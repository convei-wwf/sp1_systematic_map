(2008) focuses on assimilating data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system of satellites to improve the simulation of water storage and fluxes in the Mississippi River basin using a Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM). The authors assimilated monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies derived from GRACE for different subbasins of the Mississippi River into the CLSM using an Ensemble Kalman Smoother from January 2003 to May 2006.    The methods involve disaggregating the coarse-scale GRACE observations onto the finer-resolution model elements, accounting for different water storage components such as groundwater, soil moisture, vegetation, surface water, snow, and ice. The ensemble smoother updates the model states based on the difference between the observations and the model estimates, considering error variances and cross correlations. The assimilation process is performed iteratively at the subbasin level to improve the model simulation compared to open-loop simulations.    The results of the assimilation show enhanced skill in capturing groundwater variability, increased correlation between simulated water storage and gauged river flow, and improved simulation performance for smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin.

As Seen From Space: Tele-Epidemiological Data as Pandemic Memory,"Gleason, Louis",2022,8576,"The paper proposes the use of satellite technology and Earth Observation (EO) methods to improve the surveillance and tracking of pandemic data, notably in locations with limited access to traditional healthcare infrastructure. The methods outlined include using satellites to track viral vectors, identify mass burial sites, and predict the movement of potential disease vectors.     In particular, tele-epidemiology is highlighted as a technique that utilizes satellite data to create geographic models of viral dispersion, aiding in identifying vulnerable areas and emerging epicenters of infection. Remote sensing techniques such as ground-penetrating radar and electrical earth resistance are mentioned as effective tools for locating concealed mass grave sites.     Moreover, the paper emphasizes the importance of satellite imagery in documenting instances of mass burials, such as those in remote or under-resourced areas, which may otherwise go unnoticed or unrecorded. Analysis of such data from mass graves can provide more accurate and inclusive records of the impact of pandemics, correcting historical amnesia and ensuring a more just historical narrative.

Assessing the Economic Value of Early Warning Systems,"Klafft, Michael and Meissen, Ulrich",2011,7257,"The paper by Klafft et al. proposes an economic assessment model for early warning systems, focusing on the societal benefits and tangible economic impacts. The authors highlight that investments in early warning systems are often driven by disasters, leading to inconsistent funding patterns and suboptimal decision-making. The model integrates socio-cultural factors to support policymakers and investors in making informed decisions regarding early warning applications.    The authors discuss two main methods for assessing the value of Earth Observation/Early Warning Systems: contingent valuation and cost avoidance calculations. Contingent valuation gauges the value of a system based on user willingness to pay, while cost avoidance calculations estimate the damage prevented by having a warning system in place. The paper emphasizes the challenges and biases associated with contingent valuation and recommends the cost avoidance approach for assessing early warning systems.    The paper outlines factors influencing the effectiveness of early warning systems, categorizing them into personal and cultural factors, prediction-related factors, and dissemination-related factors. These factors impact how recipients perceive and respond to warnings, the accuracy of disaster predictions, and the dissemination and reception of warning messages.    Finally, the paper introduces a mathematical model for assessing the economic value of early warning systems, incorporating variables related to disaster types, response actions, prediction accuracy, dissemination channels, and system costs. The model calculates the benefits of additional protective actions initiated by the system and compares them to the costs of operating the system.

Value of Information for Climate Observing Systems,"Cooke, Roger and Wielicki, Bruce A. and Young, David F. and Mlynczak, Martin G.",2014,11592,"The paper discusses the value of information provided by improved climate observing systems, specifically comparing the benefits of an advanced observing system (referred to as ""Clarreo"") relative to existing satellite observations (referred to as ""I/A/C""). The methods involve calculating the societal benefits of the improved observing system by estimating the reduction in damages due to climate change that could be achieved by switching to a reduced emissions path based on earlier and more accurate information on key climate parameters.    The analysis is based on a decision context in which society switches from a business-as-usual emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable (such as the decadal rate of global temperature rise) exceeds a critical value. The societal benefits are quantified as the difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems.    The study uses the DICE integrated assessment model to compute the social cost of carbon and assess the economic impacts of climate change. Various scenarios are considered, including different discount rates, trigger values, launch dates for the advanced observing system, and confidence levels for triggering the switch to a reduced emissions path. The results show the potential societal benefits of investing in an improved climate observing system like Clarreo.    Overall, the methods involve modeling the link between improved climate observations, decision-making based on trigger variables, and the resulting reductions in climate damages.

The study considers the reduction in burned areas and the total patrolling area as key metrics to evaluate the benefits of using better weather observations. Additionally, the paper explores the sensitivity of the model to the quality of input data, such as grid resolution, number of weather stations, and the design of the observation system.    Overall, the methodology involves developing a model that simulates forest fires based on weather data and air patrolling rules, and then assessing the benefits of improved weather observations in reducing burned areas and enhancing fire management efficiency. The results suggest that integrating precise yet expensive weather observations with broader, cheaper data can optimize the overall performance and cost-effectiveness of forest fire management systems.",NA,1,Include,NA,VOI/Bayesian based on reduction in burned areas based on either coarse or fine resolution weather data.

Value of Improved Long-Range Weather Information,"Adams, Richard M. and Bryant, Kelly J. and Mccarl, Bruce A. and Legler, David M. and O'Brien, James and Solow, Andrew and Weiher, Rodney",1995,8140,"The paper titled ""Value of Improved Long-Range Weather Information"" by Richard M. Adams and colleagues focuses on estimating the societal benefits of enhanced forecasts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for the agricultural sector in the Southeastern United States. The study employs an interdisciplinary methodology that integrates meteorological, agronomic, and economic data and models, specifically using a value of information framework based on Bayesian decision theory.    ### Summary of Methods:    1. **Interdisciplinary Framework**:     - The assessment combines insights from meteorology, plant sciences, and economics to evaluate the economic implications of improved ENSO forecasts. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of how weather variations impact agricultural production and economic welfare.    2. **Bayesian Decision Theory**:     - The study employs Bayesian decision theory to measure the value of an ENSO forecast. This involves updating probabilities based on new information (the forecast) and assessing how this affects decision-making for farmers regarding crop choices under different weather conditions.    3. **Economic Modeling**:     - An economic model of the U.S. agricultural sector is developed, which translates physical yield effects from meteorological data into economic impacts on producers and consumers. This model considers the changes in yields during different ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña, and normal conditions) to assess the economic consequences of these variations.    4. **Yield Estimation**:     - The impact of meteorological conditions (temperature and precipitation) under different ENSO phases is estimated using crop biophysical simulation models. The study focuses on major crops such as cotton, corn, sorghum, and soybeans, simulating their yields across different conditions.    5. **Data Collection**:     - Historical climate data from multiple meteorological stations across the Southeastern U.S. (1948-1987) are analyzed to estimate seasonal temperature and precipitation conditions under various ENSO phases. This data helps identify significant meteorological differences that influence crop yields.    6. **Decision-Making Model**:     - The economic value of both perfect and imperfect forecasts is calculated by assessing how these forecasts change farmers’ decision-making processes regarding planting and harvesting strategies. The model simulates expected profits under both perfect information scenarios and scenarios with imperfect forecasts.    7. **Value Estimation**:     - The value of perfect information is estimated at approximately $245 million annually, while the value of an imperfect forecast is about $96 million. This highlights the substantial economic benefits of increasing forecast accuracy for the agricultural sector.    8. **Policy Implications**:     - The research offers insights into the cost-effectiveness of investing in improved forecasting and monitoring systems, suggesting that such investments could yield significant economic benefits for agricultural producers and consumers.    ### Conclusion:  This study presents a systematic approach to quantifying the societal benefits of improved long-range weather forecasting, specifically focusing on ENSO events.

The Benefits to Mexican Agriculture of an El Ni~no-southern Oscillation (ENSO) Early Warning System,"Adams, Richard M and Houston, Laurie L and McCarl, Bruce A and Tiscare{~n}o L, Mario and Matus G, Jaime and Weiher, Rodney F",2003,10580,"The paper titled ""The Benefits to Mexican Agriculture of an El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Early Warning System"" employs several methodologies to estimate and quantify the societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data, specifically in relation to agricultural forecasting in Mexico. Here’s a summary of the key methods used:    1. **Modeling Crop Yield Sensitivity**: The authors developed estimates of regional crop yield sensitivity for key crops using a crop biophysical simulator, specifically the Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model. This model allows for the simulation of crop responses under different ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral), taking into account local climate conditions, production practices, and soil characteristics.    2. **Economic Modeling**: A stochastic, price-endogenous, mathematical programming model was employed to represent the agronomic and economic conditions in the five-state region of Mexico. This model simulates agricultural behavior under different ENSO phases and calculates the expected economic benefits of forecasted yield changes. The model accounts for acreage allocation, crop prices, total production, and input usage.    3. **Forecast Value Assessment**: The value of the ENSO forecasts is assessed by calculating the expected increase in economic benefits due to changes in cropping patterns, which are informed by the forecasts. This is formalized within a Bayesian decision theory framework, where the expected welfare under different scenarios (with and without forecasts) is compared.    4. **Data Collection and Calibration**: The model used historical data on crop production, prices, and climatic conditions. The authors gathered data from various sources, including government agricultural statistics and local agricultural departments, to ensure the model accurately reflected current agricultural practices and conditions.    5. **Scenario Analysis**: The authors conducted scenario analyses based on different ENSO frequency assumptions and forecast accuracy levels. They estimated the economic benefits of the early warning system under various scenarios, including perfect forecasts and forecasts with 70% accuracy.    6. **Benefit-Cost Analysis**: The societal benefits of the early warning system were quantified in monetary terms, with estimates ranging from approximately $8 million to $47 million per year, depending on the forecast skill and ENSO frequency assumptions. The internal rate of return on investment for the system was calculated to be around 30%.    7. **Sensitivity Analysis**: A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the trade-offs in net present value associated with different levels of forecast skill and adoption rates by farmers.    Through these methodologies, the study effectively quantifies the potential economic benefits of improved weather forecasting related to ENSO events, emphasizing the importance of satellite and Earth Observation data in enhancing agricultural decision-making and food security.",NA,1,include,,not satellite specifically,voi,ag production,dollars,climate forecast,agriculture,x
"Contingent Valuation Study of the Benefits of Seasonal Climate Forecasts for Maize Farmers in the Republic of Benin, West Africa","Amegnaglo, Cocou Jaur{\`e}s and Anaman, Kwabena Asomanin and {Mensah-Bonsu}, Akwasi and Onumah, Edwards Ebo and Amoussouga Gero, Fulbert",2017,14763,"The paper ""A Contingent Valuation Study of the Benefits of Seasonal Climate Forecasts for Maize Farmers in the Republic of Benin, West Africa"" employs various methods to quantify the societal benefits of seasonal climate forecasts, particularly for maize farmers. Below is a summary of the key methodologies used in this study:    ### Methodology Overview    1. **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**:      - The study uses CVM to assess the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts. This method involves creating a hypothetical market where farmers express their willingness to pay (WTP) for access to improved climate information.     - Farmers were asked to indicate the maximum amount they would be willing to pay for access to seasonal climate forecasts, which reflects the perceived value of the forecasts in enhancing their agricultural productivity.    2. **Surveys and Sampling**:     - A random survey was conducted among 354 maize farmers across three climatic zones in Benin (Kandi, Glazoué, and Zè). The sampling involved multi-stage cluster sampling to ensure diverse representation.     - Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the socio-economic characteristics of farmers and their specific information needs regarding seasonal climate forecasts.    3. **Elicitation Techniques**:     - The WTP was assessed using iterative bidding techniques, where farmers were presented with a series of prices until they determined their maximum WTP amount. This method helps mitigate starting point bias commonly associated with CVM.    4. **Heckman Two-Step Selection Model**:     - This econometric model was employed to account for potential selection bias in the WTP responses. The model helps differentiate between the decision to pay for seasonal climate forecasts and the amount they are willing to pay.     - The first step involved a probit model to estimate the probability of a farmer being willing to pay, while the second step used ordinary least squares (OLS) to analyze the factors influencing the amount of WTP.    5. **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**:     - Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the types of seasonal climate information needed, optimal lead times, and dissemination channels preferred by farmers.     - Mann-Whitney U tests and mean difference tests were conducted to evaluate significant differences in WTP across different climatic zones.    6. **Economic Valuation**:     - The average annual economic value of seasonal climate forecasts was calculated by aggregating the individual WTP amounts across the surveyed farmers. The study estimated a total economic benefit of about USD 66.5 million at the national level.     - Regression analysis was also performed to identify socio-economic factors (e.g., access to extension services, mobile phone ownership, credit access) that significantly influenced the benefits derived from using seasonal climate forecasts.    7. **Practical Implications**:     - The findings suggest that integrating seasonal climate forecasts into agricultural extension services can significantly enhance farmers' productivity and income. The study highlights the importance of reliable and timely dissemination of climate information through preferred channels such as radio and local meetings.    ### Conclusion  The study effectively combines CVM, econometric modeling, and descriptive analyses to quantify the societal benefits of seasonal climate forecasts for maize farmers in Benin. The results underscore the vital role of climate information in improving agricultural practices and economic outcomes for smallholder farmers in developing regions.",context_length_exceeded,1,Include,,not satellite specifically,contingent valuation,ag production,dollars,climate forecast,agriculture,x
The Value of Weather Information in Market Equilibrium,"Babcock, Bruce A.",1990,8335,"In the paper ""The Value of Weather Information in Market Equilibrium"" by Bruce A. Babcock, the author employs a stylized economic model to explore how improved weather forecasts affect the welfare of farmers and market equilibrium. Here is a summary of the methods used to estimate or quantify the societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data, particularly weather information.    ### Methods Overview    1. **Model Framework**:     - The study utilizes a competitive production model with rational expectations. Farmers are assumed to make decisions based on forecasts of weather, which affects both the physical productivity of their inputs and market prices.     - The model includes a representative farmer who operates under a production function influenced by weather inputs, which can take on different states (good or bad weather).    2. **Value of Information Calculation**:     - The value of weather information for an individual farmer is calculated as the difference between expected returns or utility using the forecasted information and without it. This involves estimating expected profits under different weather scenarios.     - The aggregate value of weather information is defined as the sum of individual values for all farmers in the market.    3. **Rational Expectations**:     - Farmers are assumed to have rational expectations, meaning they consider how other farmers will respond to information when making their own production decisions.     - The model incorporates the aggregate actions of all farmers to determine how individual decisions affect market prices and supply.    4. **Demand Elasticity Analysis**:     - The paper distinguishes between elastic and inelastic demand scenarios. It shows that improvements in weather information can lead to different outcomes depending on the elasticity of demand for agricultural products.     - For inelastic demand, improved forecasts may lead to lower expected profits because increased supply (due to better weather forecasts) can reduce market prices without sufficiently increasing revenue.    5. **Input Use Adjustments**:     - The analysis assesses how farmers adjust their input use (e.g., fertilizers, labor) based on the accuracy of weather forecasts. The model predicts that with more accurate forecasts, farmers may reduce their input use if they expect lower average prices due to increased supply.     - The study employs calculus to differentiate the expected profit functions with respect to input use to determine the marginal value of improved weather information.    6. **Expected Supply Calculation**:     - The expected supply is derived from the production decisions made under different weather conditions and forecast accuracies. The paper mathematically analyzes how the average use of inputs changes as the accuracy of forecasts increases.     - The results show that improved weather forecasts might decrease expected supply when farmers respond to lower expected prices by reducing input use, even if overall productivity potential increases.    7. **Counterintuitive Findings**:     - The paper concludes that better weather information does not universally lead to increased welfare for farmers, particularly when demand is inelastic. Instead, it shows that farmers can be worse off as improved forecasts lead to lower market prices, offsetting any potential productivity gains.    ### Conclusion  Babcock's study provides a nuanced perspective on the societal benefits of weather information through a rigorous economic model. It highlights the importance of considering market dynamics, demand elasticity, and farmer behavior when evaluating the value of satellite and Earth Observation data in agriculture. The findings suggest that simply improving the accuracy of weather forecasts may not always result in better economic outcomes for farmers, especially in markets characterized by inelastic demand.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite specifically,equilibrium model,ag production,conceptual,climate forecast,agriculture,x
Estimating the Social Value of Geologic Map Information: A Regulatory Application,"Bernknopf, Richard L. and Brookshire, David S. and McKee, Michael and Soller, David R.",1997,8164,"The paper ""Estimating the Social Value of Geologic Map Information: A Regulatory Application"" by Bernknopf et al. employs a structured approach to quantify the societal benefits derived from improved geologic map information, particularly in the context of regulatory land use decision-making. Below is a summary of the methods used in the study:    ### Key Methods    1. **Economic Decision Framework**:     - The authors develop a model that incorporates the objectives of regulators and utilizes geologic map information to evaluate land-use decisions.     - The model assesses whether investments in additional geologic map information are socially justified by comparing the economic impacts of decisions made with new versus existing data.    2. **Risk Assessment**:     - The analysis incorporates the concept of risk associated with land use, where the regulatory standard (acceptable risk) is defined based on geologic characteristics.     - The probability of violating the regulatory standard is modeled, with regulators aiming to minimize this probability using improved geologic information.    3. **Public Choice Model**:     - The regulatory behavior is modeled as that of a risk-averse agent who maximizes utility, balancing monetary payoffs against risk reduction.     - The regulators’ decisions are influenced by the uncertainty associated with geologic attributes, which are described using probability distributions.    4. **Geographic Information System (GIS)**:     - A GIS is used to incorporate both geologic and economic data to analyze the impact of improved geologic map information on regulatory decisions at two different scales.     - The GIS facilitates the integration of detailed geologic data into the decision-making framework.    5. **Comparison of Geologic Data**:     - The study compares the existing geologic map (1:500,000 scale from 1963) to an improved geologic map (1:100,000 scale from 1992). The latter provides more detailed and accurate geologic information.     - The benefits of the improved map are quantified by evaluating the changes in regulatory outcomes (e.g., siting decisions for waste disposal facilities).    6. **Loss Avoidance Calculation**:     - The benefits of improved geologic information are assessed by calculating the expected losses avoided due to better regulatory decisions. This involves estimating the potential losses from environmental hazards (e.g., groundwater contamination) based on geologic attributes.     - The expected loss avoided is calculated as the product of the probability of a loss occurring and the monetary value of that loss.    7. **Demonstration Study**:     - The paper presents a case study in Loudoun County, Virginia, where the improved geologic map information is applied to site a waste disposal facility.     - The analysis shows that using improved geologic information leads to more informed regulatory decisions, resulting in significant societal benefits in terms of avoided losses from potential contamination.    8. **Net Benefit Calculation**:     - The net social benefits of the improved geologic map are derived by subtracting the costs of producing the new map from the estimated societal value of the avoided losses.     - The study concludes with a quantification of net benefits, providing evidence for the economic value of accurate geologic information in regulatory applications.    ### Conclusion  Overall, the paper effectively illustrates how improved geologic map information can enhance regulatory decision-making, reduce environmental risks, and yield substantial societal benefits. The methods employed, including economic modeling, risk assessment, GIS analysis, and empirical demonstration, provide a robust framework for evaluating the value of geologic information in public policy contexts.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite,voi,reduced loss and harm from land use decisions based on reduced uncertainty,various,usgs geologic maps,various,x

Assessing the Usability and Potential Value of Seasonal Climate Forecasts in Land Management Decisions in the Southwest UK: Challenges and Reflections,"Bruno Soares, Marta",2017,5743,"The paper by Marta Bruno Soares, presented at the 16th EMS Annual Meeting and 11th European Conference on Applied Climatology, assesses the usability and potential value of Seasonal Climate Forecasts (SCF) for supporting land management decisions in Southwest UK. The study focuses on a semi-operational climate service prototype called the Land Management Tool (LMTool), developed in collaboration with local farmers.    ### Key Methods Used to Assess Usability and Value of SCF:    1. **Co-development Approach**: The LMTool was developed through a participatory approach involving farmers. This included continuous feedback from farmers to tailor the tool to their needs, ensuring relevance and usability.    2. **Workshops**: A workshop was conducted where farmers identified critical decisions related to their farming practices for the upcoming months. This helped in understanding the context in which SCF could be applied.    3. **Decision Calendars**: Farmers were encouraged to create decision calendars during the workshop. These calendars helped outline the timing of key decisions, the weather conditions affecting those decisions, and other influencing factors such as labor and financial resources.    4. **Follow-up Interviews**: After the winter season, follow-up interviews with selected farmers were conducted to reflect on their experiences with the SCF and their decision-making processes. This qualitative method provided insights into how forecasts influenced their decisions and the perceived value of the information.    5. **Qualitative Analysis**: The study employed a qualitative analysis to capture the farmers' experiences and perceptions regarding the usefulness of SCF. This included assessing how SCF impacted their decision-making regarding activities such as crop spraying and land management.    6. **Identifying Challenges**: The research identified several challenges in using SCF, including the complexity of farm decisions, farmers’ trust in probabilistic forecasts, and the need for longer-term SCF availability to build confidence among users.    ### Findings on Societal Benefits:  - Farmers who utilized SCF reported that it helped them adapt their decision-making and avoid unnecessary costs. However, the quantification of these benefits in economic terms proved challenging.  - The study underscores the importance of developing methods that can effectively capture the complex decision-making processes in agriculture and the associated benefits of using SCF.    ### Conclusion:  The paper emphasizes the need for ongoing evaluations and the development of new research methods to better assess the usability and societal benefits of SCF in agricultural decision-making.

Assessing the Value of Seasonal Climate Forecasts for Decision-making,"Bruno Soares, Marta and Daly, Meaghan and Dessai, Suraje",2018,24509,"The paper titled ""Assessing the Value of Seasonal Climate Forecasts for Decision-Making"" by Marta Bruno Soares, Meaghan Daly, and Suraje Dessai explores the methods used to estimate the societal benefits of seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) in decision-making contexts. The authors review various economic and social research methodologies aimed at quantifying the value of SCFs. Here is a summary of the key methods discussed in the paper:    1. **Decision Theory-Based Models**: These models assess how agents make decisions to maximize objectives based on potential payoffs from using SCFs compared to climatological information. The value of SCFs is defined as the difference in expected outcomes when decisions are made with versus without SCFs. This approach often combines with management or production models to optimize decisions under different climate scenarios.    2. **General Equilibrium Models (GEM)**: GEMs consider the interconnectedness of decision-makers, reflecting how SCF use by one sector (e.g., agriculture) can influence others (e.g., prices in markets). While these models are complex and not frequently used for SCF valuation, they can inform partial equilibrium models that assess the economic effects of SCFs within a specific sector.    3. **Contingent Valuation (CV)**: A survey-based method that estimates the monetary benefits of non-marketed goods and services, CV assesses how much individuals are willing to pay (WTP) for SCFs or to receive compensation for their loss. This method has been applied to understand WTP among farmers for SCFs in various studies.    4. **Benefit Transfer**: This method uses existing economic values from one context (the ""study"" site) and applies them to a different context (the ""policy"" site). It is often employed due to its resource efficiency but faces challenges related to transferability and reliability.    5. **Qualitative and Participatory Studies**: These approaches emphasize the involvement of users in the evaluation process. They gather insights through interviews and focus groups to understand how SCFs are perceived and used in decision-making. They can capture non-economic benefits and the contextual factors affecting SCF value, although they may lack the quantitative rigor of other methods.    6. **Ex Ante and Ex Post Valuations**: The paper distinguishes between ex ante valuations (based on expected responses) and ex post valuations (based on observed responses). Ex ante studies are more common, but ex post studies can provide a clearer picture of the actual value derived from SCFs.    Overall, the authors stress the importance of integrating diverse methodological approaches to capture the full spectrum of benefits associated with SCFs. They advocate for co-evaluation with decision-makers to ensure that the valuation process reflects real-world complexities and user needs.",NA,1,Exclude,review,"good examination of the term ""value"" in context of seasonal climate forecasts though",,,,,,x
The Value of Climate Information When Farm Programs Matter,"Cabrera, Victor E. and Letson, David and Podest{\'a}, Guillermo",2007,10023,"The paper ""The Value of Climate Information When Farm Programs Matter"" by Cabrera et al. (2007) employs a comprehensive methodology to estimate the societal benefits of climate information, specifically focusing on the value of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-based climate forecasts for agricultural decision-making in a representative farm in North Florida. Below is a summary of the key methods used in the paper to estimate the societal benefits of Earth Observation data related to climate forecasts.    ### 1. **Study Design and Case Selection**  - The study centers on a representative 130 ha rainfed farm in Jackson County, Florida, growing peanuts, cotton, and maize. This specific case was selected due to its relevance to other major agricultural regions in the Southeastern U.S.    ### 2. **Climate Data and Yield Simulation**  - Historical climate data (1939-2003) were used, focusing on daily weather records to characterize rainfall and temperature variations associated with different ENSO phases.  - Crop yield simulations were conducted using biophysical crop models integrated into the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). Yield predictions were adjusted to reflect locally reported averages.  - A stochastic yield generator was developed to produce synthetic crop yield distributions based on the simulation results, allowing for a more extensive analysis of yield variability.    ### 3. **Economic Component**  - **Price Simulation**: A stochastic multivariate distribution of crop prices was generated to reflect historical price variability. This involved collecting monthly average prices and applying statistical techniques (e.g., principal component analysis) to ensure the synthetic prices maintained the correlation structure of historical data.  - **Production Costs**: Variable and fixed production costs for each crop were incorporated based on local agricultural budgets.    ### 4. **Whole Farm Model**  - A stochastic non-linear whole farm model was developed to simulate farm decision-making under uncertainty, factoring in climate forecasts and federal farm programs (Commodity Loan Programs and Crop Insurance Programs).  - The model aimed to identify optimal crop selection and planting dates while maximizing expected utility based on different levels of risk aversion.    ### 5. **Expected Value of Information (EVOI) Calculation**  - The value of climate forecasts (EVOI) was estimated by comparing simulated net margins with and without the use of ENSO forecast information. This calculation was repeated across various risk aversion levels to understand how farmers’ risk preferences affected the value they derived from the forecasts.    ### 6. **Sensitivity Analysis**  - The impact of federal farm programs on the value of climate forecasts was analyzed. The authors assessed how these programs might enhance or limit the effectiveness of forecast information, revealing that the overall value of climate information decreased when such programs were in place, particularly for risk-averse farmers.    ### 7. **Results Interpretation**  - The analysis highlighted that the value of climate information is highly dependent on the risk aversion level of the farmer and the presence of government programs.

Agricultural Value of ENSO Information under Alternative Phase Definition,"Chen, Chi-Chung and McCarl, Bruce and Hill, Harvey",2002,8457,"The paper ""Value of ENSO Information to Agriculture Under Alternative ENSO Phase Definitions"" by Chi-Chung Chen et al. investigates the impact of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on agricultural productivity and welfare by comparing the value of forecasts derived from two different definitions of ENSO phases: a three-phase model and a five-phase model. The methods employed to estimate societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data regarding agricultural responses to ENSO information are as follows:    ### Data Collection and Preparation  1. **Historical Data Gathering**: The authors collected crop yield data from 1972 to 1993 for 63 U.S. regions across 13 crops and total crop production data for 28 world regions. This comprehensive dataset was sourced from USDA agricultural statistics.      2. **Regression Analysis**: A regression-based approach was employed to remove systematic trends from the data. Independent variables included acreage, lagged yields, and time, allowing for the construction of a multivariate unconditional probability distribution of yields, which represents the crop yields across all crops and regions regardless of ENSO state.    3. **ENSO Phase Grouping**: The researchers constructed a conditional probability distribution of yields based on the ENSO phase definitions. They grouped yield data according to either the three-phase or five-phase definitions, which enabled them to analyze the effects of knowing an impending ENSO event on agricultural outcomes.    ### Modeling Framework  4. **Stochastic Agricultural Model**: The authors utilized a stochastic multi-commodity, multi-country agricultural model, termed ""GlobalASM,"" which simulates agricultural production across 63 U.S. regions and 28 world regions. This model incorporates varying weather states and allows for the assessment of how different ENSO phase definitions affect agricultural welfare.    5. **Decision Tree Approach**: The model employed a decision tree to represent different climate events and phases. It simulated adjustments in crop mix, storage, and consumption decisions based on the knowledge of which ENSO phase was occurring, and allowed for the exploration of potential welfare gains from improved information.    ### Simulation Scenarios  6. **Scenario Simulation**: The researchers conducted several scenarios to estimate the agricultural value of ENSO information:     - A baseline scenario without any ENSO phase information.     - A scenario using the three-phase definition.     - A scenario utilizing the five-phase definition.     - A “perfect foresight” scenario where decisions are made based on the exact nature of all past ENSO events.    7. **Welfare Measurement**: The outcomes included measuring total welfare gains, consumer surplus, producer surplus, and foreign surplus under each scenario. The differences in these welfare measures across scenarios provided insights into the value of improved ENSO forecasts.    ### Results Analysis  8. **Welfare Impacts**: The results indicated a substantial increase in welfare from the use of five-phase forecasts compared to three-phase forecasts, nearly doubling the estimated benefits. The findings highlighted the potential for further improvements if additional refinements to forecast methodologies were made.    9. **Sensitivity Analysis**: The variability of welfare measures was also assessed, showing that more refined phase definitions led to reduced variability in welfare outcomes for both U.S. consumers and producers.    ### Conclusion  The study concluded that enhanced ENSO phase information significantly benefits agricultural decision-making, allowing for better adaptation to climatic variations, ultimately leading to improved agricultural sector welfare. The methods used effectively quantified the societal benefits of satellite-based climate forecasts by demonstrating their direct application in agricultural yield predictions and resource management.    This comprehensive methodological framework showcases the effective use of historical data, statistical analysis, and simulation modeling to estimate the societal benefits derived from improved climate information in agriculture.",NA,1,Include,,"improved enso information, i.e., five phase vs three phase - not specifically satellite",stochastic model and voi,ag production,dollars,climate forecast,agriculture,x
The Value of El Nino Forecasts in the Management of Salmon: A Stochastic Dynamic Assessment,"Costello, Christopher J. and Adams, Richard M. and Polasky, Stephen",1998,12367,"The paper by Costello, Adams, and Polasky focuses on estimating the societal benefits of improved El Niño forecasts within the context of the management of the Pacific Northwest coho salmon fishery. The authors employ a bioeconomic model that integrates biological, climatological, and economic data to assess the value of improved forecasting for decision-making in fisheries management.    ### Key Methods Used:    1. **Bioeconomic Modeling**:     - The authors develop a stochastic dynamic model that combines biological dynamics (like fish growth and survival) with economic decision-making under uncertainty. This model captures the interaction between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases and salmon populations, allowing for the assessment of management strategies in response to climate variability.    2. **Value of Information (VoI)**:     - The VoI is calculated through a Bayesian framework that updates prior probabilities of different ENSO phases based on forecast accuracy. The expected net present value (NPV) of management outcomes is compared under different information scenarios (no forecast, imperfect forecast, and perfect forecasts) to determine the benefits derived from improved forecasting.    3. **Forecast Scenarios**:     - Several forecasting models are analyzed:       - **Naive Model**: Assumes no knowledge of ENSO conditions.       - **Certainty Equivalence Model**: Manages based on expected average conditions.       - **Hedge Model**: Incorporates some level of uncertainty in forecasts.       - **Improved Forecasts**: Examines the impact of various accuracy levels of one-year and multi-year forecasts.    4. **Dynamic Programming**:     - The authors employ dynamic programming techniques to solve for optimal management strategies over time, given the uncertainty in future ocean conditions and their impact on salmon survival and reproduction.    5. **Welfare Analysis**:     - The analysis includes multiple components of welfare, such as:       - **Consumer Surplus**: Derived from recreational fishing and the existence value of maintaining wild salmon populations.       - **Producer Quasi-Rents**: Associated with commercial fishing activities.       - **Passive-Use Values**: The value non-users place on the existence of healthy salmon populations.     - The results quantify how these welfare components shift under different management strategies influenced by forecasting accuracy.    6. **Statistical Analysis**:     - The study integrates empirical data and statistical analysis to estimate biological parameters, such as survival rates and recruitment functions, which are affected by ENSO conditions.    ### Summary of Findings:  - The paper finds that perfect El Niño forecasts could yield significant welfare gains (estimated at approximately $1 million annually), while imperfect forecasts still provide some benefits, albeit lesser.  - The optimal management strategy under uncertainty favors conservative approaches, resulting in lower harvest rates and higher wild fish escapement compared to management without consideration of ENSO forecasts.  - The analysis indicates that improving short-term forecast accuracy is more beneficial than merely extending the forecast horizon, highlighting the importance of timely and accurate climate information in fisheries management.    This comprehensive approach provides insights into the economic value of climate data and its implications for sustainable fishery management, emphasizing the need for continued investment in forecasting capabilities.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite specifically,bioeconomic model;voi,fishery production; sustainability,dollars,climate forecast,fisheries,x
Spatio-Temporal Design for a Water Quality Monitoring Network Maximizing the Economic Value of Information to Optimize the Detection of Accidental Pollution,"Destandau, Fran{\c c}ois and Zaiter, Youssef",2020,8713,"The paper titled ""Spatio-temporal design for a water quality monitoring network maximizing the economic value of information to optimize the detection of accidental pollution"" by Destandau and Zaiter presents a novel methodology for optimizing water quality monitoring networks (WQMNs) by estimating the Economic Value of Information (EVOI) derived from such networks. Here’s a summary of the key methods used to estimate or quantify societal benefits from satellite or Earth Observation data in the context of water quality monitoring:    1. **Economic Value of Information (EVOI):**      - The authors utilize the concept of EVOI, which is calculated based on Bayesian decision theory. This approach allows decision-makers to update their beliefs about the state of nature (e.g., water quality) based on new information acquired through monitoring.     - EVOI is defined as the difference between the expected utility of decisions made with new information versus those made without it. This quantifies the value that additional monitoring data can provide in terms of improved decision-making.    2. **Bayesian Framework:**     - The Bayesian method is central to the analysis, allowing for the integration of prior beliefs (initial probabilities about water quality states) with new data from monitoring stations. This iterative updating process helps refine the understanding of water quality conditions over time.    3. **Spatio-temporal Network Design:**     - The study focuses on optimizing both the spatial locations and the temporal frequency of monitoring stations. This dual optimization is crucial for maximizing the EVOI, as it highlights the trade-offs between the number of stations, their locations, and the frequency of measurements.     - Two scenarios are explored: one where damage from pollution is uniform across the river and another where damage decreases downstream. The optimization of monitoring stations is tailored to these specific damage scenarios.    4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**     - The methodology incorporates a cost-benefit analysis framework, allowing for the assessment of whether the costs associated with the monitoring network are justified by the benefits it generates in terms of reduced environmental damage.     - The net benefit is calculated as the difference between the EVOI and the costs of establishing and operating the monitoring stations.    5. **Optimization under Budget Constraints:**     - The paper presents a method to determine the optimal combination of monitoring stations and detection probabilities within the constraints of a fixed budget. This involves the use of iso-cost curves (representing combinations of costs) and indifference curves (representing combinations of benefits) to identify the most efficient design for the network.    6. **Simulation and Parameter Estimation:**     - The authors run simulations using chosen parameters to illustrate the relationships between the number of monitoring stations, detection probabilities, and the resulting EVOI. This empirical approach aids in visualizing how changes in design parameters impact the overall effectiveness of the monitoring network.    7. **Societal Benefits:**     - By quantifying the benefits derived from improved detection of accidental pollution through enhanced monitoring, the study provides a framework for policymakers and resource managers to justify investments in monitoring infrastructure. This includes assessing the societal impacts of preventing pollution events through timely detection and response.    Overall, the paper integrates economic analysis with environmental monitoring to demonstrate how strategically designed WQMNs can yield significant societal benefits, particularly in the context of managing water quality and preventing pollution. The methodologies developed can inform future research and practical applications in environmental management and policy-making.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite,voi,reduction of damage due to water pollution,,water quality monitoring network,water resources,x
Willingness to Pay for Soil Information Derived by Digital Maps: A Choice Experiment Approach,"Diafas, Iason and Panagos, Panos and Montanarella, Luca",2013,8765,"The paper ""Willingness to Pay for Soil Information Derived by Digital Maps: A Choice Experiment Approach"" by Iason Diafas, Panos Panagos, and Luca Montanarella (2013) employs a choice experiment (CE) methodology to estimate the economic value of soil information obtained from new digital mapping technologies. Here’s a summary of the methods used, especially focusing on how societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data are quantified.    ### 1. Choice Experiment Methodology:  The authors utilize a choice experiment, a stated preference method, to derive the willingness to pay (WTP) for various attributes of digital soil maps. This approach allows respondents to express their preferences for different features of the maps by presenting them with hypothetical scenarios (choice sets).    - **Design of Choice Sets**: The choice sets included various attributes related to soil information, such as:    - Spatial resolution (low, medium, high)    - Measurement accuracy for different soil properties (e.g., carbon content, water content)    - Inclusion of map interpretation    - Price per hectare    Each choice set presented respondents with two alternatives and an opt-out option, encouraging them to make trade-offs between the features and price.    ### 2. Survey Administration:  The survey was administered online to a sample of approximately 1,085 potential users from diverse backgrounds, including academia, government, and private sectors. The respondents were specifically targeted to ensure they had a genuine interest in soil maps, which was crucial for obtaining accurate WTP estimates.    ### 3. Econometric Modeling:  The WTP values were estimated using a Random Parameter Logit (RPL) model, which allows for the capture of preference heterogeneity across respondents—an essential aspect since different users may value attributes differently.    - **Utility Function**: The utility for each alternative was modeled as a function of its attributes and respondent characteristics. The model incorporated both deterministic and stochastic elements to account for observable and unobservable influences on choices.    - **WTP Calculation**: WTP for specific attributes was derived from the estimated coefficients of the utility function. The implicit price of each attribute was calculated, allowing for the estimation of the overall WTP for complete alternative versions of the mapping tool.    ### 4. Results and Interpretation:  The results indicated significant WTP for high-resolution and high-accuracy maps, particularly for the inclusion of map interpretation. The study found that the average WTP for a high-quality soil map could be as high as €447 per hectare, reflecting the perceived societal benefits of using enhanced soil information for agricultural and environmental purposes.    ### 5. Implications for Societal Benefits:  The choice experiment approach provides valuable insights into how users value different features of soil information derived from satellite or Earth Observation data. By translating user preferences into monetary terms, the study highlights the economic benefits associated with improved soil mapping technologies, which can inform policy decisions and investments in environmental management.    In summary, the paper utilizes a choice experiment to quantify the economic value of soil information derived from digital maps, effectively demonstrating the societal benefits of enhanced soil data through WTP estimations. This method not only provides direct insights into user preferences but also serves as a model for valuing similar environmental information derived from Earth Observation technologies.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite,choice experiment,ag production,dollars,digital soil map,agriculture,x

Simulating the Value of El Nino Forecasts for the Panama Canal,"Graham, Nicholas E. and Georgakakos, Konstantine P. and Vargas, Carlos and Echevers, Modesto",2006,12533,"The paper ""Simulating the Value of El Niño Forecasts for the Panama Canal"" by Graham et al. (2006) employs a combination of simulation, optimization, and assessment methods to estimate the societal benefits of seasonal climate forecasts, specifically focusing on the effects of El Niño on the Panama Canal's operations. The key methods outlined in the paper are summarized as follows:    ### 1. **Forecasting Inflows:**     - The study leverages the strong correlation between tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) and precipitation in Panama, which affects inflows into Gatun Lake, the primary water source for the canal.      - Three types of inflow forecasts are utilized:       - **Perfect forecasts (Perf):** Assumes exact inflow values with minimal uncertainty.       - **Climatological forecasts (Clim):** Uses long-term monthly mean inflows without accounting for variability.       - **Operational forecasts (Fcst):** Based on SST predictions and historical relationships, providing a probabilistic distribution of expected inflows.    ### 2. **Simulation Model:**     - A ""virtual"" canal system is created to simulate operations, incorporating the physical characteristics of the canal and Gatun Lake, including storage capacity, inflow variability, and operational constraints (e.g., lockage and hydropower generation).     - The model accounts for monthly inflow forecasts and simulates the management of water releases for lockage and hydropower generation, adjusting for spillage and evaporation losses.    ### 3. **Optimization Procedures:**     - The optimization algorithm seeks to determine the best release policy that maximizes total income from both lockage and hydropower generation, while adhering to operational constraints.     - It uses a simplex method to minimize an objective function that reflects the expected income through the forecast horizon, taking into account forecast uncertainty.    ### 4. **Assessment of Economic Value:**     - The simulation framework allows for the assessment of different forecast scenarios over historical periods (1981-1998) to evaluate the potential economic benefits of using SST forecasts.     - The results indicate that using operational forecasts can yield significant additional income ($20 million annually) compared to relying solely on climatological forecasts, particularly under conditions of reduced inflows during El Niño events.    ### 5. **Importance of Forecast Uncertainty:**     - The paper emphasizes the critical role of accurately characterizing forecast uncertainty in developing economically beneficial policies. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of forecasts depends on the balance between forecast accuracy and the inherent variability of inflows.    ### Conclusion:  The methods employed in this study effectively quantify the societal benefits of utilizing SST forecasts for the management of the Panama Canal, demonstrating how improved forecasting can enhance operational efficiency and economic outcomes.

The Value of Harmful Algal Bloom Predictions to the Nearshore Commercial Shellfish Fishery in the Gulf of Maine,"Jin, Di and Hoagland, Porter",2008,10676,"The paper titled ""The Value of Harmful Algal Bloom Predictions to the Nearshore Commercial Shellfish Fishery in the Gulf of Maine"" by Di Jin and Porter Hoagland employs a multi-step framework to estimate the societal benefits of predictions related to harmful algal blooms (HABs) and their economic implications for the shellfish fishery. Below is a summary of the methods used:    ### Framework Development  1. **Economic Impact Assessment**: The authors first assess the direct economic impacts of HAB events (specifically, the 2005 bloom) on the nearshore commercial shellfish fisheries in Maine and Massachusetts. This involves comparing the economic value of shellfish landings during HAB years against baseline years without HABs.    2. **Value of Information Model**: The study applies a well-established economic model to evaluate the value of information from HAB predictions. This model calculates the expected economic benefit of utilizing predictions in decision-making compared to situations where predictions are not available.    ### Steps for Estimating Value of HAB Predictions  1. **Impact Measurement**: The first step involves quantifying direct economic impacts (e.g., revenue losses) from HAB events. The authors measure these impacts by analyzing historical data on shellfish landings and revenues during HAB and non-HAB years.    2. **Prediction Characterization**: The second step focuses on describing the accuracy of the HAB predictions. The authors examine different scenarios based on the frequency of HAB events and the accuracy of forecasts (100%, 90%, and 80%).    3. **Decision-Making Analysis**: The third step evaluates how predictions influence the decision-making of both private (fishermen) and public (shellfish managers) entities. This includes identifying various response strategies, such as adjusting harvest schedules or modifying area closures based on predictions.    4. **Quantifying Benefits**: The final step aggregates the economic value derived from the predictions by estimating the potential economic benefits from reduced closures and increased harvests. This is done through simulations that assess different response scenarios and their impacts on landings.    ### Model Specification  - The model uses a Bayesian framework to update the probabilities of HAB occurrence based on the predictions. The authors define two states of nature (HAB event occurs or does not occur) and two actions (adjusted harvest schedule or normal harvest schedule).  - The expected utility of each decision is calculated, taking into account the likelihood of predictions being accurate.    ### Results Interpretation  - The authors calculate the net present value (NPV) of the forecasting system over a specified period (30 years) under various scenarios, reflecting how the value changes with different frequencies of HAB events and prediction accuracy.  - The results indicate that the societal benefits of HAB predictions are sensitive to factors such as the frequency of HABs, the accuracy of predictions, and the effectiveness of responses by fishermen and managers.    ### Limitations Acknowledged  - The study recognizes that its model may not capture the full social value of HAB predictions, as it focuses primarily on the nearshore shellfish fishery and certain private responses.   - Additional benefits to other fisheries and sectors, as well as other potential responses, are not included in the initial analysis.    ### Conclusion  The paper concludes that developing a robust prediction and tracking system for HABs can lead to significant economic benefits for the shellfish industry by minimizing losses and optimizing harvest strategies, thereby justifying public and private investments in monitoring and forecasting technologies.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite specifically,voi,shellfish production,dollars,harmful algal bloom predictions,fisheries,x

This model accounts for various storm conditions and the decisions made by ship operators based on the information available to them.    2. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**     - The storm exposure is analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations, which involve generating random storm conditions and simulating the responses of vessels based on different information scenarios (e.g., blind, nowcast, and forecast scenarios).    3. **Information Scenarios:**     - The paper examines multiple information scenarios, including:       - **Blind:** No information about storm conditions.       - **Historical:** Ships rely on historical storm data to inform routing decisions.       - **Nowcast:** Ships receive observed storm conditions at regular intervals.       - **Forecasts:** Ships use forecasts, which vary in accuracy and completeness.     - Each scenario is assessed for its effectiveness in reducing storm exposure and associated costs.    4. **Economic Valuation:**     - The authors estimate the expected annual economic losses due to storm exposure for container and bulk shipping. They quantify potential savings by comparing the costs of storm exposure with the benefits derived from improved wind data.     - The analysis includes estimating the number of containers lost, the financial implications of these losses, and the cost of delays and damage due to storms.    5. **Benefit-Cost Analysis:**     - The study conducts a benefit-cost analysis to evaluate the net economic benefits of using satellite-based wind observations. This analysis takes into account both the savings from avoided losses and the potential increase in operating costs due to longer ship routes when avoiding storms.    6. **Sensitivity Analysis:**     - The impact of different levels of information quality (e.g., accuracy and timeliness of forecasts) on the overall benefits to the shipping industry is explored. This helps in understanding how improvements in satellite technology and forecasting can enhance maritime safety and efficiency.    7. **Comparative Analysis:**     - The results from different information scenarios are compared to illustrate the incremental value added by higher quality wind information and to highlight the diminishing returns of additional accuracy.    ### Conclusion:  The paper concludes that high-quality ocean surface wind information significantly reduces the economic risks associated with storm exposure for maritime shipping. The estimated benefits are substantial, indicating that improved satellite observations can lead to considerable savings for the maritime sector, thus underscoring the value of investing in advanced Earth Observation systems.",NA,1,Include,,Hypothetical satellite,voi,avoided exposure of shipping to storms,dollars,hypothetical,shipping,x

For example, analyzing how individuals respond to evacuation orders during hurricane threats can provide insights into the economic value of forecasts based on actual observed decisions.     - **SP Methods**: These survey-based approaches ask individuals to express their WTP for improved forecasts in hypothetical scenarios, allowing researchers to capture non-market values associated with the forecasts, such as reduced risk of injury or loss of life.    ### 4. **Cost-of-Evacuation Approach**     - This approach estimates the economic value of hurricane forecasts by analyzing the costs incurred during evacuations. It quantifies the savings from reduced unnecessary evacuations and mitigated damages, providing a tangible measure of the forecast's value to individuals and society.    ### 5. **Bayesian Decision Framework**     - The authors suggest employing a Bayesian approach to capture the temporal dynamics of hurricane forecasting. This method involves updating users' prior beliefs about hurricane probabilities based on new forecast information, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the value of forecasts over time.    ### 6. **Dynamic Modeling**     - The paper indicates the use of dynamic models to simulate evacuation decision processes as an optimal stopping problem, where individuals decide when to evacuate based on updated forecasts and changing conditions.    ### 7. **Cost-Loss Models**     - Cost-loss models can be employed to assess the economic impact of improved forecasts by estimating the avoided costs associated with potential hurricane damages, thereby quantifying the value of forecast improvements.    ### 8. **Comprehensive Understanding Across Stakeholders**     - The authors advocate for a comprehensive understanding of the economic value of hurricane forecasts across different stakeholders, incorporating various time scales and types of decisions (adaptation, mitigation, response). This would involve a multidisciplinary approach integrating insights from economics, meteorology, and social sciences.    ### 9. **Future Research Directions**     - The paper calls for further research into the communication and comprehension of forecasts, the behavioral responses of individuals to forecast information, and the societal implications of improved forecasting capabilities.    In conclusion, the paper uses a variety of economic methods to assess the value of hurricane forecasts, focusing on both individual and societal benefits while emphasizing the importance of integrating these approaches to inform policy and improve forecast systems.",NA,1,Exclude,review,,,,,,,x
Value of Perfect ENSO Phase Predictions for Agriculture: Evaluating the Impact of Land Tenure and Decision Objectives,"Letson, David and Laciana, Carlos E. and Bert, Federico E. and Weber, Elke U. and Katz, Richard W. and Gonzalez, Xavier I. and Podest{\'a}, Guillermo P.",2009,15628,"The paper by Letson et al. (2009) explores the expected value of seasonal climate information, specifically focusing on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and its implications for agricultural decision-making. The authors utilize a simulation-based approach to quantify the societal benefits of climate forecasts, emphasizing how these benefits vary depending on land tenure and decision-making objectives.    ### Key Methods Employed:    1. **Simulation Framework**:      - The authors simulate farm-level decisions under different scenarios, particularly those related to ENSO forecasts, to estimate the expected value of forecast information (EVOI). They consider 64 different cropping alternatives reflective of the agricultural practices in the Pampas region of Argentina.       2. **Expected Value of Forecast Information (EVOI)**:     - EVOI is defined as the difference between the expected outcome of a decision made with climate forecast assistance and the expected outcome without such assistance. This metric quantifies the potential economic benefits derived from using climate forecasts in agricultural planning.    3. **Modeling Decision Objectives**:     - The study contrasts two primary decision-making frameworks:       - **Expected Utility (EU)**: Traditional economic model where decision-makers maximize expected outcomes based on their risk preferences.       - **Prospect Theory (PT)**: A behavioral model that accounts for the psychological factors influencing decision-making, such as loss aversion and reference dependence.     - The authors simulate the decision-making process under each model to evaluate how these differing assumptions affect the perceived value of climate information.    4. **Parameter Variation**:     - The authors explore a broad range of parameter values for both EU and PT to account for variability in farmers' risk preferences, wealth levels, and other cognitive factors. This involves adjusting parameters related to risk aversion, loss aversion, and reference wealth.    5. **Farm Decision Models**:     - The study employs a stochastic whole-farm crop and management choice model to capture the role of climate forecasts in decision-making. The optimization process identifies the optimal land allocation to various cropping alternatives based on the decision objectives and available forecast information.    6. **Land Tenure Considerations**:     - The research distinguishes between landowners and tenants, recognizing that their objectives and constraints differ significantly. Landowners typically have longer-term production goals, while tenants may focus on short-term profits, influencing how they utilize climate forecasts.    7. **Empirical Analysis**:     - The authors validate their model using historical weather and crop yield data from the Pampas, simulating yields based on different cropping strategies and climatic conditions over a historical timespan.    8. **Sensitivity Analysis**:     - To assess the robustness of their findings, the authors conduct sensitivity analyses on the parameter values within both the EU and PT frameworks, examining how changes in risk preferences and wealth levels impact the EVOI.    ### Conclusion:  The findings underscore the importance of considering psychological and contextual factors in agricultural decision-making when assessing the value of climate information. The results suggest that the societal benefits of climate forecasts can be significant, particularly for tenants who have more flexibility in their cropping decisions compared to landowners. The paper advocates for tailored communication and application strategies for climate forecasts to enhance their effectiveness in agricultural practices.",NA,1,Include,,,expected utility;prospect theory;voi,ag production,utility,climate forecast,agriculture,x

Assessing the Value of Climate Forecast Information for Pastoralists: Evidence from Southern Ethiopia and Northern Kenya,"Luseno, Winnie K and McPeak, John G and Barrett, Christopher B and Little, Peter D and Gebru, Getachew",2003,36079,"The paper outlines a comprehensive exploration of the societal benefits of climate forecast information for pastoralists in Southern Ethiopia and Northern Kenya, employing both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Below is a summary of the key methods used to estimate or quantify the societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data in the context of climate forecasting:    ### 1. **Qualitative Data Collection**  - **Open-ended Interviews**: Researchers conducted open-ended interviews to identify and understand indigenous climate forecasting methods among pastoralist communities. This approach allowed for the collection of detailed qualitative data regarding local knowledge and practices, which were crucial for contextualizing the later quantitative findings.    ### 2. **Quantitative Surveys**  - **Two-stage Survey Design**: The study employed a structured survey instrument that was fielded in two rounds—before and after the long rains of 2001. This design enabled the researchers to capture changes in expectations and behaviors over time.    - **First Round (March 2001)**: Focused on eliciting pastoralists' expectations of rainfall and their sources of climate forecast information.    - **Second Round (June-July 2001)**: Followed up on the outcomes of the rainy season and assessed the accuracy of forecasts as perceived by the pastoralists.    ### 3. **Probabilistic Forecast Elicitation**  - **Stone Allocation Exercise**: Respondents were given twelve stones to allocate among three categories representing their expectations for rainfall (above normal, normal, below normal). This method quantified their subjective probabilistic forecasts, allowing for a comparison with external forecasts.    ### 4. **Assessment of Forecast Information**  - **Receipt and Confidence in Forecasts**: The survey included questions on the extent of awareness and access to external forecasts, as well as confidence levels in these forecasts compared to indigenous methods. This allowed for the evaluation of how external climate forecasts were received and trusted by the pastoralists.    ### 5. **Comparison of Indigenous vs. External Forecasts**  - **Analysis of Forecast Differences**: The study compared the forecasts generated by pastoralists (both traditional and modern) with those produced by meteorological services to determine the novelty and potential value of external forecasts. This involved analyzing discrepancies between traditional expectations and external forecasts.    ### 6. **Behavioral Response Evaluation**  - **Behavioral Adjustment Questions**: The survey assessed whether pastoralists adjusted their behaviors based on the climate forecasts they received. This included inquiries about changes in herd management, cultivation practices, and financial decisions based on perceived rainfall expectations.    ### 7. **Data Analysis and Interpretation**  - **Statistical Analysis**: The researchers utilized statistical methods to analyze survey data, including probit models to identify factors influencing access to and confidence in external forecasts. The analysis aimed to understand the correlation between forecast information and behavioral changes among households.    ### Conclusion  The methods employed in this study highlight the importance of integrating both indigenous knowledge and scientific forecasting in assessing the societal benefits of climate information for pastoral communities. The findings suggest that while external climate forecasts are available, their impact on pastoralists' decision-making is limited due to a strong reliance on traditional forecasting methods and the contextual factors influencing their behavior.

Economic Value of Seasonal Climate Forecasts for Agriculture: Review of Ex-Ante Assessments and Recommendations for Future Research,"Meza, Francisco J. and Hansen, James W. and Osgood, Daniel",2008,17241,"The paper by Meza et al. (2008) provides a comprehensive review of methods used to estimate the societal benefits of seasonal climate forecasts for agriculture, particularly focusing on ex-ante assessments. Here’s a summary of the key methods discussed in the paper:    1. **Ex-Ante Economic Valuation**: The paper emphasizes the importance of ex-ante assessments which estimate the potential benefits of seasonal forecasts before their adoption. This approach contrasts with ex-post evaluations, which assess actual outcomes after implementation. The authors highlight that ex-ante assessments are crucial for mobilizing funds and guiding institutional agendas.    2. **Bioeconomic Modeling**: A significant methodological approach discussed is the use of bioeconomic models that combine biological and economic data to simulate how farmers might respond to seasonal climate forecasts. These models incorporate various management responses to changes in forecast information, allowing researchers to evaluate potential impacts on agricultural productivity and incomes.    3. **Decision Theory and Optimization**: The authors reference decision theory frameworks where farmers optimize their management decisions based on probabilistic forecasts of climate outcomes. This involves maximizing expected utility based on forecasted weather conditions, thereby quantifying the economic value of forecasts in terms of increased profits or reduced risks.    4. **Simulation and Crop Models**: The use of crop simulation models is highlighted as a method for evaluating how different agricultural practices can be optimized in light of seasonal forecasts. These models help estimate crop yields under varying climatic conditions, incorporating forecast information into the decision-making process.    5. **Quantitative Assessments of Value**: The paper reviews various studies that provide quantitative estimates of the economic value of seasonal forecasts, generally expressed in monetary terms per hectare of land. These assessments consider factors such as forecast accuracy, lead time, and regional agricultural characteristics.    6. **Risk Analysis**: The authors discuss the interplay between risk attitudes of farmers and the value of climate forecasts. They explain that risk-averse farmers may benefit more from forecasts that allow them to mitigate the impacts of adverse conditions, while also highlighting the diminishing returns of forecast value as risk aversion increases.    7. **Incorporation of Insurance and Policy Impacts**: The paper also notes that the value of climate forecasts can be influenced by the availability of insurance products and government policies. Combining forecasts with insurance can enhance their value by allowing farmers to make more informed decisions.    8. **Stakeholder Engagement and Elicited Responses**: The authors advocate for the inclusion of farmer insights and participatory approaches to better understand local agricultural systems and to identify relevant management responses to seasonal forecasts. This helps improve the realism and applicability of economic assessments.    9. **Environmental Impact Considerations**: Some studies reviewed in the paper also consider environmental externalities associated with agricultural management decisions based on climate forecasts, suggesting that forecasts might lead to better resource management and environmental outcomes.    10. **Identification of Gaps**: The paper identifies gaps in the existing literature, including a narrow range of farming systems studied, limited geographic representation, and a need for more comprehensive modeling approaches that capture complex interactions between climate forecasts and agricultural decisions.    In conclusion, Meza et al. (2008) argue that while significant insights have been gained regarding the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts, further research is needed to enhance the robustness and credibility of these assessments, particularly in underrepresented agricultural contexts. They suggest specific recommendations for future research to address these gaps.",NA,1,Exclude,review,,,,,,,x
The Not-So-Marginal Value of Weather Warning Systems,"Miller, Benjamin M.",2018,12833,"The paper by Benjamin M. Miller titled ""The Not-So-Marginal Value of Weather Warning Systems"" employs robust econometric methods to estimate the societal benefits of expanding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR) network. The study aims to assess the impact of NWR transmitter installations on tornado-related injuries and fatalities by addressing the challenge of establishing a reliable counterfactual—to determine how individuals would fare without access to the warning system.    ### Key Methods Used:    1. **Conditional Variation in Broadcast Dates**:     - The study exploits the variation in the timing and location of NWR transmitter installations to create a quasi-experimental design. This allows for the comparison of outcomes in areas that received NWR broadcasts to similar areas that did not, effectively creating a counterfactual scenario.    2. **Cross-Sectional Analysis**:     - This method compares injuries and fatalities across a large sample of tornadoes. It includes controls for potential confounding variables such as population size, frequency of tornado occurrences, and other socio-demographic factors. The analysis uses Poisson regression to estimate the relationship between the percentage of counties on a tornado's path that have NWR coverage and the number of injuries and fatalities.    3. **Fixed Effects Panel Analysis**:     - This methodology examines changes in injury and fatality rates over time within the same counties affected by multiple tornadoes. By controlling for unobserved, time-invariant characteristics of the counties, this method helps to isolate the impact of NWR broadcasts on outcomes. The focus is on counties that experienced at least two tornadoes within the study period, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the causal effect of NWR coverage.    4. **Regression Models**:     - The study employs both Poisson and negative binomial regression models to handle the count nature of the outcome variables (injuries and fatalities). The choice of model is guided by the characteristics of the data, including overdispersion and the presence of zero counts.    5. **Control Variables**:     - The analysis includes several control variables to account for factors that might influence fatalities and injuries, such as population density, housing structure, and historical data on tornado occurrences. Year fixed effects are also incorporated to control for temporal trends that might affect both NWR coverage and outcomes.    6. **Estimation of Marginal Benefits**:     - The paper estimates the marginal impact of NWR transmitters on injuries and fatalities. Results indicate substantial reductions in injuries (approximately 40%) and fatalities (up to 50%) associated with the presence of NWR coverage.    ### Results:  The results suggest that expanding NWR coverage significantly reduces tornado-related injuries and fatalities. However, the paper also discusses that the incremental benefits of further expansions may have declined over time, potentially due to the saturation of warning systems or the introduction of alternative technologies.    ### Conclusion:  Miller's study contributes valuable empirical evidence on the efficacy of weather warning systems, highlighting the importance of robust statistical methods in evaluating public safety interventions. The findings provide a tangible basis for policymakers to justify investments in disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite specifically,cross sectional; panel; causal inference,reduced injury and mortality,injury;mortality,weather early warning systems,disaster response,x
Getting the Most out of Ensemble Forecasts: A Valuation Model Based on User--Forecast Interactions,"Millner, Antony",2008,11920,"The paper by Antony Millner titled ""Getting the Most Out of Ensemble Forecasts: A Valuation Model Based on User–Forecast Interactions"" introduces a flexible theoretical model aimed at quantifying the perceived value of forecasts, particularly in the context of decision-making processes that involve climate forecasts. The model focuses on the interactions between user characteristics and the ensemble forecasts provided, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how these forecasts can drive decision-making and their subsequent value to users.    ### Key Methods Used to Estimate Societal Benefits of Satellite or Earth Observation Data:    1. **Forecast Valuation Model**:     - The model is built on a combination of expected utility theory and Bayesian updating, enabling it to account for how users perceive the value of forecasts based on their own risk preferences and beliefs about forecast accuracy.    2. **User Decision-Making Framework**:     - The model assumes that users act as expected utility maximizers, where their decision-making is influenced by personal beliefs about the likelihood of different states of the world and the associated consequences of their actions (e.g., protecting against adverse events).     - The utility function captures users' risk preferences, allowing for differentiation between risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviors.    3. **Bayesian Updating**:     - When users receive forecast information, they update their beliefs about the probabilities of future events using Bayes' theorem. This updating process incorporates both prior beliefs and the new information provided by the forecast, leading to adjusted expectations of outcomes based on perceived forecast accuracy.    4. **Perceived Forecast Accuracy**:     - A critical aspect of the model is the perceived accuracy of the ensemble forecasts, denoted as a parameter (λ). This reflects the user's belief in the reliability of the forecasts and significantly influences the perceived value derived from using such information.    5. **Cost-Loss Decision Framework**:     - The model is illustrated through a cost-loss scenario, where the implications of decisions (to protect or not protect against an adverse event) are evaluated. This framework allows for the quantification of how forecast information impacts decision-making in economic terms, thus providing insights into the societal benefits of improved forecasting.    6. **Quantitative Value Assessment**:     - The paper defines the value of forecast information as the monetary amount a user would be willing to pay to access the forecast, making it possible to quantify the economic benefits derived from improved forecasting systems.    7. **Sensitivity Analysis**:     - The model is sensitive to various parameters, including perceived accuracy, risk preferences, and the cost-benefit ratio of the decision problem. This sensitivity analysis helps in understanding how different user groups may respond to forecast information and the conditions under which forecasts are most valuable.    8. **Empirical and Theoretical Integration**:     - Millner aims to bridge the gap between empirical findings from social sciences regarding user behavior and theoretical models from economics, ultimately providing a comprehensive framework that can adapt to various decision contexts.    ### Conclusion:  The methods outlined in Millner's paper offer a structured approach to quantifying the societal benefits of satellite or Earth observation data through ensemble forecasting. By emphasizing user interactions, risk preferences, and Bayesian updating, the model provides valuable insights that can inform policy decisions and improve the uptake of forecasting information in sectors reliant on climate data.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite specifically,voi,conceptual,conceptual,weather forecast,conceptual,x
The Public Value of Improving a Weather Forecasting System in Korea: A Choice Experiment Study,"Park, Sun-Young and Yoo, Seung-Hoon",2018,13101,"The paper ""The Public Value of Improving a Weather Forecasting System in Korea: A Choice Experiment Study"" by Sun-Young Park and Seung-Hoon Yoo employs a choice experiment (CE) method to estimate the societal benefits associated with improvements to the Korean weather forecasting system. Here’s a summary of the methods used, specifically regarding the estimation of societal benefits:    ### 1. **Choice Experiment Design**  The authors designed a choice experiment to evaluate the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements in weather forecasting services based on four key attributes:   - **Update frequency of short-range forecasts**  - **Accuracy of short-range forecasts**  - **Update frequency of medium-range forecasts**  - **Accuracy of medium-range forecasts**    Each attribute had multiple levels (e.g., update frequencies ranging from every 3 hours to every hour), allowing for the assessment of how variations in these attributes affect public valuation.    ### 2. **Survey Administration**  A survey was conducted with 1,000 randomly selected households in Korea. The survey included questions on respondents' demographics, their perceptions of the importance of weather forecasts, and their preferences regarding the proposed improvements in forecasting attributes. The survey was administered through in-person interviews to ensure clarity and higher response quality.    ### 3. **Data Collection and Analysis**  The collected data involved respondents' choices among various hypothetical forecasting scenarios, which included:  - A status quo option (current forecast attributes)  - Two alternative scenarios with different levels of the four attributes.    This resulted in a structured dataset suitable for analysis using statistical models.    ### 4. **Multinomial Logit (MNL) Model**  The analysis utilized a multinomial logit model to estimate the WTP for the different attributes of weather forecasting service improvements. The model assessed how the likelihood of choosing a particular scenario varied with changes in the attributes while accounting for the price attribute (cost to households).    ### 5. **Marginal Willingness to Pay (MWTP) Calculation**  From the MNL model estimation, the authors derived the marginal willingness to pay for each attribute, indicating how much households are willing to pay for one additional unit of improvement (e.g., one more update or a 1% increase in accuracy). The MWTP values were calculated based on the estimated coefficients from the model and were reported with confidence intervals to indicate the precision of the estimates.    ### 6. **Scenario Analysis**  The authors created several scenarios to demonstrate the potential public benefits of different levels of improvements to the forecasting system. These scenarios allowed for the aggregation of WTP across households, providing a comprehensive estimate of the total public value of the proposed improvements.    ### 7. **Policy Implications**  The findings from this study are intended to inform policymakers about the economic benefits of investing in improved weather forecasting services, supporting decisions on budget allocations and service enhancements based on public preference and valuation.    In summary, the paper effectively uses a choice experiment approach to quantify the societal benefits of improved weather forecasting in Korea, offering valuable insights for public investment decisions in meteorological services.",NA,1,Include,,not satellite specifically,choice experiment,household utility,dollars,weather forecast,,x
Global Warming Uncertainties and the Value of Information: An Analysis Using CETA,"Peck, Stephen C. and Teisberg, Thomas J.",1993,13315,"The paper investigates the societal benefits of improved information regarding uncertainties in global warming, particularly through the use of the Carbon Emissions Trajectory Assessment (CETA) model. Here's a summary of the methods employed in the study:    ### Methodology Overview    1. **CETA Model Description**:     - The CETA model is an integrated economic growth and energy use model that captures the dynamics of greenhouse gas accumulation, global mean temperature rise, and the associated adaptation and damage costs from climate change.     - The model operates over a long time horizon (260 years), examining the interplay between energy consumption, production, and emissions.    2. **Optimal Policy Analysis**:     - The analysis begins by determining optimal carbon control policies based on central case assumptions of key parameters related to climate change.     - Sensitivity analysis is conducted to see how varying these parameters (like costs of control and benefits of control) affects optimal policies. Parameters identified as crucial include the warming rate per doubling of CO2 and the adaptation/damage function.    3. **Decision Tree Framework**:     - A decision tree framework is utilized to estimate the value of information regarding uncertainties. This involves comparing two scenarios: one where the state of the world is known before policy decisions are made (allowing tailored policies) and one where decisions are made without that knowledge (leading to a uniform policy across possible states).     - The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is calculated as the difference in expected utility between these two scenarios, demonstrating the value of resolving uncertainties.    4. **Value of Information Estimation**:     - The authors focus on three key uncertain parameters: the warming rate per doubling of CO2, the damage cost percentage associated with warming, and the power of the adaptation/damage function.     - For each parameter, they treat it as the only uncertain variable and assign it a probability distribution for analysis. They also explore the implications of joint uncertainty by examining multiple parameters simultaneously.    5. **Comparative Analysis Under Different Policies**:     - The paper considers how the resolution of uncertainties impacts policy-making, contrasting optimal control strategies with potential suboptimal policies that might arise from political processes.     - The analysis shows that if suboptimal policies are chosen under uncertainty, the value of resolving uncertainty is significantly higher, emphasizing the urgency of obtaining accurate information quickly.    6. **Sensitivity and Impact Assessment**:     - The sensitivity of the model's outcomes to variations in parameters is assessed to identify which uncertainties have the greatest impact on optimal policies.     - Results indicate that the value of information about warming rates is particularly high, and addressing uncertainties around costs and adaptation strategies is also critical.    ### Key Findings    - The study concludes that the societal benefits derived from resolving uncertainties about climate change are substantial enough to justify increased research efforts, particularly into the impacts of climate change and adaptation costs.  - If optimal policies are assumed, there is ample time to design research programs effectively. However, if policies are suboptimal due to unresolved uncertainties, the urgency for resolution increases dramatically.    The paper ultimately emphasizes the importance of both understanding and addressing uncertainties in climate change economics to inform better policy decisions.",NA,1,Exclude,eo data not used,this is  about carbon emissions trajectory and policy rather than any kind of remote observation-related information,,,,,,x
Identifying Methods for Quantifying the Societal Impacts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"Pendleton, Linwood and Wiley, Peter and {Beller-Simms}, Nancy and Curtis, Rita and Gaynor, John and Huffer, Hillary and Morris, Charlie and Sagar, Heather and Smith, Adam and Sprague, Jennifer and Triezenberg, Heather",2011,43596,"The paper ""Identifying Methods for Quantifying the Societal Impacts of NOAA"" outlines various methodologies aimed at estimating the societal benefits of NOAA's satellite and Earth observation data. Here’s a summary of the methods discussed:    ### 1. **Value Statements and Logic Models**  The workshop emphasized developing clear value statements or narratives that connect NOAA's outputs with societal benefits. This approach involved creating logic models that outline how NOAA's activities lead to specific outputs, which in turn affect societal outcomes. For example, a logic model might depict how weather forecasts (output) lead to better evacuation decisions (outcome), which ultimately saves lives (societal impact).    ### 2. **Case Studies and Examples**  Participants were encouraged to present case studies that illustrate the impact of NOAA's products.

An Assessment of the Value of Seasonal Forecasting Technology for Western Australian Farmers,"Petersen, E.H and Fraser, R.W",2001,9320,"The paper by Elizabeth Petersen and Rob Fraser presents a methodology for assessing the value of seasonal forecasting technology for farmers in the Merredin region of Western Australia using a whole-farm modeling approach. Here is a summary of the key methods employed to estimate or quantify the societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data, particularly in the context of seasonal forecasting.    ### Key Methods Used in the Study    1. **Modeling Framework**:     - The study utilizes the **MUDA**S (Model of an Uncertain Dryland Agricultural System) model, which is a whole-farm discrete stochastic programming model that incorporates the complexities of a mixed cropping system. This model captures the interactions between various farm enterprises (wheat, sheep, and lupins) and incorporates the stochastic (random) nature of climate impacts on agricultural productivity.    2. **Weather-Year States**:     - The model defines **eleven discrete weather-year states** based on historical meteorological records from 1907 to 1995. Each state has associated probabilities of occurrence and is classified according to parameters such as summer rain, sowing conditions, and post-sowing weather conditions.    3. **Objective Function**:     - The objective is to **maximize expected terminal wealth** (or profit) under uncertainty. The model simplifies the analysis by focusing on expected profit rather than incorporating risk aversion, which allows for a clearer assessment of the impact of seasonal forecasting.    4. **Tactical Adjustments**:     - The model simulates how farmers adjust their management strategies over the farming season in response to changing climatic conditions. These adjustments include decisions related to land use, nitrogen application rates, and livestock management based on the observed weather conditions.    5. **Evaluation of Forecasting Technology**:     - The paper assesses the **value of seasonal forecasting technology** by simulating a **mean-preserving reduction in seasonal uncertainty**. This reduction is characterized as decreasing the variability of yield outcomes by 30% without changing the expected yield. The authors argue that this approach gives a conservative estimate of the technology's benefits.    6. **Quantification of Benefits**:     - The benefits of the forecasting technology are quantified by analyzing changes in profit, yield variability, and management decisions. The study finds that the introduction of seasonal forecasting technology can lead to a **5% increase in expected profits** for farmers and a **26% reduction in profit variability**.    7. **Aggregate Economic Impact**:     - The aggregate annual benefit of the forecasting technology for the Merredin region is estimated to be approximately **$2 million**, based on the number of farm holdings in the area.    ### Conclusion  The methodology employed in this study provides a robust framework for evaluating the economic benefits of seasonal forecasting technology, which is critical for farmers facing seasonal uncertainty. By utilizing a whole-farm model that captures interdependencies between farming enterprises and simulating the impact of reduced uncertainty, the authors provide valuable insights into the potential economic returns from investments in satellite and Earth observation data for agricultural forecasting.",NA,1,Include,,,stochastic programming;optimization;voi,ag production,dollars,climate forecast,agriculture,x

The Value of Improved ENSO Prediction to U.S. Agriculture,"Solow, Andrew R and Adams, Richard F and Bryant, Kelly J and Legler, David M and O'Brien, James J and McCARL, BRUCE A and Nayda, William and Weiher, Rodney",1998,5911,"The paper ""The Value of Improved ENSO Prediction to U.S. Agriculture"" employs a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to estimate the societal benefits of enhanced El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) predictions, particularly focusing on their economic value to U.S. agriculture. The methods used in the study can be categorized into several key components:    1. **Bayesian Decision Analysis Framework**: The study utilizes Bayesian decision theory to model how farmers make cropping decisions based on predicted ENSO phases. This framework allows for the incorporation of uncertainty in predictions, enabling farmers to update their decision-making based on the probability of different ENSO outcomes.    2. **Climatic Differentiation by ENSO Phase**: The researchers classify ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña, and neutral) based on historical sea surface temperature anomalies and analyze the corresponding climatic differences (temperature and precipitation patterns) for each phase.

A Bayesian Methodology for Estimating the Impacts of Improved Coastal Ocean Information on the Marine Recreational Fishing Industry,"Wieand, Kenneth",2008,10576,"The paper by Kenneth Wieand (2008) presents a Bayesian methodology for estimating the impacts of improved coastal ocean information on the marine recreational fishing industry. The research focuses on developing a model to quantify the expected catch of recreational anglers based on varying levels of information regarding coastal ocean conditions. Here’s a summary of the methods employed in the study:    1. **Model Development**: The study constructs a model that predicts recreational fish catch probabilities, which depends on anglers' fishing strategies and the uncertainty of information about the coastal ocean environment. The model is rooted in random utility models (RUM), which describe angler behavior as utility-maximizing under uncertain conditions.    2. **Bayesian Framework**: A key component of the methodology is the integration of Bayesian probabilities into the RUM framework. This allows the model to account for the uncertainty in environmental information available to anglers. The model incorporates three types of variables:     - Fish density (defined as biomass at a location and time).     - Ocean quality parameters (which influence fish density).     - Predictions of these parameters based on available information.    3. **Information Sets**: The paper contrasts two hypothetical information sets:     - A baseline data set, which offers limited predictive power regarding ocean conditions.     - An integrated ocean observing system (IOOS) data set, which provides more accurate and actionable information.    4. **Expected Catch Calculation**: The expected catch per angler is computed based on the two information sets. The model evaluates how improved information from the IOOS influences the anglers' decision-making process, leading to higher probabilities of successful catches. The expected catch is quantified by multiplying the probability of each outcome (given the state of the ocean and fishing strategy) by the expected catch associated with that outcome.    5. **Hypothetical Scenarios**: The methodology includes hypothetical computations to showcase the benefits of improved ocean data. It examines how changes in the accuracy of environmental predictions can alter an angler’s choice of fishing strategy and location, which in turn affects the expected catch.    6. **Economic Valuation**: The paper uses willingness-to-pay estimates to place an economic value on the increase in expected catch due to improved information. The estimated value of an additional fish caught is used to calculate the overall economic benefit to recreational anglers who utilize the IOOS data.    7. **Data Requirements**: The paper discusses the types of data needed to implement the Bayesian model effectively, including the relationship between ocean quality metrics (like temperature, salinity, and nutrient levels) and fish density, as well as how anglers use this data to make informed fishing decisions.    8. **Implications for Policy and Management**: The methodology has implications for the design of ocean observation systems and can inform policy decisions regarding fishery management and the sustainable use of marine resources.    Overall, Wieand's paper illustrates how Bayesian methods can be effectively applied to environmental data to assess and enhance the economic benefits to the recreational fishing sector through improved ocean observation systems.",NA,1,Include,,,voi,fishery production,,ocean observing system;hypothetical,fisheries,x
A Skill Score Based on Economic Value for Probability Forecasts,"Wilks, D S",2001,10296,"The paper ""A Skill Score Based on Economic Value for Probability Forecasts"" by D. S. Wilks proposes a novel approach to evaluating probability forecasts for dichotomous events, particularly focusing on their economic value across varying cost/loss ratios. Here’s a summary of the methods employed, particularly those utilized to estimate or quantify societal benefits from satellite or Earth Observation data.    ### Methods Overview    1. **Economic Value Framework**:     - The core of the paper is based on the ""cost/loss ratio problem,"" which models decision-making under uncertainty. This involves a decision-maker who must choose whether to take protective action against adverse weather events, balancing the costs incurred with the potential losses faced if such events occur.    2. **Value Score (VS) Calculation**:     - The methodology introduces a Value Score (VS) curve that represents the non-dimensionalized relative economic value of forecasts as a function of cost/loss ratios. This curve allows for a nuanced view of how different decision-makers (with varying cost/loss ratios) derive value from the forecasts.    3. **Calibration and Verification**:     - Forecasts are evaluated using Brier scores and skill scores to assess their accuracy. The calibration-refinement factorization is used to break down the joint distribution of forecasts and observations into meaningful components, providing insights into the reliability of forecasts.    4. **Transformation to Categorical Forecasts**:     - The method transforms probability forecasts into categorical yes/no forecasts based on a decision threshold that reflects the decision-maker’s cost/loss ratio. This results in a 2x2 contingency table that summarizes the performance of the forecasts.    5. **Expected Economic Value**:     - Economic value is computed by calculating the expected expenses under different forecasting scenarios (using both climatological information and the forecasts) and deriving the difference. This expected economic value is contextualized in terms of user-specific decision frameworks.    6. **Visualization of Results**:     - The results are presented graphically, with the VS curve plotted against varying cost/loss ratios. This visual representation aids in understanding how different users can benefit from the same set of forecasts based on their individual decision parameters.    7. **Comparative Analysis**:     - The paper includes a comparative analysis of actual weather forecasts (both objective and subjective) to illustrate the practical implications of the proposed methods. It shows how different models can yield varying economic values depending on user-specific contexts.    ### Societal Benefits Estimation    The methods outlined in the paper facilitate the quantification of societal benefits from satellite or Earth Observation data through:    - **Economic Analysis**: By linking forecast accuracy to economic outcomes, the framework helps quantify the financial benefits of accurate weather forecasting, which can be derived from satellite data.  - **User-Centric Approach**: By considering different cost/loss ratios, the method recognizes the diverse impacts of weather forecasts on various sectors (e.g., agriculture, emergency services), enhancing the understanding of how satellite data can inform decision-making.  - **Incremental Value Assessment**: The ability to compare forecasts against climatological benchmarks provides a basis for assessing the incremental value added by satellite observations, translating technical accuracy into real-world economic benefits.    Overall, the paper provides a robust framework for understanding the economic implications of weather forecasts, particularly those driven by satellite or Earth Observation data, emphasizing the need to consider user-specific contexts in evaluating forecast utility.",NA,1,Include,,"""value score"" sounds like a voi normalized by perfect information: ""as a percentage improvement in value between climatological and perfect information; as a function of the cost/loss ratio, for 0 < C/L < 1.",cost/loss problem,hypothetical,,hypothetical weather forecast,hypothetical,x

Ziolkowska aims to quantify the economic benefits derived from the utilization of the Oklahoma Mesonet weather and environmental information system by farmers. The study fills a gap in the literature that primarily comprises qualitative analyses by providing a quantitative assessment.    ### Methods Overview    1. **Data Sources**: The study utilizes several data sources, including:     - **USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)** for agricultural production statistics.     - Agricultural output statistics and crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center.     - Historical weather data from the Oklahoma Mesonet, which consists of 121 weather monitoring stations.    2. **Proficiency Analysis**:      - The economic value of mesonet information is evaluated through a **profitability analysis** that examines the relationship between net returns from agricultural production and the use of weather information.     - Net returns are calculated as the difference between total revenues (yield multiplied by area harvested and market price) and total production costs (unit costs multiplied by area planted).    3. **Profitability Factors**:      - The analysis incorporates **profitability adjustment factors** derived from a survey of farmers that estimates the percentage of profits attributed to the application of mesonet information. This factor, termed ""factor p,"" was determined to be 3.7% based on median responses.    4. **Utilization Rate**:      - The percentage of farmers using mesonet information (referred to as ""factor u"") is estimated at 73%, based on survey data.    5. **Economic Benefits Calculation**:      - The cumulative economic benefit from utilizing mesonet information is calculated over the period from 2006 to 2014, considering both improved profits and prevented losses due to informed decision-making.     - The formula used to calculate total economic value (vec) is:       \[       vec = \sum [ |nri| * factor p * factor u ]       \]       where nri represents net returns for each crop.    6. **Sensitivity Analysis**:      - A sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore how changes in the utilization rate and profitability factor impact the economic benefits, revealing how varying assumptions affect the outcomes.    7. **Regional Analysis**:      - The analysis is further broken down by climate regions in Oklahoma to assess regional variations in economic benefits from mesonet information.    ### Results  - The cumulative economic benefits from the application of mesonet information were estimated at approximately $183.1 million for the period from 2006 to 2014, highlighting the significance of weather information in preventing losses, especially during drought years.  - The study identifies regions with the highest benefits, particularly in the southwest, north central region, and panhandle, where weather conditions significantly impact agricultural production.    ### Conclusion  The paper concludes that mesonet information provides substantial economic value to Oklahoma farmers by enhancing decision-making capabilities and reducing weather-related losses. This study sets a foundation for future research to explore the economic benefits of weather information in other sectors and regions.",NA,1,Include,,,utility value;voi,ag production,dollars,Mesonet,agriculture,x
