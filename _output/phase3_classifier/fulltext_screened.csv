The authors employ survival analysis to estimate the timing and occurrence of deforestation events using remote sensing data. They compare two regions divided by an artificial line: one under satellite monitoring (Legal Maranh√£o) and the other without (Cerrado Maranh√£o).     To address the challenge of cloud cover, which obscures satellite images and delays detection, the authors develop a cloud cover mask using MODIS vegetation indices and land cover data. They quantify the effect of cloud cover on deforestation by creating a binary dataset indicating whether pixels were deforested or not. Counterfactual simulations assess the potential deforestation that would have occurred without the monitoring program or in the absence of cloud cover, estimating that nearly 73 million tonnes of CO2 emissions could be avoided if clouds did not impede detection.
