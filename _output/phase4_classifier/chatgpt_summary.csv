The methodology involves two main approaches: a single-date image classification and a multi-date analysis examining seasonal variations. Initially, the authors conducted an experimental design to maximize site representation across intactness classes, utilizing TM data that was atmospherically corrected.     The process included unsupervised classifications followed by field visits to gather ground-truthing data.
