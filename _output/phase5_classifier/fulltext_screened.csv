Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Network for High-Speed Sar Ship Detection,"Zhang, Tianwen and Zhang, Xiaoling and Shi, Jun and Wei, Shunjun",2019,zhang_depthwiseseparableconvolutionneural_2019,32465,"The paper presents a novel approach for high-speed ship detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using a Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network (DS-CNN). The authors propose a lightweight network architecture integrating multi-scale detection, concatenation, and anchor box mechanisms to enhance detection accuracy while improving speed. The DS-CNN replaces traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (C-CNNs) by using depthwise and pointwise convolutions, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational cost, thus increasing detection speed.    To evaluate the effectiveness of their method, the authors conducted experiments on the Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) and a large-size Sentinel-1 SAR image. They measured detection speed in frames per second (fps) and detection accuracy using mean Average Precision (mAP). The results indicate that their approach achieves a detection speed of 111 fps (9.03 ms per image) with only a slight sacrifice in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art object detectors. They also analyzed computational complexity and network size, demonstrating that DS-CNN effectively balances speed and accuracy, making it valuable for real-time maritime applications.",NA,1,,,,,,,,,
Initial Assessment of Burn Severity Using Transfer Learning Model,"Zheng, Z. and Wang, J. and Zou, B. and Gao, Y. and Yang, S. and Wang, Y.",2022,zheng_initialassessmentburnseverity_2022,12107,"The paper employs a transfer learning approach to improve the initial assessment of burn severity from forest fires using remote sensing data. Specifically, the authors utilize a semi-supervised transfer component analysis (SSTCA) algorithm to project original spectral features from remote sensing images of source areas (historical field survey data from previous fire events) into a new feature space where the distributions of both source and target areas (recently burned) can be aligned. This method facilitates the construction of a support vector regression (SVR) model based on the historical data and allows for its application to the target area, which experienced the Lushan fire in March 2020.    The performance of the SSTCA-SVR model is quantitatively compared against traditional models, including those based on the normalized burn ratio (NBR), delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR), and other spectral indices. Results indicate that the SSTCA-SVR model achieves the highest overall accuracy (71.20%) and Kappa coefficient (0.64), significantly outperforming the other methods, which exhibited much lower accuracies. This approach offers a rapid and efficient means for assessing burn severity, potentially enhancing post-fire management responses.",NA,1,,,,,,,,,
