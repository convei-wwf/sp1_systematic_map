Estimating fatal strikes: Using a probabilistic model based on factors such as whale density, vessel transit duration, dimensions of whales and vessels, velocities of whales, and vessels to estimate expected rates of fatal encounters.  2. Management decision model: Developing a decision model to characterize how managers choose vessel speed restrictions based on expected rates of fatal strikes and constraints on exceedance probability.  3. Cost of management: Calculating the costs to vessels for compliance with vessel speed regulations based on vessel transit times and operational costs per hour.  4. VOI analysis: Comparing the costs of compliance for vessel operators under regulations informed by the two information cases to estimate the VOI of using Earth observations.    Results show that using remote sensing data (RSDI) can lead to cost savings for marine shipping operators compared to using shipboard surveys (ISDI), ranging from US$21 million to US$332 million annually depending on the conservation objectives. The counterfactual case (RSDI) enables more cost-effective management by providing more accurate and precise estimates of blue whale densities, leading to less stringent regulations and lower compliance costs for vessel owners.",NA,1

An Analysis of the Value of Additional Information Provided by a Water Quality Measurement Network,"Destandau, F. and Diop, A. P.",2016,7084,"The paper uses Bayesian decision theory to estimate the value of additional information provided by a water quality measurement network. The authors define the value of information in relation to parameters such as prior probabilities on the states of nature, costs associated with poor decisions, and the accuracy of additional information. They analyze how these parameters impact the value of information, particularly focusing on the role of prior probabilities and error costs in increasing or decreasing the value of information based on the initial uncertainty level.    The authors illustrate their methodology using a case study of a stream in the Bas-Rhin department in France, where a monitoring station provides information on the sensitivity of the environment to nutrients for decision-making regarding wastewater treatment plant techniques. The economic utility of modifying decisions based on the additional information is calculated to determine the value of the information provided by the monitoring network.    The paper discusses the impact of the accuracy of the additional information, initial assumptions, and error costs on the value of information. It also highlights how the value of information changes based on the ecological damage, prior probabilities, and the precision of the additional information. Figures and analysis are presented to show how these parameters influence the value of information in the context of the water quality monitoring network case study.

Assimilation of GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Data into a Land Surface Model: Results for the Mississippi River Basin,"Zaitchik, Benjamin F. and Rodell, Matthew and Reichle, Rolf H.",2008,12515,"The paper by Zaitchik et al. (2008) focuses on assimilating data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system of satellites to improve the simulation of water storage and fluxes in the Mississippi River basin using a Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM). The authors assimilated monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies derived from GRACE for different subbasins of the Mississippi River into the CLSM using an Ensemble Kalman Smoother from January 2003 to May 2006.    The methods involve disaggregating the coarse-scale GRACE observations onto the finer-resolution model elements, accounting for different water storage components such as groundwater, soil moisture, vegetation, surface water, snow, and ice. The ensemble smoother updates the model states based on the difference between the observations and the model estimates, considering error variances and cross correlations. The assimilation process is performed iteratively at the subbasin level to improve the model simulation compared to open-loop simulations.    The results of the assimilation show enhanced skill in capturing groundwater variability, increased correlation between simulated water storage and gauged river flow, and improved simulation performance for smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin. The assimilation of GRACE data leads to better agreement with observational data and a more accurate representation of the seasonal water cycle variability.    Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of using GRACE data assimilation with a land surface model to improve the estimation and understanding of water storage dynamics in hydrological applications.",NA,1
