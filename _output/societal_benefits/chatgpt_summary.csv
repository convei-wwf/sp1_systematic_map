The Value of Information: Methodological Frontiers and New Applications in Environment and Health,NA,2012,5443,"The paper proposes an economic assessment model to quantify the tangible economic impact of early warning systems, focusing on the false alert problematic and incorporating socio-cultural factors. The authors review existing approaches for assessing the value of early warning systems, such as contingent valuation and cost avoidance calculations. They argue that cost avoidance calculations are preferable due to the limitations and biases associated with contingent valuation methods.    Factors influencing the effectiveness of early warning systems are classified into personal and cultural factors, prediction-related factors, and dissemination-related factors. Personal and cultural factors include individuals' capability to understand, believe, verify, and personalize warning messages, as well as their perception of risk and willingness to take protective actions. Prediction-related factors consider the accuracy of disaster predictions and lead times of warnings. Dissemination-related factors address the likelihood of recipients correctly receiving and noticing warnings through various communication channels.    The paper proposes a mathematical model to assess the economic impact of early warning systems by calculating the benefits of additional protective actions initiated by the system and comparing them to the costs of system operations and protective actions taken. The model considers factors such as disaster occurrence, prediction accuracy, population size, and the effectiveness of protective actions. The economic value of the early warning system is calculated as the difference between the total benefits and the total costs incurred.    The authors acknowledge the need for further research on the socio-cultural factors influencing early warning system effectiveness and highlight ongoing projects aimed at addressing these gaps. Overall, the paper aims to provide a systematic framework for evaluating the economic value of early warning systems to support investment decisions by policymakers and private investors.",NA

The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response,"Oddo, Perry C. and Bolten, John D.",2019,300,"In the paper ""Visual Evidence From Above: Assessing the Value of Earth Observation Satellites for Supporting Human Rights"" by Tanya Notley and Camellia B. Webb-Gannon (2016), the authors explore the use of satellite-collected images in human rights contexts. The researchers analyze the opportunities, challenges, and risks associated with utilizing satellite data for documenting, preventing, and verifying rights abuses, as well as proposing social change.    While public access to remote sensing earth observation satellite data has historically been limited, there is a growing trend of citizens and rights advocacy groups leveraging these images to address justice issues. The authors point out the relatively scarce critical analysis of satellites compared to other communication technologies in terms of their potential as tools for social justice, activism, and resistance. They argue for a greater focus on ensuring accountability from below if satellites are to be effectively used by rights advocates to collect evidence in support of human rights causes.    The specific methods used in the paper to quantify the societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract provided. However, based on the focus of the study, it can be inferred that the researchers likely employed qualitative research methods such as case studies, content analysis of satellite-collected images, and possibly interviews or surveys with rights advocates and other stakeholders to assess the impact and value of using Earth Observation satellites for human rights advocacy.

These poverty maps are constructed for different administrative levels in Nigeria, such as states, LGAs (Local Government Areas), and wards. The paper assesses the effectiveness of these high-resolution poverty maps in improving the geographic targeting of social assistance programs.    To evaluate the performance of geographic targeting using these poverty maps, the study compares the outcomes obtained by targeting based on the machine learning-based poverty maps with targeting based on a benchmark derived from a nationally representative household survey (DHS data). The evaluation is then conducted using independent ground truth data from the 2019 NLSS (National Living Standards Survey), which provides information on the wealth status of households in Nigeria.    The study assesses targeting accuracy for both poor households and extreme poor households in regions where ground truth data are available.

Assimilation of GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Data into a Land Surface Model: Results for the Mississippi River Basin,"Zaitchik, Benjamin F. and Rodell, Matthew and Reichle, Rolf H.",2008,9386,"The paper focuses on assimilating data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite system to improve the simulation of water storage and fluxes in the Mississippi River basin. The authors assimilated GRACE-derived monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies into a land surface model using an ensemble Kalman smoother from January 2003 to May 2006. The assimilation led to enhanced skill in estimating groundwater variability and improved correlation between simulated water storage and gauged river flow. Additionally, the model performance was evaluated for smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, showing increased correlation between water storage estimates and gauged river flow, indicating the potential of data assimilation for hydrological applications. The paper demonstrates the potential benefits of using satellite data for estimating and quantifying societal benefits related to water resources management.",NA
A User-Driven Approach to Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities for Societal Benefit,"Zell, Erica and Huff, Amy K. and Carpenter, Adam T. and Friedl, Lawrence A.",2012,7467,"The paper titled ""A User-Driven Approach to Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities for Societal Benefit"" by Erica Zell, Amy K. Huff, Adam T. Carpenter, and Lawrence A. Friedl focuses on identifying and prioritizing critical earth observation needs from the perspective of users across various societal benefit areas. The study utilized a two-stage process: in the first stage, critical observations for each societal benefit area were determined based on publicly available documents expressing user needs. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual benefit areas based on their criticality and commonality to multiple areas.     The main methods used in the study include:    1. Unweighted Tally: Summing up the number of benefit areas for which a given observation is considered critical based on full lists of priority observations.       2. 3-2-1 Weighted Tally: Assigning weights (3, 2, 1) for high, medium, and low priority observations respectively in each benefit area to determine total weighted scores.       3. 6-3-1 Weighted Tally: Similar to the previous method but with different weight assignments.       4. ""15 Most Critical"" Tally: Counting the number of benefit areas (up to 15) for which a given observation was among the most critical.    The results of the analysis included a ranking of 152 critical earth observation priorities based on their criticality and commonality across different benefit areas. The study aimed to provide a foundation for engaging user communities and identifying key observations to maximize societal benefits from earth observation data. The top 10 observations identified by the study were precipitation, soil moisture, surface air temperature, land cover, surface wind speed, vegetation cover, surface humidity, urbanization, vegetation type, and surface wind direction and sea surface temperature.",NA
