G.",2009,5060,"The paper explores the value of Earth Observation (EO) data for marine water quality management. The authors aim to develop and test an analytical framework to quantify the returns on investing in EO data by combining Bayesian decision theory with an expert-oriented approach. The analysis focuses on the societal benefits of using EO for marine water quality management but suggests that the methodology is applicable to other topics as well.

The paper attempts to quantify the societal benefits of investing in EO data by considering decision-makers' beliefs, the accuracy of the information system, and the impact of EO data on decision-making.    Two case studies are presented to illustrate the methodology: harmful algal blooms in the North Sea and water quality management in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Through expert elicitation and surveys, the authors assess decision-makers' beliefs, the perceived accuracy of EO information, and the potential benefits of using EO data for these specific environmental management issues.    The results suggest that the expected benefits of investing in EO data are positive, but strongly depend on the perceived accuracy of the information system.

Assessing the Economic Value of Early Warning Systems,"Klafft, Michael and Meissen, Ulrich",2011,10140,"The paper uses the contingent valuation technique to determine the willingness of Oklahoma farmers and ranchers to pay for real-time mesoscale weather information provided by the Mesonet system. The authors conducted a mail survey to gather data from 175 respondents, assessing their willingness to pay for both raw weather data and value-added weather information products derived from the Mesonet system.    The study focuses on evaluating the societal benefits of improved weather information in aiding agricultural decision-making and reducing weather-related losses. Factors such as gross sales, irrigation usage, and past weather losses were found to significantly impact the willingness to pay for mesoscale weather information. Producers with larger farms, irrigation systems, and higher weather-related losses were generally willing to pay more for the weather data and decision aids.    The study provides estimates of the mean willingness to pay for raw weather data ($5.83 per month) and the combined raw data with value-added information products ($6.55 per month). These estimates contribute to understanding the economic value that agricultural producers place on real-time mesoscale weather information and decision aids.

The Value of Information: Methodological Frontiers and New Applications in Environment and Health,NA,2012,7257,"The paper by Klafft et al. proposes an economic assessment model for evaluating the societal benefits of early warning systems. The authors discuss existing methods for assessing the economic value of Earth Observation or satellite data, focusing on two main approaches: contingent valuation and cost avoidance calculations.    Contingent valuation estimates the value of a system by analyzing users' willingness to pay, while cost avoidance calculations determine the amount of damage prevented by the system compared to the investment needed. The paper suggests that cost avoidance calculations are preferred due to potential biases in contingent valuation methods.    The authors also highlight factors influencing the effectiveness of early warning systems, including personal and cultural factors, prediction-related factors, and dissemination-related factors. These factors influence how warnings are received and translated into protective actions by individuals.    The paper proposes an assessment model that considers factors such as disaster occurrence, prediction accuracy, damage potential, and socio-cultural variables. The model calculates the economic impact of early warnings by assessing the benefits of additional protective actions initiated by the system and comparing them to the costs of the system's operation and induced protective actions.    In conclusion, the paper aims to provide a framework for more precise and comprehensive evaluations of the costs and benefits of early warning systems. The proposed model supports decision-making processes related to investments in early warning applications, potentially leading to more sustainable spending on these systems in the future.

Assimilation of GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Data into a Land Surface Model: Results for the Mississippi River Basin,"Zaitchik, Benjamin F. and Rodell, Matthew and Reichle, Rolf H.",2008,12515,"The paper by Zaitchik et al. (2008) focuses on the assimilation of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to improve the simulation of water storage and fluxes in the Mississippi River Basin. They assimilated GRACE-derived monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies using an Ensemble Kalman Smoother into a land surface model (CLSM) from January 2003 to May 2006.     The study evaluated the benefits of assimilating the GRACE data by comparing the assimilated results to independent measurements of groundwater, river flow, and other hydrological variables. The authors found that assimilation improved the simulation of groundwater variability, correlation between simulated water storage and gauged river flow, and downscaling of GRACE data for hydrological applications.    The methods used in the paper involved ensemble data assimilation techniques, specifically the Ensemble Kalman Smoother, to distribute GRACE observations at the coarse scale onto the finer-scale model elements of the land surface model. The assimilation increments were calculated based on the differences between observations and model estimates, error variances, and modeled cross-covariances between observed variables and model states.    Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential of assimilating GRACE data into land surface models to enhance the simulation and understanding of water storage and fluxes at regional scales. The assimilation approach showed improvements in capturing hydrological variability and correlations with observed groundwater and river flow.",NA,1
A User-Driven Approach to Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities for Societal Benefit,"Zell, Erica and Huff, Amy K. and Carpenter, Adam T. and Friedl, Lawrence A.",2012,9956,"The paper focuses on determining critical earth observation priorities for societal benefit by conducting a cross-sectoral meta-analysis from the perspective of users. The study organized around the Group on Earth Observations' (GEO) societal benefit areas (SBAs) identified 152 critical earth observation priorities across agriculture, biodiversity, climate, disasters, ecosystems, energy, health, water, and weather.    The methodology involved a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each SBA were identified based on publicly available documents. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations across multiple SBAs based on their criticality and commonality. The top 10 priority observations were identified as precipitation, soil moisture, surface air temperature, land cover, surface wind speed, vegetation cover, surface humidity, urbanization, vegetation type, and surface wind direction, and sea surface temperature.    The paper acknowledges some limitations in the methodology, including regional bias in available documents and varying levels of detail on required observation characteristics. However, the results provide valuable insights into user needs and can support decision-making for investments in earth observation systems. Further research and follow-up studies are suggested to enhance the understanding of specific observation needs and to address evolving user priorities.",NA,1
