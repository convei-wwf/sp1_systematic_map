J. and Quayle, Brad and Epting, Justin and Hardy, Terry and Goodrich, David",2021,10810,"The methods used in this paper involve an economic model applied to assess the societal benefits of geospatial information in decision-making. The value of information (VOI) contained in geospatial data is evaluated by comparing the net benefits of a decision with and without the information. Various technologies are employed for collecting and distributing geospatial data. The economic model for assessing the VOI in geospatial data is applied to three examples:     1. A retrospective model on the environmental regulation of agrochemicals to demonstrate the potential value of geospatial information in regional health policy decisions.       2. A prospective model on the impact and mitigation of earthquakes in urban areas to show how geospatial data can inform dynamic physical processes and their effects on specific income groups.    3. An ongoing examination of a privateâ€“public integrated geospatial information model for ecosystem services markets to reduce environmental externalities by using detailed geospatial data for efficient monitoring and analysis.    The applied economic model involves an interdisciplinary approach incorporating spatial and temporal scientific, technical, and economic data. The geospatial information is used to identify spatial patterns, test hypotheses, and estimate the gain in societal welfare based on better decisions with additional information in the presence of uncertainty. The economic value of geospatial data is assessed by analyzing the net benefits with and without the information in decision-making scenarios.

G.",2009,3795,"The paper developed an analytical framework to estimate the societal benefits of Earth observation (EO) data, specifically focusing on marine water quality management. The analysis combined Bayesian decision theory with an expert-oriented approach to assess the value of informational investments under uncertainty. Two case studies were presented: one concerning potentially harmful algal blooms in the North Sea and the other addressing water quality monitoring in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon.     For the North Sea case study, the expected benefits of EO investments were found to depend strongly on the perceived accuracy of the information system. Respondents indicated that EO data could improve marine water quality monitoring and reduce uncertainty by roughly 50%. The value of EO information in this case was estimated to be 350,000 euro/week if the perceived accuracy was high.     In the Great Barrier Reef case study, respondents expected the accuracy of EO information to be maximally 80%. Depending on prior beliefs and perceived accuracy, the value of EO information ranged from 21.2 million to 82 million USD per year.     The results showed that decision-makers' perceptions of the accuracy of EO data and their prior beliefs about the state of the environment play significant roles in determining the value of EO information for societal benefit in marine water quality management.

Empowering Brazilian Unprivileged Communities with High Geotechnological Tools,"Brito, Patricia Lustosa and Reis, Daniel Nadier Cavalcanti and Brito, Ricardo Lustosa and {de Oliveira Fernandes}, Vivian and Alixandrini, Mauro",2013,8265,"The paper titled ""The Value of Earth Observation for Managing the Great Barrier Reef"" by Bouma, Kuik, and Dekker (2009) utilizes an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian decision theory to estimate the expected contribution of investments in Earth observation (EO) data for managing the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The main focus is on how EO can improve decision-making by enabling better-targeted emission reduction measures in the GBR lagoon.    The authors develop a model to optimize emission reductions under different states: emissions from all catchments affecting reef quality or emissions from certain catchments affecting reef quality more. To estimate the societal benefits, they assess the cost savings of improved targeting which could lead to more efficient water quality management.    In order to quantify the value of the information provided by EO data, the authors construct a Bayesian decision framework that considers decision-makers' prior beliefs, the perceived accuracy of the information, and how decision-makers update their beliefs based on the information. By eliciting decision-makers' perceptions of the accuracy of EO information through a questionnaire, the study determines the type-I and type-II errors associated with the information.    The study finds that improving information accuracy increases its value and expands the range of decision-makers willing to invest in the informational service. The estimated value of EO information for managing water quality in the GBR is 13.9 million AUD per year, representing the potential cost savings that could be achieved through more targeted decision-making facilitated by EO data.
