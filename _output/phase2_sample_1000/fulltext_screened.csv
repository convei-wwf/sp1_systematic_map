Revisiting the Environmental Kuznets Curve for City-Level Co2 Emissions: Based on Corrected Npp-Viirs Nighttime Light Data in China,"Chen, Hongxing and Zhang, Xiaoling and Wu, Rongwei and Cai, Tianyi",2020,17192,"The paper titled ""Revisiting the Environmental Kuznets Curve for City-Level CO2 Emissions: Based on Corrected NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light Data in China"" by Hongxing Chen et al. employs several key methods to estimate and quantify societal benefits associated with satellite or Earth observation data, specifically focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China. Below is a summary of the methods used in the research:    1. **Data Collection**: The study utilizes corrected nighttime light (NTL) data from the NPP-VIIRS (National Polar-orbiting Partnership - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) for the years 2015 and 2016. This dataset is combined with additional socio-economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita, urbanization rate, industrial structure) and energy consumption statistics from provincial and city-level statistical yearbooks.    2. **CO2 Emissions Estimation**: The authors employ a top-down method to allocate CO2 emissions derived from energy consumption. The estimation of provincial and city-level CO2 emissions utilizes a formula that incorporates various energy types and their corresponding emission factors. This method is positioned as more feasible and reliable compared to traditional methods that largely rely on statistical data.    3. **Modeling Approaches**: The study applies the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model to explore the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions. The model includes variables such as population density, urbanization rate, and investment in fixed assets to understand their impact on carbon emissions.    4. **Spatial Econometric Analysis**: To examine the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) at the city level, the study incorporates spatial econometric models, specifically the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Spatial Error Model (SEM). These models account for spatial dependence in CO2 emissions across neighboring cities, which is critical for accurate estimation.    5. **Hot Spot and Cold Spot Analysis**: The authors conduct spatial analysis to identify areas with high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) CO2 emissions. This analysis helps visualize the geographical distribution of emissions and indicates regions that may require targeted emissions reduction strategies.    6. **Testing the EKC Hypothesis**: The study tests the EKC hypothesis using the relationship between urban economic development (measured by GDP per capita) and CO2 emissions. The results suggest an inverted U-shape relationship, indicating that as cities develop, CO2 emissions initially increase before reaching a turning point, after which emissions begin to decline.    7. **Visualization and Mapping**: The study employs GIS tools (ArcGIS) to visualize the spatial distribution of CO2 emissions, providing a clear depiction of emissions across various provinces and cities in China.    8. **Correlation and Validation**: The authors validate their CO2 estimation method by comparing estimated emissions against statistical data, achieving a high correlation (RÂ² values) between the two, which reinforces the credibility of their approach.    The societal benefits of using satellite or Earth observation data, as highlighted in the paper, include enhanced understanding of city-level emissions, better-informed policy-making for emissions reductions, and the ability to visualize and target high-emission areas for more effective environmental management.

Three Most Widely Used Gnss-Based Shoreline Monitoring Methods to Support Integrated Coastal Zone Management Policies,"Goncalves, R. M. and Awange, J. L.",2017,12269,"The paper by Goncalves and Awange focuses on the evaluation of three widely used Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based methods for shoreline monitoring: Relative Kinematic (RK), Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), and Precise Point Positioning (PPP). The study is set in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) policies, particularly within the coastal zone of Pernambuco State, Brazil. Hereâ€™s a summary of the methods employed in the paper to estimate and quantify the societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data:    ### Methods Overview    1. **GNSS Methods for Shoreline Monitoring**:     - **Relative Kinematic (RK)**: Involves using a fixed reference station to determine the positions of a moving roving receiver. This method requires post-processing of data collected by both receivers to eliminate common errors (e.g., satellite clock errors, atmospheric delays). The accuracy is generally in the centimeter range, but it is affected by the distance from the reference station.         - **Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)**: Similar to RK but provides real-time position data. It requires a fixed base station and a rover; the base station transmits corrections to the rover via a communication link. While RTK offers high accuracy (centimeter-level) and real-time feedback, it is limited by the range of the radio signal between the base and the rover and can experience signal loss in obstructed areas.       - **Precise Point Positioning (PPP)**: This method differs as it only requires a single GNSS receiver, which can be advantageous in terms of cost and labor. PPP achieves high accuracy by using precise satellite orbit and clock data, allowing for post-processing to address common GNSS errors. However, it has longer convergence times to achieve centimeter-level accuracy.    2. **Data Collection and Analysis**:     - The study conducted field surveys along a 2.4 km stretch of shoreline, employing each GNSS technique to collect positional data at high tide, which serves as a reference for shoreline position.     - Data were processed using different GNSS software tailored to each method, and various statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of shoreline positions obtained from each method.    3. **Evaluation Criteria**:     - The methods were evaluated based on several criteria: mean deviations from reference shorelines, standard deviation, root mean square error (RMSE), minimum and maximum displacements, and Pearson correlation to assess the similarity between the trajectories obtained from different methods.    4. **Societal Benefits Assessment**:     - The findings provided insights into the reliability and economic viability of each GNSS method for mapping shoreline changes, which is crucial for informing coastal management policies and planning efforts.     - The study emphasizes the importance of accurate shoreline data for decision-making in coastal development, resource management, and response strategies for climate change impacts and coastal erosion.    ### Summary of Findings  - The results indicated that all three methods could be suitable for different scenarios in coastal monitoring, with PPP emerging as a cost-effective option due to its minimal equipment requirements.  - The study concluded that GNSS-based methods are instrumental in providing timely and precise shoreline data, which supports ICZM policies aimed at sustainable coastal development and environmental protection.

Portability of Semantic and Spatial-Temporal Machine Learning Methods to Analyse Social Media for near-Real-Time Disaster Monitoring,"Havas, Clemens and Resch, Bernd",2021,13068,"The paper discusses a methodology for estimating societal benefits from satellite or Earth observation data by utilizing social media data to enhance disaster management efforts. Below is a summary of the key methods employed in the study:    1. **Data Collection**: The authors developed a tool called ""geocrawler"" to collect georeferenced social media posts (primarily from Twitter) in a timely manner during natural disasters. The geocrawler uses both the REST and streaming APIs from Twitter to ensure comprehensive data collection, which allows for near-real-time analysis.    2. **Data Preprocessing**: Social media data is often noisy and contains irrelevant posts. The authors implemented preprocessing steps to clean the data by transforming text to lowercase, removing URLs, numbers, short words, and stop words, and stemming words to combine different forms of the same word.    3. **Semantic Topic Extraction**: The methodology employs a semi-supervised topic modeling approach using Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation (guided LDA) to identify disaster-related topics within the tweets. Seed words associated with disasters guide the model to ensure that the topics extracted are relevant to the events being analyzed.    4. **Hot Spot Analysis**: After filtering the tweets for disaster relevance, the authors conduct a hot spot analysis using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to identify areas with high concentrations of disaster-related social media posts (hot spots) and areas with low concentrations (cold spots). This analysis takes into account the spatial distribution of tweets to provide a clearer picture of the impacted areas.    5. **Validation**: The results of the hot spot analysis are validated by comparing them against official datasets from authorities such as the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS). This comparison helps to ascertain the accuracy and reliability of the information derived from social media.    6. **Use Cases**: The methodology was tested on various natural disasters, including earthquakes and hurricanes, under both historical (cold cases) and ongoing (warm cases) scenarios. By creating hot spot maps in near real-time, the authors demonstrated the methodology's effectiveness in identifying impacted areas more swiftly than traditional satellite-based monitoring systems.    In summary, the paper illustrates a robust approach that combines machine learning techniques with social media data to enhance disaster monitoring and management. The integration of near-real-time information from social media not only complements satellite data but also provides critical insights into the societal impacts of natural disasters.",NA,1,Exclude,Does not value data,"Very interesting, looking at tweet analysis as a way to understand natural disasters in near real time, compared to ""official"" products like USGS info.

The authors employ a theoretical framework and empirical analysis to examine the adoption decisions of farmers in the context of pest population dynamics and economic thresholds for pesticide applications. Below is a summary of the methods used in the study to estimate or quantify the societal benefits associated with satellite or Earth Observation data.    ### Theoretical Model  1. **Option-Value Framework**:      - The authors develop an option-value model to analyze the investment decision in RSVT.

H. and Coops, Nicholas C. and Stenhouse, Gordon B.",2021,17676,"The paper by Kearney et al. (2021) presents two novel methods for characterizing off-highway road use in grizzly bear habitat using remote sensing, social media, and crowd-sourced data. The focus is on estimating societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data in the context of wildlife conservation. Hereâ€™s a summary of the methods used:    ### 1. **Network-Based Approach**  - **Data Sources**: This method leverages data from social media platforms (Flickr, Facebook, Google, and Wikiloc) to determine human activity hotspots. It also incorporates data on oil and gas activity and forest harvesting derived from public databases and satellite imagery.  - **Circuit Theory Application**: The authors applied circuit theory, which models connectivity through a network, to estimate human activity intensity along the road network. This was done by treating activity locations as nodes and the road network as resistors connecting these nodes. The model calculates the flow of ""current"" (representing human activity) between nodes based on the intensity of the activity at those nodes.  - **Classification of Road Use**: The road segments were classified into three categories (low, medium, high use) based on the summed current derived from the human activity data.    ### 2. **Image-Based Approach**  - **Data Collection**: This method used high-resolution satellite imagery (RapidEye) and ground data collected from a mobile app (RoadLab-Pro). This app tracked road surface conditions and travel speeds over a subset of the study area.  - **Feature Extraction**: The authors derived various vegetation indices and terrain variables from the satellite imagery to capture road conditions and surface types. These features were hypothesized to correlate with road use intensity.  - **Random Forest Classification**: The extracted features were input into a random forest model to classify road segments into low, medium, and high use categories, based on the previously collected training data regarding road speed and roughness.    ### 3. **Comparison with Reference Classification**  - The two new methods (network-based and image-based) were compared against a reference road classification from a government database. The authors assessed the utility of each method in modeling grizzly bear behavior and habitat selection.  - The comparison aimed to demonstrate how well these methods captured meaningful information about roads in relation to wildlife behavior, especially in areas lacking detailed traffic data.    ### 4. **Grizzly Bear Movement Analysis**  - The study utilized GPS collar data from grizzly bears to evaluate the influence of the different road use classifications on bear movement patterns and habitat selection.  - The authors analyzed how movement rates and habitat selection varied during day and night relative to road classifications, with an emphasis on understanding nocturnal behavior near high-use roads.    ### Conclusion  The study concludes that both the network-based and image-based methods provide valuable, cost-effective alternatives for characterizing road use in wildlife habitats, particularly where traffic data is scarce.

Automatic Parameter Optimization for Support Vector Regression for Land and Sea Surface Temperature Estimation from Remote Sensing Data,"Moser, Gabriele and Serpico, Sebastiano B.",2009,16459,"The paper by Gabriele Moser and Sebastiano B. Serpico presents an approach for the automatic optimization of parameters used in Support Vector Regression (SVR) for estimating land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite data. Here are the key methods discussed in the paper, particularly focusing on how societal benefits of satellite or Earth Observation data are estimated or quantified:    ### Methodology Overview  1. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:     - The authors use SVR, a supervised learning technique, to establish a relationship between satellite-derived features (e.g., brightness temperature) and in situ measurements of LST and SST. SVR is chosen for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships through kernel functions.    2. **Parameter Optimization**:     - Traditional SVR requires careful selection of parameters (e.g., trade-off parameter \( C \), error tolerance \( \epsilon \), and kernel parameters). The authors propose an innovative method for automatic parameter optimization to ensure that the regression model achieves minimal estimation errors without manual intervention.    3. **Span-Bound Functional**:     - The core of their optimization technique revolves around minimizing the ""span-bound"" functional, which serves as an upper bound on the regression error. This functional is shown to correlate strongly with actual regression errors on test sets, making it a suitable target for optimization.    4. **Powellâ€™s Method for Minimization**:     - Powellâ€™s method is employed to minimize the span-bound functional. This method is advantageous as it does not require gradient information, making it suitable for handling nondifferentiable functions, which is relevant to the span-bound.    5. **Experimental Validation**:     - The proposed method is validated on three real datasets, comparing its performance against traditional grid search methods for parameter tuning. The experiments involved estimating LST from AVHRR data and SST from buoy data, with results showing that the automatic method yields comparable accuracy while significantly reducing computational time.    ### Estimation of Societal Benefits  - The societal benefits of satellite data, as alluded to in the paper, can be understood through the context in which LST and SST data are used.
