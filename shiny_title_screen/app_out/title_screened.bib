  ABSTRACT = {Purpose: Every community with the potential to organize a festival aims to actualize increased participation to transform the community image and socio-cultural cohesion. Hence, this study aims to investigate the motivational factors influencing festival participation of Eyo and Ojude Oba in southwestern Nigeria, using the push and pull and activity theories as theoretical footing. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data was collected through questionnaire administration on members of the host communities. Geospatial data was collected on the number of buildings through high-resolution satellite imagery and maps sourced from the Cooperative Information Network (COPINE) of the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA). Systematic sampling procedure was adopted to select 3% of the estimated 5231 and 4,934 buildings within the designated zones in Lagos Island and Ijebu Ode, respectively. In this case, 314 and 148 respondents were sampled in Lagos Island and Ijebu-Ode, respectively. Data collected were analyzed using mean index and factor analysis (principal component analysis). Findings: This study revealed that the factors influencing participation of Eyo and Ojude Oba festivals comprise six and three factors, respectively, with varying contributions. Eyo festival explained 75.34% variance with varying factors extracted which are psychosocial (22.9%), proximity/mobility (9.93%), facility (13.41%), environmental/cultural (12.2%), demographic (10.65%) and health/safety factors (6.25%). While factors influencing Ojude-Oba festival comprises of sociocultural/psychological (35.44%), facilities/mobility (28.00%) and demographic factor (8.51%), thereby explaining 71.95% variation of factors influencing its participation. The study therefore, prove policy response in enhancing the destination receptors based on the influencing factors to promote positive words of mouth and encourage visitors’ intention to revisit. Originality/value: This study focused on two distinguished festivals with internal homogenous and external heterogeneous features (Eyo and Ojude-Oba festivals). Ojude-Oba is an annual festival of class, whereas Eyo is non-annual traditional festival. Both festivals are mega, with similarities in the activities engaged in by the visitors and members of the communities, inform of colorful display of costumes, dances, chanting of songs and group parades among other activities. © 2023, International Tourism Studies Association.},

  ABSTRACT = {Natural crises manifested in floods and droughts are counted as the most severe impacts of climate change on the world. In this regard, flash floods are the most common cause of economic and human losses worldwide. However, the present study focuses on the flash flood-affected area between Zafaarana and Ras Ghareb coastal roads. Sentinel-2 satellite images of recent years before and after the flash flood have been utilized to detect flooded areas and investigate their environmental conditions. Initially, the captured images were pre-processed to compare the environmental conditions before and after flooding. Consequently, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was utilized to classify water bodies in different bands. Finally, an image difference feature (IDF) model with computation of per-pixel features, merging image disparities, and calculation of the characteristic value phases was constructed to extract various image differences after photo processing, that's to identify flooded pixels in the images and assess their performance in the proposed model. The proposed IDF model was compared by rating each model on the same test set, while changing the training set. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm shows an accuracy of 98.9%, which is a better flood image processing technique than other methods. The insights from this research will help decision makers in structuring their rescue strategies and evacuation maps during and before the environmental crisis. © 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science},

  ABSTRACT = {Electricity access is an important issue and building capacity for it requires drawing relevant lessons from past policies. In this study, we evaluate the effect of the Jyotigram Yojana, or the lighted village scheme, a supply-side policy intervention during 2003–08 to increase rural electricity access in Gujarat, India. We hypothesize that policy implementation is associated with increased electricity consumption. To test this hypothesis, we exploit variation in the timing of policy implementation at the village level, and use a generalized difference-in-differences strategy for identification. Further, we use night-time luminosity measured through remote sensing as a proxy for electricity consumption, and control for weather, village fixed effect, year fixed effect, and village or administrative block specific time trend. We find that while the overall effect of the policy on night-time luminosity was not statistically significant, the effects were likely heterogeneous, with the night-time luminosity increasing in some districts after policy implementation and decreasing in others. We conclude that the policy might have had a re-distributive effect on electricity access or consumption and recommend adopting a more holistic approach – incorporating both supply-side and demand-side measures – to increase electricity access. © 2023 The Authors},
