A Generic Self-Supervised Learning (Ssl) Framework For Representation Learning From Spectral-Spatial Features Of Unlabeled Remote Sensing Imagery,"Zhang, Xin and Han, Liangxiu",2023,"Remote sensing data has been widely used for various Earth Observation (EO) missions such as land use and cover classification, weather forecasting, agricultural management, and environmental monitoring. Most existing remote-sensing-data-based models are based on supervised learning that requires large and representative human-labeled data for model training, which is costly and time-consuming. The recent introduction of self-supervised learning (SSL) enables models to learn a representation from orders of magnitude more unlabeled data. The success of SSL is heavily dependent on a pre-designed pretext task, which introduces an inductive bias into the model from a large amount of unlabeled data. Since remote sensing imagery has rich spectral information beyond the standard RGB color space, it may not be straightforward to extend to the multi/hyperspectral domain the pretext tasks established in computer vision based on RGB images. To address this challenge, this work proposed a generic self-supervised learning framework based on remote sensing data at both the object and pixel levels. The method contains two novel pretext tasks, one for object-based and one for pixel-based remote sensing data analysis methods. One pretext task is used to reconstruct the spectral profile from the masked data, which can be used to extract a representation of pixel information and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with pixel-based analysis. The second pretext task is used to identify objects from multiple views of the same object in multispectral data, which can be used to extract a representation and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with object-based analysis. The results of two typical downstream task evaluation exercises (a multilabel land cover classification task on Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets and a ground soil parameter retrieval task on hyperspectral datasets) demonstrate that the proposed SSL method learns a target representation that covers both spatial and spectral information from massive unlabeled data. A comparison with currently available SSL methods shows that the proposed method, which emphasizes both spectral and spatial features, outperforms existing SSL methods on multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing datasets. We believe that this approach has the potential to be effective in a wider range of remote sensing applications and we will explore its utility in more remote sensing applications in the future.",zhang_genericsupervisedlearningssl_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Space As An Enabler In The Maritime Sector,"Papadimitriou, Angeliki and Pangalos, Katherine and Duvaux-Bechon, Isabelle and Giannopapa, Christina",2019,"Space can be used as a tool for business decision and policy makers. The maritime sector is rapidly evolving as far as business and industrial activities are concerned. Space can assist in transforming this sector through satellite navigation and positioning, telecommunications and integrated applications as well as earth observation. Additionally, space can be used as a tool in developing, implementing maritime affairs. This paper focuses on the role of space in maritime policy. Space technologies have been serving the maritime community for over fourty years. Satellite technology is becoming increasingly important for a wide range of maritime activities through enhanced navigation accuracy, marine environmental monitoring and maritime surveillance. For this reason, agreements between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), have been signed in 2007 and 2010, strengthening the framework for cooperation between the two agencies for the use of space-based systems in support of maritime activities. The first part of the paper summarizes European maritime related policy areas where space assets can contribute to achieve their objectives. The second part of the paper addresses how ESA's initiatives and programs could contribute and support the maritime sector in Europe. The main purpose of this paper is to come up with conclusions on whether and how the use of space assets, technology and applications, can contribute in achieving the maritime policy objectives for the benefit of Europe.",papadimitriou_spaceenablermaritimesector_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Structural Health Monitoring Of Oil And Gas Pipelines Through Internet Of Remote Things,"Shyamala Kumari, C. and Nivedhitha, G. and Meena, K.",2020,"Internet of Things paradigm via satellite communication acts as a great aspect inenterprising the perception for an universe which is coupled genuinely. Satellites provide wall to wall broadcasting and authenticity in all the localities including remote locations that can’t be accessed through terrestrial access networks. This indicates there is kinship in most of the secluded areas such that they can work in the atmosphere and in the sea premises, permitting their applications beyond distinct barter sections. The objective of this paper is to use IoT through satellite articulation for structural monitoring of Oil and gas pipe lines. This prototypefetches knowledge from sensors or RFID and fires management messages to actuators. In several applications, sensors and actuators are disseminated over a wide space or they may be deployed in remote areas.Satellite communication plays a distinctive role in Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) by intercommunicating among their satellite systems and the backing of IPv6 over satellite, sensors and actuators.The proposed structural health monitoring system combines satellite communication automationsandIoT to render better results than the existing techniques. In this paper, Oil and Gas pipeline monitoring will be analyzed through satellite and IoT paradigms.

Valuation Of Ecotourism Resources Using A Contingent Valuation Method: The Case Of The Korean Dmz,"Lee, Choong-Ki and Mjelde, James W.",2007,"The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has been untouched by human interference for the last half century, has become a sanctuary for rare species of animals and plants. Conflicts concerning development between communities and environmentalists are arising. Estimates of the preservation value of the DMZ are necessary for society to properly address these issues. Such estimates will help policy-makers address issues of conservation management, sustainable development, and public financial support. Given this situation, the objectives are two-fold. The primary objective of this study is to obtain estimates of the preservation value of the Korean DMZ and Civilian Control Zone (CCZ). A secondary objective is to examine the potential for hypothetic bias in respondents' answers in a contingent valuation method framework. Findings suggest hypothetical bias is present in the survey. including a real payment vehicle may reduce hypothetical bias in eliciting willingness-to-pay (WTP). Best estimates are the mean WTP is US \$ 16.74 per capita. Aggregate preservation value lies between US \$264 and \$602 million. These findings indicate that conservation of the DMZ and CCZ is not only important for moral and ecological reasons, but the DMZ and CCZ are of considerable economic value to South Koreans. Any development unfriendly to the environment will degrade the quality of the ecosystem of the DMZ, as well as, decrease its economic value. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Review Of State-Of-The-Art Decision Support Systems (Dsss) For Prevention And Suppression Of Forest Fires,"Sakellariou, Stavros and Tampekis, Stergios and Samara, Fani and Sfougaris, Athanassios and Christopoulou, Olga",2017,"Forest ecosystems are our priceless natural resource and are a key component of the global carbon budget. Forest fires can be a hazard to the viability and sustainable management of forests with consequences for natural and cultural environments, economies, and the life quality of local and regional populations. Thus, the selection of strategies to manage forest fires, while considering both functional and economic efficiency, is of primary importance. The use of decision support systems (DSSs) by managers of forest fires has rapidly increased. This has strengthened capacity to prevent and suppress forest fires while protecting human lives and property. DSSs are a tool that can benefit incident management and decision making and policy, especially for emergencies such as natural disasters. In this study we reviewed state-of-the-art DSSs that use: database management systems and mathematical/economic algorithms for spatial optimization of firefighting forces; forest fire simulators and satellite technology for immediate detection and prediction of evolution of forest fires; GIS platforms that incorporate several tools to manipulate, process and analyze geographic data and develop strategic and operational plans.",sakellariou_reviewartdecisionsupport_2017,FALSE,class_round2,NA
A Review Of Property Rights In Outer Space From A Land Management Perspective,"de Vries, Walter Timo and Hugentobler, Urs",2021,"Purpose - In light of the discussions on outer space property management, this conceptual review paper aims to discuss and evaluate if, when and under which conditions certain land management and property right frameworks can apply to allocate and/or restrict property rights in outer space. Design/methodology/approach - This paper applies a pragmatic review approach which seeks to better understand if and how the basic tenets of the land management frameworks could better shape and revise the challenges in outer space regulations. Findings - Despite the fact that regulatory guidelines on outer space rights are existing, the analysis shows that these lack a number of practical tools and measures aiming at intervening if stakeholders do not follow the rules. With the use of land management frameworks, it is possible to derive policy options for making the outer space management more practical and action-oriented, in particular for the removal of space debris. These include amongst others more attention for formulating global public restrictions in outer space, incorporating regulatory guidelines for accessing open space regimes, addressing responsiveness and robustness in adherence and compliance to regulations Research limitations/implications - Given the conceptual and discursive character of the paper, there are no specific empirical data, yet several recommendations for further research include expanding the boundary work between the land management and regulatory outer space domain. Practical implications - The insights derived from land management and real estate related property theories could potentially provide new starting points for (re)formulating the regulatory framework for outer space property discourses. Social implications - Interpreting the outer space regulations from known and practiced land management perspective helps to bridge the policy-society knowledge and necessity gap on outer space activities. Originality/value - The specific land management perspective and discursive analysis on outer space debris provide new options for devising and extending regulatory guidelines for assigning responsibilities on outer space debris and debris rights, restrictions and responsibilities.",devries_reviewpropertyrightsouter_2021,FALSE,class_round2,NA
"A Framework For Assessing Readiness Of Satellite Assembly, Integration And Testing Organization","Lima, Isomar and Sorice Genaro, Andreia Fatima and Loureiro, Geilson and Mattiello-Francisco, Fatima and Robledo Asencio, Jenny Carolina",2022,"Purpose: The success of satellites in orbit depends on the quality of the engineering processes adopted in the development cycle of the mission. The facilities and processes provided by Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) laboratories support the verification and validation of satellite' systems regarding their capacities to operating into space environmental conditions. Choose an ideal AIT organization to a particular satellite project requires knowing their processes and services provided. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the services for satellite AIT provided by an AIT organization. The framework, named PRONT-AIT, allows to assess the organization's readiness based on both process areas and criteria of adherence to the stakeholder's requirements. Methodology/approach - Inspired by the CMMI model, the framework was structured in process areas, covering management and technical processes of the AIT organization, that supports 5 levels of readiness. Each readiness level expresses the organization maturity in terms of the processes and practices established to provide the services required by a particular space project. Findings - The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its use to assess the readiness of a particular AIT organization on meeting the specific requirements of two types of satellites: remote sensing and CubeSat satellites. The results reveal that the example organization readiness fully reached level 2 (Manageable Readiness) for remote sensing satellite and partially reached level 2 for CubeSat satellite. Originality/value - The framework has a good value to satellite project managers because it supports them on evaluating an AIT organization prior to contracting its services. Higher readiness level revealed by PRONT-AIT gives to the satellite project manager more confidence on the AIT organization capacities. Thus, an AIT organization is not chosen solely on the basis of the facilities it offers and the cost of the services but also on the level of readiness revealed by this framework.",lima_frameworkassessingreadinesssatellite_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Improved Classification Of Conservation Tillage Adoption Using High Temporal And Synthetic Satellite Imagery,"Watts, Jennifer D. and Powell, Scott L. and Lawrence, Rick L. and Hilker, Thomas",2011,"Conservation tillage management has been advocated for carbon sequestration and soil quality preservation purposes. Past satellite image analyses have had difficulty in differentiating between no-till (NT) and minimal tillage (MT) conservation classes due to similarities in surface residues, and may have been restricted by the availability of cloud-free satellite imagery. This study hypothesized that the inclusion of high temporal data into the classification process would increase conservation tillage accuracy due to the added likelihood of capturing spectral changes in MT fields following a tillage disturbance. Classification accuracies were evaluated for Random Forest models based on 250-m and 500-m MODIS, 30-m Landsat, and 30-m synthetic reflectance values. Synthetic (30-m) data derived from the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) were evaluated because high frequency Landsat image sets are often unavailable within a cropping season due to cloud issues. Classification results from a five-date Landsat model were substantially better than those reported by previous classification tillage studies, with 94\% total and >= 88\% class producer's accuracies. Landsat-derived models based on individual image scenes (May through August) yielded poor MT classifications, but a monthly increase in accuracy illustrated the importance of temporal sampling for capturing regional tillage disturbance signatures. MODIS-based model accuracies (90\% total; >= 82\% class) were lower than in the five-date Landsat model, but were higher than previous image-based and survey-based tillage classification results. Almost all the STARFM prediction-based models had classification accuracies higher than, or comparable to, the MODIS-based results (>90\% total; >= 84\% class) but the resulting model accuracies were dependent on the MODIS/Landsat base pairs used to generate the STARFM predictions. Also evident within the STARFM prediction-based models was the ability for high frequency data series to compensate for degraded synthetic spectral values when classifying field-based tillage. The decision to use MODIS or STARFM-based data within conservation tillage analysis is likely situation dependent. A MODIS-based approach requires little data processing and could be more efficient for large-area mapping; however a STARFM-based analysis might be more appropriate in mixed-pixel situations that could potentially compromise classification accuracy.

Incorporating A Constrained Optimization Algorithm Into Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture Methodology,"Morgenthaler, GW and Khatib, N and Kim, B",2003,"For two decades now, the use of Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture to improve farm yields while reducing the use of polluting chemicals and the limited water supply has been a major goal. With world population growing exponentially, arable land being consumed by urbanization, and an unfavorable farm economy, farm efficiency must increase to meet future food requirements and to make farming a sustainable, profitable occupation. ""Precision Agriculture"" refers to a farming methodology that applies nutrients and moisture only where and when they are needed in the field. The real goal is to increase farm profitability by identifying the additional treatments of chemicals and water that increase revenues more than they increase costs and do no exceed pollution standards (constrained optimization). Even though the economic and environmental benefits appear to be great, Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture has not grown as rapidly as early advocates envisioned. Technology for a successful Remote Sensing/Precision Agriculture system is now in place, but other needed factors have been missing. Commercial satellite systems can now image the Earth (multi-spectrally) with a resolution as fine as 2.5 in. Precision variable dispensing systems using GPS are now available and affordable. Crop models that predict yield as a function of soil, chemical, and irrigation parameter levels have been developed. Personal computers and internet access are now in place in most farm homes and can provide a mechanism for periodically disseminating advice on what quantities of water and chemicals are needed in specific regions of each field. Several processes have been selected that fuse the disparate sources of information on the current and historic states of the crop and soil, and the remaining resource levels available, with the critical decisions that farmers are required to make. These are done in a way that is easy for the farmer to understand and profitable to implement. A ""Constrained Optimization Algorithm"" to further improve these processes will be presented. The objective function of the model will be used to maximize the farmer's profit via increasing yields while decreasing environmental damage and decreasing applications of costly treatments. This model will incorporate information from Remote Sensing, from in-situ weather sources, from soil history, and from tacit farmer knowledge of the relative productivity of selected ""Management Zones"" of the farm, to provide incremental advice throughout the growing season on the optimum usage of water and chemical treatments.

How Much Will Precision Nitrogen Management Pay Off? An Evaluation Based On Simulating Thousands Of Corn Fields Over The Us Corn-Belt,"Jin, Zhenong and Archontoulis, Sotirios V. and Lobell, David B.",2019,"Variable rate technology nitrogen (VRT-N) application, a precision management approach to synchronize N input with crop demand, has received increasing attention in recent years. Although existing field trials have suggested the agronomic and environmental feasibility of VRT-N adoption, the potential benefits at large scale remain a puzzle to farmers and policy-makers, partly because no tools are available for aggregated assessments. In this study, we develop a scalable framework to support large-scale precision N management by fully leveraging recent advances in crop modeling, remote sensing, and publicly available weather and soil datasets. Using this new framework, we investigated the agronomic and environmental benefits of VRT-N application for corn compared to Uniform-N application across 9 states and ca. 2600 fields in the US Corn-Belt. Our results showed that, given an Extension-reported service fee of 6.2 USD\$/ha for applying N at variable rate, the multi-year averaged mean agronomic margin of adopting VRT-N were only 6.7 \$/ha more than Uniform-N. Accounting for the environmental cost of N leaching and N2O emission increased the mean benefit of VRT-N to 26.4 \$/ha. Agronomic benefits in general increased with the yield heterogeneity in field, and the mean value was driven by a small fraction of very heterogenous fields. Additional benefits from managing the temporal variability were 29.5 \$/ha and 51.6 \$/ha on average from an agronomic and environmental perspective, respectively. Environmental benefits are considerable but are unlikely to drive farmer adoption in the absence of new incentives for precision technologies. Although various uncertainties remain to be reduced, the current framework opens opportunity to ingest future improvements in models and geospatial datasets and could serve as a foundation for other precision management practices such as seeding rate and irrigation.",jin_precisionnitrogenmanagementpay_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Qoe-Driven Social Aware Caching Placement For Terrestrial-Satellite Networks,"Zhong, Guiting and Yan, Jian and Kuang, Linling",2018,"In remote terrestrial-satellite networks, caching is a very promising technique to alleviate the burden of space cloudlet (e.g., cache-enabled satellite user terminal) and to improve subscribers' quality of experience (QoE) in terms of buffering delay and achievable video streaming rate. In this paper, we studied a QoE-driven caching placement optimization problem for video streaming that takes into account the required video streaming rate and the social relationship among users. Social ties between users are used to designate a set of helpers with caching capability, which can cache popular files pro-actively when the cloudlet is idle. We model the utility function of QoE as a logarithmic function. Then, the caching placement problem is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the user's average QoE subject to the storage capacity constraints of the helpers and the cloudlets. Furthermore, we reformulate the problem into a monotone submodular optimization problem with a partition matroid constraint, and an efficient greedy algorithm with 1 - 1/e approximation ratio is proposed to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed caching placement approach significantly outperforms the traditional approaches in terms of QoE, while yields about the same delay and hit ratio performance compare to the delay-minimized scheme.",zhong_qoedrivensocialaware_2018,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Satellite Data Applications For Sustainable Energy Transitions,NA,NA,"Transitioning to a sustainable energy system poses a massive challenge to communities, nations, and the global economy in the next decade and beyond. A growing portfolio of satellite data products is available to support this transition. Satellite data complement other information sources to provide a more complete picture of the global energy system, often with continuous spatial coverage over targeted areas or even the entire Earth. We find that satellite data are already being applied to a wide range of energy issues with varying information needs, from planning and operation of renewable energy projects, to tracking changing patterns in energy access and use, to monitoring environmental impacts and verifying the effectiveness of emissions reduction efforts. While satellite data could play a larger role throughout the policy and planning lifecycle, there are technical, social, and structural barriers to their increased use. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for satellite data applications to energy and recommendations for research to maximize the value of satellite data for sustainable energy transitions.

Utility Of Biological Sensor Tags In Animal Conservation,"Wilson, A. D. M. and Wikelski, M. and Wilson, R. P. and Cooke, S. J.",2015,"Electronic tags (both biotelemetry and biologging platforms) have informed conservation and resource management policy and practice by providing vital information on the spatial ecology of animals and their environments. However, the extent of the contribution of biological sensors (within electronic tags) that measure an animal's state (e.g., heart rate, body temperature, and details of locomotion and energetics) is less clear. A literature review revealed that, despite a growing number of commercially available state sensor tags and enormous application potential for such devices in animal biology, there are relatively few examples of their application to conservation. Existing applications fell under 4 main themes: quantifying disturbance (e.g., ecotourism, vehicular and aircraft traffic), examining the effects of environmental change (e.g., climate change), understanding the consequences of habitat use and selection, and estimating energy expenditure. We also identified several other ways in which sensor tags could benefit conservation, such as determining the potential efficacy of management interventions. With increasing sensor diversity of commercially available platforms, less invasive attachment techniques, smaller device sizes, and more researchers embracing such technology, we suggest that biological sensor tags be considered a part of the necessary toolbox for conservation. This approach can measure (in real time) the state of free-ranging animals and thus provide managers with objective, timely, relevant, and accurate data to inform policy and decision making. © 2015 Society for Conservation Biology.",wilson_utilitybiologicalsensortags_2015,FALSE,class_round2,NA

While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products.

Remote Sensing Of Croplands,"Friedl, M. A.",2017,"Mapping and monitoring of croplands is one of the most important and widely applied uses of remote sensing. Indeed, much of the technological and methodological basis for contemporary land remote sensing was initially developed to support the need for improved monitoring of croplands at local, regional, and global scales. Early field experiments, including LACIE and AgRISTARS, provided the initial proof-of-concept and methodological foundation, demonstrating the ability and utility of remote sensing for mapping a wide array of cropland attributes including crop type, crop health, crop phenology, and soil and canopy attributes. As instrumentation, computing power, and methods of analysis have improved over the last several decades, the depth, breadth, and sophistication of remote-sensing applications in both basic research and management of croplands have expanded rapidly. This chapter provides an overview of remote sensing applied to croplands, along with a survey of key literature and important applications. We provide a brief overview of the history and core applications for which remote sensing has been used in croplands, followed by a summary of key areas where remote sensing is currently most widely exploited in both basic and applied research in croplands. Key topics include remote sensing of cropland extent and type at local, regional, and global scales, biophysical remote sensing of croplands, and important specialized applications. Key thematic topics related to biophysical remote sensing of croplands include spectral properties of soils and crop canopies, spectral vegetation indices, mapping crop yields, and monitoring crop phenology.

Populating Digital Earth: Improving Access To Chinese Remote Sensing Data For Terrestrial Applications,"Li, Mengxue and Townshend, John R.",2014,"Global change has a significant impact on the lives of humankind. Earth observation can help to better understand our earth and cope with global change. With the availability of more reliable environmental data sets, digital earth is becoming a popular way to monitor the Earth and provide information to researchers and decision makers on environment protection, disaster mitigation, and social benefits. Therefore, accessing data with lowering costs is essential for digital earth. Nevertheless, there are big challenges in ensuring the feasibility of access to Chinese remote sensing data.

Blockchain For Environmental Governance: Can Smart Contracts Reinforce Payments For Ecosystem Services In Namibia?,"Oberhauser, Daniel",2019,"The Global South harbors some of the planet's most precious natural resources and is hence key in addressing the pressing environmental challenges of the Anthropocene. Here, payments for ecosystem services (PES) have recently gained importance as a means of environmental governance, increasingly complementing conventional command-and-control approaches. For instance, climate change is now mitigated through carbon offset payments and biodiversity loss is addressed through wildlife conservation performance payments. However, such payment schemes in the Global South face numerous challenges as identified by a large body of literature. This paper investigates if blockchain technology can help address some of the challenges by reinforcing PES programs with tamper-proof blockchain smart contracts. To this end, the paper presents a proof-of-concept of a blockchain-based wildlife conservation performance payments scheme in Namibia: the habitat integrity of an elephant corridor is assessed by remote sensing algorithms, which in turn trigger fictitious blockchain smart contract payments to surrounding communities. The application allows to practically discuss the potential of blockchain technology regarding three key aspects of PES: (i) effectiveness (conditionality) of environmental monitoring (ii) efficiency and transaction costs, as well as (iii) equity and benefit distribution. The case presented here is an example for linking the digital Blockchain sphere to practical challenges of natural resource management in the physical world.

Revealing Preferences For Urban Biodiversity As An Environmental Good,"Ratzke, Leonie",2023,"Biodiversity is essential for human well-being, but little is known about urban dwellers' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban biodiversity. Since a large share of the global population concentrates in cities, urban areas are a critical space where humans and nature interact and biodiversity-related preferences are formed. This study investigates urban dwellers' WTP for biodiversity using a revealed-preference approach on a real estate dataset of approximately 140,000 unique entries of rental and sales transactions of apartments. Three biodiversity indicators were used to investigate heterogeneous preferences for biodiversity as an environmental good. The findings indicate that WTP for biodiversity is positive and economically significant. This implies that urban biodiversity conservation and enhancement can result in co-benefits for the local urban population. Moreover, this study identifies a satellite-based biodiversity indicator as a potential alternative to conventional species richness indicators.

P.",2000,"The remote sensing applications are growing very rapidly with the availability of high-resolution data from the state of the art satellites like IRS-1C/1D/P4. The advancement in computer hardware and software in the area of remote sensing also enhance the growth of remote sensing applications. 1RS-1C/1D/P4 provides data with the resolution of 5.6m in panchromatic mode giving more information of the ground area covered. The remote sensing satellites with high-resolution sensors and wide coverage capabilities will provide the data with better resolution, coverage and revisit to meet the growing application needs. Many applications like crop acreage and yield estimation, draught monitoring and assessment, flood mapping, waste land mapping, mineral prospectus, forest resource survey etc. have become an integral part of the resources management system in the developing countries. These resource management systems need the data to be transferred in real time or near real time for processing. The transfer of data in real time or near real time calls for advanced data delivery techniques to deliver the data as quickly as possible. Processing of remote sensing data can be performed even on low cost personal computers, which in turn further increases the remote sensing applications enabling by setting up the processing centers even at grass root level i.e., at district, taluk or village level. Setting up of processing centers at grass root level demands for quick, cost effective and efficient data delivery mechanism to transfer remote sensing data with or without value added services.

Environmental Monitoring And Landscape Design Of Green City Based On Remote Sensing Image And Improved Neural Network,"Gu, Haiyan and Wei, Yinan",2021,"In some developed countries in Europe, cities are developing very rapidly, but the rapid development of these countries also has to go through the following stages, which are the three essential development processes of urbanization, counter-urbanization and re-urbanization.

But with the development of urbanization, these areas are also facing a very troublesome problem, that is, the balance between the development of the city and the environmental ecosystem.

This article will focus on the area around the Yangtze River Delta, and investigate the spatial patterns of urban environmental ecosystems by comparing this area with cities in developed regions such as Western Europe and North America. Under the conditions of different regions and different degrees of urbanization, the comprehensive situation of environmental elements in the city is investigated, and the environmental impact effects and the causes, effects and effects of environmental changes are more accurately studied. Combine the BP network model related to the nervous system in the experiment, and continuously optimize the model during the experiment. The experimental data selects environmental difference reports displayed in different years and different seasons to predict the air pollution value of a certain city. The reason why we use this method is that this model can improve the accuracy of statistical data and greatly simplify the unnecessary and complicated steps in the research process, and it can also reduce the error problems generated in the operation of the BP system, such as when we When entering a piece of data, the data obtained is often very different from the target data. Therefore, we will use the ant colony algorithm to solve the above problems, and add stereo and 3D technologies, which can monitor experiments in real time, greatly improve the speed of the experiment, and the 3D stereo technology can make the results more perceptual to meet the needs of the experiment.

"Modeling On Comparison Of Ecosystem Services Concepts, Tools, Methods And Their Ecological-Economic Implications: A Review","Meraj, Gowhar and Singh, Suraj Kumar and Kanga, Shruti and Islam, Md. Nazrul",2022,"The paper aims to identify the gaps in the assessment and modeling of ecosystem services to help researchers, resource managers, and decision-makers develop a holistic understanding of the ecosystem service assessments' foundations. This review proposes that to efficiently assess the ecosystem services, methodologies that are region-specific and standardized in the terminologies are useful in determining the valuation component in the ecosystem services assessments' goal to explain trade-offs between development and conservation priorities for implementation of conservation policies. Ecosystem service assessments are critical for the sustainable future of Earth. Numerous scholarly studies have been conducted in the field of ecosystem services (ES) that have laid down the foundation of their valuation, mapping, and quantification. We reviewed 103 peer-reviewed publications using the SCOPUS database, perhaps the most extensive database of peer-reviewed research literature as well WoS, PUBMED, and Google Scholar databases based on certain criteria. Our review revealed that different definitions of the ES concept and the non-standardization of the economic concepts for assigning market values to the ecosystem services had shown conflicting results. Further, we also found that ES assessment methodologies depend upon the evaluation purpose and vary from qualitative approaches to modeling and integrated ones. ES assessment has considerable implications in understanding the earth's surface processes and the pursuing benefits in the form of balanced trade-offs between sustainability and development. To attain sustainable development goals, we propose shifting towards a green economy to balance the trade-off between conservation and development.",meraj_modelingcomparisonecosystemservices_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA
21st Century Engineering For On-Farm Food-Energy-Water Systems,"Wolfe, Mary Leigh and Richard, Tom L.",2017,"For more than a century, agricultural mechanization encouraged larger fields with more uniform management and increasing impacts on the environment. The trajectory of agricultural technology is now at an inflection point where information technology, including remote sensing, simulation modeling, decision support systems, precision agricultural technologies, and automation, enables site-specific management at small spatial scales with the potential to simultaneously enhance food and bioenergy production, farm profitability, and environmental quality. To achieve these economic and environmental benefits of transforming agricultural landscape design and cropping system management, agricultural producers need increased access to both enabling technologies and engineering expertise. Government policies and programs are also needed to incentivize changes in cropping systems that promote soil health and improve water quality, for example, payments to cover much or all of the cost of transitioning land use to perennials and nutrient trading programs in which agricultural producers contract with industrial and municipal wastewater generators to reduce nutrient loading at a reduced cost.

Predictive Mapping Of Floristic Site Conditions Across Mire Habitats: Evaluating Data Requirements,"Ecker, K. and Kuechler, M. and Feldmeyer-Christe, E. and Graf, U. and Waser, L. T.",2008,"As conservation of sensitive habitats is a high priority issue in European environmental policy, there is considerable interest in mapping and monitoring specific habitats of high conservation value. In this study, we discuss the potential of the Swiss mire monitoring program to monitor small area habitats in sufficient detail. The monitoring scheme combines nationwide probability sampling and predictive habitat mapping based on a field data sample. Thus, it is designed to identify spatio-temporal changes at the stand level and to derive hard statistics for the sub-national level. For feasibility reasons, the thematic focus is on semi-quantitative mean indicator values derived from vegetation records. These measures provide robust estimates of essential floristic site conditions. Regression models based on CIR aerial photographs are applied to continuously map respective measures across the sample mires. The present study explores the required investment of data for model-based mapping. Exemplary mapping results are presented and validated within a reference mire. Repeated tests show that about one hundred field records are needed to guarantee optimal prediction accuracy and reliable error estimates for all target variables. The corresponding 95\% error quantiles in a test data set are below 0.7. To evaluate the benefit of high resolution orthophotos (30 cm resolution), the model prediction is compared with results obtained from coarsened images. Although the original CIR images produce the best model performance, the models based on resolutions comparable to modern satellite images still show considerable potential to assess larger areas where the use of digital aerial photographs is limited. The resulting spatially-explicit in-depth information can resolve the common thematic limitations of stand-alone remote sensing applications in conservation monitoring. As the method is applicable consistently across a range of habitat types, we argue that it has the potential to become a standard method for operational monitoring of priority habitats in European nature conservation.",ecker_predictivemappingfloristicsite_2008,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Application Of Water Extraction Methods From Landsat Imagery For Different Environmental Background,"Qiao, D. and Zheng, J. and Lu, H. and Deng, L.",2021,"Rapid and accurate extraction of water information from satellite images has been a hot issue in remote sensing applications and has important application value in water resources management, water environment monitoring, and disaster emergency management. Although there are a variety of water extraction methods for Landsat series images, the same method can generate different extraction results in different environmental backgrounds due to the influence of environmental background factors such as geographic location, topography, and water body shape. In order to study the applicability of water extraction methods under different environmental conditions, this article focuses on two typical environments: urban areas around Huairou County, Beijing with severe human influence and strong contrast between light and dark images, and non-urban areas around Beijing Miyun Reservoir with obvious topography and small water bodies. Water index method and classification method are tested based on water extraction and accuracy verification using Landsat 5 (2009) and Landsat 8 (2019) satellite images which have slightly different band settings. The water index method includes Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), while the classification method includes Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML). Our results show that SVM has the highest accuracy with overall accuracy > 97% in the urban areas. By selecting training samples reasonably and delicately, the extracted spatial pattern of water results is close to the real water distribution. It applies well to multiple-scale and complex water bodies. In the non-urban areas, SVM can completely identify the fine rivers which are usually difficult to be identified by other methods. It is also suitable for judging the shape and flow direction of small rivers between mountains, though the shadow of the mountain could be easily mixed together by mistake. Due to the difference in sensor band settings, SVM has a better performance in Landsat 8 data. MNDWI can effectively reduce the error extraction rate, resulting in an overall accuracy > 95%. It is convenient to determine the threshold value of MNDWI through visual interpretation, which is more suitable for the rapid extraction of water in the non-urban areas. The environmental background may show different effects on water body extraction. The water index method and classification method have different advantages in different environmental backgrounds. The most suitable method should vary according to the actual situation. In scenarios with higher requirements for efficiency, we should focus on the use of index method, and design a new index which can make full use of the band information. In application scenarios where higher extraction accuracy is required, classification methods can improve the accuracy of water extraction. Moreover, we cannot ignore the differences between interpretation methods in data sources from different sensors. This study provides a reference for the selection of water extraction methods under different environmental backgrounds. © 2021, Science Press.

Using Viirs/Npp And Modis/Aqua Data To Provide A Continuous Record Of Suspended Particulate Matter In A Highly Turbid Inland Lake,"Cao, Zhigang and Duan, Hongtao and Shen, Ming and Ma, Ronghua and Xue, Kun and Liu, Dong and Xiao, Qitao",2018,"Inland lakes are generally an important source of drinking water, and information on their water quality needs to be obtained in real time. To date, Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have played a critical, effective and long-term role in fulfilling this function. However, the MODIS instruments on board both the Terra and Aqua satellites have operated beyond their designed five-year mission lifespans (Terra was launched in 1999, whereas Aqua was launched in 2002), and these instruments may stop running at any time in the near future. The Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP, which was launched in Oct 2011) is expected to provide a consistent, long-term data record and continue the series of observations initiated by MODIS. To date, few evaluations of the consistency between VIIRS and MODIS have been conducted for turbid inland waters. In this study, we first used synchronous MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data (+/- 1 h) collected during 2012-2015 to evaluate the consistency of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) observations over Lake Hongze (the fourth-largest freshwater lake in China), since accurate remote sensing reflectance (R-rc) values cannot be acquired over turbid inland waters. Second, we used recently developed algorithms based on R-rc in the red band to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data. Finally, we assessed the consistency of the SPM products derived from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP. The results show the following. (1) The differences in Rrc among the green (VIIRS 551 nm and MODIS 555 nm) and red bands (VIIRS 671 nm and MODIS 645 nm) indicate a satisfactory consistency, and the unbiased percentage difference (UPD) is < 12\%. Meanwhile, the results for the near infrared (NIR) band (MODIS 859 nm and VIIRS 862 nm) indicate relatively large differences (UPD = 21.84\%). (2) The satellite-derived SPM products obtained using MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP have a satisfactory degree of consistency (0-150 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.81, UPD < 16\% and 0-80 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.85, UPD < 12\%, respectively). These results demonstrate that VIIRS/NPP can continue to record the SPM observations initiated by MODIS/Aqua for turbid inland waters and establish environmental datasets over long time periods to support water quality management endeavors.",cao_viirsnppmodisaqua_2018,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Remote Sensing In The Information Age,"Abiodun, AA",1998,"A large percentage of the public today perceives the majority of applications of Earth observation data from satellite and aircraft altitudes to be focused on the understanding and management of the renewable and non-renewable resources of the Earth and its environment. Originally conceived as a tool for gathering intelligence information, remote sensing has just fully emerged from its military womb to the public domain. Advances in the technology, a variety of indirect benefits that could be derived from space exploration, commercialization of remote sensing and the drive of the value-added companies - all of these hold promise for new opportunities for many other novel applications of Earth observation data and related information. In the advent of the more advanced, user-friendly, cost effective, and problem solving operations being championed by the private sector, particularly in the industrialized countries, it appears that the commercial future for remote sensing programmes and related information generated in the process is promising. This paper examines how the information age is influencing the metamorphosis of remote sensing technology particularly through international legal instruments and converging technologies. In spite of the progress attained to-date, of international concern is possible radio frequency interference between remote sensing satellite and communication satellite services. There is also a major knowledge gap between the providers of raw remote sensing data and the user community, particularly those interested in the new high-level information. A resolution of these issues will enhance the contributions of remote sensing to the information economy. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Willingness To Pay For Emergency Referral Transport In A Developing Setting: A Geographically Randomized Study,"Bose, S. K. and Bream, K. D. W. and Barg, F. K. and Band, R. A.",2012,"Objectives: The objective was to identify the correlates of willingness to pay for ambulance transports from a rural city to a regional hospital in Guatemala. Methods: An innovative methodology that utilizes a novel randomization technique and satellite imagery was used to select a sample of homes in Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala. The respondents were surveyed at these homes about their willingness to pay for ambulance transport to a regional hospital. A price ladder was used to elicit respondents' willingness to pay for ambulance transport, depending on the level of severity of three types of emergencies: life-threatening emergencies, disability-causing emergencies, and simple emergencies. Simple and multiple linear regression modeling was used to identify the social and economic correlates of respondents' willingness to pay for ambulance transport and to predict demand for ambulance transport at a variety of price levels. Beta coefficients (β) expressed as percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Results: The authors surveyed 134 respondents (response rate = 83.3%). In the multivariable regression models, three variables correlated with willingness to pay: household income, location of residence (rural district vs. urban district), and respondents' education levels. Correlates for ambulance transport in life-threatening emergencies included greater household daily income (β = 1.32%, 95% CI = 0.63% to 2.56%), rural location of residence (β = -37.3%, 95% CI = -51.1% to -137.5%), and higher educational levels (β = 4.41%, 95% CI = 1.00% to 6.36%). Correlates of willingness to pay in disability-causing emergencies included greater household daily income (β = 1.59%, 95% CI = 0.81% to 3.19%) and rural location of residence (β = -19.4%, 95% CI = -35.7% to -89.4%). Correlates of willingness to pay in simple emergencies included rural location of residence (β = 59.4%, 95% CI = 37.9% to 133.7%) and higher educational levels (β = 7.96%, 95% CI = 1.96% to 11.8%). At all price levels, more individuals were willing to pay for transport for a life-threatening emergency than a disability-causing emergency. Respondents' willingness to pay was more responsive to price changes for transport during disability-causing emergencies than for transport during life-threatening emergencies. Conclusions: The primary correlates of willingness to pay for ambulance transport in Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala, are household income, location of residence (rural district vs. urban district), and respondents' education levels. Furthermore, severity of emergency significantly appears to influence how much individuals are willing to pay for ambulance transport. Willingness-to-pay information may help public health planners in resource-poor settings develop price scales for health services and achieve economically efficient allocations of subsidies for referral ambulance transport. © 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",bose_willingnesspayemergencyreferral_2012,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Wildfire Detection From Multisensor Satellite Imagery Using Deep Semantic Segmentation,"Rashkovetsky, Dmitry and Mauracher, Florian and Langer, Martin and Schmitt, Michael",2021,"Deriving the extent of areas affected by wildfires is critical to fire management, protection of the population, damage assessment, and better understanding of the consequences of fires. In the past two decades, several algorithms utilizing data from Earth observation satellites have been developed to detect fire-affected areas. However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather.",rashkovetsky_wildfiredetectionmultisensorsatellite_2021,FALSE,class_round2,NA

UAV remote sensing is considered an important supplement of spaceborne remote sensing and is recently being widely used in the topographical surveying and mapping, precision agriculture, heritage inspection, and emergency rescue, etc. For the traditional mining industry, high-quality and real-time UAV remote sensing data can be obtained at reasonable costs and benefit the mining operations, particularly for numerous small- and medium-scale mining sites where equipments and professional expertise are expensive. However, application scenarios of UAV remote sensing in the mining industry are rarely reported and lack systematic review.

These catastrophic events leave behind a trail of mass destruction with property and human losses amounting to millions. Once a natural disaster hits a region, built-up information is required within a short span of time for disaster management. Nowadays, earth observation satellite imagery serves as a promising source to extract the land use / land cover classes. However, the automatic extraction of urban built-up from remote sensing data is a known challenge in the remote sensing community. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) algorithm has been recognized as an effective algorithm for automatic built-up identification from medium spatial and spectral resolution satellite images. Few researchers have modified this algorithm and proposed new quantitative expressions for the built-up index. In this paper, three built-up index based, unsupervised built-up extraction algorithms have been reviewed and compared. An automated kernel-based probabilistic thresholding algorithm is used to assort the built-up index values, obtained from modified built-up index algorithms, into built-up and non built-up regions for enhancing the efficiency of the built-up detection process. Qualitative assessment of these algorithms involves computation of several parameters including recently developed parameters like allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement, and classical parameters such as error of omission, error of commission and overall accuracy.

Improving Maize Nitrogen Nutrition Index Prediction Using Leaf Fluorescence Sensor Combined With Environmental And Management Variables,"Dong, Rui and Miao, Yuxin and Wang, Xinbing and Chen, Zhichao and Yuan, Fei",2021,"Precision nitrogen (N) management requires rapid and real-time technologies for in-season crop N status diagnosis. The leaf fluorescence sensor Dualex 4 is an effective and promising tool to monitor crop N status. N nutrition index (NNI) is the most widely recognized diagnostic tool for accurate in-season diagnosis of crop N status. However, studies focusing on revealing the relationships between fluorescence sensing indices and NNI and assessing the N status of maize is limited. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the potential of using Dualex 4 indices measured on three differently positioned leaves to estimate NNI across different stages; and (2) determine if the incorporation of environmental (weather) and management information can significantly improve the in-season N status prediction and diagnosis of maize. In 2016 and 2017, a total of four experiments with six N rates and three plant densities were conducted in two fields in Northeast China. Dualex sensor readings - Chlorophyll (Chl) and N balance index (NBI) - were collected from three differently positioned leaves at three growth stages. Some external factors including weather and management conditions were included for in-season N status assessment. The results indicated that the two Dualex indices (Chl and NBI) had strong relationships with NNI at different growth stages, and both stage-specific and across-stage models could estimate NNI based on their values acquired from differently positioned leaves. Nevertheless, the N diagnostic accuracies based on the estimated NNI by the Dualex indices were not satisfactory with Kappa values all lower than 0.40. Likewise, similar results were found in the multiple linear regression (MLR) models only based on the Dualex readings (MLRChl, MLRNBI and MLRChl+NBI). However, when weather and management variables were used together with Dualex sensor measurements in MLR analysis, the prediction of NNI (R2 = 0.81 to 0.85) and the accuracy of maize N status diagnosis (areal agreement = 0.79 and Kappa = 0.52 to 0.55) were significantly improved. More studies are needed to develop strategies combining more environmental and management variables with sensor data to further improve in-season N status diagnosis and N management and/or combine proximal with remote sensing for large-scale crop N nutritional status diagnosis and in-season site-specific N management.",dong_improvingmaizenitrogennutrition_2021,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Remote Sensing Of Crop Residue And Tillage Practices: Present Capabilities And Future Prospects,"Zheng, Baojuan and Campbell, James B. and Serbin, Guy and Galbraith, John M.",2014,"Sustainable agricultural management is essential not only to maintain productivity of current farmlands, but also to conserve natural environments.

Building Information Modelling (Bim) Capabilities In The Design And Planning Of Rural Settlements In China: A Systematic Review,"Cao, Yu and Huang, Liyan and Aziz, Nur Mardhiyah and Kamaruzzaman, Syahrul Nizam",2022,"With rural revitalization being established as the national policy in China, the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural settlements has received widespread attention from the whole society in China. However, due to the over-exploitation of resources and the uneven development between urban and rural in China, the environmental conditions and residential experience in rural settlements in China are still relatively backward. To prompt the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural settlements in China, it is necessary to optimize the planning and design of rural settlements in China. As a multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can significantly contribute to the planning and design of rural settlements in China. To optimize the environmental quality and residential experience in rural settlements in China, this study is developed to perform a systematic literature review of the BIM capabilities in the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. To achieve this aim, the PRISMA protocol was used to perform this systematic review. The review and discussion of this study were conducted between June 2022 and September 2022. In this study, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were adopted as the main databases, and 189 articles were reviewed. Through this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM capabilities have significant advantages in the following aspects of the design and planning of rural settlements in China: Data storage and management; 3D modeling and visualization; Disaster prevention and environmental analysis; Cost estimation and optimization. Furthermore, through the discussion and analysis of research results, it can be concluded that BIM capabilities can perform their benefits in the rural settlements' design and planning through their following characteristics: knowledge management, simulation, and modeling.

A Sustainability-Based Socio-Technical-Environmental Project Selection Algorithm,"Bhattu, B. and Barkdoll, B. D. and Breffle, W. S.",2018,"Including environmental and health impacts in project option selection is important to serve humanity and reduce the adverse effects of development. An algorithm is introduced here that includes lifecycle costs, avoided losses, users’ willingness to pay and value per statistical life (VSL), and both environmental and health impacts. The algorithm is entitled the Socio-Technical-Environmental Project Selection (STEPS) algorithm and incorporates social and health aspects through the willingness to pay, technical aspects through the engineering design, and economic aspects through the lifecycle costs. The algorithm consists of estimating the various quantities needed, such as lifecycle costs, benefits (avoided mortality and infrastructure losses), willingness to pay, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Contaminant Level (EPA-MCL). These values are plotted with the environmental and health impacts on the horizontal axis and the Net Cost (equal to the lifecycle cost minus the benefits) on the vertical axis. The most balanced option is the one that plots closest to the origin of the plot. The new algorithm is demonstrated on project selection for the elimination of riverbank erosion using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) as riprap. RCA uses previously used crushed concrete from demolition as aggregate for any beneficial purpose such as aggregate for new concrete or riprap, as in this case. The disadvantage of RCA, however, is that harmful chemicals leach out when exposed to water. Four options were considered, namely (1) do nothing, (2) use RCA as a riverbank erosion countermeasure, (3) use RCA with a leachate treatment system, and (4) use rock riprap instead of RCA. It was found that the proposed STEPS algorithm leads to the selection of Option 3 with RCA riprap and leachate treatment. Selecting by cost alone would have led to Option 2, which also happens to result in a violation of the EPA-MCL for the arsenic leachate. In addition, Option 4 would have been selected without considering RCA or the problem with landfills reaching capacity with the addition of crushed concrete. The STEPS algorithm, therefore, resulted in the most sustainable solution considering both the lifecycle cost and health and environmental impacts. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",bhattu_sustainabilitybasedsociotechnical_2018,FALSE,class_round2,NA
"Remote Sensing From Space—Present And Future Applications In Forestry, Nature Conservation And Landscape Management","Kätsch, C. and Vogt, H.",1999,"Past studies have suggested that sound knowledge about the reflectance characteristics of objects could be of great value in understanding the physical, chemical, and the spatial properties of features on our planet. These characteristics can be assessed remotely, and the available techniques hold considerable promise for the inventory and monitoring of natural resources. However, a significant lack of information concerning the full potential of this recent technology has resulted in an inadequate appreciation of the many possible applications in various domains. This paper presents the current situation regarding the development of satellite remote sensing technology within the fields of forestry, nature conservation, and landscape management in terms of resource assessment and monitoring. Future applications are reported on by having a closer look at the new generation of sensor systems and satellites, since methods currently used for environmental monitoring and resource survey appear to be fairly inappropriate or even inadequate in some cases. Forestry and associated environmental applications are reviewed in more detail with focus on projects being carried out in the southern part of Africa. Satellite remote sensing as a powerful and suitable tool for mapping purposes, forest mensuration and inventory, and forest disease and stress assessment is discussed. In addition, issues such as fire management, the assessment of soil erosion, the mapping of land cover, as well as wildlife habitat evaluation are raised. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Calibration Of Satellite Measurements Of River Discharge Using A Global Hydrology Model,"Brakenridge, G. Robert and Cohen, Sagy and Kettner, Albert J. and De Groeve, Tom and Nghiem, Son V. and Syvitski, James P. M. and Fekete, Balazs M.",2012,"Measurements of river discharge and watershed runoff are essential to water resources management, efficient hydropower generation, accurate flood prediction and control, and improved understanding of the global water cycle. Previous work demonstrates that orbital remote sensing can measure river discharge variation in a manner closely analogous to its measurement at ground stations, and using reach flow surface area instead of stage as the discharge estimator. For international measurements, hydrological modeling can, in principle, be used to provide the needed calibration of sensor data to discharge. The present study tests this approach and investigates the accuracy of the results. We analyze six sites within the US where gauging station, satellite measurements, and WBM model results are all available. Knowledge is thereby gained concerning how accurately satellite sensors can measure discharge, if the signal is calibrated only from global modeling results without any ground-based information. The calibration (rating) equations obtained for the remote sensing signal are similar, whether based on gauging station or on model information: r(2) correlation coefficients for least squares fits at one example site (\#524; White River, Indiana) are both .66 (n = 144, comparing monthly daily maxima, minima, and mean, 20032006). Space-based 4-day mean discharge values for this site when using the model calibration are accurate to within +/- 67\% on the average (n = 1824; largest percent errors occur at low discharges), and annual total runoff is accurate to 9\%, 2003-2008. Comparison of gauging station versus modeled discharge commonly indicates a small positive model bias; the observed errors of satellite-observed annual runoff are also positive and could be improved by bias removal from the rating curves. Also, analysis of a large flood event, along the Indus River in 2010, shows that the model does not capture flood wave attenuation by overbank flow, and thus predicts faster flood wave celerity and higher peak discharge than was measured by the remote sensing. The incorporation of overbank processes would improve discharge estimation via modeling, and also facilitate more accurate satellite-based measurement of peak discharge. The analysis shows that existing and planned microwave sensors can usefully characterize global river discharge dynamics, and that water balance model-based rating curves provide acceptable calibration of remote sensing signal to discharge.

Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Fuzzy- Pso Hybrid Approach,"Sarkar, A. and Das, R.",2015,"Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always key features for classifying mixed pixels.

Decommissioning Vs. Reusing Offshore Gas Platforms Within Ethical Decision-Making For Sustainable Development: Theoretical Framework With Application To The Adriatic Sea,"Zagonari, Fabio",2021,"This paper integrates ethics into decision-making for sustainable development to help planners choose between decommissioning and reuse of an offshore gas platform within a social perspective. To do so, I match multi-criteria analysis (MCA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), weighted life-cycle assessment (WLCA), and monetary life-cycle assessment (MLCA) to four main ethical standpoints: MCA for duty to the current generation by minimising impacts (strong sustainability in a linear economy), WLCA for duty to the current and future generations by minimising impacts (strong sustainability in a circular economy), CBA for duty to the current generation by maximising welfare (weak sustainability in a linear economy), and MLCA for duty to the current and future generations by maximising welfare (weak sustainability in a circular economy). Analytical results demonstrated that reuse of the platforms is more suitable than decommissioning in a linear economy. Thus, the decision on decommissioning vs. reuse is primarily a matter of inter-generational equity. Numerical results with non-marginal assessments for a case study in the Adriatic Sea suggested that support for reuse of the platform is 100\% of the solution space based on MCA, 72\% based on WLCA, 89\% based on CBA, and 83\% based on MLCA. However, after accounting for the estimated impacts, WLCA no longer supports reuse. Thus, the decision on decommissioning vs. reuse depends secondarily on the sustainability perspective. Sensitivity analyses based on greater positive and negative perceptions of reuse and with greater social and environmental concerns showed that reuse is a robust choice with respect to perceptions (i.e., the information gap is not relevant) and concerns (i.e., stakeholder representativeness is not significant) for all sustainability paradigms and economic approaches. Therefore, the main policy implications are that the avoided decommissioning costs should be shared in terms of inter-generational distributive justice; and that employment and biodiversity benefits from reuse should be stressed within a strong sustainability perspective.",zagonari_decommissioningreusingoffshoregas_2021,FALSE,class_round2,NA

All-Electric Satellites: Insurance Implications,"Wade, David and Gubby, Robin and Hoffer, David",2015,"The significant mass reduction of an all-electric satellite compared to a chemically propelled satellite with the same payload, or the ability to include a larger payload for the same launch mass, will reduce transponder prices and ensure that satellite solutions remain competitive against terrestrial alternatives. The major disadvantage of all-electric satellites is the time it takes to reach geostationary orbit, which could be a number of months, even under nominal operations. Traditional space insurance policies include a provision such that a satellite can be declared a total loss if it does not reach geostationary orbit within a predefined number of days. For chemically propelled satellites that require a handful of impulsive burns to complete the transfer to GEO, such a loss is relatively easy to determine, and for a situation, for example, where a satellite is delivered short of its intended apogee, the quantum of a loss, or whether it is worth proceeding with the orbit-raising maneuvers, can be determined with confidence, relatively quickly. The situation for all-electric satellites will be different. For all-electric satellites it may be possible to overcome launch shortfalls or certain propulsion system failure scenarios by increasing the duration of the orbit-raising phase. Satellite insurance policies cover the value of the space asset, which for a newly launched satellite would usually mean the replacement cost of the satellite, the replacement cost of the launch service, and the cost of the insurancethe three main costs in any satellite project. Insurance does not usually cover the revenue that the satellite is expected to generate. While the traditional satellite insurance policies have served satellite operators well, there are failure scenarios for all-electric satellites, which only reduce the level of redundancy, for example, but which could result in a significant increase in the duration of orbit raising. The increased duration of orbit raising will result in a financial impact for the satellite operator due to the loss of revenue associated with the delayed entry into service, but would not be covered by a traditional satellite insurance policy. This article will consider, from an insurance perspective, the implications of moving to all-electric propulsion and suggest ways in which the satellite insurance coverage may need to be adapted to ensure satellite operators continue to be indemnified for the risks they face.",wade_electricsatellitesinsuranceimplications_2015,FALSE,class_round2,NA
"Priority Areas For Watershed Service Conservation In The Guapi-Macacu Region Of Rio De Janeiro, Atlantic Forest, Brazil","Rodríguez Osuna, V. and Börner, J. and Nehren, U. and Prado, R. B. and Gaese, H. and Heinrich, J.",2014,"Introduction: Land use intensification and urbanisation processes are degrading hydrological ecosystem services in the Guapi-Macacu watershed of Rio de Janeiro. A proposal to pay farmers to restore natural watershed services might be an alternative to securing the water supply in the long-term for the around 2.5 million urban water users in the study region. This study quantifies the costs of changing current land use patterns to enhance watershed services and compares these costs to the avoided costs associated with water treatment for public supply.; Methods: We use farm-household data to estimate the opportunity costs of abandoning current land uses for the recovery of natural vegetation; a process that is very likely to improve water quality in terms of turbidity due to reduced inputs from erosion. Opportunity cost estimates are extrapolated to the watershed scale based on remote sensing land use classifications and vulnerability analysis to identify priority zones for watershed management interventions. To assess the potential demand for watershed services, we analyse water quality and treatment cost data from the main local water treatment plant.; Results: Changing agricultural land uses for watershed services provision generally comes at high opportunity costs in our study area near to the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. Alternative low cost watershed conservation options do exist in the livestock production sector. These options have the potential to directly reduce the amount of sediments and nutrients reaching the water bodies, and in turn decrease the costs of treatment needed for drinking water. Land cover changes at the scale needed to improve water quality will, nonetheless, likely exceed the cost of additional investments in water treatment.; Conclusions: The state water utility company’s willingness to pay for watershed services alone will not be enough to induce provision of additional watershed services. We conclude that monetary incentives conditioned on specific adjustments to existing production systems could still have a complementary role to play in improving watershed services. However, we note that our willingness to pay analysis focusses on only one of the potentially wide range of ecosystem services provided by natural vegetation in the Guapi-Macacu watershed. Factoring these ecosystem services into the willingness to pay equation is likely to change our assessment in favour of additional conservation action, be it through PES or other policy instruments. © 2014, Rodriguez Osuna et al.; licensee Springer.",rodriguezosuna_prioritywatershedserviceconservation_2014,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Evapotranspiration Estimation And Validation At 16 M Resolution Based On Etmonitor Model Driven By Gf-1 Satellite Remote Sensing Datasets,"Zheng, C. and Jia, L. and Hu, G.",2023,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the core variables for studying the surface water cycle and management of the field-scale water resources. Satellite remote sensing are widely adopted to obtain the variation of evapotranspiration at large spatial scale, but the resolution of existing ET products is mainly limited at low or medium resolution (1—25 km), which cannot satisfy the field-scale water management application. The Chinese GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV) camera has the characteristics of high spatial and temporal resolution, with a spatial resolution of 16m, and it can support to generate ET products with high spatial and temporal resolution, which has not yet been well presented. The objective of this study is to present the capacity of using the remote sensing data from the GF-1 satellite as the driving force to produce high resolution (16 m) ET. The ETMonitor model was adopted to estimate ET at 16 m resolution in this study. ETMonitor is a combined model with multi-process parameterizations, and it has been proven to be able to generate accurate regional and global ET estimation at relative coarse resolution (e.g., 1 km) mainly using the biophysical and hydrological parameters/variables retrieved from satellite observations. During the ET estimation procedure, the adopted GF-1 remote sensing datasets include the Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FVC), Albedo, and NDVI datasets, which are retrieved from previous studies. Ground observation data from 16 sites in China was collected to validate the estimated ET, including 6 grassland sites, 4 cropland sites, 1 mixed forest site, 2 shrubland sites, and 3 desert or Gobi sites. The validation results show that the overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of estimated daily evapotranspiration based on GF-1 satellite remote sensing datasets is 0.85 mm d-1, the correlation coefficient (R) is 0.79, and the Bias is 0.16 mm d-1, which can demonstrate the high accuracy of estimated ET. The GF-1 based ET at 16 m resolution also presented better performance in terms of spatial variation of ET comparing with the low-resolution (e. g., 1 km) ET, especially in the regions with high surface heterogeneity. These highlight the ability of Chinese GF-1 satellite remote sensing dataset could produce accurate ET at high spatial variation, and it has potential to meet the application of field-scale agricultural water resources management, irrigation management, ecological environment monitoring and government decision-making in China. However, due to the impact of the revisit cycle of the GF-1 satellite and the impact of clouds, there are some gaps or missing values in GF-1 based LAI, FVC or Albedo, and these further cause gaps in the GF-1 ET data. In order to improve the availability of high-resolution ET products, it is necessary to produce spatially and temporally continuous high-resolution ET products, which will be the focus of follow-up research. © 2023 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

Dammed Lake Water Volume Estimation By Satellite Imagery And Digital Elevation Model Under Unknown Underwater Terrain Scenario,"Zhu, C. and Zhang, X. and Fang, H. and Wang, W.",2022,"The real-time dynamic monitoring of water volume has great value for risk assessment, prediction, and early warning and disposal decision-making of dammed lakes. In view of the difficulty in obtaining underwater topographic data of dammed lake in areas without gauged data on the plateau, directly, quantitatively, and timely estimating the water volume of dammed lake by using remote sensing technology is difficult. This study aims to solve the problem of rapid quantitative estimation of water volume of plateau dammed lake under unknown underwater terrain scenario by remote sensing and perform the risk monitoring and disaster assessment of dammed lake.According to the existing remote sensing data and digital elevation information, this study puts forward a remote sensing quantitative estimation method of water volume of dammed lake on the plateau without underwater terrain by fully using remote sensing data. The details are as follows. First, the submerged area of dammed lake is extracted from remote sensing images. Second, the center line of the complex polygon of the dammed lake is calculated. Specifically, according to the water area of the dammed lake, the Tyson polygon algorithm is used to calculate the position information of the dammed lake centerline. Third, through the location of the polygonal center line of the dammed lake, the fixed-point elevation measurement is carried out to complete the fitting calculation. Then, according to the fitting estimation of the middle line elevation and combined with the slope elevation information, the unknown underwater terrain of the dammed lake is adaptively simulated. Finally, based on the simulated underwater terrain and the submerged area of the dammed lake, the capacity of the dammed lake is calculated by 3D curved surface space discrete integration.The dammed lake, namely, Sarez Lake in the Pamirs was selected as the research area. Remote sensing survey and empirical research on water volume were carried out using the proposed method. The research results show that the water area of Sarez dammed lake is approximately 89.09 km2, and the water volume of Sarez Lake is approximately 16.25 billion m3. This result is consistent with the expert's estimated water volume of 15.5 billion m3 to 16.5 billion m3. The accuracy verification of the local simulation experiment shows that the overall dynamic error between the simulation data and the measured data is controlled within 10%, and the correlation coefficient is 0.95 (P<0.01, double tailed). This finding further proves the robustness of the algorithm and the credibility of the estimation results.This method can rapidly estimate the water volume of plateau dammed lake, with high accuracy and strong technical universality. It provides an efficient method for remote sensing estimation of plateau dammed lake water volume under none or lack of underwater terrain data scenario. It also solves the problem of quantitative calculation of plateau dammed lake water volume with unknown underwater terrain. © 2022, Science Press.

Precision Agriculture And The Role Of Remote Sensing: A Review,"Brisco, B. and Brown, R. J. and Hirose, T. and Mc Naim, H. and Staenz, K.",1998,"Precision agriculture involves the integration of new technologies including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies to allow farm producers to manage within field variability to maximize the cost-benefit ratio, rather than using the traditional whole-field approach. Variable Rate Technology (VRT) available with farm implements, such as fertilizer or pesticide applicators and yield monitors, have evolved rapidly and have fostered the growth of precision agriculture. Site specific management allows inputs to be reduced, while optimizing outputs, both of which are attractive to the farm producer. At the same time, by reducing inputs, the run-off of fertilizers and pesticides is reduced, thus improving the environmental condition of the agro-ecosystem. Remote sensing provides input data for many precision agriculture applications including pre-growth soil fertility and moisture analyses, crop growth and growth detractant monitoring (crop scouting), and yield forecasting. This information in turn helps the farm producer in his decision-making. Although the acceptance and growth of precision agriculture has been rapid, some fundamental requirements are needed to help fully develop and implement this technology. Among these requirements are continued research and development of algorithms for the radiometric and geometric correction of remote sensing data and for information extraction. Also, access to timely, cost-effective remote sensing data, or derived value-added products and the development of decision support systems or other expert systems integrating GIS, GPS, and RS technologies in a user-friendly fashion are needed.

Improvement Of Multi-Satellite Real-Time Precipitation Products For Ensemble Streamflow Simulation In A Middle Latitude Basin In South China,"Jiang, Shanhu and Ren, Liliang and Hong, Yang and Yang, Xiaoli and Ma, Mingwei and Zhang, Yu and Yuan, Fei",2014,"The real-time availability of several satellite-based precipitation products has recently provided hydrologists with an unprecedented opportunity to improve current hydrologic prediction capability for vast river basins, particularly for ungauged regions. However, the accuracy of real-time satellite precipitation data remains uncertain. This study aims to use three widely used real-time satellite precipitation products, namely, TRMM Multi satellite Precipitation Analysis real-time precipitation product 3B42 (TMPA 3B42RT), Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensing Information using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIAN), and NOAA/Climate Precipitation Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), for ensemble stream flow simulation with the gridded xinanjiang (XAJ) model and shuffled complex evolution metropolis (SCEM-UA) algorithm in the middle-latitude Mishui basin in South China. To account the bias of the satellite precipitation data and consider the input uncertainty, two different methods, i.e. a precipitation error multiplier and a precipitation error model were introduced. For each precipitation input model, the posterior probability distribution of the parameters and their associated uncertainty were calibrated using the SCEM-UA algorithm, and 15,000 ensemble stream flow simulations were conducted. The simulations of the satellite precipitation data were then optimally merged using the Bayseian model averaging (BMA) method. The result shows that in Mishui basin, the three sets of real-time satellite precipitation data largely underestimated rainfall. Streamflow simulation performed poorly when the raw satellite precipitation data were taken as input and the model parameters were calibrated with gauged data. By implementing the precipitation error multiplier and the precipitation error model and then recalibrating the model, the behavior of the simulated stream flow and calculated uncertainty boundary were significantly improved. Furthermore, the BMA combination of the simulations from the three datasets resulted in a significantly better prediction with a remarkably reliable uncertainty boundary and was comparable with the simulation using the post-real-time bias-corrected research quality TMPA 3B42V7. The proposed methodology of bias adjustment, uncertainty analysis, and BMA combination collectively facilitates the application of the current three real-time satellite data to hydrological prediction and water resource management over many under-gauged basins.

On The Potential Of Surfers To Monitor Environmental Indicators In The Coastal Zone,"Brewin, Robert J. W. and de Mora, Lee and Jackson, Thomas and Brewin, Thomas G. and Shutler, Jamie",2015,"The social and economic benefits of the coastal zone make it one of the most treasured environments on our planet. Yet it is vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Coastal management aims to mitigate these pressures while augmenting the socio-economic benefits the coastal region has to offer. However, coastal management is challenged by inadequate sampling of key environmental indicators, partly due to issues relating to cost of data collection. Here, we investigate the use of recreational surfers as platforms to improve sampling coverage of environmental indicators in the coastal zone. We equipped a recreational surfer, based in the south west United Kingdom (UK), with a temperature sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) device that they used when surfing for a period of one year (85 surfing sessions). The temperature sensor was used to derive estimates of sea-surface temperature (SST), an important environmental indicator, and the GPS device used to provide sample location and to extract information on surfer performance. SST data acquired by the surfer were compared with data from an oceanographic station in the south west UK and with satellite observations. Our results demonstrate: (i) high-quality SST data can be acquired by surfers using low cost sensors; and (ii) GPS data can provide information on surfing performance that may help motivate data collection by surfers. Using recent estimates of the UK surfing population, and frequency of surfer participation, we speculate around 40 million measurements on environmental indicators per year could be acquired at the UK coastline by surfers. This quantity of data is likely to enhance coastal monitoring and aid UK coastal management. Considering surfing is a world-wide sport, our results have global implications and the approach could be expanded to other popular marine recreational activities for coastal monitoring of environmental indicators.",brewin_potentialsurfersmonitorenvironmental_2015,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Opportunities For Improving Conservation Early Warning And Alert Systems,"Tabor, Karyn M. and Holland, Margaret B.",2021,"Conservation early warning and alert systems (CEAS) provide tremendous opportunities to inform strategic and effective environmental responses. However, these systems are not systematically evaluated based on how they are contributing to conservation outcomes. We survey the current state of systems enabled by satellite monitoring to support tropical forest management and highlight their recent proliferation and the sparse evaluations of these systems in terms of user adoption and application for improving conservation decisions. To guide practitioners, funders and policymakers to choose the appropriate tool for the application, we distinguish two types of CEAS, Rapid Response and Targeted Response, characterized by the user application and the timeframe for decision-making. These tools are distinct from monitoring tools used for policy and planning which require routine, high-accuracy and quantifiable estimates of land cover change. We see a need for more systematic evaluations quantifying their environmental and socioeconomic benefits and improved indicators measuring progress toward achieving conservation outcomes. To inform system developers, we summarize best practices for increasing system adoption and use gleaned from seasoned applications of early warning and alert systems for conservation and humanitarian applications. Engaging diverse stakeholders, building permanent capacity, increasing accessibility and interpretability of the information, and communicating the information value to decision-makers help root these systems into decision-making processes. Incorporating local knowledge and on-the-ground monitoring information from stakeholders can improve alert accuracy while respectfully honoring local knowledge and garnering stakeholder trust in the systems. Strengthening cross-institutional networks, building political support, and allocating adequate resources empower decision-makers to act upon the information.

Evaluation Of Negative Economic-Environmental Externalities Of Overextraction Of Groundwater,"Baniasadi, Mostafa and Mehrjordi, Mohammad Reza Zare' and Boshrabadi, Hossein Mehrabi and Khalilabad, Hamid Reza Mirzaei and Estakhrooye, Abbas Rezaei",2020,"In recent decades, increased extraction of groundwater for human and agriculture consumption has led to a substantial drop in groundwater level in large areas of across the world. Declining groundwater levels is a serious problem in itself and has multiple economic, social, cultural, political, security-related, and environmental externalities. The negative economic-environmental externalities of overextraction of groundwater in the Orzouiyeh plain in the Kerman Province, Iran, were evaluated using methods such as replacement cost, production function, market prices, shadow price, and the value of the input marginal product. After evaluating externalities, the Positive Mathematical Programming method was used to evaluate different water policies to reduce the consumption of groundwater. The total economic losses due to the externalities were calculated to equal 2.8 U.S. million dollars. The damages caused by environmental externalities were calculated to equal 436.1 U.S. million dollars.

Status And Prospect Of Agricultural Remote Sensing,"Shi, Z. and Liang, Z. and Yang, Y. and Guo, Y.",2015,"Remote sensing technology can cost-effectively access a wide range of real-time land surface spatial information, and provides an effective way for resource surveys, environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. With the help of remote sensing technology, geo-information can be acquired quickly, accurately, efficiently and comprehensively. Undoubtedly, remote sensing will play an increasingly important role in the fields of geosciences, agricultural sciences, and so on. In particular civil resources satellite was launched in the 1970s, which was applied in agriculture and benefited first. Moreover, significant developments were registered in some key fields along with the advancement of high resolution remote sensing. The combination of their high temporal frequency with extended geographical coverage makes them particularly useful for time series crop growth monitoring, crop types subdivision, and acquisition of field precision agriculture. The fact is of note that the new challenges followed as a result of the dispersion and spatial-temporal variability in agricultural production. An overview of the history and theoretical background of agricultural remote sensing technology was introduced. And then four aspects of yield estimation, agricultural resources survey, agricultural disaster monitoring and precision agriculture management were presented. Remotely sensed data from existing platforms and the ground observation network technology which can provide an important data source for supporting agriculture were expected. On the other hand, new generation remote sensing platform of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) should be promoted. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore multi-sensors, spectral data, surface characteristic parameters and existing crop model. The combination of multi-sensor data and assimilation will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for agriculture. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Multi-Level Health Evaluation Method For On-Orbit Satellites Based On Reconfigurable Degree,"Lu, Z. and Jin, G. and Yang, T. and Wu, G. and Lan, X.",2018,"At present, the main methods for evaluating the multi-level health status of on-orbit satellites are the weighted synthesis methods. However, these methods cannot adequately characterize the high redundancy and reconfigurability of the satellite system, and the weight parameters are seriously determined by subjective judgment or expert experience.

At the component level, the non-parametric regression method is used to evaluate the health status. From the component level to the system level, the system can be evaluated by building a tree structure model based on the degree of reconfiguration.

In this paper, we present a method that uses remote sensing, GIS modeling and stakeholder engagement to produce a decision support tool that communicates the availability and need for green infrastructure benefits. The case study presented is the City of Tshwane, South Africa, a Global South city facing rapid urbanization. We found that this method of mapping green infrastructure benefits can provide simultaneous oversight on multiple objectives for green infrastructure, including climate change adaptation, biodiversity, and equitable distribution of urban green space. We found that low-scoring benefit areas occur in dense urban areas where small-scale nature-based solutions or rehabilitation activities are required. Moderate benefit scores occurred in parts of the city that are vulnerable to urban expansion and densification activities, warranting the careful planning of green infrastructure provision, and that moderate-to-high-scoring areas can be protected as conservation areas.

Self-Supervised Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based On High Frequency Feature And Gate Attention-Guided Optimization Unit,"Shi, Aiye and Wang, Sen and Wang, Xin",2023,"Remote sensing image change detection (CD) is a technical method to analyze and compare remote sensing images covering the same area with different phases to determine the process of surface change, which has important application value in natural resource management, land monitoring, and natural disaster monitoring. At present, the commonly used supervised remote sensing image CD technique requires a large number of labeled samples to train the network, which brings a large human and material cost. In contrast, the unsupervised remote sensing image CD technique does not require the construction of labeled samples; however, there is no direct correspondence between the unsupervised learning task and the downstream CD. To address the aforementioned issues, a self-supervised remote sensing image CD method based on a high frequency feature enhancement module (HFFEM) and gate attention-guided optimization unit (GAGOU) Siamese-like network is proposed. First, the network is trained using a self-supervised learning diagram to extract features that are beneficial to remote sensing image CD and better serve the downstream CD task. After that, a clustering loss function and a contrastive loss function are used to optimize the network. Second, to enhance the feature extraction capability for change edges and to address the degradation of network performance due to the entrainment of redundant features during feature fusion, HFFEM and GAGOU are proposed, respectively. Finally, comprehensive simulation experiments were conducted on the IKONOS multi-spectral datasets Mina and Riyadh, the open CD dataset Onera satellite change detection (OSCD), and the heterogeneous dataset Shuguang, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms based on evaluation metrics, such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and F1 score.",shi_supervisedremotesensingimage_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Credible Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Evidential Fusion On Aerial-Ground Dual-View Images,"Zhao, K. and Gao, Q. and Hao, S. and Sun, J. and Zhou, L.",2023,"Due to their ability to offer more comprehensive information than data from a single view, multi-view (e.g., multi-source, multi-modal, multi-perspective) data are being used more frequently in remote sensing tasks. However, as the number of views grows, the issue of data quality is becoming more apparent, limiting the potential benefits of multi-view data. Although recent deep neural network (DNN)-based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing them renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and inflexibly in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view. Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible.

This paper aims to document this dataset by providing detailed descriptions of the assimilation system and the first validation results for the above reanalysis dataset. The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method is adopted to demonstrate the quality of the reanalysis. The CV results show that the CAQRA yields an excellent performance in reproducing the magnitude and variability of surface air pollutants in China from 2013 to 2018 (CV R 2 D 0 :52-0.81, CV root mean square error (RMSE) D 0 :54 mg =m3 for CO, and CV RMSE D 16 :4-39.3 mu g =m(3) for the other pollutants on an hourly scale). Through comparison to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMSRA) dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF), we show that CAQRA attains a high accuracy in representing surface gaseous air pollutants in China due to the assimilation of surface observations. The fine horizontal resolution of CAQRA also makes it more suitable for air quality studies on a regional scale. The PM2.5 reanalysis dataset is further validated against the independent datasets from the US Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program over China, which exhibits a good agreement with the independent observations (R 2 D 0 :74-0.86 and RMSE D 16 :8-33.6 mu g =m3 in different cities). Furthermore, through the comparison to satellite-estimated PM2.5 concentrations, we show that the accuracy of the PM2.5 reanalysis is higher than that of most satellite estimates. The CAQRA is the first high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset in China that simultaneously provides the surface concentrations of six conventional air pollutants, which is of great value for many studies, such as health impact assessment of air pollution, investigation of air quality changes in China, model evaluation and satellite calibration, optimization of monitoring sites, and provision of training data for statistical or artificial intelligence (AI)-based forecasting.

Model-Driven Coordinated Management Of Data Centers,"Mukherjee, T. and Banerjee, A. and Varsamopoulos, G. and Gupta, S. K. S.",2010,"Management of computing infrastructure in data centers is an important and challenging problem, that needs to: (i) ensure availability of services conforming to the Service Level Agreements (SLAs); and (ii) reduce the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), i.e. the ratio of total power, up to half of which is attributed to data center cooling, over the computing power to service the workloads. The cooling energy consumption can be reduced by allowing higher-than-usual thermostat set temperatures while maintaining the ambient temperature in the data center room within manufacturer-specified server redline temperatures for their reliable operations. This paper proposes: (i) a Coordinated Job, Power, and Cooling Management (JPCM) policy, which performs: (a) job management so as to allow for an increase in the thermostat setting of the cooling unit while meeting the SLA requirements, (b) power management to reduce the produced thermal load, and (c) cooling management to dynamically adjust the thermostat setting; and (ii) a Model-driven coordinated Management Architecture (MMA), which uses a state-based model to dynamically decide the correct management policy to handle events, such as new workload arrival or failure of a cooling unit, that can trigger an increase in the ambient temperature. Each event is associated with a time window, referred to as the window-of-opportunity, after which the temperature at the inlet of one or more servers can go beyond the redline temperature if proper management policies are not enforced. This window-of-opportunity monotonically decreases with increase in the incoming workload. The selection of the management policy depends on their potential energy benefits and the conformance of the delays in their actuation to the window-of-opportunity. Simulations based on actual job traces from the ASU HPC data center show that the JPCM can achieve up to 18% energy-savings over separated power or job management policies. However, high delay to reach a stable ambient temperature (in case of cooling management through dynamic thermostat setting) can violate the server redline temperatures. A management decision chart is developed as part of MMA to autonomically employ the management policy with maximum energy-savings without violating the window-of-opportunity, and hence the redline temperatures. Further, a prototype of the JPCM is developed by configuring the widely used Moab cluster manager to dynamically change the server priorities for job assignment. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Remote Sensing Image Compression Assessment Based On Multilevel Distortions,"Jiang, H. and Yang, K. and Liu, T. and Zhang, Y.",2014,"The measurement of visual quality is of fundamental importance to remote sensing image compression, especially for image quality assessment and compression algorithm optimization. We exploit the distortion features of optical remote sensing image compression and propose a full-reference image quality metric based on multilevel distortions (MLD), which assesses image quality by calculating distortions of three levels (such as pixel-level, contexture-level, and content-level) between original images and compressed images. Based on this, a multiscale MLD (MMLD) algorithm is designed and it outperforms the other current methods in our testing. In order to validate the performance of our algorithm, a special remote sensing image compression distortion (RICD) database is constructed, involving 250 remote sensing images compressed with different algorithms and various distortions. Experimental results on RICD and Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering databases show that the proposed MMLD algorithm has better consistency with subjective perception values than current state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing image compression assessment, and the objective assessment results can show the distortion features and visual quality of compressed image well.

Hsi Modeling And Intelligent Optimization For Fishing Ground Forecasts Using A Genetic Algorithm,"Feng, Y. and Chen, X. and Xiaoming, Y. and Gao, F.",2014,"The construction of a habitat suitability index (HSI) model is a crucial problem in fishing ground forecasts. In general, the HSI model is established by estimating the relationship between marine environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities. However, the environmental factors observed by remote sensing technology and commercial fishing investigations are usually highly correlated, and conventional methods such as the continued product model, minimum model, maximum model, arithmetic mean model, and geometric mean model cannot eliminate the harmful effects caused by the correlation of fishing data. As a result, it is difficult for them to capture the complex relations between environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities. Based on the widely used intelligent optimization method of genetic algorithms (GAs), this paper presents a general framework called GeneHSI for HSI modeling and intelligent optimization. Most importantly, the GeneHSI framework can remove the harmful effects of correlation, allowing the automatic retrieval and optimization of the HSI parameters. The core of GeneHSI modeling is the construction of a fitness function. This function was built by projecting the logistic regression-based HSI space to that of a GA, and is used to guide the optimization process of GeneHSI. Specifically, the fundamental concept of the projection is to minimize accumulative errors between the computed ground probabilities and the observed probabilities converted from commercial fishing data. The proposed GeneHSI framework is composed of three elements. These are the construction of the problem to be solved, the initialization of the GA, and the optimization strategy of the GA. The validation and effectiveness of the GeneHSI framework have been demonstrated using simulation data, that is, randomly generated normalized marine environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities range from 0 to 1. Research shows that the GeneHSI framework is effective and efficient in retrieving and optimizing HSI parameters for fishing ground forecasts. Because of the stochastic characteristics of GAs, however, there is a high requirement for modelers and scientists to better control the implementation of the GeneHSI framework. The HSI parameters retrieved by the GeneHSI framework vary under different constraints. Such constraints used in GAs commonly include linear inequalities and linear equality constraints on the underlying relations between marine environmental factors and fishing ground probabilities, as well as constraints on the bounds of HSI parameters. Compared with the results under optimization strategies using these constraints, the results under a general optimization strategy are inferior in that the GeneHSI framework cannot obtain a good match between the best-fitness and mean-fitness curves. In theory, the fitness value is the accumulative error of the GeneHSI model; hence, a smaller value indicates a better result. However, a good convergence process does not necessarily lead to a minimum fitness value amongst fitness functions under different constraints. In this paper, therefore, an evaluation of the convergence process, instead of a minimum fitness value, is considered the fundamental standard for the assessment of a good set of HSI parameters. In addition, experience and professional knowledge are required for an exact assessment of the HSI parameters. Overall, the above constraints, especially those on the parameter bounds, greatly help the optimization of the GeneHSI framework to retrieve better HSI parameters. In addition, the implementation of the GeneHSI framework with 100, 1 000, 5 000, and 10 000 samples demonstrates its strong capability for processing the mass data of fishing grounds. It is expected that the GeneHSI framework can enrich the modeling methods and theories of fishing grounds, and hence guide the application of intelligent optimization methods in fishing ground HSI modeling. © 2014, Science Press.

Environmental Applications Of Remote Sensing,"Mertikas, S. P. and Partsinevelos, P. and Mavrocordatos, C. and Maximenko, N. A.",2020,"Remote sensing, the science and technology through which characteristics and properties of targets on Earth can be identified and determined from a distance, has provided systematic, dedicated, and repetitive observations of the Earth’s surface (atmosphere, water, land, living species, vegetation, pollution, climate) from global to local scales. Satellite observations have contributed to the spectacular improvement of the accuracy of weather forecasts over the last few decades. Remote sensing has provided the means for detecting and quantifying the rates of pollution, and mapping and monitoring sources of pollution and the degree of remediation for their management. It has the means to respond and facilitate environmental management, and makes sound and evidence-based decisions in relation to Earth’s resources at a global scale and across different continents, nations, and domains. Remote sensing currently supplies essential Earth observations to protect irreplaceable resources and provide support for sustainable economic growth, disaster resilience, management of energy and mineral resources, food and water security, and sustainability. It provides powerful tools for understanding the past and present conditions of Earth systems and components, as well as the interplay between them. Thus remote sensing could assist us to solve environmental problems, address and mitigate risks, and deliver skillful predictions of the future behaviors of Earth systems (natural disasters, state of oceans, atmosphere, land, vegetation, food, public health, etc.).

Integration Of Farm Financial Accounting And Farm Management Information Systems For Better Sustainability Reporting,"Poppe, Krijn and Vrolijk, Hans and Bosloper, Ivor",2023,"Farmers face an increasing administrative burden as agricultural policies and certification systems of trade partners ask for more sustainability reporting. Several indicator frameworks have been developed to measure sustainability, but they often lack empirical operationalization and are not always measured at the farm level. The research gap we address in this paper is the empirical link between the data needs for sustainability reporting and the developments in data management at the farm level. Family farms do not collect much data for internal management, but external demand for sustainability data can partly be fulfilled by reorganizing data management in the farm office. The Farm Financial Accounts (FFAs) and Farm Management Information Systems (FMISs) are the main data sources in the farm office. They originate from the same source of note-taking by farmers but became separated when formalized and computerized. Nearly all European farms have a bank account and must keep financial accounts (e.g., for Value-Added Tax or income tax) that can be audited. Financial accounts are not designed for environmental accounting or calculating sustainability metrics but provide a wealth of information to make assessments on these subjects. FMISs are much less frequently used but collect more technical and fine-grained data at crop or enterprise level for different fields. FMISs are also strong in integrating sensor and satellite data. Integrating data availability and workflows of FFAs and FMISs makes sustainability reporting less cumbersome regarding data entry and adds valuable data to environmental accounts. This paper applies a design science approach to design an artifact, a dashboard for sustainability reporting based on the integration of information flows from farm financial accounting systems and farm management information systems. The design developed in this paper illustrates that if invoices were digitized, most data-gathering needed for external sustainability reporting would automatically be done when the invoices is paid by a bank transfer. Data on the use of inputs and production could be added with procedures as in current FMISs, but with less data entry, fewer risks of differences in outcomes, and possibilities of cross-checking the results.",poppe_integrationfarmfinancialaccounting_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Evaluating Landscape Options For Corridor Restoration Between Giant Panda Reserves,"Wang, Fang and McShea, William J. and Wang, Dajun and Li, Sheng and Zhao, Qing and Wang, Hao and Lu, Zhi",2014,"The establishment of corridors can offset the negative effects of habitat fragmentation by connecting isolated habitat patches. However, the practical value of corridor planning is minimal if corridor identification is not based on reliable quantitative information about species-environment relationships. An example of this need for quantitative information is planning for giant panda conservation. Although the species has been the focus of intense conservation efforts for decades, most corridor projects remain hypothetical due to the lack of reliable quantitative researches at an appropriate spatial scale. In this paper, we evaluated a framework for giant panda forest corridor planning. We linked our field survey data with satellite imagery, and conducted species occupancy modelling to examine the habitat use of giant panda within the potential corridor area. We then conducted least-cost and circuit models to identify potential paths of dispersal across the landscape, and compared the predicted cost under current conditions and alternative conservation management options considered during corridor planning. We found that due to giant panda's association with areas of low elevation and flat terrain, human infrastructures in the same area have resulted in corridor fragmentation. We then identified areas with high potential to function as movement corridors, and our analysis of alternative conservation scenarios showed that both forest/bamboo restoration and automobile tunnel construction would significantly improve the effectiveness of corridor, while residence relocation would not significantly improve corridor effectiveness in comparison with the current condition. The framework has general value in any conservation activities that anticipate improving habitat connectivity in human modified landscapes. Specifically, our study suggested that, in this landscape, automobile tunnels are the best means to remove current barriers to giant panda movements caused by anthropogenic interferences.",wang_evaluatinglandscapeoptionscorridor_2014,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Incorporating Ecological And Evolutionary Processes Into Continental-Scale Conservation Planning,"Klein, Carissa and Wilson, Kerrie and Watts, Matthew and Stein, Janet and Berry, Sandra and Carwardine, Josie and Smith, Mark Stafford and Mackey, Brendan and Possingham, Hugh P.",2009,"Systematic conservation planning research has focused on designing systems of conservation areas that efficiently protect a comprehensive and representative set of species and habitats. Recently, there has been an emphasis on improving the adequacy of conservation area design to promote the persistence and future generation of biodiversity. Few studies have explored incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into conservation planning assessments. Biodiversity in Australia is maintained and generated by numerous ecological and evolutionary processes at various spatial and temporal scales. We accommodated ecological and evolutionary processes in four ways: ( 1) using sub-catchments as planning units to facilitate the protection of the integrity and function of ecosystem processes occurring on a sub-catchment scale; ( 2) targeting one type of ecological refugia, drought refugia, which are critical for the persistence of many species during widespread drought; ( 3) targeting one type of evolutionary refugia which are important for maintaining and generating unique biota during long-term climatic changes; and ( 4) preferentially grouping priority areas along vegetated waterways to account for the importance of connected waterways and associated riparian areas in maintaining processes. We identified drought refugia, areas of relatively high and regular herbage production in arid and semiarid Australia, from estimates of gross primary productivity derived from satellite data. In this paper, we combined the novel incorporation of these processes with a more traditional framework of efficiently representing a comprehensive sample of biodiversity to identify spatial priorities across Australia. We explored the trade-offs between economic costs, representation targets, and connectivity. Priority areas that considered ecological and evolutionary processes were more connected along vegetated waterways and were identified for a small increase in economic cost. Priority areas for conservation investment are more likely to have long-term benefits to biodiversity if ecological and evolutionary processes are considered in their identification.",klein_incorporatingecologicalevolutionaryprocesses_2009,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Improving The Optimization Solution For A Semi-Analytical Shallow Water Inversion Model In The Presence Of Spectrally Correlated Noise,"Garcia, Rodrigo A. and McKinna, Lachlan I. W. and Hedley, John D. and Fearns, Peter R. C. S.",2014,"In coastal regions, shallow water semi-analytical inversion algorithms may be used to derive geophysical parameters such as inherent optical properties (IOPs), water column depth, and bottom albedo coefficients by inverting sensor-derived sub-surface remote sensing reflectance, r(rs). The uncertainties of these derived geophysical parameters due to instrumental and environmental noise can be estimated numerically via the addition of spectral noise to the sensor-derived r(rs) before inversion. Repeating this process multiple times allows the calculation of the standard error and average for each derived parameter. Apart from spectral non-uniqueness, the optimization algorithm employed in the inversion must converge onto a single minimum to obtain a true representation of the uncertainty for a given set of noise-perturbed r(rs). Failure to do so inflates the uncertainty and affects the average retrieved value (accuracy). We show that the standard approach of seeding the optimization with an arbitrary, fixed initial guess, can lead to the convergence to multiple minima, each having substantially different centroids in multi-parameter solution space. We present the Update-Repeat Levenberg-Marquardt (UR-LM) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) routines that dynamically search the solution space for an optimal initial guess, that when applied to the optimization allows convergence to the best local minimum. We apply the UR-LM and LHS methods on HICO-derived and simulated r(rs) and demonstrate the improved computational efficiency, precision, and accuracy afforded from these methods compared with the standard approach. Conceptually, these methods are applicable to remote sensing based, shallow water or oceanic semi-analytical inversion algorithms requiring nonlinear least squares optimization.",garcia_improvingoptimizationsolutionsemi_2014,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Cost And Benefit Of Satellite Shielding,"Wiedemann, Carsten and Oswald, Michael and Stabroth, Sebastian and Alwes, Detlef and Voersmann, Peter",2008,"Recent simulations of the future development of the space debris environment revealed that the number of hypervelocity impacts on satellite surfaces will increase. Impacts of space debris particles and micrometeoroids can damage satellites. This can cause operational anomalies or even the loss of a satellite mission. The loss of a satellite reduces its expected operational lifetime. Thus, financial investments cannot be amortized completely. In this paper the cost of hypervelocity impacts on satellites is estimated. A risk analysis is performed by combining the probability of a penetration with the failure probability of the satellite. The goal of this work is to combine the risk of particle impacts with a cost analysis. The probability of a satellite failure is estimated by combining the probability of a penetration with a vulnerability model. The failure probability is weighted with the mission cost of a satellite. This results in a probability of loss of amortization. The amortization loss is used as estimation for the damage cost due to hypervelocity impacts. In this way it is possible to associate impacts with cost. The cost model is used to analyze selected reference missions. This analysis considers the influence of shielding measures on the mission cost. An important result is the estimation of the failure probability for different satellite wall designs including shielding. Shielding requires a modification of the satellite wall. This can result in an increasing complexity of the wall or an increasing mass. As a consequence, the hardware cost increase. To identify suitable shielding measures and to justify the additional financial investments, it is necessary to investigate the economic feasibility of such measures and to demonstrate their benefit.

The Generalized Risk-Adjusted Cost-Effectiveness (Grace) Model For Measuring The Value Of Gains In Health: An Exact Formulation,"Lakdawalla, Darius N. and Phelps, Charles E.",2023,"The generalized risk-adjusted cost-effectiveness (GRACE) analysis method modifies standard cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), the primary method currently used worldwide to value health improvements arising from healthcare interventions. Generalizing standard CEA, GRACE allows for decreasing or even increasing returns to health. Previous presentations of GRACE have relied extensively on Taylor Series expansion methods to specify key model parameters, including those that properly adjust for illness severity and preexisting disability, consequences of uncertain treatment outcomes, and the marginal rate of substitution between life expectancy and health-related quality of life. Standard CEA cannot account for these sources of value or cost in its valuation of medical treatments. However, calculations of GRACE measures based on Taylor Series are approximations, which may be poorly behaved in some contexts. This paper provides a new approach for implementing GRACE, using exact utility functions instead of Taylor Series approximations. While any proper utility function will suffice, we illustrate with three well-known functions: constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility; hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility, of which CRRA is a special case; and expo-power (EP) utility, of which constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) is a special case. The analysis then extends from two-period to multiperiod models. We discuss methods to estimate parameters of HARA and EP functions using two different types of data, one from discrete choice experiments and the other from ""happiness economics"" methods. We conclude with some reflections on how this analysis might affect benefit-cost analysis studies of healthcare interventions.",lakdawalla_generalizedriskadjustedcost_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Satellite Surface Reflectance Improves Habitat Distribution Mapping: A Case Study On Heath And Shrub Formations In The Cantabrian Mountains (Nw Spain),"Moran-Ordonez, Alejandra and Suarez-Seoane, Susana and Elith, Jane and Calvo, Leonor and de Luis, Estanislao",2012,"Aim We aim to map the distribution of four heath and shrub formations constituting habitats of high conservation priority in Europe, whose occurrence is strongly dependent on human activities. Specifically, we assess whether the use of LANDSAT data in habitat distribution modelling may account for land use management, allowing accurate mapping of real distribution patterns. In particular, we explore whether reflectance values may be a better alternative to other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches (i.e. spectral vegetation indices and classified land cover maps). Finally, we test whether modelling performance is affected by the ecological traits of the dominant species of the target formations. Location Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain). Methods We generated maps for the four formations (two specialists vs. two generalists) using MaxEnt. First, we ran the models with environmental predictors only (topography, climate, lithology and human disturbances). Then, we compared the advantages of including, in turn, different data derived from LANDSAT imagery: reflectance values (corresponding to different wavelength channels of the multispectral image), a spectral index and a land cover map. We assessed changes in explanatory power and also in the formations predicted distribution patterns. Results Formations dominated by specialist species were accurately mapped on a base of environmental variables only, whereas those dominated by generalists were overpredicted. Average mean temperature, southness and distance to urban areas were the variables contributing most in predictions of environmental models. LANDSAT channels increased the accuracy of all models, but mainly those for formations dominated by generalist species. They showed advantages against other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches. Main conclusions Habitat distribution models allowed accurate mapping of heath and shrub formations. The use of reflectance values as predictors improved the accuracy of the models, particularly for formations dominated by generalist species, supplying environmental information that was otherwise unavailable.",moranordonez_satellitesurfacereflectanceimproves_2012,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Multi-Objective Game Theory Model And Fuzzy Programing Approach For Sustainable Watershed Management,"Moradi, Sohrab and Limaei, Soleiman Mohammadi",2018,"This study was carried out with the aim of feasibility evaluation of the application of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches for settling balance between economic development and environmental impact as well as to facilitate the respective decision-makings in Zemkan basin, west of Iran. The biobjectives of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches are minimizing the destructive effects on the environment (less erosion and sediments) and maximizing the economical incomes resulted from different land uses (more net present value). Satellite images were used for recognition of different land uses and the areas of these land use. In this study, the environmentalists and Zemkan basin users were selected as environmental and economical players, respectively. The results reveal that Nash bargaining solution, which is the result of the multi-objective game theory model, differs from Pareto optimalities, obtained through the classical multi-objective model. Nash bargaining solution offered more satisfactory solutions based on decision-makers' priorities. In addition, the overall results showed that the results of fuzzy programming approach were very close to the results of the multi-objective game theory model. Therefore, in both methods, the decision variables of semi-closed forest, open forest, non-irrigated agricultural lands and barren rocky lands were eliminated and the ones of rural areas, urban areas, and water body remained unchanged. The innovation of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches, which can be understood and interpreted well by decision makers, is setting a kind of balance between economic and environmental concerns in watershed management. The results also show that multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches can be applied to many other issues concerning the environmental management.

Method And Gcp-Independent Block Adjustment For Zy-3 Satellite Images,"Sun, Y. and Zhang, L. and Xu, B. and Zhang, Y.",2019,"The spatial and radiation resolutions of domestic satellites have been remarkably improved in recent years. The sensor design and geometric calibration technologies have improved with the development and application of stereo mapping satellites (ZY-3). However, the imaging systems typically use the linear CCD imaging technology. The long focal length and narrow field angle causes the geometrical model to have 3D parallel projection characteristics, and the satellite images will still have residual system errors caused by the drift error of satellite-borne GPS/IMU and asynchrony between the pose and trace of the satellite, especially after the rigorous on-orbit geometry calibration. A block adjustment technique is still required to meet the requirements of remote sensing monitoring and mapping application. Therefore, satellite images-based accurate positioning without ground control point information is the precondition to obtain the global geographic and resource environmental information and monitoring changes in the global resource environment. The accuracy of "" ZY-3"" satellite image is improved to 15 m after calibration and its internal precision is better than 1 pixel. After the overall block adjustment without GCPs, the plane and elevation accuracy of the image can be improved to 5 m (medium error). In this study, on the basis of the widely used optimization method of solving the constraint problem in photogrammetry-alternating direction method (ADM) and RFM least-squares block adjustment, we propose a GCP-independent block adjustment method for large-scale domestic high-resolution optical satellite images-GCP-independent satellite imagery block adjustment (GISIBA) based on the geometric features of ZY-3 satellite images. The proposed method is highly efficient and easy to parallelize. GISIBA of satellite images can be considered as the overall block adjustment of the multi-source optical satellite imagery with specific constraints (distance, angle, etc.) when no ground control points are available. Most GCP-independent adjustments use a form of virtual control points. However, the precision of these virtual control points is low (varied system error), and the precision is inconsistent in the measurement area. Thus, the GCP-independent adjustment is a type of block adjustment under different precision controls. The law of error propagation of this approach is complex, and gross error detection and positioning are difficult to perform using this approach. This study presents an "" average"" virtual control point-based stereoscopic GCP-independent block adjustment method for large-scale satellite image GISIBA. On the basis of the automatic and reliable acquisition of uniformly distributed image tie points, the method comprehensively uses the "" ADM"" introduced from aerial photogrammetry and RFM-based least squares adjustment algorithm to realize the combined block adjustment of satellite images. First, the "" ADM"" is used to solve the initial values of the unknowns and to perform automatic detection and elimination of the above medium-scale gross error based on the parallel processing platform. All unknowns are assigned priori weights based on the results. Next, the RFM-based least square method is used to solve the large-scale reformation normal equation to obtain the orientation parameters with high-precision, which meets the production requirement of high-precision image products. Block adjustment by constructing virtual "" average"" control points addresses the "" rank"" problems in the GCP-independent adjustment and improves the state of normal equation of the block adjustment system, which benefits the stability and fast convergence of the block. Moreover, the method makes it convenient to analyze the relationship among the data coverage, imaging time interval, and satellite image GCP-independent block adjustment. In addition, parallel processing based on the OMP parallel method is used to realize the parallel processing of the "" ADM"" and multi-thread parallel computing based on least-squares adjustment to ensure he efficiency of block adjustment. We used multiple sets of the ZY-3 satellite image data in typical regions to verify our method. The following experiment results are summarized as follows: 1) On the basis of the widely used optimization method of constraint problem called the "" ADM"" and RFM least-squares block adjustment, the proposed GISIBA method is easy to parallelize and is highly efficient in terms of reliability, accuracy, and performance of the developed procedure. 2) In this method, virtual "" average"" control points are built to solve the rank defect problem and qualitative and quantitative analyses in block adjustment without control. Assuming the positioning accuracy is located on the same number order (such as 50 m), the final positioning accuracy of satellite image must be improved after GCP-independent block adjustment by using the virtual "" average"" control points. The final positional accuracy is stronger than the worst initial positioning accuracy of the original image. Furthermore, the increase on the coverage of satellite images does not consistently improve the overall positioning accuracy. However, the use of considerable high-resolution satellite images to cover the same area improves the positioning accuracy after the final block adjustment in the statistical sense. The horizontal and vertical accuracies of multi-covered and multi-temporal satellite images are greater than 6 m and 5 m, respectively. 3) The mosaic problem of adjacent areas in large area DOM production can be solved when third-party geographic information data are introduced as horizontal and vertical constraints. This approach is considered as weak-sense auxiliary control in the block adjustment process. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.",sun_methodgcpindependentblock_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Do Buyers' Sustainable Supply Chain Management And Stakeholders' Pressure Lead To Better Suppliers' Environmental And Operational Performance?,"Ming-Chang, H. and Arthur Cheng-Hsui, C. and Athena Jane, T. and Yen Yen, L. and Chen-Hua, L.",2021,"Among management research subjects, sustainable supply chain is a major one, in which various enhancements of economic, social, and environmental performance factors are to be considered and proposed through buyer-supplier collaboration.

If the answer is positive, what path could it be? We expect the proactiveness of suppliers' environmental strategy may be the key to balance the potential conflicts between economic benefit and environmental expenditure. Empirical evidences from the 135 suppliers of Taiwan Central Satellite Production System have indicated that SSCM and environmental pressure from the stakeholders have positive impact on the proactiveness of suppliers' environmental strategy.

Greenhouse Extraction With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Using Fused Fully Convolutional Network And Object-Oriented Image Analysis,"Ma, Hairong and Feng, Tianjing and Shen, Xiangcheng and Luo, Zhiqing and Chen, Pingting and Guan, Bo",2021,"The wide application of agricultural greenhouses globally has brought economic benefits; however, it has also led to many environmental problems. The timely and accurate acquisition of greenhouse areas and distribution is valuable for authorities seeking to optimize regional agricultural management and mitigate environmental pollution. Automatic extraction of the greenhouses from high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery based on deep learning can reduce labor costs and improve operational efficiency to have better application prospects. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel fused fully convolutional network (FCN) optimized by the optimal scale object-oriented segmentation results for agricultural greenhouse extraction from high spatial resolution RS imagery. First, to make full use of remote sensing feature images of target objects and to not increase the complexity of the deep learning network, we constructed a decision-level fusion FCN network that can simultaneously input multiple remote sensing images for preliminary extraction of greenhouse. Second, to address a defect in the classical FCN network causing the easy loss of ground object details, we optimized the preliminary extraction results from FCN by the results of object-oriented segmentation. Finally, the optimized greenhouse extraction results were processed by the mathematical morphology, and the final extraction results were obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Multi-channel fused FCN model could use the unique spectral characteristics of different ground objects. (2) Optimized initial extraction results from FCN based on the optimal scale object-oriented segmentation results could fully maintain the edge details of the greenhouse. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extract the greenhouse effectively. The precision and F value of our proposed method are 92.68\% and 0.94.

While new remote-sensing technologies are able to detect forest data in high quality and large quantity, operational applications are still limited by deficits of in situ verification. In situ sampling data as input is required in order to add value to physical imaging remote sensing observations and possibilities to interlink the forest health assessment with biotic and abiotic factors. Numerous methods on how to link remote sensing and in situ data have been presented in the scientific literature using e.g. empirical and physical-based models. In situ data differs in type, quality and quantity between case studies. The irregular subsets of in situ data availability limit the exploitation of available satellite remote sensing data. To achieve a broad implementation of satellite remote sensing data in forest monitoring and management, a standardization of in situ data, workflows and products is essential and necessary for user acceptance. The key focus of the review is a discussion of concept and is designed to bridge gaps of understanding between forestry and remote sensing science community. Methodological approaches for in situ/remote-sensing implementation are organized and evaluated with respect to qualifying for forest monitoring.

Satellite Remote Sensing For Forestry Planning—A Review,"Holmgren, P. and Thuresson, T.",1998,"This review attempts, from a critical perspective, to put 25 years of satellite remote sensing research into the context of forestry planning. It is limited to temperate and boreal regions and to remote sensing in the visible and near infra-red spectra. It is structured as follows: firstly, the forestry planning problem is defined and information requirements are identified; secondly, the attempts to use satellite remote sensing as an information source for forestry planning are reviewed, divided into the topics inventory and monitoring; and, finally, the methods for extracting forest information from satellite images are re-examined, and their inherent limitations and methodological weaknesses are discussed. It is concluded that satellite images seldom contain enough information to support the decision process in applied forestry. Although regional level applications may be useful, few successful and reliable applications for local forest inventory, planning or damage monitoring have evolved. Stratification for multi-stage sampling and monitoring of clear-cuts are areas in which satellite images have been shown to be feasible. However, it is doubtful whether the costs involved can be justified for such uses alone. A further conclusion is that many studies have adopted simplistic views of the information needs in the forestry planning process. These studies do not relate the analysis to management decisions, but instead assume that plain and approximate mapping of the forest has a great value. Present developments in the discipline involve complex modelling of reflectance, taking into consideration internal shading, topography and other features, yet without dramatic improvements compared with earlier studies. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing and digital image analysis are no longer technologically spectacular, facts which may affect future research in the discipline. It is, perhaps, time to draw the conclusion that current satellite sensors are not in general suitable for forestry planning, since (a) they contain little relevant information, and (b) for forest management planning purposes there are often more efficient ways of collecting the information required. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",holmgren_satelliteremotesensingforestry_1998,FALSE,class_round2,NA

A Simple Remote Sensing Based Information System For Monitoring Sites Of Conservation Importance,"Szantoi, Zoltan and Brink, Andreas and Buchanan, Graeme and Bastin, Lucy and Lupi, Andrea and Simonetti, Dario and Mayaux, Philippe and Peedell, Stephen and Davy, James",2016,"Monitoring is essential for conservation of sites, but capacity to undertake it in the field is often limited. Data collected by remote sensing has been identified as a partial solution to this problem, and is becoming a feasible option, since increasing quantities of satellite data in particular are becoming available to conservationists. When suitably classified, satellite imagery can be used to delineate land cover types such as forest, and to identify any changes over time. However, the conservation community lacks (a) a simple tool appropriate to the needs for monitoring change in all types of land cover (e.g. not just forest), and (b) an easily accessible information system which allows for simple land cover change analysis and data sharing to reduce duplication of effort. To meet these needs, we developed a web-based information system which allows users to assess land cover dynamics in and around protected areas (or other sites of conservation importance) from multi-temporal medium resolution satellite imagery. The system is based around an open access toolbox that pre-processes and classifies Landsat-type imagery, and then allows users to interactively verify the classification. These data are then open for others to utilize through the online information system. We first explain imagery processing and data accessibility features, and then demonstrate the toolbox and the value of user verification using a case study on Nakuru National Park, Kenya.

The study uses remote sensing methods to quantify forest ES supply in Namizimu Forest Reserve in Malawi, and links this to demand for ES within the villages near the reserve. It then investigates how a plausible set of CBM rules can be developed to cap consumption of forest products to sustainable amount and quantifies, by using monetary valuation techniques, how these set of rules may affect the total well-being of local population. Our results demonstrate that, due to the spatial mismatches between demand and supply, the distribution of provisioning ES to the population across the harvesting area is unequal in biophysical terms. The current available stock of forest products is sufficient to cover the current demand, however, it is higher than the mean annual increment indicating that this level of consumption is ecologically unsustainable and will lead to forest degradation as shown under the business-as-usual scenario. We then examined the impact of governance and how CBM rules to allocate forest ES to different social groups (poor and rich) under a co-management regime will affect total societal welfare. We found that the distributional scenario that maximises total societal welfare expressed in monetary terms across the whole harvesting area is the scenario that distributes 40\% of biomass to the rich group while the remaining 60\% is allocated to the poor group. However, this scenario maximises Willingness to Pay (WTP) at total level but does not maximise WTP in each sub-area of forest but just for those that have a high availability for biomass. This indicates that the distributional rules that maximise total welfare at aggregate level may not maximise welfare at local level where constraints from biomass availability require to restrict further the distribution of forest products. When biomass availability is low, total societal welfare is maximised with distributional rules that distribute more trees to richer. Yet, a policymaker may choose a distributional rule that distribute more trees to the poor on normative grounds and forego the objective of maximising total welfare. In such cases the WTP analysis outlined in this paper can support the policymaker in choosing the distributional rule that minimise trade-offs between efficiency, i.e., maximising total welfare, and livelihoods objectives.",dreoni_assessingwelfareimpactsforest_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA

During the next decade, NPOESS will provide global operational data to meet many of the needs of weather forecasters, climate researchers, and global decision makers for remotely sensed Earth science data and global environmental monitoring. The NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) will be launched in 2011 as a precursor to NPOESS to reduce final development risks for NPOESS and to provide continuity of global imaging and atmospheric sounding data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) missions. Beginning in 2014, NPOESS spacecraft will be launched into an afternoon orbit and in 2016 into an early-morning orbit to provide significantly improved operational capabilities and benefits to satisfy critical civil and national security requirements for space-based, remotely sensed environmental data. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Meteorological Operation (MetOp) spacecraft will complement NPOESS in a midmorning orbit. The joint constellation will provide global coverage with a data refresh rate of approximately four hours. NPOESS will observe more phenomena simultaneously from space and deliver a data volume significantly greater than its operational predecessors with substantially improved data delivery to users. Higher-resolution (spatial and spectral) and more accurate imaging and atmospheric sounding data will enable improvements in short-to medium-range weather forecasts. Multispectral and hyperspectral instruments on NPOESS will provide global imagery and sounding products useful to the forecaster that are complementary to those available from geostationary satellites. NPOESS will support the operational needs of meteorological, oceanographic, environmental, climatic, and space environmental remote sensing programs and provide continuity of data for climate researchers. This article that describes NPOESS was completed and accepted for publication prior to the White House decision in February 2010 ordering a major restructuring of the NPOESS program. The Department of Commerce will now assume primary responsibility for the afternoon polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite orbit and the Department of Defense will take primary responsibility for the early morning orbit. However, NPP, as described in this article, is still scheduled to be launched in 2011.

Assessment Of Landsat-Based Evapotranspiration Using Weighing Lysimeters In The Texas High Plains,"Hashem, Ahmed A. and Engel, Bernard A. and Bralts, Vincent F. and Marek, Gary W. and Moorhead, Jerry E. and Radwan, Sherif A. and Gowda, Prasanna H.",2020,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the largest data gaps in water management due to the limited availability of measured evapotranspiration data, and because ET spatial variability is difficult to characterize at various scales. Satellite-based ET estimation has been shown to have great potential for water resource planning and for estimating agricultural water use at field, watershed, and regional scales. Satellites with low spatial resolution, such as NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and those with higher spatial resolution, such as Landsat (Land Satellite), can potentially be used for irrigation water management purposes and other agricultural applications. The objective of this study is to assess satellite based-ET estimation accuracy using measured ET from large weighing lysimeters. Daily, seven-day running average, monthly, and seasonal satellite-based ET data were compared with corresponding lysimeter ET data. This study was performed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) in Bushland, Texas, USA. The daily time series Landsat ET estimates were characterized as poor for irrigated fields, with a Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) of 0.37, and good for monthly ET, with an NSE of 0.57. For the dryland managed fields, the daily and monthly ET estimates were unacceptable with an NSE of -1.38 and -0.19, respectively. There are various reasons for these results, including uncertainties with remotely sensed data due to errors in aerodynamic resistance surface roughness length estimation, surface temperature deviations between irrigated and dryland conditions, poor leaf area estimation in the METRIC model under dryland conditions, extended gap periods between satellite data, and using the linear interpolation method to extrapolate daily ET values between two consecutive scenes (images).",hashem_assessmentlandsatbasedevapotranspiration_2020,FALSE,class_round2,NA

The use of orbital images for the accomplishment of these studies allows a reduction of the costs involved, greater agility and constancy in the access to the data and, it consents, a holistic evaluation, analyzing with more precision and detail several environmental components present in the region of interest. This paper aimed to analyze the spectral responses in the visible and infrared bands and to compare values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained by the OLI - Landsat 8 and MSI - Sentinel 2 sensors in the semi - arid region that comprises part of the territory of the basin of the Moxotó river. When analyzing the spectral response of each of the sensors, it is evident that there are clear differences between the bands that provide the computation of the NDVI, which are the red and near infrared bands that could generate different values of the same index in the same area. Despite the differences between the Landsat-8 / OLI and Sentinel-2 / MSI optical sensors, they presented similar statistical moments between the bands compared. The NDVI in the studied period presented mean values for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 equal to 0.383 and 0.387, respectively, and a strong correlation equal to 0.871 among the sensors. The MSI-Sentinel-2 sensor allowed a greater delineation of the targets due to its greater spatial resolution, allowing greater confidence for monitoring and management of the environment. © 2018; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. all rights reserved.",bezerra_comparisonnormalizeddifferencevegetation_2018,FALSE,class_round2,NA

It has since evolved into a freeware product primarily targeted for spatial site investigation and soil remediation design, though its applications have extended into many diverse environmental disciplines that emphasize the spatial distribution of data. Because of the variety of algorithms incorporated, the user interface is engineered in a consistent and scalable manner to expose additional functionality without a burdensome increase in complexity. The scalable environment permits it to be used for both application and research goals, especially investigating spatial aspects important for estimating environmental exposures and designing efficient remedial designs.

Feature Weighted Attention-Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Model For Change Detection In Remote Sensing Images,"Patra, Raj Kumar and Patil, Sujata N. and Falkowski-Gilski, Przemyslaw and Lubniewski, Zbigniew and Poongodan, Rachana",2022,"In remote sensing images, change detection (CD) is required in many applications, such as: resource management, urban expansion research, land management, and disaster assessment. Various deep learning-based methods were applied to satellite image analysis for change detection, yet many of them have limitations, including the overfitting problem. This research proposes the Feature Weighted Attention (FWA) in Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) method to reduce the overfitting problem and increase the performance of classification in change detection applications. Additionally, data usage and accuracy in remote sensing activities, particularly CD, can be significantly improved by a large number of training models based on BiLSTM. Normalization techniques are applied to input images in order to enhance the quality and reduce the difference in pixel value. The AlexNet and VGG16 models were used to extract useful features from the normalized images. The extracted features were then applied to the FWA-BiLSTM model, to give more weight to the unique features and increase the efficiency of classification. The attention layer selects the unique features that help to distinguish the changes in the remote sensing images. From the experimental results, it was clearly shown that the proposed FWA-BiLSTM model achieved better performance in terms of precision (93.43\%), recall (93.16\%), and overall accuracy (99.26\%), when compared with the existing Difference-enhancement Dense-attention Convolutional Neural Network (DDCNN) model.",patra_featureweightedattentionbidirectional_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Auto-Detection And Hiding Of Sensitive Targets In Emergency Mapping Based On Remote Sensing Data,"Lu, P. and Xu, D. and Ren, F. and Xu, S. and Qiu, T. and Peng, R.",2020,"Objectives: Emergency remote sensing mapping can provide support for decision-making in disaster assessment or disaster relief, and therefore plays an important role in disaster response.Traditional emergency remote sensing mapping methods use the decryption algorithms based on manual retrieval and image editing tools when processing sensitive targets. Although the traditional methods can achieve target recognition, they are inefficient and cannot meet the immediate requirements of disaster relief, which are unable to be released or applied in time. The main objective is to propose a method for auto-detecting and hiding of sensitive targets in emergency remote sensing mapping to accelerate the rapid production and release emergency remote sensing products.Methods: Because of the huge size of remote sensing images, it is not realistic to directly hide sensitive targets. We propose a two-stage processing method automatic target detection and hiding of sensitive targets method, which consists of two neural network models: target detection model and generative adversarial network model. Firstly, Mask R-CNN, a well-known and effective target detection method, was used to detect sensitive targets from massive remote sensing data and generate target coordinates and Masks. Then, Deepfill model, one of GAN(generative adversarial networks) models, can ignore other normal areas and directly hide sensitive objects in the local area based on the coordinates and Masks information. The aircraft objects in the remote sensing image was used as an application example to verify the feasibility of our method, furthermore, we added the reconstruction of loss function, candidate frame optimization of region recommendation network, Mask optimization algorithm, and attention mechanism reconstruction based on the characteristics of the aircraft objects. Mask R-CNN model and Deepfill model have different training principles, so we trained and tuned them separately, and finally combine the trained models. We randomly extracted images from RSOD(remote sensing object detection) and DOTA(a large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images) to form a new dataset. A total of 1 607 images were obtained for Mask R-CNN model training, and 9 502 images were used for Deepfill model training. All these samples are divided into training set and verification set according to the ratio of 0.8: 0.2. The performance of the Mask R-CNN model was evaluated by precision, recall rate, missing detect rate and F1-score; the performance evaluation indicators of the Deepfill model are PSNR(peak signal to noise ratio) and SSIM(structural similarity).Results: 46 images were extracted separately from the original dataset to test the performance of the trained models. In the target detect stage, the accuracy of the benchmark model was 98.13%, the recall rate was 44.21%, the missed detection rate was 55.79%, and the F1-score was 60.96%. Many targets were not detected. For comparison, the accuracy of our method reaches 94.65%, the recall rate reaches 81.89%, which is 85.23% higher than the benchmark model; the missed detection rate reaches 18.11%, which is 67.54% lower than the benchmark model; the F1-score reaches 87.81%, which is 44.05% higher than the benchmark model. In the inpainting stage, the average PSNR in this method reaches 32.26, and the average SSIM value is 0.98.Conclusions: In the proposed method, the recall rate and F1-score of aircraft targets in remote sensing images have been significantly improved, the inpainting processing effect is reasonable and natural, and the overall time of the emergency remote sensing mapping process is saved, indicating that the two-stage model works well. In the future, it can further expand the detection and processing of other sensitive targets, accelerate the production and release efficiency of disaster emergency response map products, and thus improve the ability of disaster prevention and relief. © 2020, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

Applicability Of Ordinary Kriging Modeling Techniques For Filling Satellite Data Gaps In Support Of Coastal Management,"Kostopoulou, Elena",2021,"Effective coastal zone management relies on accurate and sound data of environmental parameters. In many cases, however, lack of pertinent environmental variable datasets hinders the development of sustainable policies and practices. Marine remote sensing has been used extensively to provide such datasets, with limited success due to different spatial resolutions, non-overlapping grids, and different spatial extent, since, in most cases, they are derived from miscellaneous sources. Several methods have been proposed aiming to overcome this problem and enable remote-sensing techniques to attain the highest possible applicability in coastal ecosystem management studies. Most of these techniques use interpolation modeling techniques for satellite data gap filling near the shoreline. This paper presents the use of the Ordinary Kriging (OK) methodology, as an interpolator of satellite data, from miscellaneous and variant environmental datasets of the territorial waters of the Heraklion Prefecture, on the island of Crete. The applicability of OK in satellite data gap filling was examined by the use of cross-validation, taking into account resolution levels for optimum estimations. In addition, a number of diagnostic statistics were employed to evaluate the performance of the interpolation models used. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is valid and independent of remote-sensing data characteristics, thus proving that OK can be used to homogenize effectively and integrate fully diverse satellite datasets. This study concludes that the methodology described in predicting estimates of missing values of satellite data with statistical certainty can be used as an effective tool in coastal management.",kostopoulou_applicabilityordinarykrigingmodeling_2021,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Anticipating Social Equity Impacts In Redd Plus Policy Design: An Example From The Democratic Republic Of Congo,"Pelletier, Johanne and Horning, Ned and Laporte, Nadine and Samndong, Raymond Achu and Goetz, Scott",2018,"Equity is a sensitive topic discussed under the REDD + mechanism. This study focuses on the impact of prevailing social and ecological conditions on the potential equity outcome of REDD + intervention at the local level. Working at a REDD + pilot project site in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we present a quantitative framework to assess contextual equity at the village level. We conducted a full community census on household characteristics and livelihood practices to evaluate current social conditions. We used participatory mapping and remote sensing analysis of a time series of very high resolution imagery over a 10-year period within the village boundaries to examine the ecological context of land use. We identify important differences between 379 households in terms of social characteristics and livelihoods practices. Social differentiation strongly relates to customary land rights as well as gender, ethnicity and origin. Using this case study, we find REDD + activities that can be implemented under the prevailing ecological conditions could impact community members differently, by reducing access to land for a segment of the population that is already under stress, and therefore have implications on equity in both space and time. We identify important risks for sectors of the population that do not have the contextual features necessary for benefitting from REDD + implementation and may be impacted, directly and indirectly, by decisions linked to benefit-sharing. We argue that such quantitative assessment is valuable to inform REDD + policy design on the way livelihood practices and social characteristics are inter linked and how they affect forest cover change. This information can be used to anticipate potential equity issues that may arise with REDD + implementation. We suggest that contextually informed definitions of the benefits and costs are critical for achieving equity in benefit-sharing. A flexible adaptive management and equity conscious approach is recommended from the policy design to implementation, by anticipating and mitigating potential risks of REDD + interventions in order to promote equitable outcomes at the local level.",pelletier_anticipatingsocialequityimpacts_2018,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Decision Support Toolkit For Integrated Analysis And Design Of Reclaimed Water Infrastructure,"Lee, Eun Jung and Criddle, Craig S. and Geza, Mengistu and Cath, Tzahi Y. and Freyberg, David. L.",2018,"Planning of water reuse systems is a complex endeavor. We have developed a software toolkit, IRIPT (Integrated Urban Reclaimed Water Infrastructure Planning Toolkit) that facilitates planning and design of reclaimed water infrastructure for both centralized and hybrid configurations that incorporate satellite treatment plants (STPs). The toolkit includes a Pipeline Designer (PRODOT) that optimizes routing and sizing of pipelines for wastewater capture and reclaimed water distribution, a Selector (SeIWTP) that assembles and optimizes wastewater treatment trains, and a Calculator (CalcBenefit) that estimates fees, revenues, and subsidies of alternative designs. For hybrid configurations, a Locator (LocSTP) optimizes siting of STPs and associated wastewater diversions by identifying manhole locations where the, flow rates are sufficient to ensure that wastewater extracted and treated at an adjacent STP can generate the revenue needed to pay for treatment and delivery to customers. Practical local constraints are also applied to screen and identify STP locations. Once suitable sites are selected, System Integrator (Tool Integrator) identifies a set of centralized and hybrid configurations that: (1) maximize reclaimed water supply, (2) maximize reclaimed water supply while also ensuring a financial benefit for the system, and (3) maximize the net financial benefit for the system. The resulting configurations are then evaluated by an Analyst (SANNA) that uses monetary and non-monetary criteria, with weights assigned to appropriate metrics by a decision-maker, to identify a preferred configuration. To illustrate the structure, assumptions, and use, of IRIPT, we apply it to a case study for the city of Golden, CO. The criteria weightings provided by a local decision-maker lead to a preference for a centralized configuration in this case. The Golden case study demonstrates that IRIPT can efficiently analyze centralized and hybrid water reuse configurations and rank them according to decision-makers' preferences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Optimization Of Intersatellite Link Assignment Based On Reinforcement Learning,"Ren, Weiwu and Zhu, Jialin and Qi, Hui and Cong, Ligang and Di, Xiaoqiang",2022,"Intersatellite links can reduce the dependence of satellite communication systems on ground networks, reduce the number of ground gateways, and reduce the complexity and investment of ground networks, which are important future trends in satellite development. Intersatellite links are dynamic over time, and different intersatellite topologies have a great impact on satellite network performance. To improve the overall performance of satellite networks, a satellite link assignment optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed in this article. Different from the swarm intelligence method in principle, this algorithm models the combinatorial optimization problem of links as the optimal sequence decision problem of a series of link selection actions. Realistic constraints such as intersatellite visibility, network connectivity, and number of antenna beams are regarded as fully observable environmental factors. The agent selects the link according to the decision, and the selection action utility affects the next selection decision. After a finite number of iterations, the optimal link assignment scheme with minimum link delay is achieved.

Underground Water Level Prediction In Remote Sensing Images Using Improved Hydro Index Value With Ensemble Classifier,"Stateczny, Andrzej and Narahari, Sujatha Canavoy and Vurubindi, Padmavathi and Guptha, Nirmala S. and Srinivas, Kalyanapu",2023,"The economic sustainability of aquifers across the world relies on accurate and rapid estimates of groundwater storage changes, but this becomes difficult due to the absence of in-situ groundwater surveys in most areas. By closing the water balance, hydrologic remote sensing measures offer a possible method for quantifying changes in groundwater storage. However, it is uncertain to what extent remote sensing data can provide an accurate assessment of these changes. Therefore, a new framework is implemented in this work for predicting the underground water level using remote sensing images. Generally, the water level is defined into five levels: Critical, Overexploited, Safe, Saline, and Semi-critical, based on water quantity. In this manuscript, the remote sensing images were acquired from remote sensing images. At first, Wiener filtering was employed for preprocessing. Secondly, the Vegetation Indexes (VI) (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Infrared index (IRI), Radar Vegetation Index (RVI)), and statistical features (entropy, Root Mean Square (RMS), Skewness, and Kurtosis) were extracted from the preprocessed remote sensing images. Then, the extracted features were combined as a novel hydro index, which was fed to the Ensemble Classifier (EC): Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models for underground water level prediction in the remote sensing images. The obtained results prove the efficacy of the proposed framework by using different performance measures. The results shows that the False Positive Rate (FPR) of the proposed EC model is 0.0083, which is better than that of existing methods. On the other hand, the proposed EC model has a high accuracy of 0.90, which is superior to the existing traditional models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU).",stateczny_undergroundwaterlevelprediction_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA

A New Framework Of 17 Hydrological Ecosystem Services (Hess17) For Supporting River Basin Planning And Environmental Monitoring,"Ha, Lan Thanh and Bastiaanssen, Wim G. M. and Simons, Gijs W. H. and Poortinga, Ate",2023,"Hydrological ecosystem services (HESS) describe the benefits of water for multiple purposes with an emphasis on environmental values. The value of HESS is often not realized because primary benefits (e.g., food production, water withdrawals) get the most attention. Secondary benefits such as water storage, purification or midday temperature cooling are often overlooked. This results in an incorrect evaluation of beneficial water usage in urban and rural resettlements and misunderstandings when land use changes are introduced. The objective of this paper is to propose a standard list of 17 HESS indicators that are in line with the policy and philosophy of the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and that are measurable with earth observation technologies in conjunction with GIS and hydrological models. The HESS17 framework considered indicators that can be directly related to water flows, water fluxes and water stocks; they have a natural characteristic with minimal anthropogenic influence and must be quantifiable by means of earth observation models in combination with GIS and hydrological models. The introduction of a HESS framework is less meaningful without proper quantification procedures in place. Because of the widely diverging management options, the role of water should be categorized as (i) consumptive use (i.e., evapotranspiration and dry matter production) and (ii) non-consumptive use (stream flow, recharge, water storage). Governments and responsible agencies for integrated water management should recognize the need to include HESS17 in water allocation policies, water foot-printing, water accounting, transboundary water management, food security purposes and spatial land-use planning processes. The proposed HESS17 framework and associated methods can be used to evaluate land, soil and water conservation programs.

However, satellite data are currently underused within the biodiversity research and conservation communities. Three factors have significant impact on the utility of remote sensing data for tracking and understanding biodiversity change. They are its continuity, affordability, and access. Data continuity relates to the maintenance of long-term satellite data products. Such products promote knowledge of how biodiversity has changed over time and why. Data affordability arises from the cost of the imagery. New data policies promoting free and open access to government satellite imagery are expanding the use of certain imagery but the number of free and open data sets remains too limited. Data access addresses the ability of conservation biologists and biodiversity researchers to discover, retrieve, manipulate, and extract value from satellite imagery as well as link it with other types of information. Tools are rapidly improving access.

Land Use And Land Cover Mapping In Wetlands One Step Closer To The Ground: Sentinel-2 Versus Landsat 8,"Sánchez-Espinosa, A. and Schröder, C.",2019,"Environmental studies with Landsat images have revealed many of the problems faced by wetland ecosystem, which are crucial for the conservation of biodiversity and the natural values of our planet. The study of LULC changes in wetlands through remote sensing constantly helps to identify and combat their main environmental threats improving the conservation of these natural habitats. Starting in mid-2015, the Sentinel-2 satellite opens new possibilities in the field of earth observation thanks to its higher spatial, spectral and temporal resolution becoming a powerful source of information for LULC monitoring in wetland areas. However, researchers may ask them selves to what extent Sentinel-2 is an improvement over Landsat 8 for general purposes. This research test if there is a real difference in the quality of the results delivered by both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery when basic classification methods are applied. The study uses Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery to produce LULC maps in a Mediterranean wetland area applying an object based classification method in order to compare the accuracy and reliability in the surface detected by both satellites. The results show that an object based classification using only the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 image information, without band indexes or ancillary data, offers very similar results for most LULC classes, being the overall accuracy around 87–88% with slightly better results when using Sentinel-2. Although using Sentinel-2 leads to an increase in file size and processing times, the analysis of certain LULC classes presents an improvement compared to Landsat 8, detecting more linear and small size elements with a better delineation of image features in the classified map. However, these improvements should not underestimate the value of Landsat imagery in the future since both satellites provide high precision information, so they can and should coexist and be used together to increase data availability in order to have the best possible results in remote sensing research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",sanchezespinosa_landlandcovermapping_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Fuzzy Object-Based Image Analysis Methods Using Sentinel-2a And Landsat-8 Data To Map And Characterize Soil Surface Residue,"Najafi, Payam and Navid, Hossein and Feizizadeh, Bakhtiar and Eskandari, Iraj and Blaschke, Thomas",2019,"Soil degradation, defined as the lowering and loss of soil functions, is becoming a serious problem worldwide and threatens agricultural production and terrestrial ecosystems. The surface residue of crops is one of the most effective erosion control measures and it increases the soil moisture content. In some areas of the world, the management of soil surface residue (SSR) is crucial for increasing soil fertility, maintaining high soil carbon levels, and reducing the degradation of soil due to rain and wind erosion. Standard methods of measuring the residue cover are time and labor intensive, but remote sensing can support the monitoring of conservation tillage practices applied to large fields. We investigated the potential of per-pixel and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for detecting and estimating the coverage of SSRs after tillage and planting practices for agricultural research fields in Iran using tillage indices for Landsat-8 and novel indices for Sentinel-2A. For validation, SSR was measured in the field through line transects at the beginning of the agricultural season (prior to autumn crop planting). Per-pixel approaches for Landsat-8 satellite images using normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) and simple tillage index (STI) yielded coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.727 and 0.722, respectively. We developed comparable novel indices for Sentinel-2A satellite data that yielded R-2 values of 0.760 and 0.759 for NDTI and STI, respectively, which means that the Sentinel data better matched the ground truth data. We tested several OBIA methods and achieved very high overall accuracies of up to 0.948 for Sentinel-2A and 0.891 for Landsat-8 with a membership function method. The OBIA methods clearly outperformed per-pixel approaches in estimating SSR and bear the potential to substitute or complement ground-based techniques.",najafi_fuzzyobjectbasedimage_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Suitability Of Satellite Remote Sensing Data For Yield Estimation In Northeast Germany,"Vallentin, Claudia and Harfenmeister, Katharina and Itzerott, Sibylle and Kleinschmit, Birgit and Conrad, Christopher and Spengler, Daniel",2022,"Information provided by satellite data is becoming increasingly important in the field of agriculture. Estimating biomass, nitrogen content or crop yield can improve farm management and optimize precision agriculture applications. A vast amount of data is made available both as map material and from space. However, it is up to the user to select the appropriate data for a particular problem. Without the appropriate knowledge, this may even entail an economic risk. This study therefore investigates the direct relationship between satellite data from six different optical sensors as well as different soil and relief parameters and yield data from cereal and canola recorded by the thresher in the field. A time series of 13 years is considered, with 947 yield data sets consisting of dense point data sets and 755 satellite images. To answer the question of how well the relationship between remote sensing data and yield is, the correlation coefficient r per field is calculated and interpreted in terms of crop type, phenology, and sensor characteristics. The correlation value r is particularly high when a field and its crop are spatially heterogeneous and when the correct phenological time of the crop is reached at the time of satellite imaging. Satellite images with higher resolution, such as RapidEye and Sentinel-2 performed better in comparison with lower resolution sensors of the Landsat series. The additional Red Edge spectral band also has advantage, especially for cereal yield estimation.

Thematic Portfolio Optimization: Challenging The Core Satellite Approach,"Methling, Florian and von Nitzsch, Ruediger",2019,"In recent years, thematic exchange-traded funds (ETF) have increased in economic significance. Investors in thematic ETFs have more than just financial objectives and gain a non-monetary added value from a thematic portion in their portfolios. Therefore, traditional portfolio optimization models which target only financial criteria cannot suit these investors' needs anymore. Nevertheless, to account for their thematic interests, investors adapt a core satellite strategy in which conventional core portfolios and thematic satellite portfolios are combined. Thus, these portfolios are separately optimized without further considering inter-portfolio correlation effects. Since modern portfolio theory has originally been established to, inter alia, optimize these correlation effects, portfolios can only be efficient by chance. Therefore, this study targets the correlation effects between conventional and thematic portfolios and uses a tri-criterion thematic portfolio optimization model as an overall framework. Throughout a two-part analysis with tradable ETFs and a simulation with 250,000 draws and 1,750,000 portfolio optimizations performed, the status quo is compared to the tri-criterion model. Quantifying the suboptimality, simulation results show a mean portfolio improvement of 6.23\% measured as relative yield enhancement. Further, our analysis concludes that the more narrowly a theme is defined and the more particular it is, relative yield enhancements can increase up to 46.88\%.",methling_thematicportfoliooptimizationchallenging_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Disruptive Technologies For Improving Water Security In Large River Basins,"Harshadeep, Nagaraja Rao and Young, William",2020,"Large river basins present significant challenges for water resource planning and management. They typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic regimes, are characterized by complex and variable hydrology, and span multiple jurisdictions with diverse water demands and values. They are often data-poor and in many developing economies are characterized by weak water governance. Rapid global change is seeing significant changes to the pressures on the water resources of large basins, exacerbating the challenge of sustainable water management. Diverse technologies have long supported water resource planning and development, from data collection, analytics, simulation, to decision-making, and real-time operations. In the last two decades however, a rapid increase in the range, capability, and accessibility of new technologies, coupled with large reductions in cost, mean there are increasing opportunities for emerging technologies to significantly ""disrupt"" traditional approaches to water resources management. In this paper, we consider the application of 'disruptive technologies' in water resources management in large river basins, through a lens of improving water security. We discuss the role of different actors and institutions for water management considering a range of emerging disruptive technologies. We consider the risks and benefits associated with the use of these technologies and discuss the barriers to their widespread adoption. We obverse a positive trend away from the reliance solely on centralized government institutions and traditional modeling for the collection and analysis of data, towards a more open and dynamic 'data and knowledge ecosystem' that draws upon data services at different levels (global to local) to support water planning and operations. We expect that technological advances and cost reductions will accelerate, fueling increased incremental adoption of new technologies in water resources planning and management. Large-basin analytics could become virtually free for users with global, regional, and national development agencies absorbing the costs of development and any subscription services for end users (e.g., irrigators) to help improve water management at user level and improve economic productivity. Collectively, these changes can help to 'democratize' water management through improved access to data and information. However, disruptive technologies can also be deployed in top-down or centralized processes, and so their use is sometimes contested or misunderstood. Increased attention therefore needs to be given to ensuring equity in technology access, and to strengthening the governance context for technology deployment. Widespread adoption of disruptive technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals are trained, increased adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations, and careful consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues.",harshadeep_disruptivetechnologiesimprovingwater_2020,FALSE,class_round2,NA

This article presents a case study of Guatemala and compares the simulated VIIRS-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with MODIS-NDVI for four different dates each in 2003 and 2005. The dissimilarity between VIIRS-NDVI and MODIS-NDVI was examined on the basis of the percent difference, the two-tailed student's t-test, and the coefficient of determination, R2. The per cent difference was found to be within 3%, the p-value ranged between 0.52 and 0.99, and R2 exceeded 0.88 for all major types of vegetation (basic grains, rubber, sugarcane, coffee and forests) found in Guatemala.

However, existing remote sensing image super-resolution methods may fail in many real-world scenarios because they are trained on ﻿synthetic data generated by a single degradation model or on﻿ ﻿a limited amount of real data collected from specific satellites. ﻿To achieve super-resolution of real-world remote sensing images with different qualities in a unified framework, we propose a practical degradation model and a kernel-aware network (KANet). The proposed degradation model ﻿includes ﻿blur kernels estimated from real images and blur kernels generated from pre-defined distributions, which improves the diversity of training data and covers more real-world scenarios. ﻿The proposed KANet consists of a kernel prediction subnetwork and a kernel-aware super-resolution subnetwork. The ﻿former estimates the blur kernel of each ﻿image, making it possible to cope with real images of different qualities in an adaptive way.

An example involves the mental health challenges of long-duration spaceflight (such as a Mars mission), including prolonged confinement, microgravity, and different sunlight exposure lengths. Persisting on Earth are global mental health challenges stemming from disease burdens, limited interview-based diagnostic systems, trial-and-error treatment approaches, and suboptimal access. There is potential for cross-pollinating solutions between these seemingly disparate challenges using a range of emerging technologies such as sensors,'omics', and big data. In this review, we highlight the bidirectional value of mental health technology transfer aimed to address issues both on Earth and in space.

Progress And Prospect Of Chinese Ocean Satellites,"Jiang, X. and Lin, M. and Zhang, Y.",2016,"China attaches great importance to the development of marine remote sensing and monitoring technology. The ocean remote sensing systems with complementary vantages offer significant economic and social benefits. HY-1A/B data have been widely used in sea surface temperature forecasting, sea ice operational monitoring in winter, red tide and green tide monitoring in summer, dynamic monitoring of coastal zones, coastal water quality monitoring, and fishery remote sensing. The HY-2A satellite fills the gaps of ocean dynamic environment satellite remote sensing and is the world's only in-orbit comprehensive ocean dynamic environment satellite that carries active and passive microwave remote sensors. HY-2A can simultaneously obtain data on sea-surface wind field, significant wave height, sea surface height, and sea surface temperature. The effectiveness of ocean environment monitoring and catastrophic sea condition forecasting has been improved with the use of satellite data. Ocean satellites provide reliable remote sensing data to the national economy and defense construction, marine scientific research, and global change research. They also play an important role in the international Earth observation system and are highly recognized by domestic and foreign users.HY-1 and HY-2 series satellites lay a solid foundation for the establishment of a sound ocean environment stereo monitoring system in China. With national development and the implementation of ""the Belt and Road"" strategy in China, the construction of maritime power, the safeguarding of marine rights and interests, and the development of marine economy demand high requirements and emphasize the urgent need for ocean remote sensing. Therefore, the ""Long-term Development Plan of Civil Space Infrastructure (2015-2025)"" is focused on the national maritime power strategy and establishes the plan for the ocean satellite series. This development plan is aimed at supporting the areas of marine resource survey, environment protection, disaster prevention and reduction, rights and interests safeguarding, management of sea areas, island and coastal zone investigation, and the polar ocean expedition of China.

Satellite remote sensing is well-positioned to aid in the identification and mapping of cyanoHABs and their dynamics, giving freshwater resource managers a tool for both rapid and long-term protection of public health. Monitoring cyanoHABs in lakes and reservoirs with remote sensing requires robust processing techniques for generating accurate and consistent products across local and global scales at high revisit rates. We leveraged the high spatial and temporal resolution chlorophyll-a (Chla) and phycocyanin (PC) maps from two multispectral satellite sensors, the Sentinel-2 (S2) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and the Sentinel-3 (S3) Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) respectively, to study bloom dynamics in Utah Lake, United States, for 2018. We used established Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to map Chla from MSI and train new MDNs for PC retrieval from OLCI, using the same architecture and training dataset previously proven for PC retrieval from hyperspectral imagery. Our assessment suggests lower median uncertainties and biases (i.e., 42\% and -4\%, respectively) than that of existing top-performing PC algorithms. Additionally, we compared bloom trends in MDN-based PC and Chla products to those from a satellite-derived cyanobacteria cell density estimator, the cyanobacteria index (CI-cyano), to evaluate their utility in the context of public health risk management.

Global Path Planning Of Unmanned Vehicle Based On Fusion Of A* Algorithm And Voronoi Field,"Zhao, J. and Ma, X. and Yang, B. and Chen, Y. and Zhou, Z. and Xiao, P.",2022,"Purpose: Since many global path planning algorithms cannot achieve the planned path with both safety and economy, this study aims to propose a path planning method for unmanned vehicles with a controllable distance from obstacles. Design/methodology/approach: First, combining satellite image and the Voronoi field algorithm (VFA) generates rasterized environmental information and establishes navigation area boundary. Second, establishing a hazard function associated with navigation area boundary improves the evaluation function of the A* algorithm and uses the improved A* algorithm for global path planning. Finally, to reduce the number of redundant nodes in the planned path and smooth the path, node optimization and gradient descent method (GDM) are used. Then, a continuous smooth path that meets the actual navigation requirements of unmanned vehicle is obtained. Findings: The simulation experiment proved that the proposed global path planning method can realize the control of the distance between the planned path and the obstacle by setting different navigation area boundaries. The node reduction rate is between 33.52% and 73.15%, and the smoothness meets the navigation requirements. This method is reasonable and effective in the global path planning process of unmanned vehicle and can provide reference to unmanned vehicles’ autonomous obstacle avoidance decision-making.

While it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of extreme flood events, disaster planning can help in mitigating its detrimental effects. Monitoring flood extent using satellite observations just after the flood disasters is a core component of rapid emergency response process, which enables the emergency rescue teams to prioritize their efforts in critical areas to save lives and protect health, in addition to providing near real-time flooding information to the decision makers and planners. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the utility of less data intensive, but equally robust hydrodynamic models to develop flood extent maps in conjunction with freely available remote sensing imageries at different scales.

Combining Satellite-Derived Pm2.5 Data And A Reduced-Form Air Quality Model To Support Air Quality Analysis In Us Cities,"Gallagher, Ciaran L. and Holloway, Tracey and Tessum, Christopher W. and Jackson, Clara M. and Heck, Colleen",2023,"Air quality models can support pollution mitigation design by simulating policy scenarios and conducting source contribution analyses. The Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is a powerful tool for equitable policy design as its variable resolution grid enables intra-urban analysis, the scale of which most environmental justice inquiries are levied. However, InMAP underestimates particulate sulfate and overestimates particulate ammonium formation, errors that limit the model's relevance to city-scale decision-making. To reduce InMAP's biases and increase its relevancy for urban-scale analysis, we calculate and apply scaling factors (SFs) based on observational data and advanced models. We consider both satellite-derived speciated PM2.5 from Washington University and ground-level monitor measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, applied with different scaling methodologies. Relative to ground-monitor data, the unscaled InMAP model fails to meet a normalized mean bias performance goal of <+/- 10\% for most of the PM2.5 components it simulates (pSO(4): -48\%, pNO(3): 8\%, pNH(4): 69\%), but with city-specific SFs it achieves the goal benchmarks for every particulate species. Similarly, the normalized mean error performance goal of <35\% is not met with the unscaled InMAP model (pSO(4): 53\%, pNO(3): 52\%, pNH(4): 80\%) but is met with the city-scaling approach (15\%-27\%). The city-specific scaling method also improves the R-2 value from 0.11 to 0.59 (ranging across particulate species) to the range of 0.36-0.76. Scaling increases the percent pollution contribution of electric generating units (EGUs) (nationwide 4\%) and non-EGU point sources (nationwide 6\%) and decreases the agriculture sector's contribution (nationwide -6\%).Plain Language Summary Air quality models can support the design of pollution reduction strategies by assessing sources of pollution and simulating policy scenarios. The Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is an air quality model that can evaluate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) differences within cities, which makes it valuable as tool to assess equity of PM2.5 exposure. However, InMAP's simplified atmospheric chemistry equations results in errors that limit the model's relevance to city-scale decision-making. To reduce the model's biases and errors, we calculate and apply SFs based on observational data and advanced models, specifically ground-level monitor measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a satellite-derived data product. We find that applying SFs derived from satellite observations over cities or individual grid-cells improves model performance.

Applying Optimization Technology In Reservoir Management,"Vasantharajan, S. and Al-Hussainy, R. and Heinemann, R. F.",2006,"This paper presents the application of optimization techniques in reservoir management to determine the best development plan that maximizes the economic performance of an asset. A distinguishing characteristic of this approach is that it can evaluate all feasible scenarios for a specific financial objective within a set of well-defined constraints. The output of this integrated workflow is a complete set of decisions that drive capital investment, development scheduling, production, hydrocarbon recovery, and, ultimately, economic performance of the asset. The conventional approach to reservoir manage ment often considers a limited number of development options because of the complexity of the events within an investment plan and the time required for the evaluation. Input into the decision-making process traditionally comes in the form of sensitivity analyses from reservoir simulation, cost engineering, wellbore planning, pipeline networking, and project economic-analysis tools. These technologies are used to simulate performance by examining a specific development scenario, calculating future production, and performing a discounted cash-flow analysis to assess the return on the required investment. The exact scheduling of n ew infrastructure and production facilities as well as the drilling and stimulation of additional wells is critical to maximizing economic performance, especially if remaining reserves are material in size. These discrete events sometimes receive little attention. While the industry's ability to predict asset performance and assimilate several diverse perspectives together has significantly advanced, many reservoir-management decisions still are based on heuristics, rules of thumb, analogs to other assets, and ease of execution. Use of optimization techniques is not new in the energy busi ness. However, in reservoir management, the technology must cope with more nonlinear phenomena within the physical system, complex and realistic objective functions and constraints, and discrete decisions that occur at distinct points over the asset life. The use of mixed-integer nonlinear programming algorithms can be useful in these situations. These algorithms implicitly construct a tree of all possible development plans and then efficiently prune the branches to eliminate candidates that can be shown to be nonoptimal. The effectiveness of optimization technology is illustrated by applying it to the ongoing expansion of a regional complex of gas reservoirs. The approach is used to determine the development schedule of the different reservoirs and the timing of their wells, the timing and staging of compression, and the development of satellites to meet a contract specification. The results demonstrate four cornerstones of reservoir management that are key to maximizing economic performance: ordering - the schedule of events in the development schedule; integraton - coupled consideration of the total physical system; objective - the appropriate choice of a performance metric; and decision making - determining the developement plan that maximizes value.

"Land Use Land Cover Mapping Using Advanced Machine Learning Classifiers: A Case Study Of Shiraz City, Iran","Jamali, Ali",2020,"Due to the recent climate changes and their consequences such as flash floods and droughts, there is a need for Land Use Land Cover mapping to monitor environmental changes which have effects on ecology, policy management, health, and disaster management. It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by climate change, and on the other hand, population growth has increased the rate of urbanization in Iran, where people are moving from rural areas to urban areas. In this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Complex Tree (CTree), are used for land cover mapping. An advanced supervised algorithm, namely the Derivative-free Multi-layer Perceptron (FDMLP), which is based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function, is developed in MATLAB programming language. The FDMLP uses a derivative-free function for the optimization of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used for LULC mapping as well.

We leverage recent advances in remote sensing and air pollution modelling to examine this question at a landscape scale. Combining data on daily PM2.5 levels with satellite measures of no-till uptake since 2005, we show a strong association between increasing adoption of no-till and reductions in county average PM2.5 pollution over more than 28 million hectares of cropland in the American Corn Belt. The reduction in local pollution implies substantial monetary benefits from reductions in mortality that are roughly one-fourth as large as the estimated carbon benefits. The benefits of mortality reductions are also, by themselves, nearly equal to the current monetary costs of subsidizing no-till practices.",behrer_levelstillagriculturelower_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Benefits Of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing For Tracking Plant Invasions,"He, Kate S. and Rocchini, Duccio and Neteler, Markus and Nagendra, Harini",2011,"Aim We aim to report what hyperspectral remote sensing can offer for invasion ecologists and review recent progress made in plant invasion research using hyperspectral remote sensing. Location United States. Methods We review the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing for detecting, mapping and predicting the spatial spread of invasive species. We cover a range of topics including the trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions and classification accuracy, the benefits of using time series to incorporate phenology in mapping species distribution, the potential of biochemical and physiological properties in hyperspectral spectral reflectance for tracking ecosystem changes caused by invasions, and the capacity of hyperspectral data as a valuable input for quantitative models developed for assessing the future spread of invasive species. Results Hyperspectral remote sensing holds great promise for invasion research. Spectral information provided by hyperspectral sensors can detect invaders at the species level across a range of community and ecosystem types. Furthermore, hyperspectral data can be used to assess habitat suitability and model the future spread of invasive species, thus providing timely information for invasion risk analysis. Main conclusions Our review suggests that hyperspectral remote sensing can effectively provide a baseline of invasive species distributions for future monitoring and control efforts. Furthermore, information on the spatial distribution of invasive species can help land managers to make long-term constructive conservation plans for protecting and maintaining natural ecosystems.",he_benefitshyperspectralremotesensing_2011,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Gis And Optimisation: Potential Benefits For Emergency Facility Location In Humanitarian Logistics,"Rodriguez-Espindola, Oscar and Albores, Pavel and Brewster, Christopher",2016,"Floods are one of the most dangerous and common disasters worldwide, and these disasters are closely linked to the geography of the affected area. As a result, several papers in the academic field of humanitarian logistics have incorporated the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for disaster management. However, most of the contributions in the literature are using these systems for network analysis and display, with just a few papers exploiting the capabilities of GIS to improve planning and preparedness. To show the capabilities of GIS for disaster management, this paper uses raster GIS to analyse potential flooding scenarios and provide input to an optimisation model. The combination is applied to two real-world floods in Mexico to evaluate the value of incorporating GIS for disaster planning. The results provide evidence that including GIS analysis for a decision-making tool in disaster management can improve the outcome of disaster operations by reducing the number of facilities used at risk of flooding.

Improved U-Net Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation Method,"Hu, G. and Yang, C. and Xu, L. and Shang, H. and Wang, Z. and Qin, Z.",2023,"Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images by deep neural network is an important content of remote sensing intelligent interpretation, which plays a very important role in urban planning, disaster assessment, agricultural production and other fields. High resolution remote sensing images are characterized by complex background, diverse scales and irregular shape, etc. Therefore, using natural scene semantic segmentation methods to process remote sensing images often has the problem of low segmentation accuracy. Based on the U-Net model, a multi-scale skip connection method is proposed to integrate semantic features of different levels and obtain accurate segmentation boundary and location information. Attention mechanism and pyramid pooling are introduced to solve the problem of fine segmentation in complex background. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the WHDLD and LandCover.ai dataset and compared with the mainstream semantic segmentation methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other comparison methods, with mloU reaching 74.28% and 82.04% respectively, and with average of Fi score reaching 84.47% and 89.76% respectively; compared with the segmentation results of U-Net, the value of loU improves significantly in buildings, roads and other categories with a relatively small proportion, and is superior to other comparison methods. © 2023 SinoMaps Press.

Implementing Remote Sensing Strategies To Support Environmental Compliance Assessment: A Neural Network Application,"Lein, James K.",2009,"Environmental compliance assessment and enforcement are complex, labor intensive tasks that would benefit from some form of decision support. Despite the well-documented application of remote sensing in environmental analysis and assessment, the operational use of this technology for environmental compliance enforcement remains in its infancy. Because the majority of environmental laws and regulations in the United States were enacted prior to the emergence of a mature science of remote sensing, there exists a degree of skepticism regarding the operational utility and reliability of remotely sensed data as an environmental compliance tool. This paper provides a review of the role of remote sensing in environmental compliance assessment and introduces a framework to guide the application of this technology based on the use of artificial neural networks. The customized neural networks developed in this study serve as a simplifying strategy to assist the process of compliance monitoring. Functioning as ""intelligent"" classifiers, the network models provide a spatial characterization of activities likely to cause damage; achieving mapping accuracies that ranged from 68 to 90\% for the test case samples selected for investigation.

This effect is aggravated by climate change. Here, we integrated modelled hydrologic data, remote sensing products, climate data, and linear mixed integer optimization (MIP) to identify stewardship actions across space and time that can reduce the impact of invasive species. The study area is the windward coast of Hawai'i Island (USA) across which non-native strawberry guava occurrence varies from extremely dense stands in lower watershed reaches, to low densities in upper watershed forests. We focused on the removal of strawberry guava, an invader that exerts significant impacts on watershed condition. MIP analyses spatially optimized the assignment of effective management actions to increase water yield, generate revenue from enhanced freshwater services, and income from removed biomass. The hydrological benefit of removing guava, often marginal when considered in isolation, was financially quantified, and single- and multiobjective MIP formulations were then developed over a 10-year planning horizon. Optimization resulted in \$2.27 million USD benefit over the planning horizon using a payment-for-ecosystem-services scheme. That value jumped to \$4.67 million when allowing work schedules with overnight camping to reduce costs. Pareto frontiers of weighted pairs of management goals showed the benefit of clustering treatments over space and time to improve financial efficiency.

Economic Benefit And Ecological Cost Of Enlarging Tea Cultivation In Subtropical China: Characterizing The Trade-Off For Policy Implications,"Su, Shiliang and Wan, Chen and Li, Jing and Jin, Xianfeng and Pi, Jianhua and Zhang, Qianwen and Weng, Min",2017,"Cash crop expansion has become a global land use issue in recent decades. While the enlarging cash crop cultivation brings promising profitability, it can impair the delivery of various ecosystem services, with a risk of threat to sustainability and human well being. In order to make well-informed land use policy decisions, it requires elaborate efforts to characterize the trade-off between the benefit and cost of cash crop cultivation. This paper focuses on the enlarging tea cultivation in subtropical China, using a case of Anji County. We first monitor tea expansion from 1985 to 2016 based on time-series Landsat imageries, and then analyze the subsequent changes of water conservation service through an in-field survey of soil loss. Monetary approach is finally employed to evaluate the trade-off between economic benefit and ecological cost associated with the growing age of tea plantations. Results show that tea plantations expanded rapidly from 1985 to 2016 in Anji County. Delivery of water conservation service has been significantly impaired by the conversion from natural forests to tea plantations, but it can be gradually improved during the long rotational life cycles of tea plantations. For a given plot (1 ha at moderate slope), in theory, the economic benefit and ecological cost exhibit opposite trend associated the growing age of tea plantations, and an equilibrium point is approximately achieved at the 12-year growing age. In reality, ecological cost exceeds the economic benefit throughout the study period in Anji County. More specifically, the net difference increases from 11575 Yuan in 1985-1469167 Yuan in 2016. It denotes that economic benefit fails to compromise the ecological cost of the enlarging tea cultivation in Anji County. Conflicting land use policies (ecological conservation vs cash cropping promotion) and 'household contract responsibility' system should account for the unbalanced relationship between economic benefit and ecological conservation. We finally propose four major options towards the win-win possibilities between economic gain and ecological conservation associated with tea cultivation.",su_economicbenefitecologicalcost_2017,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Remote sensing data and economic analysis can also be used to study the spatial distribution of water consumption as an indicator of equity in access to water resources. It even enables identification of farms that consume more irrigation water than formally allocated. Finally, it provides a basis to assess the cost-effectiveness of various ways to reduce agricultural water consumption.

However, when wall-to-wall ALS coverage is cost prohibitive or logistically challenging, alternative approaches are needed for forest mapping. We evaluated an indirect approach for extending ALS-based maps of forest attributes using medium resolution satellite and environmental data. First, we developed ALS-based models and predicted a suite of forest attributes for a 950 km2 study area covered by wall-to-wall ALS data. Then, we used samples extracted from the ALS-based predictions to model and map these attributes with satellite and environmental data for an extended 5600 km2 area with similar forest and ecological conditions. All attributes were predicted well with the ALS data (R2 ≥ 0.83; RMSD% < 26). The satellite and environmental models developed using the ALS-based predictions resulted in increased correspondence between observed and predicted values by 13-49% and decreased prediction errors by 8-28% compared with models developed directly with the ground plots. Improvements were observed for both multiple regression and random forest models, and for the suite of forest attributes assessed.

Improving Spectrum Management For Satellite Communication Systems With Hunger Marketing,"Li, Feng and Lam, Kwok-Yan and Hua, Jingyu and Zhao, Kanglian and Zhao, Nan and Wang, Li",2019,"Efficient spectrum management is an important issue in satellite communications due to the pervasive growth in wireless communications and the ever-increasing demand by bandwidth-hungry mobile applications. While various kinds of static and dynamic spectrum allocation schemes have been studied by satellite researchers, the issue of unpredictable user behavior, hence demand for bandwidth, remains one of the key challenges faced by the research community. In this letter, we introduce the hunger marketing strategy in satellite spectrum management in order to address the unpredictable user demands. When adopting hunger marketing, the system always maintain a certain level of spectrum supply shortage, thus stimulating the desire of users to plan and commit their bandwidth requirements in advance, hence making their behavior more predictable and benefiting satellite systems. Besides, in circumstances of multibeam satellite systems, when allocating bands to new satellite users, the issue of increase in inter-cell interference is also considered in this letter. Thus, a two-stage dynamic game model based on hunger marketing is proposed which aims to achieve an optimal balance between spectrum utilization and inter-cell interference.

The Complementary Value Of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing And Snow Covered Area Products For Snow Hydrological Modelling,"Schattan, Paul and Schwaizer, Gabriele and Schoeber, Johannes and Achleitner, Stefan",2020,"A combined snow modelling approach integrating remote sensing data, in-situ data, and an improved hydrological model is presented. Complementary information sources are evaluated in terms of its value for constraining the model parameters and to overcome limitations of individual data such as inadequate scale representation. The study site consists of the Upper Fagge river basin in the Austrian Alps featuring the Weisssee Snow Research Site. The available remote sensing datasets include Terra MODIS based medium resolution and Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A based high resolution fractional snow covered area maps. Recently, Sentinel-1 based wet snow covered area maps have become increasingly available. To the knowledge of the authors the first evaluation of their value for snow-hydrological modelling is presented. Besides conventional small footprint station data, in-situ time-series of snow water equivalent (SWE) of a Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) having a footprint of several hectares is additionally used. For including these data the model now provides respective outputs such as fractional snow cover, wet/dry snow surface and SWE areal means equivalent to the CRNS sensor footprint. By means of 40,000 model runs the high complementary value of representative SWE data and remote sensing information was assessed with most promising results achieved by combining high resolution fractional snow covered area maps with CRNS-SWE data. Regarding mean SWE or mean snow covered area in the catchment the ensemble spreads are reduced by two thirds compared to the results of a benchmark simulation based only on runoff for model calibration. Wet snow covered area maps have a high potential for simulating SWE at Weisssee Snow Research Site but introduce additional uncertainties for runoff simulations likely caused by the uncertain detection of the snow covered area from Sentinel-1 backscatter. The approach has high potential for water resources management in gauged and ungauged mountain basin and gives guidance for efficient data assimilation schemes.",schattan_complementarycosmicrayneutron_2020,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Trade-Offs Between Economic Benefits And Environmental Impacts Of Vegetable Greenhouses Expansion In East China,"Qiu, Lefeng and Wu, Shaohua",2021,"Greenhouse vegetable cultivation (GVC) has become a global issue in agricultural land use in recent years. While the use of GVC brings considerable economic profits, it has significant environmental impacts, with a risk of threat to sustainability. To make sound development and management strategies, it is necessary to characterize the trade-offs between the benefits and costs of GVC expansion. This study focuses on the expansion of GVC in East China, taking Xiaoshan County as a case study. Remote sensing techniques are used to detect the spatial patterns of GVC expansion from 2005 to 2015; then, field surveys and empirical models are employed to assess the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and plastic waste. Lastly, monetary analysis is used to evaluate the trade-offs between the environmental costs and economic gains caused by GVC expansion. The results show that GVC has expanded rapidly from 2005 to 2015 in Xiaoshan County. The GVC expansion has significantly increased GHG emissions and plastic waste from cultivated land. Both the economic benefits and environmental costs of GVC expansion show an increasing tendency throughout the study period. It denotes that economic benefits can compensate for environmental costs of GHG emissions and plastic waste brought by GVC, but the long-term damage to the quality and environmental conditions of cultivated land is still underestimated.

Because some program costs are borne by third parties, over that same period, for overall (social) program ROI to exceed I requires delivery of very modest flood and supply risk reduction and biodiversity co-benefits, making co-benefits crucial for social program justification. Transaction costs account for half of total program costs, a result of large investments in efficient targeting and program sustainability. Co-benefits justify increased cost sharing with other beneficiaries, which would increase ROl for the utility, demonstrating the sensitivity of the business case for watershed conservation to its broader social-economic case and the ability to forge institutional arrangements to internalize third-party benefits.

The Impact Of A Shade Coffee Certification Program On Forest Conservation Using Remote Sensing And Household Data,"Takahashi, Ryo and Todo, Yasuyuki",2014,"In recent years, shade coffee certification programs have attracted increasing attention from forest conservation and development organizations. The certification programs could be expected to promote forest conservation by providing a premium price to shade coffee producers. However, little is known about the significance of the conservation efforts generated by certification programs. In particular, the relationship between the impact of the certification and producer characteristics has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, was to examine the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation and its relationship with the socioeconomic characteristics of the producers. Remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 was used to gauge the changes in forest area. Employing a probit model, we found that a forest coffee area being certified increased the probability of forest conservation by 193 percentage points relative to forest coffee areas lacking certification. We also found that although economically poor producers tended to engage in forest clearing, the forest coffee certification program had a significant impact on these producers. This result suggests that the certification program significantly affects the behaviors of economically poor producers and motivates these producers to conserve the forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In the United States, such satellites are a cornerstone of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), required to carry out advanced coastal and ocean research, and to implement and sustain sensible resource management policies based on science. Satellite imagery and satellite-derived data are required for mapping vital coastal and marine resources, improving maritime domain awareness, and to better understand the complexities of land, ocean, atmosphere, ice, biological, and social interactions. These data are critical to the strategic planning of in situ observing components and are critical to improving forecasting and numerical modeling. Specifically, there are several stakeholder communities that require periodic, frequent, and sustained synoptic observations. Of particular importance are indicators of ecosystem structure (habitat and species inventories), ecosystem states (health and change) and observations about physical and biogeochemical variables to support the operational and research communities, and industry sectors including mining, fisheries, and transportation.

Scalable Retrieval Of Similar Landscapes In Optical Satellite Imagery Using Unsupervised Representation Learning,"Karatsiolis, S. and Padubidri, C. and Kamilaris, A.",2024,"Global Earth observation is becoming increasingly important in understanding and addressing critical aspects of life on our planet, including environmental issues, natural disasters, sustainable development, and others.

However, current applications of similar landscape retrieval are limited by a moderate performance and the need for time-consuming and costly annotations. We propose splitting the similar landscape retrieval task into a set of smaller tasks that aim to identify individual concepts inherent to satellite images.

Review On Applications Of Remote Sensing In Urban Flood Modeling,"Xu, Z. and Cheng, T. and Hong, S. and Wang, L.",2018,"Urban flooding is serious in China. More than 360 cities have suffered rainstorm floods from 2007 to 2013. Floods in Beijing, Guangzhou, Jinan, et al. have caused serious casualties. In recent years, sea-views in cities have repeated here and there, and rainstorm induced flood has gradually become a chronic illness in many large and medium-sized cities in China. Simulation model for floods is a key technology for urban flood control and land use planning, and play a crucial role in the construction of urban water conservancy projects and infrastructures such as urban drainage system and sponge city. With the continuous and rapid development of the economics and society, urban flood risk warning and management requires a higher demand on the efficiency and elaboration of flood simulation. Obviously, the degree of elaboration on flood simulation highly depends on the temporal and spatial resolution of the basic input data. Rainfall data with smaller time intervals will present more comprehensive rainfall characteristics and further reflect the characteristics of flood processes. Meanwhile, higher resolution terrain data can reflect subtle ground features of urban surface such as buildings, curbs, bridges, etc. By summarizing and analyzing the literature on the researches of hydrological modeling with the utilization of remote sensing data, the application of remote sensing data (including meteorological and hydrological data, and surface information based on remote sensing) in flood simulation is reviewed. Frequently used remote sensing data sources with relatively high precision such as LiDAR (light imaging, detection, and ranging), InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar), oblique photography and hyperspectral remote sensing as well as their applications are presented. Advanced technologies and methods (airborne LiDAR and UAV Oblique Photography) producing basic remote sensing information used in urban flood modeling are presented. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the extraction framework of the basic information of urban flood simulation based on remote sensing, and the prospect to apply remote sensing technology in urban flood simulation is also presented. It is pointed out that flood simulation will be more effective and refined with the support of massive multi-source data in the future. At the same time, rich data sources also bring the following challenges and opportunities: (1) Rapidly increasing amount of high-resolution remote sensing data poses greater challenges to data storage and management, while high-performance distributed storage technologies and data processing technologies can provide solutions for this objective. (2) Massive data and the relatively low processing and utilization capacity will cause a huge waste of resources. Based on data analysis methods such as machine learning and data assimilation, massive multi-source data will be integrated to form a comprehensive database for urban flood modeling, which can provide scientific and technological support for modern urban construction and management.

Watershed Conservation In The Long Run,"Kaiser, Brooks A.",2014,"We studied unanticipated long-run outcomes of conservation activities that occurred in forested watersheds on O'ahu, Hawaii, in the early twentieth century. The initial general impetus for the conservation activities was to improve irrigation surface water flow for the sugar industry. Industry concentration facilitated conservation of entire ecosystems. We investigate the benefits that accrued through dynamic linkages of the hydrological cycle and groundwater aquifer system. This provides a clear example of the need to consider integrated watershed effects, industrial structure, and linkages in determining conservation policy. We incorporated remote-sensing data, expert opinion on current watershed quality, and a spatial economic and hydrological model of O'ahu's freshwater use with reports of conservation activities from 1910-1960 to assess these benefits. We find a 2.3\% annual increase in groundwater recharge levels from these activities, with a lower bound benefit-cost ratio of 7.1-18.2. This lower-bound excludes returns from such high value, yet controversial to measure, amenities as species preservation.",kaiser_watershedconservationrun_2014,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Enhancing Object Detection In Remote Sensing: A Hybrid Yolov7 And Transformer Approach With Automatic Model Selection,"Ahmed, M. and El-Sheimy, N. and Leung, H. and Moussa, A.",2024,"In the remote sensing field, object detection holds immense value for applications such as land use classification, disaster monitoring, and infrastructure planning, where accurate and efficient identification of objects within images is essential for informed decision making. However, achieving object localization with high precision can be challenging even if minor errors exist at the pixel level, which can significantly impact the ground distance measurements. To address this critical challenge, our research introduces an innovative hybrid approach that combines the capabilities of the You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) and DEtection TRansformer (DETR) algorithms. By bridging the gap between local receptive field and global context, our approach not only enhances overall object detection accuracy, but also promotes precise object localization, a key requirement in the field of remote sensing. Furthermore, a key advantage of our approach is the introduction of an automatic selection module which serves as an intelligent decision-making component. This module optimizes the selection process between YOLOv7 and DETR, and further improves object detection accuracy. Finally, we validate the improved performance of our new hybrid approach through empirical experimentation, and thus confirm its contribution to the field of target recognition and detection in remote sensing images. © 2023 by the authors.",ahmed_enhancingobjectdetectionremote_2024,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Ecological Compensation Estimation Of Soil And Water Conservation Based On Cost-Benefit Analysis,"Sun, Lina and Lu, Wenxi and Yang, Qingchun and Delgado Martin, Jordi and Li, Di",2013,"Soil and water conservation ecological compensation can be simply defined as a monetary payment to offset the environmental loss.

Impact Of Insolation Data Source On Remote Sensing Retrievals Of Evapotranspiration Over The California Delta,"Anderson, Martha and Diak, George and Gao, Feng and Knipper, Kyle and Hain, Christopher and Eichelmann, Elke and Hemes, Kyle S. and Baldocchi, Dennis and Kustas, William and Yang, Yun",2019,"The energy delivered to the land surface via insolation is a primary driver of evapotranspiration (ET)the exchange of water vapor between the land and atmosphere. Spatially distributed ET products are in great demand in the water resource management community for real-time operations and sustainable water use planning. The accuracy and deliverability of these products are determined in part by the characteristics and quality of the insolation data sources used as input to the ET models. This paper investigates the practical utility of three different insolation datasets within the context of a satellite-based remote sensing framework for mapping ET at high spatiotemporal resolution, in an application over the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in California. The datasets tested included one reanalysis product: The Climate System Forecast Reanalysis (CFSR) at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, and two remote sensing insolation products generated with geostationary satellite imagery: a product for the continental United States at 0.2 degrees, developed by the University of Wisconsin Space Sciences and Engineering Center (SSEC) and a coarser resolution (1 degrees) global Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. The three insolation data sources were compared to pyranometer data collected at flux towers within the Delta region to establish relative accuracy. The satellite products significantly outperformed CFSR, with root-mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.7, 1.5, and 1.4 MJm(-2)d(-1) for CFSR, CERES, and SSEC, respectively, at daily timesteps. The satellite-based products provided more accurate estimates of cloud occurrence and radiation transmission, while the reanalysis tended to underestimate solar radiation under cloudy-sky conditions. However, this difference in insolation performance did not translate into comparable improvement in the ET retrieval accuracy, where the RMSE in daily ET was 0.98 and 0.94 mm d(-1) using the CFSR and SSEC insolation data sources, respectively, for all the flux sites combined. The lack of a notable impact on the aggregate ET performance may be due in part to the predominantly clear-sky conditions prevalent in central California, under which the reanalysis and satellite-based insolation data sources have comparable accuracy. While satellite-based insolation data could improve ET retrieval in more humid regions with greater cloud-cover frequency, over the California Delta and climatologically similar regions in the western U.S., the CFSR data may suffice for real-time ET modeling efforts.",anderson_impactinsolationdatasource_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Delay-Packet-Loss-Optimized Distributed Routing Using Spiking Neural Network In Delay-Tolerant Networking,"Velusamy, Gandhimathi and Lent, Ricardo",2023,"Satellite communication is inevitable due to the Internet of Everything and the exponential increase in the usage of smart devices. Satellites have been used in many applications to make human life safe, secure, sophisticated, and more productive. The applications that benefit from satellite communication are Earth observation (EO), military missions, disaster management, and 5G/6G integration, to name a few. These applications rely on the timely and accurate delivery of space data to ground stations. However, the channels between satellites and ground stations suffer attenuation caused by uncertain weather conditions and long delays due to line-of-sight constraints, congestion, and physical distance. Though inter-satellite links (ISLs) and inter-orbital links (IOLs) create multiple paths between satellite nodes, both ISLs and IOLs have the same issues. Some essential applications, such as EO, depend on time-sensitive and error-free data delivery, which needs better throughput connections. It is challenging to route space data to ground stations with better QoS by leveraging the ISLs and IOLs. Routing approaches that use the shortest path to optimize latency may cause packet losses and reduced throughput based on the channel conditions, while routing methods that try to avoid packet losses may end up delivering data with long delays. Existing routing algorithms that use multi-optimization goals tend to use priority-based optimization to optimize either of the metrics. However, critical satellite missions that depend on high-throughput and low-latency data delivery need routing approaches that optimize both metrics concurrently. We used a modified version of Kleinrock's power metric to reduce delay and packet losses and verified it with experimental evaluations. We used a cognitive space routing approach, which uses a reinforcement-learning-based spiking neural network to implement routing strategies in NASA's High Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) project.",velusamy_delaypacketlossoptimized_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Impact Of Subsystem Reliability On Satellite Revenue Generation And Present Value,"Saleh, JH and Hassan, R and Torres-Padilla, JP and Hastings, DE and Newman, DJ",2005,"A new framework is developed that analytically links an engineering concept, a system's reliability, with both managerial and financial concepts, the system's revenue generation capability, and its present value. A communications satellite is used as an example to illustrate the use and insights that can be generated from this framework. For instance., after the development of a revenue model for a communications satellite, the cost of unreliability was quantified: the present value penalty for the lack of 100\% payload reliability. Next, the value of redundancy was also analytically captured: the satellite incremental present value provided by payload redundancy. The central finding is that present value calculations of a technical revenue-generating system, in this instance, a communications satellite, that do not account for system's reliability overestimate the system's present value and, thus, can lead to flawed investment decisions. Finally, when sensitivity analysis is performed on the various drivers of the satellite present value, it was found, against conventional wisdom, that redundancy in communications satellite payload is overrated; in other words, that increasing payload redundancy provides limited incremental value to the spacecraft.",saleh_impactsubsystemreliabilitysatellite_2005,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Risk Preferences Over Health: Empirical Estimates And Implications For Medical Decision-Making,"Mulligan, K. and Baid, D. and Doctor, J. N. and Phelps, C. E. and Lakdawalla, D.

Several strands of recent research call this implication into question. Generalized Risk-Adjusted Cost-Effectiveness (GRACE) demonstrates theoretically that baseline health status influences value, so long as consumers are not risk-neutral over health. Prior empirical literature casts doubt on risk-neutral expected utility-maximization in the health domain. We estimate utility over HRQoL in a nationally representative U.S. population and use our estimates to measure risk preferences over health. We find that individuals are risk-seeking at low levels of health, become risk-averse at health equal to 0.485 (measured on a 0–1 scale), and are most risk-averse at perfect health (coefficient of relative risk aversion = 4.51).

A Review Of The Role Of Active Remote Sensing And Data Fusion For Characterizing Forest In Wildlife Habitat Models,"Vogeler, J. C. and Cohen, W. B.",2016,"Spatially explicit maps of wildlife habitat relationships have proven to be valuable tools for conservation and management applications including evaluating how and which species may be impacted by large scale climate change, ongoing fragmentation of habitat, and local land-use practices. Studies have turned to remote sensing datasets as a way to characterize vegetation for the examination of habitat selection and for mapping realized relationships across the landscape. Potentially one of the more difficult habitat types to try to characterize with remote sensing are the vertically and horizontally complex forest systems. Characterizing this complexity is needed to explore which aspects may represent driving and/or limiting factors for wildlife species. Active remote sensing data from lidar and radar sensors has thus caught the attention of the forest wildlife research and management community in its potential to represent three dimensional habitat features. The purpose of this review was to examine the applications of active remote sensing for characterizing forest in wildlife habitat studies through a keyword search within Web of Science. We present commonly used active remote sensing metrics and methods, discuss recent advances in characterizing aspects of forest habitat, and provide suggestions for future research in the area of new remote sensing data/techniques that could benefit forest wildlife studies that are currently not represented or may be underutilized within the wildlife literature. We also highlight the potential value in data fusion of active and passive sensor data for representing multiple dimensions and scales of forest habitat. While the use of remote sensing has increased in recent years within wildlife habitat studies, continued communication between the remote sensing, forest management, and wildlife communities is vital to ensure appropriate data sources and methods are understood and utilized, and so that creators of mapping products may better realize the needs of secondary users.",vogeler_reviewroleactiveremote_2016,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Cost-Effective Forest Conservation And Criteria For Potential Conservation Targets:: A Finnish Case Study,"Juutinen, Artti and Luque, Sandra and Monkkonen, Mikko and Vainikainen, Nina and Tomppo, Erkki",2008,"Selecting reserves for forest biodiversity maintenance is often done by setting criteria for components of structural elements of biodiversity, such as a volume of decaying wood. we tested how the different threshold values for the components of structural elements affect the cost-effective site selection. Using Finnish National Forest Inventory information and remote sensing data, we determined a habitat quality index and economic value for each site in Satakunta region in Finland. Moreover, we defined several sets of potential conservation targets using alternative criteria for the habitat quality index developed for the Finnish case study. These figures were used in the site selection model in order to maximize the sum of habitat index of selected areas under a given budget constraint. We found that the production possibility frontier for the outputs of timber and biodiversity is only slightly concave when using the given threshold values. Thus, the optimal combination of the outputs is sensitive to the relative values of these goods. Our results suggest that an integrated approach in forest conservation could provide to environmental managers considerable cost savings compared with current management practices. Environmental managers could also reduce conservation costs by loosening the criteria for potential conservation targets. This would not lower considerably the quality of conserved forests.

Research Progress Of Soil Moisture Estimation Based On Microwave Remote Sensing,"Mandi, Z. and Zhong, L. and Zhaohui, X. and Jianhui, L. and Junling, S.",2024,"Soil moisture is an important link for the exchange of water and heat processes between the surface and the atmosphere, and is of great significance to agricultural production, ecological planning, and water resources management. Microwave remote sensing has the advantages of not being affected by weather conditions and being able to better detect the soil information and trend of soil moisture change under vegetation coverage. Thus, it is a hot spot for accurate soil moisture retrieval by remote sensing. With the gradual increase in the number of Earth observation satellites, microwave detectors have developed from C-band to L-band, and soil moisture datasets have become more and more abundant. In this paper, the existing global-scale soil moisture products based on microwave remote sensing are summarized. It also analyzes and compares the principle, characteristics, application scope and key technological progress of active microwave remote sensing, passive microwave remote sensing, and active and passive microwave fusion in soil moisture retrieval. The advantage of active microwave remote sensing and passive microwave remote sensing is high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, respectively. High spatial resolution can capture the subtle spatial information features of the surface, but it is limited by the complex relationship between soil moisture and backscattering coefficients, especially the interference of vegetation and surface roughness on the radar backscattering coefficient making retrieval of soil moisture inaccurate. Therefore, selecting different scattering models according to the actual situation and using multi-source data synergy are the current research hotspots to improve accuracy. This paper summarizes the active microwave soil moisture retrieval method into three types: mechanism model, empirical model and semi-empirical model according to the principle. We also considered the applicability and shortcomings at the same time. For instance, high temporal resolution can achieve global and large-scale soil moisture monitoring, but it is difficult to meet the actual research needs of small-scale or small-scale areas. In order to better match the measured data in space, four downscaling methods based on the geostatistical method, mathematical statistics method, data assimilation method and multi-source remote sensing data fusion method are proposed. Combining the advantages and disadvantages of the above two microwave remote sensing methods, researchers can rely on more abundant data sources and relatively mature observation technology to fuse and extract more moisture information and to improve the retrieval accuracy or obtain long-term series data. However, this method often has the problem of missing data due to factors such as revisit time, seasonal ice period or radio frequency interference, which has a great impact on the spatiotemporal continuity of the data. So, the interpolation methods based on time, space, and statistics have been employed to solve the missing value issues. In the current method, soil moisture retrieval shows good performance at small scales, but at the global scale, there will be many problems such as missing data, poor applicability, low retrieval accuracy, and too complicated retrieval processes. Improvements can be made by employing multiple observation methods (multi-polarization, multi-angle, multi-band), multi-temporal repeated observation, the introduction of new algorithms on the original model and data assimilation. The rapid development of long-term stable and high spatiotemporal resolution L-band microwave signals in the field of land remote sensing of Global Navigation Satellite System also provides a reference for the development of China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, showing its huge application potential. © 2024 Science Press.

Remote Sensing Of Irrigated Agriculture: Opportunities And Challenges,"Ozdogan, Mutlu and Yang, Yang and Allez, George and Cervantes, Chelsea",2010,"Over the last several decades, remote sensing has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. The objective of this review, which summarizes the methods and the results of existing remote sensing studies, is to synthesize principle findings and assess the state of the art. We take a taxonomic approach to group studies based on location, scale, inputs, and methods, in an effort to categorize different approaches within a logical framework. We seek to evaluate the ability of remote sensing to provide synoptic and timely coverage of irrigated lands in several spectral regions. We also investigate the value of archived data that enable comparison of images through time. This overview of the studies to date indicates that remote sensing-based monitoring of irrigation is at an intermediate stage of development at local scales. For instance, there is overwhelming consensus on the efficacy of vegetation indices in identifying irrigated fields. Also, single date imagery, acquired at peak growing season, may suffice to identify irrigated lands, although to multi-date image data are necessary for improved classification and to distinguish different crop types. At local scales, the mapping of irrigated lands with remote sensing is also strongly affected by the timing of image acquisition and the number of images used. At the regional and global scales, on the other hand, remote sensing has not been fully operational, as methods that work in one place and time are not necessarily transferable to other locations and periods. Thus, at larger scales, more work is required to indentify the best spectral indices, best time periods, and best classification methods under different climatological and cultural environments. Existing studies at regional scales also establish the fact that both remote sensing and national statistical approaches require further refinement with a substantial investment of time and resources for ground-truthing. An additional challenge in mapping irrigation across large areas occurs in fragmented landscapes with small irrigated and cultivated fields, where the spatial scale of observations is pitted against the need for high frequency temporal acquisitions. Finally, this review identifies passive and active microwave observations, advanced image classification methods, and data fusion including optical and radar sensors or with information from sources with multiple spatial and temporal characteristics as key areas where additional research is needed.",ozdogan_remotesensingirrigatedagriculture_2010,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Residual Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method For Lithium-Ion Batteries In Satellite With Incomplete Healthy Historical Data,"Peng, Jian and Zhou, Zhongbao and Wang, Jiongqi and Wu, Di and Guo, Yinman",2019,"Due to the strict requirements of satellite systems, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of the key components is very important to the reliability and security of satellite systems. Otherwise, a failure could lead to catastrophic consequences and enormous economic losses. Because of the complex structure of the satellite and its complex space environment, the factors that affect the satellite systems status are numerous. Moreover, as a result of the healthy historical data of key components in satellite are too few, which makes the traditional methods based on analysis model are not suitable for RUL prediction of key components in satellite.

These communication infrastructure assets exist either in the segments of satellite or telecommunication infrastructure. This paper intends to empirically assess the performance attributes of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure over January 2000-June 2019. Sub-period performance dynamics of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure in the pre-GFC (January 2000-June 2007) and the post-GFC (July 2009-June 2019) investment horizons are provided. Design/methodology/approach Nineteen-year monthly total returns over 2000-2019 were used to analyse the risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification potential of both listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure. The mean-variance portfolio optimisation framework using the full period and post-GFC ex-post returns, risk and correlation coefficient of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure and other financial assets was developed to determine the added-value benefits of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure in an optimised investment framework. Findings Listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure delivered mixed investment performance. They were highly volatile and there was a significant discount in total return performance against the other asset classes in the full and pre-GFC periods. However, listed telecommunication infrastructure delivered stronger performance in the post-GFC period across all performance measures. Listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure offered strong diversification benefits for investors across all investment horizons. Further, the inclusion of listed telecommunication infrastructure in both the full period and post-GFC mixed-asset investment framework was also empirically justified. Practical implications - Communication infrastructure assets such as satellite and telecommunication infrastructure are the key infrastructure assets to ensure the seamless operation of and interaction with modern technology going forward. Whilst being a small proportion of the overall infrastructure asset class universe, the \$2.1 trillion progressively expanding listed communication infrastructure sector is having an important role to stimulate investor capital deployments in high quality and future-proof communication infrastructure assets. Listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure assets are an opportunistic investment given their future growth potential and are seen as a suitable fit for investors with a secular investment profile. Originality/value Despite the infrastructure asset class being the focus of growing attention and empirical analysis, no previous studies have empirically investigated the listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure sectors. This is the first published empirical research analysis that aims at articulating the investment attributes of listed satellite and telecommunication infrastructure as a route for exposure in technology-related infrastructure assets.

The potential of the landscape for the management alternatives was quantified by airborne laser scanning based proxies. A nearest-neighbor imputation method was applied to provide each pixel with stochastic acceptabilities on the alternatives based on decision-makers' preferences sampled from a probability distribution. We showed that this workflow could be used to derive two types of maps for forest use prioritization: one showing the alternative that a decision-maker with given pref-erences should choose and another showing areas where the suitability of the forest structure suggested different alternative than the preferences. We discuss the potential of the latter approach for mapping management hotspots. The stochastic approach allows estimating the strength of the decision with respect to the uncertainty in both the proxy values and preferences. The nearest neighbor imputation of stochastic acceptabilities is a computationally feasible way to improve decisions based on ES proxy maps by accounting for uncertainties, although the need for such detailed information at the pixel level should be separately assessed.",rana_stochasticmulticriteriaacceptabilityanalysis_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA
A Variational Merging Approach To The Spatial Description Of Environmental Variables,"Ulloa, Jacinto and Samaniego, Esteban and Campozano, Lenin and Ballari, Daniela",2018,"High-resolution images of environmental variables are highly valuable sources of information in research and environmental management. Obtaining spatially continuous information from ground observations is challenging due to the wide variety of factors that affect classical interpolation methods. While geostatistical methods have produced noteworthy results, they generally rely on important assumptions and strongly depend on the availability of observed data. In turn, satellite-based or model-based gridded images generally represent the global spatial structure of environmental variables but are subject to bias. With the objective of exploiting the benefits of both sources of information, we propose a new mathematical formulation to merge observed data with gridded images of environmental variables using partial differential equations in a variational setting. With a convenient functional, formed as the sum of two competing terms, two simultaneous goals are achieved: to improve the description of the spatial structure in maps generated by simple deterministic interpolation methods and to increase the reliability of satellite-based or model-based images. Either satellite-based or model-based information is included in a regularity term to provide the global spatial structure, while in situ data are included in a fidelity term. The resulting maps can be considered a merging of interpolated in situ data with satellite or model imagery. The method is first evaluated using simulated images generated by geostatistical simulation and then applied to actual temperature and precipitation data in selected regions in the Tropical Andes. The results indicate that the method is capable of generating realistic maps while performing well in terms of validation.",ulloa_variationalmergingapproachspatial_2018,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Opportunity Costs Of Forest Conservation In Nepal,"Rai, Rajesh K. and Nepal, Mani and Karky, Bhaskar S. and Timalsina, Niroj and Khadayat, Madan S. and Bhattarai, Nabin",2022,"Forest biomass may vary by species composition, location, management regimes, and management interventions. To assess the variation in biomass production by management regimes, we conducted a study in three physiographic regions (mid-hills, Siwaliks and Terai) of Nepal with four different management regimes (community forest, collaborative forest, protected area, and protected forest). As community forest is the dominant forest management regime in Nepal, it was studied in all physiographic regions whereas the other two regimes were drawn only from the Terai. We interviewed a total of 1,115 forest user households, which was supplemented by high-resolution satellite image analysis and forest inventory to estimate the costs and benefits of forest management and calculate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our estimates suggest that the opportunity cost of conserving forest in Nepal ranged from USD 654/ha in collaborative forest to USD 3,663/ha in protected forest in 2015. The associated opportunity cost of carbon sequestration was between USD 1.11 and USD 3.56 per tCO(2). Of the forest management practices adopted, the silviculture-based intensive forest management practice had a far lower cost of forest conservation compared to the other forest management regimes. We found that such a practice is more beneficial to the forest-dependent communities as it allows them to collect the non-timber forest products that are necessary for their daily needs.",rai_opportunitycostsforestconservation_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Due to changes in climate and land management, wildfires have increased in frequency and severity, and this trend is expected to continue. Consequently, wildfires are expected to become an increasingly important source of air pollutants in the western U.S. Hence, there is a need to develop a quantitative understanding of wildfire-smoke-specific health effects. A necessary step in this process is to determine who was exposed to wildfire smoke, the concentration of the smoke during exposure, and the duration of the exposure. Three different tools have been used in past studies to assess exposure to wildfire smoke: in situ measurements, satellite-based observations, and chemical-transport model (CTM) simulations. Each of these exposure-estimation tools has associated strengths and weakness. We investigate the utility of blending these tools together to produce estimates of PM2.5 exposure from wildfire smoke during the Washington 2012 fire season. For blending, we use a ridge-regression model and a geographically weighted ridge-regression model. We evaluate the performance of the three individual exposure-estimate techniques and the two blended techniques by using leave-one-out cross validation. We find that predictions based on in situ monitors are more accurate for this particular fire season than the CTM simulations and satellite-based observations because of the large number of monitors present; therefore, blending provides only marginal improvements above the in situ observations. However, we show that in hypothetical cases with fewer surface monitors, the two blending techniques can produce substantial improvement over any of the individual tools.",lassman_spatialtemporalestimatespopulation_2017,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Disaster databases are potentially useful tools for exploring trends, however, criteria for inclusion of events and for associated descriptive characteristics is not standardized. For example, some databases include only primary disaster types, such as 'flood', while others include subtypes, such as 'coastal flood' and 'flash flood'. Here we outline a method to identify candidate events for assignment of a specific disaster subtype-namely, 'flash floods'-from the corresponding primary disaster type-namely, 'flood'. Geophysical data, including variables derived from remote sensing, are integrated to develop an enhanced flash flood confidence index, consisting of both a flash flood confidence index based on text mining of disaster reports and a flash flood susceptibility index from remote sensing derived geophysical data. This method was applied to a historical flood event dataset covering Ecuador. Results indicate the potential value of disaggregating events labeled as a primary disaster type into events of a particular subtype.

Fusion Of Remote Sensing And Internet Data To Calculate Urban Floor Area Ratio,"Zhang, Xiaoyong and Chen, Zhengchao and Yue, Yuemin and Qi, Xiangkun and Zhang, Charlie H.",2019,"The floor area ratio is a comprehensive index that plays an important role in urban planning and sustainable development. Remote sensing data are widely used in floor area ratio calculations because they can produce both two-dimensional planar and three-dimensional stereo information on buildings. However, remote sensing is not adequate for calculating the number of floors in a building. In this paper, a simple and practical pixel-level model is established through defining a quantitative relationship among the floor area ratio, building density, and average number of floors (ANF). The floor area ratios are calculated by combining remote sensing data with publicly available Internet data. It incorporates supplemental map data and street-level views from Internet maps to confirm building types and the number of floors, thereby enabling more-accurate floor area ratio calculations. The proposed method is tested in the Tiantongyuan neighborhood, Changping District, Beijing, and the results show that it can accurately approximate the number of floors in buildings. Inaccuracies in the value of the floor area ratio were found to be primarily due to the uncertainties in building density calculations. After performing systematic error correction, the building density (BD) and floor area ratio were each calculated with the relative accuracy exceeding 90\%. Moreover, the experiments verified that the fusion of internet map data with remote sensing data has innate advantages for floor area ratio calculations.",zhang_fusionremotesensinginternet_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Simple Spatial Modeling Tool For Prioritizing Prescribed Burning Activities At The Landscape Scale,"Hiers, JK and Laine, SC and Bachant, JJ and Furman, JH and Greene, WW and Compton, V",2003,"Resources for prescribed fire are frequently insufficient to manage public lands for all conservation and resource management objectives, necessitating prioritization of the application of fire across the landscape within any given year. Defining tradeoffs when applying prescribed fire to large landscapes is problematic not only because of the complexity of weighing competing management objectives at the landscape scale, but also because of the difficult nature of independently applying need-to-burn criteria to large areas. We present a case study of a simple modeling process implemented at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle (U. S. A.) to prioritize the application of prescribed fire. In a workshop setting, managers and biologists identified key conservation criteria and landscape management objectives that drive the application of prescribed fire. Remote sensing and other spatial data were developed to directly or indirectly represent all these criteria. Using geographic information system software, managers and biologists weighted each criterion according to its relative contribution to overall burn prioritization, and individual values for the criterion were scored according to how they influence the need to burn. Subsequently, this process has been validated and modified through ecological monitoring. This modeling process has also been applied to the 77,400-ha Blackwater River State Forest, public land adjacent to Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrating its applicability to lands with varying management priorities. The advantages of this model-based approach for prioritizing prescribed fire include the reliance on accessible, inexpensive software, the development of spatially explicit management objectives, the ease of transferability, and clearly stated assumptions about management that may be tested and reviewed through monitoring and public comment.",hiers_simplespatialmodelingtool_2003,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Bridging Decision-Making Process And Environmental Needs In Corridor Planning,"Nobrega, R. A. A. and O'Hara, C. G. and Sadasivuni, R. and Dumas, J.",2009,"Purpose - The aim of this paper is to clarify the spatial multi-criteria workflow for stakeholders and decision makers, for which feedback rankings are vital to the success of the transportation planning. Design/methodology/approach - The experimental approach was designed to integrate in a novel fashion both analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) within a geospatial information system (GIS) framework to deliver visual and objective tabular results useful to estimate environmental costs of the alignments generated. The method enables ranking, prioritization, selection, and refinement of preferred alternatives. The Interstate-269, the newly planned bypass of Memphis-TN, for which a recent environmental impact study (EIS) was completed, was selected as the experiment test-bed. Findings - The results indicate that the approach can automate the delivery of feasible alignments that closely approximate those generated by traditional approaches. Furthermore, via integration of local planning and ancillary spatial data, the method provided alignment results that avoided areas where local opposition was noted in the EIS. This enhanced method based on remote sensing and spatial information technologies delivers low or high-predicted environmental costs per feature criteria and cumulative predicted costs while preserving local values and plans. Practical implications - The method is highly transferable and limited solely by the availability of sources of geospatial data and coordination with stakeholders. The approach was implemented to derive results similar to traditional approaches with benefits in time, costs, and quality of solutions. Originality/value - A novel adaptation of MCDM and AHD within a spatial decision-making framework is presented. The paper suggests a clarification of multi-criteria workflow to design and select least-environmental-cost corridors.

Regional Assessment Of Environmental Vulnerability In The Tibetan Plateau: Development And Application Of A New Method,"Wang, X. D. and Zhong, X. H. and Liu, S. Z. and Liu, J. G. and Wang, Z. Y. and Li, M. H.",2008,"Regional environmental evaluation often requires a large amount of spatial information. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) are capable of managing large amounts of spatially related datum, and providing the ability to integrate multiple layers and to derive additional information. A methodological reference framework, using RS, GIS, and AHP (the analytic hierarchy process), is developed for environmental vulnerability assessment. Using this proposed method, we carried out a case study in the Tibetan Plateau. An environmental vulnerability index (EVI) proposed incorporates 15 factors covering natural conditions, environmental issues, and human activities. According to the EVI values, the vulnerability was classified into five levels: slight (EVI < 2.2), light (2.2 <= EVI < 2.7), moderate (2.7 <= EVI < 3.0), heavy (3.0 <= EVI <= 3.4), and extreme vulnerability (> 3.4). The case study showed that the majority of the area in the Tibetan Plateau is ecologically lightly (light level; 22\% of the total area), moderately (moderate level; 27\%), and heavily (heavy level: 30\%) vulnerable. Except for a clearly horizontal distribution, the environmental vulnerability increased clearly with increasing elevation (vertical distribution). The case study verified the usefulness and feasibility of the methods developed, for the results gained reflect the reality of the Tibetan environment closely. Further use in other regions should pay attention to what factors seem to be important in determining the local environmental vulnerability, and how is the impact of each factor on the complex environment.

In particular, the growth of the World Wide Web is contributing to an increase in the global user base. The synergy of remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), Internet, and mobile phone technologies is revolutionizing the way in which satellite-derived information is archived and distributed to users.

This paper describes how the delivery of satellite-derived fire information. has evolved over the last six years. By understanding user requirements and taking advantage of recent developments in areas such as information management, search, access, visualization, kind enabling technologies, FIRMS has expanded the number and range of users that are able to access and utilize satellite-derived fire information. Specifically, we describe how satellite remote sensing and GIS technologies have been integrated to deliver MODIS active fire data to natural resource managers using Internet mapping services and customized e-mail alerts to users in more than 90 countries.

An Improved Method For Estimating Surface Fine Particle Concentrations Using Seasonally Adjusted Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth,"Weber, S. A. and Engel-Cox, J. A. and Hoff, R. M. and Prados, A. I. and Zhang, H.",2010,"Using satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to estimate surface concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a well-established technique in the air quality community. In this study, the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations measured at five monitor locations in the Baltimore, MD/Washington, DC region and AOD from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) were calculated for the summer of 2004 and all of 2005. Linear regression methods were used to determine the direct quantitative relationships between the satellite AOD values and PM2.5 concentration measurements. Results show that correlations between AOD and surface PM2.5 concentrations range from 0.46 to 0.84 for the analyzed time period. Correlations with AOD from MODIS and MISR were higher than those from GOES, likely because of variations in the algorithms used by the different instruments. To determine the relative usefulness of platform- and season-specific AOD PM2.5 regression analysis, the results from this study were used to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations for two representative case studies. This analysis of case studies demonstrates that it is necessary to include season and satellite platform information for more accurate estimates of surface PM2.5 concentrations from satellite AOD data. Consequently, tools that currently use a constant relationship to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations from satellite AOD data, such as the Infusing satellite Data into Environmental Applications (IDEA) website, may need to be revised to include parameters that allow the relationships to vary with season and satellite platform to provide more accurate results.

The virtual fracture clinic (VFC) has proven to be a safe, patient-focused, cost-effective means of delivering trauma care, whilst reducing unnecessary clinic attendances. Within our institution, a Satellite VFC was established, so as to accommodate an offsite referring emergency department. The VFC database was accessed to identify the first 500 patients who were referred to the Satellite VFC. The decision made for each patient, the rate of returns to the clinic, and the rate of referrals requiring surgical intervention, following discussion at the VFC, ,were identified. A cost analysis and cost comparison was carried out between the Satellite VFC and the traditional ""face to face"" fracture clinic. There were 500 patients referred to the Satellite VFC within the study period. Of such patients, 288 (58\%) were discharged directly following review at the Satellite VFC, 141 patients (28\%) were referred to physiotherapy, 50 (10\%) were redirected to the trauma clinic, 11 (2\%) were sent directly to hand therapy, and 10 (2\%) were sent to the ED review clinic. Patients who returned to the fracture clinic accounted for 3.8\% of all referrals, and 0.2\% of all referrals necessitated surgical intervention. This pilot initiative saved the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group over (sic)50,000. The Satellite VFC is the first of its kind in the literature. Rural communities worldwide would benefit from remote orthopaedic management of suitable fracture patterns.

Road Identification Algorithm For Remote Sensing Images Based On Wavelet Transform And Recursive Operator,"Chen Guobin and Sun, Zengwu and Li Zhang",2020,"Road edge detection from remote sensing images, as an important ground object type, plays an important role in people's life and travel and urban planning and development, and extracting road information from remote sensing images has practical scientific value and practical significance. However, with the development of remote sensing technology, while the resolution of remote sensing images is improved, the information describing ground objects becomes more and more abundant, and the difficulty of identifying and extracting road information is also increased. In the process of acquiring remote sensing images, the actual system is subjected to various kinds of noise interference. Different environmental interference and system defects will introduce noises with completely different distribution and statistical characteristics to remote sensing images. Aiming at the problem that the detection effect of traditional algorithms becomes worse due to the influence of noise on remote sensing images, a wavelet transform denoising method and morphological gradient operator are proposed. By selecting appropriate structural elements of remote sensing images, noise pixels cannot participate in morphological calculation, and the noise intensity changes with the size of quantum superposition state structural elements. Therefore, a morphological gradient operator is established and applied to edge detection of remote sensing images. Finally, the experimental results show that the method proposed in this article is better than other directions in terms of effect through road edge detection and matching. This method can effectively reduce noise.

Assessing Forest Recreational Potential From Social Media Data And Remote Sensing Technologies Data,"Lingua, Federico and Coops, Nicholas C. and Griess, Verena C.",2023,"Conventionally, forest management plans have focused on ensuring a continuous provision of wood. In recent years, political agendas worldwide have recognized the importance of forests' cultural ecosystem services, such as recreation. However, the inclusion of such values in management plans is challenging, and forest managers require novel methodologies and indicators to characterize forest recreation demand and provision. To this end, in this study, we combine remote sensing technologies and crowdsourced social media data to map and value the forest recreational potential of BC's provincial parks system. We trained and deployed convolutional neural networks to automatically classify the content of over 60,000 Flickr images, we then created a random forest model to identify the variables that influence the visitors' choice of recreational activity. These models allowed us to map the most likely recreational activities to occur in BC's provincial parks and perform a spatially explicit assessment of the consumer surplus that these activities generate with a benefit transfer approach. Our findings suggest that the most influential variables in determining the choice of forest recreational activities are topo-graphic, while anthropogenic impacts and forest biometrics variables have less effect.

Adaptive Probabilistic Harmony Search For Binary Optimization Problems,"Salman, A. A. and Omran, M. G. and Ahmad, I.",2015,"Harmony search (HS) is an optimization technique that uses several operators such as pitch adjustments to provide local improvement to candidate solutions during the optimization process. A standard pitch adjustment operator is known to be inefficient for binary domain optimization problems. A novel adaptive probabilistic harmony search (APHS) algorithm for binary optimization problems is proposed in this paper. APHS combines the power of the standard harmony search with the modelling capability of probabilistic search algorithms, with almost no extra user-tuned parameters. In APHS, the expected value of the search probability distribution is adapted using a sample of “good” vectors among the population to minimize the cross entropy between the actual distribution and the measured one. Moreover, Bernoulli probability distribution was used to enhance the pitch adjustment operator to fit the binary optimization domain. The effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm are shown by a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art existing techniques in a number of binary space optimization problems with variant complexities and sizes. The set of binary space optimization problems investigated in this paper include: Max-One problem, Order-3 deceptive problem, Bipolar Order-6 deceptive problem, Muehlenbein’s Order-5 problem, Knapsack problem, Multi-Knapsack problem, and finally a real-world problem of the satellite broadcast scheduling.

However, under different working loads, measurement errors, environmental noise, environmental interference, and other uncertain factors, the output voltage value of a satellite power system has different levels of uncertainties. If these uncertainties and various working states are not considered, the recognition results can be of low quality. To address this problem and the uncertainty factors, we present an online dynamic working-state recognition system for satellite power systems based on uncertain data classification.

This interest came with a strong need for information in countries where the lack of reliable and timely basic information can be a problem. Thanks to its capacity to observe the Earth at local, regional, and global scales and from various vantage points, satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to streamline the monitoring and improvement of the existing systems, and thus to support decision-making. However, the path from satellite images to public policy decisions is not straightforward, and today, only few operational information services are available in SSA countries (e.g., early warning systems for food security and desert locust plagues prevention, rangeland production forecasting). This paper aims to analyze the gap between the technical aspects of the remote sensing sciences and the pragmatic need for relevant data to address agricultural policies in Africa and produce operational recommendations. To achieve this goal, the authors (1) determine the information, and in particular the geoinformation, needed to develop, implement and evaluate agricultural public policies (2) illustrate the role of remote sensing as a public policy tool in SSA through an overview of the current off-the-shelf products and services derived from Earth Observation systems, and (3) propose an analysis of the existing gap between the remote sensing research community and the policy makers.

The meteorological conditions in this region in 2021 and the data of agrochemical analysis of the soil on which the oilseed crop was grown were evaluated. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to determine the NDVI and GNDVI indices. A high content of nitrate nitrogen (12.3-16.2 mg/kg), a very low level of available phosphorus (3-10 mg/kg), and a high content of potassium (289-420 mg/kg) were found in the soil. A low content of humus (2.68-3.31%) and sulfur (1.1-4.9 mg/kg) was found. A study of the NDVI growth index showed that the highest value was reached by the period of July 20, 2021. After this period, a decrease in the vegetation index was observed. In conditions of severe drought, this change occurred earlier than under favorable conditions, and correlated with low flax yield (1.6-6.9 c/ha).

A Real Options Approach To Satellite Mission Planning,"Fuss, Sabine and Szolgayova, Jana and Obersteiner, Michael",2008,"Satellite missions are one instrument of Earth observation targeted at obtaining information for improved decision making in sustainable development. But satellite missions are expensive undertakings involving large sunk costs and facing uncertain benefit streams. In the area of avoiding damages through, for example, better weather forecasts or better-informed rescue missions, the benefits are high, but also difficult to quantify. Using real options to optimize the timing of the launch of a satellite enables us not only to optimize the timing of the mission, but also to derive the value that such information conveys when it can be used to reduce the extent of the damage from disasters and their consequences: with low benefit expectations or large uncertainty, launching will be postponed, so ex ante Earth observation benefit assessment is an important task.

Space-Based Earth Observations For Disaster Risk Management,"Le Cozannet, G. and Kervyn, M. and Russo, S. and Speranza, C. Ifejika and Ferrier, P. and Foumelis, M. and Lopez, T. and Modaressi, H.",2020,"As space-based Earth observations are delivering a growing amount and variety of data, the potential of this information to better support disaster risk management is coming into increased scrutiny. Disaster risk management actions are commonly divided into the different steps of the disaster management cycle, which include: prevention, to minimize future losses; preparedness and crisis management, often focused on saving lives; and post-crisis management aiming at re-establishing services supporting human activities. Based on a literature review and examples of studies in the area of coastal, hydro-meteorological and geohazards, this review examines how space-based Earth observations have addressed the needs for information in the area of disaster risk management so far. We show that efforts have essentially focused on hazard assessments or supporting crisis management, whereas a number of needs still remain partly fulfilled for vulnerability and exposure mapping, as well as adaptation planning. A promising way forward to maximize the impact of Earth observations includes multi-risk approaches, which mutualize the collection of time-evolving vulnerability and exposure data across different hazards. Opportunities exist as programmes such as the Copernicus Sentinels are now delivering Earth observations of an unprecedented quality, quantity and repetitiveness, as well as initiatives from the disaster risk science communities such as the development of observatories. We argue that, as a complement to this, more systematic efforts to (1) build capacity and (2) evaluate where space-based Earth observations can support disaster risk management would be useful to maximize its societal benefits.",lecozannet_spacebasedearthobservations_2020,FALSE,class_round2,NA
The Role Of African Emerging Space Agencies In Earth Observation Capacity Building For Facilitating The Implementation And Monitoring Of The African Development Agenda: The Case Of African Earth Observation Program,"Kganyago, Mahlatse and Mhangara, Paidamwoyo",2019,"AU-Agenda 2063 was adopted at the 24th Ordinary Session of the African Heads of State and Government in 2015 as the blueprint for the future development of the continent. Built upon the continent's past experiences, challenges, and successes, AU-Agenda 2063 comprehensively describes the strategic path for Africa's future development in the next 50 years. Thus, the monitoring of its implementation in various African states is critical for ensuring sustainable development and track progress. However, the higher cost of collecting data for accurately and reliably monitoring the implementation of Agenda 2063 may hinder the progress towards achieving these goals. Satellite Earth observation provides ample data, and thus has provided opportunities for the development of novel products and services with the potential to support implementation, monitoring and reporting for AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. However, it has been limitedly exploited in Africa, as evidenced by lower research outputs and investments. This calls for increased capacity building in the use of available EO data and products for various users including decision makers to advance national, regional and continental priorities. The use of such data products is often hampered by the capability to understand the products and thus their value for addressing socio-economic challenges. This paper discusses the potential of Earth observation capacity building for supporting the implementation, monitoring of, and reporting towards achieving AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. Specifically, this paper identifies existing capacity building resources, including the role of open and free Earth observation data, open-source software, and product dissemination platforms that can be leveraged for supporting national development, service delivery and the achievement of AU-Agenda 2063 targets. Furthermore, the paper recognizes the importance of bilateral and multilateral partnerships in leveraging existing know-how, technology and other resources for advancing strategic goals of African emerging space agencies and promoting sustainable development, with examples from South African National Space Agency (SANSA). Then, the challenges and opportunities for capacity building and the wide adoption of EO in Africa are discussed in the context of AU-Agenda 2063. The paper thus concludes that EO capacity building is essential to address the skills and data gaps and increase the use of EO-based solutions for decision making in various sectors, critical for achieving AU-A2063.",kganyago_roleafricanemergingspace_2019,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Research Needs,"Nelson, G. C.",2019,"This chapter focuses on how environmental policies affect international trade flows and examines how changes intrade policy affect the environment. Most economists agree that environmental problems are conceptually the same as negative externalities. They arise because control rights for resource attributes are not fully allocated. In the literaturethat examines the effects of environmental policy on trade, most empirical results suggest that there is much ado about nothing. New data sources need to be exploited. Satellite images provide a potentially rich source for economic analysisof the environment. They have the advantages of providing data from the early 1970s to the present, and being geo-referenced.

The Utility Of Historical Aerial Photographs For Detecting And Judging The Effectiveness Of Rangeland Remediation Treatments,"Rango, A. and Havstad, K.",2003,"Aerial photographs are a type of remote sensing data that are especially valuable for rangeland applications. Advantages of these data include relative ease of interpretation and acquisition, affordability, high resolution (1-2 meters), and provision of a common reference for communication among those involved in rangeland management. Additionally, air photos are especially well suited for analysis of historical rangeland remediation treatments because acquisition of widespread aerial photographic coverage began during the 1930s. Several types of treatments can be easily identified and monitored over time, including contour terraces, brush water spreaders, rootplow seeding, water ponding dikes, shrub removal by grubbing, and grazing restrictions. The use of archived aerial photographs allows the opportunity to recreate the management history of rangeland, as well as to serve as a point of departure for involvement in more sophisticated satellite-based remote sensing systems. © 2003 National Association of Environmental Professionals.",rango_utilityhistoricalaerialphotographs_2003,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Mapping Spatial Pattern In Biodiversity For Regional Conservation Planning: Where To From Here?,"Ferrier, S",2002,"Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations, distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping, derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.",ferrier_mappingspatialpatternbiodiversity_2002,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Drone Remote Sensing For Forestry Research And Practices,"Tang, L. and Shao, G.",2015,"Drones of various shapes, sizes, and functionalities have emerged over the past few decades, and their civilian applications are becoming increasingly appealing. Flexible, low-cost, and high-resolution remote sensing systems that use drones as platforms are important for filling data gaps and supplementing the capabilities of crewed/manned aircraft and satellite remote sensing systems. Here, we refer to this growing remote sensing initiative as drone remote sensing and explain its unique advantages in forestry research and practices. Furthermore, we summarize the various approaches of drone remote sensing to surveying forests, mapping canopy gaps, measuring forest canopy height, tracking forest wildfires, and supporting intensive forest management. The benefits of drone remote sensing include low material and operational costs, flexible control of spatial and temporal resolution, high-intensity data collection, and the absence of risk to crews. The current forestry applications of drone remote sensing are still at an experimental stage, but they are expected to expand rapidly. To better guide the development of drone remote sensing for sustainable forestry, it is important to systematically and continuously conduct comparative studies to determine the appropriate drone remote sensing technologies for various forest conditions and/or forestry applications. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",tang_droneremotesensingforestry_2015,FALSE,class_round2,NA
The Role Of Satellite Telemetry Data In 21St Century Conservation Of Polar Bears (Ursus Maritimus),"Laidre, Kristin L. and Durner, George M. and Lunn, Nicholas J. and Regehr, Eric V. and Atwood, Todd C. and Rode, Karyn D. and Aars, Jon and Routti, Heli and Wiig, Oystein and Dyck, Markus and Richardson, Evan S. and Atkinson, Stephen and Belikov, Stanislav and Stirling, Ian",2022,"Satellite telemetry (ST) has played a critical role in the management and conservation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) over the last 50 years. ST data provide biological information relevant to subpopulation delineation, movements, habitat use, maternal denning, health, human-bear interactions, and accurate estimates of vital rates and abundance. Given that polar bears are distributed at low densities over vast and remote habitats, much of the information provided by ST data cannot be collected by other means. Obtaining ST data for polar bears requires chemical immobilization and application of a tracking device. Although immobilization has not been found to have negative effects beyond a several-day reduction in activity, over the last few decades opposition to immobilization and deployment of satellite-linked radio collars has resulted in a lack of current ST data in many of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations. Here, we review the uses of ST data for polar bears and evaluate its role in addressing 21(st) century conservation and management challenges, which include estimation of sustainable harvest rates, understanding the impacts of climate warming, delineating critical habitat, and assessing potential anthropogenic impacts from tourism, resource development and extraction. We found that in subpopulations where ST data have been consistently collected, information was available to estimate vital rates and subpopulation density, document the effects of sea-ice loss, and inform management related to subsistence harvest and regulatory requirements. In contrast, a lack of ST data in some subpopulations resulted in increased bias and uncertainty in ecological and demographic parameters, which has a range of negative consequences. As sea-ice loss due to climate warming continues, there is a greater need to monitor polar bear distribution, habitat use, abundance, and subpopulation connectivity. We conclude that continued collection of ST data will be critically important for polar bear management and conservation in the 21(st) century and that the benefits of immobilizing small numbers of individual polar bears in order to deploy ST devices significantly outweigh the risks.",laidre_rolesatellitetelemetrydata_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA

P.",2017,"Soil prediction models based on spectral indices from some multispectral images are too coarse to characterize spatial pattern of soil properties in small and heterogeneous agricultural lands. Image pan-sharpening has seldom been utilized in Digital Soil Mapping research before. This research aimed to analyze the effects of pan-sharpened (PAN) remote sensing spectral indices on soil prediction models in smallholder farm settings. This research fused the panchromatic band and multispectral (MS) bands of WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and Landsat 8 images in a village in Southern India by Brovey, Gram-Schmidt and Intensity-Hue-Saturation methods. Random Forest was utilized to develop soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil exchangeable potassium (Kex) prediction models by incorporating multiple spectral indices from the PAN and MS images. Overall, our results showed that PAN remote sensing spectral indices have similar spectral characteristics with soil TN and Kex as MS remote sensing spectral indices. There is no soil prediction model incorporating the specific type of pan-sharpened spectral indices always had the strongest prediction capability of soil TN and Kex. The incorporation of pan-sharpened remote sensing spectral data not only increased the spatial resolution of the soil prediction maps, but also enhanced the prediction accuracy of soil prediction models. Small farms with limited footprint, fragmented ownership and diverse crop cycle should benefit greatly from the pan-sharpened high spatial resolution imagery for soil property mapping. Our results show that multiple high and medium resolution images can be used to map soil properties suggesting the possibility of an improvement in the maps’ update frequency. Additionally, the results should benefit the large agricultural community through the reduction of routine soil sampling cost and improved prediction accuracy. © 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Evaluating Nox Emission Inventories For Regulatory Air Quality Modeling Using Satellite And Air Quality Model Data,"Kemball-Cook, Susan and Yarwood, Greg and Johnson, Jeremiah and Dornblaser, Bright and Estes, Mark",2015,"The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of NOx emissions in the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ) State Implementation Plan (SIP) modeling inventories of the southeastern U.S. We used retrieved satellite tropospheric NO2 columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) together with NO2 columns from the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) to make top-down NOx emissions estimates using the mass balance method. Two different top -down NOx emissions estimates were developed using the KNMI DOMINO v2.0 and NASA SP2 retrievals of OMI NO2 columns. Differences in the top-down NOx emissions estimates made with these two operational products derived from the same OMI radiance data were sufficiently large that they could not be used to constrain the TCEQ NOx emissions in the southeast. The fact that the two available operational NO2 column retrievals give such different top-down NOx emissions results is important because these retrievals are increasingly being used to diagnose air quality problems and to inform efforts to solve them. These results reflect the fact that NO2 column retrievals are a blend of measurements and modeled data and should be used with caution in analyses that will inform policy development. This study illustrates both benefits and challenges of using satellite NO2 data for air quality management applications. Comparison with OMI NO2 columns pointed the way toward improvements in the CAMx simulation of the upper troposphere, but further refinement of both regional air quality models and the NO2 column retrievals is needed before the mass balance and other emission inversion methods can be used to successfully constrain NOx emission inventories used in U.S. regulatory modeling.

To promote the use of EOS data for application development, NASA funded the Synergy program in 2000 in partnership with academia, end users, and industry. Three examples of remote sensing applications from the Synergy program are presented here and include agriculture, range management, and water resource management. These examples show that remote sensing products have the potential to be useful to a variety of decision makers and policy makers because of the opportunity to reduce chemicals in the environment, improve crop yields and better manage range lands and water resources. Transitioning from research and development to successful applications must overcome challenges such as the lack of awareness by end users of these technologies, inadequate feedback mechanism between application developers and end users, and unproven cost benefits of remote sensing data. Experience from the Synergy program indicates that these issues could be mitigated by educating and training end users, demonstrating the utility of remote sensing data in improving decision making, and establishing and maintaining a continuous dialogue between developers and end users. Sustainability of remote sensing applications ultimately depends on users continuing reliance on products and benefits from remote sensing data.

At present, national-level alert-day identification relies predominately on surface monitor networks and forecasters. Satellite-based estimates of surface air quality have rapidly advanced and have the capability to inform exposure-reducing actions to protect public health. At present, we lack a robust framework to quantify public health benefits of these advances in applications of satellite-based atmospheric composition data. Here, we assess possible health benefits of using geostationary satellite data, over polar orbiting satellite data, for identifying particulate air quality alert days (24hr PM2.5 > 35 μg m−3) in 2020. We find the more extensive spatiotemporal coverage of geostationary satellite data leads to a 60% increase in identification of person-alerts (alert days × population) in 2020 over polar-orbiting satellite data. We apply pre-existing estimates of PM2.5 exposure reduction by individual behavior modification and find these additional person-alerts may lead to 1,200 (800–1,500) or 54% more averted PM2.5-attributable premature deaths per year, if geostationary, instead of polar orbiting, satellite data alone are used to identify alert days. These health benefits have an associated economic value of 13 (8.8–17) billion dollars ($2019) per year.

Acquisition Of Earth Science Remote Sensing Observations From Commercial Sources: Lessons Learned From The Space Imaging Ikonos Example,"Goward, SN and Townshend, JRG and Zanoni, V and Policelli, F and Stanley, T and Ryan, R and Holekamp, K and Underwood, L and Pagnutti, M and Fletcher, R",2003,"Over the last decade, NASA and other federal agencies have been increasingly encouraged to explore commercial sources of land remote sensing data rather than pursuing government-funded sources of these measurements (prior to U.S. Commercial Executive, 2003. U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. White House, Washington, DC). The science and applications users have been skeptical of this move to commercial sources of observations both because of uncertainty over the capabilities of the private sector and the unsatisfactory outcomes of previous efforts to commercialize satellite-acquired land remote sensing observations. In an effort to more fully explore the potential of commercial remotely sensed land data sources, the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) implemented an experimental Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) that solicited bids from the private sector to meet ESE-user data needs. The SDP activity spanned nearly 5 years and supplied many US and international researchers with sources of land remote sensing observations that had not been previously available. The images from the Space Imaging IKONOS system provided a particularly good match to the current ESE missions such as Terra and Landsat 7 and therefore serve as focal point in this analysis. Throughout the SDP process, there have been many lessons learned concerning interactions between US industry, government agencies and the science user community. The specifies of the Space Imaging IKONOS experience under the NASA SDP are most valuable with respect to possible future uses of commercial vendors to supply NASA ESE user needs for space-acquired land observations. Areas where valuable lessons were learned included the technical, scientific, proprietary and management aspects of the interactions. As this activity has evolved, user confidence in the technical and scientific qualities of the IKONOS measurements has increased substantially. There are still areas where further progress could be achieved, with respect to proprietary and management aspects of scientific commercial data buys. To date, the NASA scientific and applications users who have examined the IKONOS imagery have found the data to be of high quality, providing substantial value to their specific pursuits. They have found that the novel attributes of IKONOS, particularly in the spatiotemporal domain have introduced new analysis challenges not previously experienced with EOS sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. The technical qualities of the observations have been substantially improved during the SDP activity as a result of independent validation and verification by the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) of the IKONOS observations. The experience gained from the Space Imaging IKONOS SDP activity, suggests that US private sector is technically capable of meeting the needs of NASA ESE science and application users. The future success of such interactions between industry, government and users appears to be far more dependent on the organizational and legal aspects of such arrangements than technical capabilities of the data providers.

In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014.

In this system, TSEB is run using thermal band imagery from the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellites (GOES; 4 km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new Landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, similar to 16 day acquisition). Estimates of daily ET generated in two neighboring fields of Pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based flux measurements acquired in-field during most of the 2013 season with relative mean absolute errors on the order of 19-23\% (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mm d(-1)), reducing to 14-20\% at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (similar to 5 mm wk(-1)). A model overestimation of ET in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management. The results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil moisture status at field-scales over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops.

Evaluating The Public Value Of Improving Early Detection Accuracy Of Cumulonimbus Using A Geostationary Satellite In South Korea,"Kim, Ju-Hee and Lim, Hancheol and Shin, Jinho and Yoo, Seung-Hoon",2022,"The Cheollian Satellite 2A called Geo-Kompsat-2A is a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by Korea Meteorological Administration for weather and space-weather observation purposes. This article seeks to evaluate the public value arising from improving the accuracy of early detection of cumulo-nimbus using Geo-Kompsat-2A. To this end, an economic technique called contingent valuation (CV) is adopted taking a three step approach. In step 1, a CV questionnaire was prepared for deriving the willingness to pay (WTP) for the improvement. In step 2, a nationwide survey of 1000 households was conducted using the CV questionnaire and employing person-to-person interviews with household visits. In step 3, the average WTP was estimated. The yearly household average WTP was KRW 2143 (USD 1.91), securing statistical significance. Adjusting this value to suit the entire population of South Korea produces a yearly public value of KRW 44.1 billion (USD 39.3 million). Although it is not easy to accu-rately evaluate the costs involved in the improvement, the results of conducting a pilot cost-benefit analysis suggest that the improvement secures social desirability.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

A. and Dill, K. and Stephenson, P. and Stephenson, J. and Wolf, R. Escobar and Matias, O.",2008,"Over the past decade, remote sensing has been used increasingly in the study of active volcanoes and their associated hazards. Ground-based remote sensing techniques, such as those aimed at the analysis of volcanic gases or fumarole temperatures, are now part of routine monitoring operations with additional satellite-based remote sensing methods. It is likely that the use of satellite-based systems will be most beneficial for volcano monitoring in developing country regions and remote areas. In such situations, an operational real-time satellite remote sensing system could provide rapid assessment of volcanic activity levels and potentially be used to derive crucial information for disaster prevention. This would allow key at-risk areas to be rapidly and appropriately targeted. An operational test of such a system has been carried out in the past 3 years in Central America, based on local reception and analysis of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Here we analyse the performance and data quality for recent activity of Fuego volcano (Guatemala). We assess the ability of the system to detect, quantify and monitor periods of heightened activity and consider the benefits of such information being available in near-real time to local geoscientists and for hazard mitigation. We show that the system is able to detect significant changes in volcanic activity (November and December 2004, February and December 2005). There are good comparisons for these events with large-scale monitoring systems using additional remote sensing data. This paper provides one of the few evaluations of the direct application of operational AVHRR data to volcanic hazard monitoring and disaster management in developing countries.",webley_experiencesrealtimesatellite_2008,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Runoff Estimation In The Upper Reaches Of The Heihe River Using An Lstm Model With Remote Sensing Data,"Xue, Huazhu and Liu, Jie and Dong, Guotao and Zhang, Chenchen and Jia, Dao",2022,"Runoff estimations play an important role in water resource planning and management. Many accomplishments have been made in runoff estimations based on data recorded at meteorological stations; however, the advantages of the use of remotely sensed data in estimating runoff in watersheds for which data are lacking remain to be investigated. In this study, the MOD13A2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), TRMM3B43 precipitation (P), MOD11A2 land-surface temperature (LST), MOD16A2 evapotranspiration (ET) and hydrological station data were used as data sources with which to estimate the monthly runoff through the application of a fully connected long short-term memory (LSTM) model in the upstream reach of the Heihe River basin in China from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that inputting multiple remote sensing parameters improved the quality of runoff estimation compared to the use of rain gauge observations; an increase in R-2 from 0.91 to 0.94 was observed from the implementation of this process, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) showed an improvement from 0.89 to 0.93. The incorporation of rain gauge data as well as satellite data provided a slight improvement in estimating runoff with a respective R-2 value of 0.95 and NSE value of 0.94. This indicates that the LSTM model based on remote sensing data has great potential for runoff estimation, and data obtained by remote sensing technology provide an alternative approach for estimating runoff in areas for which available data are lacking.",xue_runoffestimationupperreaches_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA

"Remote Sensing For The Study, Protection And Conservation Of Cultural Heritage: The Experience Of Itaca Mission In Southern America (2007-2013)","Masini, N. and Lasaponara, R.",2014,"The importance of applying remote sensing to archaeological research has been paid great attention worldwide, due to the following aspects: (i) the improvement in spectral and spatial resolution reveals increasing detailed information for the detection of archaeological features; (ii) the development of remote sensing data processing approaches in the context of GIS help us to manage the complexity of archaeological investigations at a variety of different scales; (iii) the availability of different sensors available for remote sensing activities (LiDAR, SAR, optical, georadar, geomagnetometry, etc.) allows to obtain several information for different purposes, from site detection to documentation up to risk analysis. Moreover, archaeologists are ever more aware of the benefits of remote sensing applications for their investigations, such as: i) maps and profiles of existing and potential sites without extensive excavation; ii) reduction of costs, time and risk associated with archaeological excavation; iii) creation of site strategies, conservation, preservation; iv) assessment of the integrity of historical structures useful for their conservation. The result is the development of a scientific culture based on the interdisciplinarity and integration of knowledge, essential for applications in the field of cultural heritage. An example of such culture is the Italian heritage Conservation and Archaeo-geophysics (ITACA) Mission. It applies different scientific methodologies which rely on the most advanced Earth Observation technologies, to contribute to the study of the pre-Columbian civilizations and the cultural heritage conservation and management in Southern America.

Government strategies to control and regulate this activity are impeded by the difficulties to collect spatial information, due to the remote location and the mobile and informal natural of ASGM. Here we present and discuss the value of remote sensing techniques to complement the knowledge on artisanal mining impacts, including for detection of illegal sites, the evaluation of the degradation of soils and waters, the deforestation and the monitoring of expansion of ASGM with time. However, these techniques are blind regarding gender issues, labor relations, mobility, migration, and insecurity and need to be considered with knowledges from other disciplines.

Nasa's Early Adopter Program Links Satellite Data To Decision Making,"Brown, Molly E. and Escobar, Vanessa M.",2019,"As the cost of satellite missions grow, government agencies are working to increase the relevance and usefulness of the Earth science data that they produce.

Scientists who are designing the satellite observing system, those who are developing mission data products, and the community who will use them need to work together to determine how satellite data can better inform decision making. NASA is working to initiate engagement with data users much earlier in the satellite program life so that the user needs can be prioritized, continue to engage with users throughout the development cycle, and then include analysis on societal impact after nominal mission life. The Early Adopter Program allows for broad and early engagement with decision makers by encouraging individuals and institutions with clear uses of data to engage with the mission. Early adopters facilitate feedback on mission products during pre-launch and accelerate the utilization of these products post-launch.

Scenarios For Valuing Sample Information In Natural Resources,"Williams, Byron K. and Brown, Eleanor D.",2020,"Uncertainty is ubiquitous in natural resource systems, science and management. Sample data are obtained in order to reduce uncertainty, thereby increasing knowledge and improving resource management, but sampling always comes at a cost of some sort. Is that cost worthwhile? Analysis of the value of sample information (VSI) addresses this question. In this paper we develop the valuation of sample information in terms of five elements: (a) asystemwhose attributes are the focus of analysis; (b) a range of managementactionsthat affect the system's status; (c)uncertaintyabout system status or structure, as characterized by initial (prior) probabilities of possible system states or structures; (d) anexperimentor other information source that produces new data points and updated (posterior) probabilities; and (e) avalue measurethat is a function of the management action taken, conditional on either the system state or structure. We describe five scenarios for analysing theVSIunder uncertainty about system structure and state. Scenarios 1-3 comprise analyses of conditional, expected and optimal expected values of sample information. They focus primarily on choice of management adaptations with new information. Scenarios 4 and 5 involve pre-selected management actions, and are useful for comparing designs of data collection rather than for choosing a management action. These last scenarios expand the framework forVSIto include actions that have been selected independently of the updating of uncertainty. We discuss other extensions ofVSIanalysis, which include spatial applications, hybrid scenarios, applications involving dynamic systems, and a focus on costs rather than net benefits. Value of sample information analysis holds promise in emerging areas of ecology such as ecological forecasting and the use of remote sensing in conservation, where potential new data from models and satellites can be evaluated in advance, thereby allowing more efficient prioritization of scientific efforts. More generally,VSIcan contribute to better ecological understanding and more effective management in a wide range of ecological situations.",williams_scenariosvaluingsampleinformation_2020,FALSE,class_round2,NA
"Use Of Uav Or Remotely Piloted Aircraft And Forward-Looking Infrared In Forest, Rural And Wildland Fire Management: Evaluation Using Simple Economic Analysis","Christensen, B. R.",2015,"Background: Investment in emerging technologies may contribute to a reduction in the suppression costs of wildfires, and is thus worth careful consideration and trialling by researchers and managers. This investigation looked at the potential incorporation of a newly emerging remote sensing technology, remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared investigated using a cost-benefit analysis approach. Methods: An online survey-based approach targeting subject matter experts in wildland fire management and unmanned aircraft was used to evaluate the percentage change in the effectiveness of five different management scenarios using remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared. The most commonly accepted economic model in wildland fire management was adapted to determine the net value change between the five scenarios. Results: The benefits of incorporated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared were measured as the reduction in cost-opportunity of helicopter use, and were estimated as an average of \$548 per fire (where the average cost of fires was \$1767) or a 31 \% cost saving on total suppression costs. The return on investment of such technology was estimated at 24 fires, whereas the return of investment of the existing thermal camera/helicopter use occurred after 160 fires. Conclusions: The incorporation of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared if implemented and managed appropriately, could well improve the cost effectiveness of the current forest, rural and wildland fire fighting efforts. The inherent uncertainty on such unevaluated technology (the combination of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared) was addressed by adding stochastic variability and a triangular probability distribution approximation. Key management issues and recommendations are identified such as; greater use of current thermal camera equipment where possible, taking a project management based approach for further testing of remotely piloted aircraft and other emerging technologies, and the improved financial recording and reporting of fire management efforts.",christensen_uavremotelypilotedaircraft_2015,TRUE,class_round2,UAV/remote operated aircraft with IR cameras - is this really remote sensing in the same sense?

Air Quality Management Using Modern Remote Sensing And Spatial Technologies And Associated Societal Costs,"Uddin, W.",2006,"This paper presents a study of societal costs related to public health due to the degradation of air quality and the lack of physical activity, both affected by our built environment. The paper further shows road safety as another public health concern. Traffic fatalities are the number one cause of death in the world. Traffic accidents result in huge financial loss to the people involved and the related public health cost is a significant part of the total societal cost. Motor vehicle exhausts and industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents as well as natural sources emit nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which are precursors to the formation of ground-level Ozone. High concentration values of ground-level Ozone in hot summer days produce smog and lead to respiratory problems and loss in worker's productivity. These factors and associated economic costs to society are important in establishing public policy and decision-making for sustainable transportation and development of communities in both industrialized and developing countries. This paper presents new science models for predicting ground-level Ozone and related air quality degradation. The models include predictor variables of daily climatological data, traffic volume and mix, speed, aviation data, and emission inventory of point sources. These models have been implemented in the user friendly AQMAN computer program and used for a case study in Northern Mississippi.

Space Assets For Demining Assistance,"Kruijff, Michiel and Eriksson, Daniel and Bouvet, Thomas and Griffiths, Alexander and Craig, Matthew and Sahli, Hichem and Valcarce Gonzalez-Roson, Fernando and Willekens, Philippe and Ginati, Amnon",2013,"Populations emerging from armed conflicts often remain threatened by landmines and explosive remnants of war. The international mine action community is concerned with the relief of this threat. The Space Assets for Demining Assistance (SADA) undertaking is a set of activities that aim at developing new services to improve the socio-economic impact of mine action activities, primarily focused on the release of land thought to be contaminated, a process described as land release. SADA was originally initiated by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). It has been implemented under the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) program of the European Space Agency (ESA). Land release in mine action is the process whereby the demining community identifies, surveys and prioritizes suspected hazardous areas for more detailed investigation, which eventually results in the clearance of landmines and other explosives, thereby releasing land to the local population. SADA has a broad scope, covering activities, such as planning (risk and impact analysis, prioritization, and resource management), field operations and reporting. SADA services are developed in two phases: feasibility studies followed by demonstration projects. Three parallel feasibility studies have been performed. They aimed at defining an integrated set of space enabled services to support the land release process in mine action, and at analyzing their added value, viability and sustainability. The needs of the mine action sector have been assessed and the potential contribution of space assets has been identified. Support services have been formulated. To test their fieldability, proofs of concept involving mine action end users in various operational field settings have been performed by each of the study teams. The economic viability has also been assessed. Whenever relevant and cost-effective, SADA aims at integrating Earth observation data, GNSS navigation and SatCom technologies with existing mine action tools and procedures, as well as with novel aerial survey technologies. Such conformity with existing user processes, as well as available budgets and appropriateness of technology based solutions given the field level operational setting are important conditions for success. The studies have demonstrated that Earth observation data, satellite navigation solutions and in some cases, satellite communication, indeed can provide added value to mine action activities if properly tailored based on close user interaction and provided through a suitable channel. Such added value for example includes easy and sustained access to Earth observation data for general purpose mapping, land use assessment for post-release progress reporting, and multi-source data fusion algorithms to help quantify risks and socio-economic impact for prioritization and planning purposes. The environment and boundaries of a hazardous area can also be better specified to support the land release process including detailed survey and clearance operations. Satellite communication can help to provide relevant data to remote locations, but is not regarded as strongly user driven. Finally, satellite navigation can support more precise non-technical surveys, as well as aerial observation with small planes or hand-launched UAV's. To ensure the activity is genuinely user driven, the Geneva International Center for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) plays an important role as ESA's external advisor. ESA is furthermore supported by a representative field operator, the Swiss Foundation of Mine Action (FSD), providing ESA with a direct connection to the field level end users. Specifically FSD has provided a shared user needs baseline to the three study teams. To ensure solutions meet with end user requirements, the study teams themselves include mine action representatives and have interacted closely with their pre-existing and newly established contacts within the mine action community.

Employing advanced remote sensing techniques, the research integrates ICESat-2 ATL08 segment data, Landsat satellite imagery, and Esri Sentinel-2 Land Cover datasets to generate forest canopy cover (FCC) maps for the years 2019 and 2022. The study area was chosen due to its high population, significant tourism industry, and frequent forest fires, making it a critical region for biodiversity and forest resources in Turkey. The Canopy Cover Estimation Method (CCEM) was employed, achieving accuracy percentages ranging from 77% to 86%, demonstrating its efficacy in estimating FCC without the need for fieldwork. The integration of annual updates from the Esri Sentinel-2 Land Cover dataset as auxiliary data greatly enhanced the reliability and accuracy of the analyses. Despite challenges posed by the study area and differences in spatial resolution among the datasets, the study successfully demonstrated the utility of integrating ICESat-2 segment data and Landsat imagery for understanding the dynamics of FCC in a complex environment. The results contribute to more informed decision-making in forest management and conservation efforts.

An important aspect of data quality lies in its spatial resolution. It is unclear how finer scale land cover and land value information might further benefit biodiversity conservation. This paper aimed to assess the impacts of scale by modelling the conservation of endangered European wetland species and their corresponding habitats. Fine-scale datasets were derived by integrating existing geographical, biophysical and economic data. A habitat allocation model, based on principles from systematic conservation planning and economic theory, was developed to estimate area requirements and opportunity costs of habitat protection in Europe. Coarse-scale and fine-scale simulations were compared by inputting both resolutions into the model. Habitat locations were restricted either only by historical species occurrence data at UTM 50 resolution or additionally by explicit wetland data at 1-km(2) resolution. Coarse country-average land rents were contrasted with spatially detailed land rent estimates at a 5' resolution.

However, historically its application has been limited by high costs associated with data acquisition, analysis, and classification. In recent years, freely available satellite imagery and geospatial data sets and rapid advancement in data analysis capabilities provide immense opportunities to understand and solve the real-world environmental problems. Open-source platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide a planetary-scale environmental science data and analyses capability at much greater efficiency and accuracy than the traditional workflows. We evaluated the GEE Python API utility for classifying the freely available NAIP aerial imagery of 2017 to derive the land use land cover (LULC) information of a Panhandle area of Florida, USA. We identified eight major LULC classes with an overall accuracy of 86\% and Kappa value of 79\%. We completed all remote sensing data analyses procedures including data retrieval, classification, and report preparation in the Jupyter notebook, an open-source web application. Computation time for the procedure was less than 15 min. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for conducting land use and land cover analysis using much less time, money, and human resources.

Geospatial Web-Based Sensor Information Model For Integrating Satellite Observation: An Example In The Field Of Flood Disaster Management,"Hu, Chuli and Chen, Nengcheng and Li, Jia",2013,"Flood observation-supporting satellite sensors (FO-SSs) are the important geospatial resources to flood disaster management. In the geospatial sensor Web environment, effective flood disaster management requires on-demand integration of instant observation information from the diverse web-ready FO-SSs. We propose a sharable and interoperable Earth Observation Satellite Sensor Information (SSI) model for satellite observations integration. The SSI model reuses and extends the existing metadata standards to be a standard metadata-filled description framework. The SensorModel prototype serving here is to apply the SSI model into FO-SSs, retrieve and visualize the qualified Web-ready FO-SSs.

Remote Sensing In Support For Monitoring Rice In The Senegal Catchment,"Lefrancq, Marie and Diarra, Mamadou and Hane, Ousmane and Lhuissier, Ludovic and Ndour, Thierno and Thumerel, Bernard and Toumiat, Farouk and Yena, Mama",2020,"Senegal River catchment represents a vital source for its four riparian countries Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal, which cooperate within the interstate agency OMVS (Senegal River Basin Development Authority). The key issue of integrated water resources management addressed major challenges, especially with climate change. Satellite imagery represents thus a relevant and inexpensive source of data for observing land use changes at large scale and thus provides management support. In this context, MOSIS project (Monitoring of Observations from Satellites for Innovative Services) arose based on a ""Living Lab"" approach between SOGED, CACG and E2L. Based on the needs of end-users, an operational tool was co-designed in a single year to localise and quantify rice producing areas using Sentinel 2 satellite imagery and Web resources. The purpose of the created WebGIS was to improve the recovery rate of the irrigation fee. Many added values have emerged when used in the field: improved identification of water users and land management, an access to water use history, performance of field agents and improved communication with users and other partners. As a first step, the Senegal River Delta alone was investigated where 80\% of irrigated surfaces are. Next steps are (1) the functional improvement of the WebGIS and the satellite image processing, (2) capacity building of SOGED, (3) regulatory certification of the tool and (4) extension of the study zone to the catchment area. The created Geo-Web service also aroused a great deal of interest among different partners and state structures.

"Organisational Drivers For, Constraints On And Impacts Of Decision And Information Support Tool Use In Desertification Policy And Management","Diez, Esther and McIntosh, Brian S.",2011,"Arguments for the potential benefits that environmental decision and information support tools (DISTs) bring to managing complex environmental issues like desertification are well rehearsed. However our empirical understanding of the reasons why particular DISTs are or are not used by different policy and management organisations, and the impacts they have on the work of those organisations is substantially weaker. Such understanding is needed to determine whether concerns raised in the literature about poor adoption and use of DISTs are correct, to understand why, and to remedy them. This paper presents a thematic analysis of 31 exploratory interviews with representatives of 14 desertification policy and management organisations operating at different scales about their use of DISTs: specifically GIS. remote sensing, simulation models, statistical models and DSS. DISTs of all types were found to be used along with other sources of decision and information support including hard-copy maps, aerial photography, databases, academic literature and local participation. GIS was most widely used, by 9 of the organisations interviewed. From the interview data a generic conceptual model identifying the organisational drivers for, constraints on and impacts of DIST use in desertification policy and management organisations is developed and discussed. Drivers were grouped into those concerned with system attributes (e.g. ease of use, flexibility) and those concerned with how information is used organisationally (e.g. to facilitate communication, assessment of desertification). Barriers including DIST information attributes such as reliability and uncertainty, and additional financial investment arising from training, employment and infrastructure procurement were identified. Impacts were grouped into structural changes, individual work changes and financial investment needs. No systematic variation was evident in the drivers, constraints or impacts of use according to DIST type, although GIS was the most widely used DIST and consequently was associated with a larger number of each., Results are discussed in relation to existing theory and evidence on information system and DSS adoption and use, and found to be in agreement. The paper finishes with a set of recommended improvements to DIST design processes to enhance the uptake of and positive benefits associated with use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Mapping Regional Land Cover With Modis Data For Biological Conservation: Examples From The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Usa And Para State, Brazil","Wessels, KJ and De Fries, RS and Dempewolf, J and Anderson, LO and Hansen, AJ and Powell, SL and Moran, EF",2004,"The paper investigated the application of MODIS data for mapping regional land cover at moderate resolutions (250 and 500 in), for regional conservation purposes. Land cover maps were generated for two major conservation areas (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem-GYE, USA and the Par State, Brazil) using MODIS data and decision tree classifications. The MODIS land cover products were evaluated using existing Landsat TM land cover maps as reference data. The Landsat TM land cover maps were processed to their fractional composition at the MODIS resolution (250 and 500 m). In GYE, the MODIS land cover was very successful at mapping extensive cover types (e.g. coniferous forest and grasslands) and far less successful at mapping smaller habitats (e.g. wetlands, deciduous tree cover) that typically occur in patches that are smaller than the MODIS pixels, but are reported to be very important to biodiversity conservation. The MODIS classification for Para State was successful at producing a regional forest/non-forest product which is useful for monitoring the extreme human impacts such as deforestation. The ability of MODIS data to map secondary forest remains to be tested, since regrowth typically harbors reduced levels of biodiversity. The two case studies showed the value of using multi-date 250 m data with only two spectral bands, as well as single day 500 in data with seven spectral bands, thus illustrating the versatile use of MODIS data in two contrasting environments. MODIS data provide new options for regional land cover mapping that are less labor-intensive than Landsat and have higher resolution than previous 1 km AVHRR or the current 1 km global land cover product. The usefulness of the MODTS data in addressing biodiversity conservation questions will ultimately depend upon the patch sizes of important habitats and the land cover transformations that threaten them.

The study was carried out using IRS 1C, LISS III data of December 11, 1997 (pre-treatment) and November 15, 2002 (post-treatment) covering the watershed to assess the changes in land use / land cover and biomass that have changed over a period of five years (1997-2002). The images were classified into different land use/land cover categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach. The results indicated that the area under agriculture crops and forest land were increased by 671 ha (5.7%) and 1,414 ha (11.94%) respectively. This is due to the fact that parts of wastelands and fallow lands were brought into cultivation. This increase in the area may be attributed to better utilization of surface and ground waters, adoption of soil and water conservation practices and changes in cropping pattern. The area under waste lands and fallow lands decreased by 1,667 ha (14.07%) and 467 ha (3.94%), respectively. The vegetation vigour of the area was classified into three classes using NDVI. Substantial increase in the area under high and low biomass levels was observed (502 ha and 19 ha respectively). The benefit-cost analysis indicates that the use of remote sensing and GIS was 2.2 times cheaper than the conventional methods. Thus, the repetitive coverage of the satellite data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the land resources and evaluate the land cover changes through comparison of images for the watershed at different periods. © 2008 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",shanwad_applicationremotesensingtechnology_2008,TRUE,class_round2,NA
May Smart Technologies Reduce The Environmental Impact Of Nitrogen Fertilization?

This is because of its ability to use multi-source information in decision support systems to increase the efficiency of farm management. Among the agronomic practices for which precision agriculture concepts were applied in research and operational contexts, variable rate (VR) nitrogen fertilization plays a key role. A promising approach to make quantitative, spatially distributed diagnoses to support VR N fertilization is based on the combined use of remote sensing information and few smart scouting-driven ground estimates to derive maps of nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this study, a new smart app for field NNI estimates (PocketNNI) was developed, which can be integrated with remote sensing data. The environmental impact of using PocketNNI and Sentinel 2 products to drive fertilization was evaluated using the Life Cycle Assessment approach and a case study on rice in northern Italy. In particular, the environmental performances of rice fertilized according to VR information derived from the integration of PocketNNI and satellite data was compared with a treatment based on uniform N application. Primary data regarding the cultivation practices and the achieved yields were collected during field tests. Results showed that VR fertilization allowed reducing the environmental impact by 11.0\% to 13.6\% as compared to uniform N application. For Climate Change, the impact is reduced from 9373 to 832.7 kg CO2 eq/t of paddy rice. The highest environmental benefits - mainly due to an improved ratio between grain yield and N fertilizers were achieved in terms of energy consumption for fertilizer production and of emission of N compounds. Although further validation is needed, these preliminary results are promising and provide a first quantitative indication of the environmental benefits that can be achieved when digital technologies are used to support N fertilization.

Diversity Features Collaboration Technology For Monitoring Forest Before And After Hurricane By Remote Sensing,"Zhong, X. and Feng, W. and Quan, Y. and Huang, W. and Xing, M.",2022,"Objective: Change monitoring and disaster assessment of hurricane-damaged forests is an important application of remote sensing technology. The extraction of feature information from remote sensing images is very important to the effect of forest remote sensing monitoring. The combination of diversity features can effectively improve the monitoring accuracy of forest change. However, the current spatial information acquisition algorithms, such as texture features, still retain the traditional fixed computing model and do not fully consider the diversity of the spatial distribution of ground objects. When extracting texture features, the accuracy of texture features will be affected if the sliding window is too large or too small. Therefore, the calculation method of this kind of texture feature is always faced with the problem of a hard balance between the number of features and the neighborhood reference range. Therefore, this paper focuses on forest change monitoring technology. Method: To solve the above problems, in this paper, a remote sensing monitoring method for forest destruction before and after hurricanes is proposed based on diversity feature collaborative technology. Firstly, the difference between normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (NDVI) before and after forest remote sensing image change was calculated. Secondly, the compound window technology is proposed to extract the texture features. Then, the texture features extracted from the remote sensing image and the spectrum of the remote sensing image were used to build a diversity characteristic combination model. This can enhance the diversity of features. Finally, an improved rotating forest algorithm based on feature separation is proposed to reduce the direct feature correlation and improve the accuracy of the classifier. Result: The study area used in this study is the remote sensing image of the Nezer forest in France before and after the hurricane, which is derived from the Formosat-2 satellite. In the experimental part, the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the other six methods. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional change detection methods based on spectral features and texture features, the overall accuracy of the proposed method, the detection accuracy of the changed area and the unchanged area are improved by 3.68%, 5.82% and 3.46%, respectively. In addition, this paper tested the sensitivity of features extracted by different methods to the number of training samples. The results show that the proposed method still maintains high classification accuracy in different training sample numbers, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are better than the comparison methods. And after the number of training samples reaches 50, the accuracy of the proposed method tends to flatten out. Conclusion: The proposed method can effectively improve the performance of forest change monitoring. This method can be used to monitor the change and damage of forests in real-time, and obtain the information of forest disaster areas efficiently, which can provide important reference data for the emergency decision-making of forest resource management departments. Therefore this method has high practical value. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin. All rights reserved.",zhong_diversityfeaturescollaborationtechnology_2022,FALSE,class_round2,NA

This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed ""cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning"" (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction.

Reducing The Cost Of Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing: Combining Near-Infrared Video Imagery With Colour Aerial Photography,"Wright, GG and Matthews, KB and Cadell, WM and Milne, R",2003,"Land managers are often confronted with management problems that could be addressed using decision support or management information systems. The use of such tools, however, depends on the availability of appropriately resolved spatial data. One source of such data is multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery. The cost of such imagery, particularly where environmental goals are most important, is often prohibitive. Even when the cost of such imagery can be met; other factors, such as cloud cover for satellite-based systems or sensor scheduling for sophisticated airborne systems, may mean that imagery is not available. This paper investigates the utility of a system that combines near-infrared imagery from a video camera with conventional medium-format aerial photography deployed in a light aircraft platform. Previously, imagery obtained from video cameras has suffered from limited spectral range and from significant image motion effects. These problems were eliminated by the use of an electronic-shutter charge-coupled device video camera with a strong IR response. The systems components and the approach to their operational deployment are described and the options, for transforming the raw imagery into survey coverage discussed. The image quality and cost is presented for a site characterisation application where the aim is the generation of normalised difference vegetation index values.

This study explores sustainable alternatives like animal manure and remote sensing for resource-efficient rice cultivation. It aims to assess the long-term impact of organic fertilization and remote sensing monitoring on agronomic traits, yield, and nutrition.Methods: A six-year experiment in rice fields evaluated fertilization strategies, including pig slurry (PS) and chicken manure (CM) with mineral fertilizers (MIN), MIN-only, and zero-fertilization. Traits, yield, spectral responses, and nutrient content were measured. Sentinel-2 remote sensing tracked crop development.Results: Cost-effective organic fertilizers (PS and CM) caused a 13\% and 15\% yield reduction but still doubled zero-fertilization yield. PS reduced nitrogen leaching. Heavy metals in rice grains were present at safe amounts. Organic-fertilized crops showed nitrogen deficiency at the late vegetative stages, affecting yield. Sentinel-2 detected nutrient deficiencies through NDVI.Discussion: Organic fertilizers, especially PS, reduce nitrogen loss, benefiting the environment. However, they come with yield trade-offs and nutrient management challenges that can be managed and balanced with reduced additional mineral applications. Sentinel-2 remote sensing helps manage nutrient deficiencies. In summary, this research favors cost-effective organic fertilizers with improved nutrient management for sustainable rice production.",martijerez_agronomicperformanceremotesensing_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA

European Space Agency's Strategic Contribution To Seismology,"Petiteville, Ivan",2013,"The impacts of disaster events such as earthquakes on economic and human lives are increasing every year, in particular due to the growing urbanization. Until recently, stakeholders involved in disaster risk management focused their efforts mainly on the response phase, immediately after the crisis. Following the recommendations of several recent studies and in order to minimize the increasing impacts of natural disasters, decision-makers and major stakeholders have showed an increasing interest in mitigation activities. Earth Observation (EO) data from space could bring a significant added value to the various phases of the seismic risk management cycle from the mitigation and preparedness phases. Space agencies need to better contribute to the management of geohazards in response to the growing request from the community of users (e. g. seismologists, insurance companies, urban planners). To foster the use of EO remote sensing data, satellite data providers have to take the appropriate measures to remove the policy and technical barriers related to the data access. They have also to increase the awareness of the community of users on the potential benefits that could be gained from the use of EO satellite data. This paper will provide examples of areas where EO remote sensing data from space could bring an added value to the current management of risks and crisis related to earthquakes. Then, the paper will describe the strategic measures undertaken by the European Space Agency in an international framework, to foster the use of satellite data by the various relevant stakeholders.",petiteville_europeanspaceagency'sstrategic_2013,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Complementing Satellites And Unmanned Aerial Vehicles For Rangeland Assessment In Patagonia,"Easdale, M. H. and Umaña, F. and Raffo, F. and Fariña, C. and Bruzzone, O.",2019,"Rangelands assessment in arid and semiarid regions is a key tool both for livestock management planning and environmental diagnoses. Even though there is a consensus on the utility of such tools, rangeland assessment with high detail (grain) while covering large areas or landscapes (extension) is too costly. Then, the compatibility between the resolution and quality of information and the spatial extent required to make decisions in livestock systems is still an operational challenge that has not found an effective solution. Thus, the use of satellite images for rangeland assessments in different environments has been growing steadily in the last two decades. The developments associated with the capture of images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would offer many advantages as a complement to information, since they increase the spatial resolution. The aim of this work was to classify rangeland environments using satellite and UAV images and compare their respective contributions for rangeland assessments in Patagonia. In particular, spatial resolution of an unsupervised classification of rangeland environments using SPOT 7 satellite images and images captured by an optical sensor mounted on an UAV were compared. Rangeland assessment can be potentiated by the use of different sources of information in a more complementary and accessible way for environmental monitoring, and for a pastoral management planning in highly heterogeneous environments from arid and semiarid regions of Patagonia, Argentina. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

Application-Oriented Real-Time Remote Sensing Service Technology,"Li, D. and Ding, L. and Shao, Z.",2021,"The aerospace industry in China has developed rapidly over the past 40 years. Remote sensing satellites have grown and gradually developed, and this situation has formed a variety of various satellite series. The communication satellite series, navigation satellite series, Earth observation satellite series, and science and technology test satellite series constitute the current application satellite system in China, which is used in national land and resources survey, meteorological services, environmental monitoring, ocean remote sensing, and other fields. This system provides the foundation for the development of satellite applications. At present, the satellite systems of communication, navigation, and remote sensing are separate and independent. Thus, they cannot meet the real-time, intelligent, and diversified requirements in the era of big data. In addition to the application of land, surveying and mapping, planning, geology and mining, agriculture, transportation, marine, and other industries, the government, enterprises, and the public have shown a large and urgent need for satellite remote sensing navigation data and services, especially high-resolution satellite remote sensing data and services. The demand of users in different industries and fields for remote sensing data products has gradually changed from singularity and standardization to diversification and specialization; from static investigation to dynamic monitoring, forecasting, and forecasting; from qualitative analysis to quantitative research; and from general application to batch business. Therefore, with the application requirements as the traction, focusing on improving the service capabilities of satellite remote sensing, the communication-navigation-remote sensing integrated space-based information service system with integrated communication, navigation, and remote sensing can be built to provide all-day, all-weather, all-region application-oriented services. This system fully utilizes the benefits of satellite applications. Thus, it breaks the barriers of satellites of communication, navigation, and remote sensing. Building a space-based information real-time service system (positioning, navigation, timing, remote sensing, communication, PNTRC) based on ""one-satellite multitasking, multi-satellite networking, multi-network integration, and intelligent services"" that integrates communication, navigation, and remote sensing, has become an important direction for the development of contemporary aerospace information technology. In the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, it is inevitable to study remote sensing service technologies for real-time applications in the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence is important to meet people's strong demand for ""fast, accurate, and flexible"" remote sensing information services with the way of B2B, B2G, or B2C. This paper first studied the real-time service capabilities of space-air-ground-sea integrated Earth observation network. Then, the real-time application service requirements of remote sensing technology (requirements for high-efficiency remote sensing services for earthquake and disaster relief, remote sensing monitoring requirements for land surface deformation, and demand for public real-world services) were elaborated. Finally, the on-orbit processing technology based on artificial intelligence was analyzed, and the trend of remote sensing technology transformed from remote sensing information to real-time services was discussed. © 2021, Science Press.

The Emerging Role Of Remote Sensing Technology In Emergency Management,"Adams, B. J. and Huyck, C. K.",2006,"The use of remote sensing technology is becoming increasingly widespread at all levels of the disaster management cycle. This paper reviews a number of emerging application areas, drawing on examples from both natural disasters such as earthquakes, and man-made events including recent terrorist attacks. In terms of mitigation and preparedness, remote sensing is making an increasing contribution towards inventory development, hazard and risk assessment and logistical planning. After a disaster has occurred, remote sensing offers a rapid low-risk method of assessing damage to critical infrastructure and the urban built environment. In particular, high resolution coverage enabled the detection of bridge damage following the Northridge earthquake and collapsed buildings following various earthquakes in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Once the initial chaos has subsided, the value of remote sensing data lies in post-event monitoring; tracking changes in hazard location and extent. Reference is made to emergency operations following the World Trade Center attack, where remote sensing imagery supported various response efforts. In terms of secondary applications, details are given concerning innovative new research, using information derived from remote sensing coverage for running traffic rerouting programs, and as a supplementary data source for loss estimation models. © 2006 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Value Of Airborne Laser Scanning And Digital Aerial Photogrammetry Data In Forest Decision Making,"Kangas, A. and Gobakken, T. and Puliti, S. and Hauglin, M. and Naesset, E.",2018,"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been the main method for acquiring data for forest management planning in Finland and Norway in the last decade. Recently, digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has provided an interesting alternative, as the accuracy of stand-based estimates has been quite close to that of ALS while the costs are markedly smaller. Thus, it is important to know if the better accuracy of ALS is worth the higher costs for forest owners. In many recent studies, the value of forest inventory information in the harvest scheduling has been examined, for instance through cost-plus-loss analysis. Cost-plus-loss means that the quality of the data is accounted for in monetary terms through calculating the losses due to errors in the data in the forest management planning context. These costs are added to the inventory costs. In the current study, we compared the losses of ALS and DAP at plot level. According to the results, the data produced using DAP are as good as data produced using ALS from a decision making point of view, even though ALS is slightly more accurate. ALS is better than DAP only if the data will be used for more than 15 years before acquiring new data, and even then the difference is quite small. Thus, the increased errors in DAP do not significantly affect the results from a decision making point of view, and ALS and DAP data can be equally well recommended to the forest owners for management planning. The decision of which data to acquire, can thus be made based on the availability of the data on first hand and the costs of acquiring it on the second hand.",kangas_airbornelaserscanningdigital_2018,TRUE,class_round2,NA

AQAST aims to increase the use of Earth science products in air quality-related research and to help meet air quality managers' information needs. We conducted a Web-based survey and a limited number of follow-up interviews to investigate federal, state, tribal, and local air quality managers' perspectives on usefulness of Earth science data and models, and on the impact AQAST has had. The air quality managers we surveyed identified meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter, emissions from mobile sources, and interstate air pollution transport as top challenges in need of improved information. Most survey respondents viewed inadequate coverage or frequency of satellite observations, data uncertainty, and lack of staff time or resources as barriers to increased use of satellite data by their organizations. Managers who have been involved with AQAST indicated that the program has helped build awareness of NASA Earth science products, and assisted their organizations with retrieval and interpretation of satellite data and with application of global chemistry and climate models. AQAST has also helped build a network between researchers and air quality managers with potential for further collaborations. Implications: NASA's Air Quality Applied Science Team (AQAST) aims to increase the use of satellite data and global chemistry and climate models for air quality management purposes, by supporting research and tool development projects of interest to both groups. Our survey and interviews of air quality managers indicate they found value in many AQAST projects and particularly appreciated the connections to the research community that the program facilitated.

Planning Iterative Investment For Landscape Restoration: Choice Of Biodiversity Indicator Makes A Difference,"Butler, Don William",2009,"Natural regrowth vegetation offers a cost-effective means of restoring some degraded landscapes. Worldwide, policy responses to climate change are increasing the attractiveness of investment in regrowth protection or facilitation which with strategic planning could also deliver substantial dividends for biodiversity conservation. This study compares the performance of two commonly used indicators of biodiversity conservation priority, irreplaceability and complementarity, as tools to support planning for iterative investment to protect natural regrowth of Brigalow, an endangered ecological community in subtropical eastern Australia. Brigalow covered more than seven million hectares prior to clearing, it now persists 'intact' on less than a tenth of that area but there are significant areas of regrowth. Data on Brigalow regrowth derived from mapping and remote sensing identify 10,555 patches covering 280,000 hectares in total. Two different classifications are used to represent Brigalow biodiversity: a land-type classification of 16 'regional ecosystems' mapped at 1:100,000 scale, and a landscape-scale classification of 40 biogeographic subregions that discriminate relatively uniform landscapes at about 1:500,000 scale. Conservation targets are expressed as the extent of regrowth needed to increase the extent of intact or 'remnant' areas of each biodiversity feature to either 5\% or 10\% of its former extent. In each case, irreplaceability and complementarity are positively correlated, and either metric type could be used to identify relatively large sets of high-priority patches. However, regional-scale restoration is likely to involve iterative investment and therefore to require discrimination of relatively small sets of patches of the highest priority for biodiversity conservation. Irreplaceability is not an ideal measure of biodiversity value when planning such iterative processes, simply because irreplaceability is uninformative for ranking 'high-value' patches; they all have the highest possible score. This study demonstrates the importance of considering quite fundamental points when choosing metrics for conservation planning, such as the frequency distribution of values they produce. Where planning aims to identify quite small sets of very high value features metrics that are most variable among the highest value patches, like the one used for complementarity, in this study, will be more useful than metrics that are strongly bounded at higher values.

Measuring The Economic Benefits Of An Environmental Monitoring Satellite Project: The Value Of Information Approach,"Eom, Young Sook and Hong, Jong Ho",2013,"This paper reports a first application of contingent valuation method to measure the value of information generated by earth science data from an environmental geostationary satellite payload called Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Satellite. The purpose of the space project is to improve the accuracy of air pollution information by enhancing air pollution monitoring and forecasting system coupled with conventional ground level monitoring stations located throughout South Korea. Estimation results based on a survey data of 1000 households show that most explanatory variables including bid amounts and household income significantly influenced dichotomous choice contingent valuation responses with expected signs. When applied to the whole sample, mean willingness to pay reflecting both use and non-use values was stable at around \$3.70 per year for the improvement of air quality information. Present values of total benefits over the lifetime period of the space satellite exceed the cost born by tax payers with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.77.

The results indicate that remote sensing plays an important role in ecosystem service valuation in the large areas where mangroves and aquaculture are mixed. We estimated the value of mangrove ecosystem services using market price and replacement cost approaches to determine an initial assessment of the overall contribution of mangroves to human well-being. The total estimated value was US\$ 600 million/year for 187,533 ha (approximately US\$ 3000/ ha/year), which is slightly smaller than the gross domestic product (GDP) of the province (US\$ 0.69 billion in 2010). However, this is only a partial estimate that does not consider other services (tourism, biocliversity, cultural and social values), clue to the absence of primary data The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to combine the approaches of remote sensing and household survey for the quantification of mangrove ecosystem services in the mangrove-shrimp integrated system.

The Six Dimensions Of Value Associated To The Use Of Copernicus Sentinel Data: Key Findings From The Sentinel Benefits Study,"Sawyer, Geoff and Mamais, Eleftherios and Papadakis, Dimitri",2022,"The role of Earth Observation (EO) data from satellites in supporting informed decision-making and more efficient operational processes is becoming increasingly recognized. However, analysing the value that this generates remains a challenge. Often, top-down cost-benefit analyses are used to justify budgets but with very broad-based, macro-economic assumptions. The approach discussed in this paper is bottom-up building on the use of a single product or service arising from the use of data coming from one or more of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. This allows a much finer, detailed understanding of how the data is being used and hence contributing to informed decision making. A case-based, value-chain methodology has been applied through which the impact on society can be analysed. Whilst early cases focused on economic value i.e., monetized benefits, later ones recognise that often the benefits may be wider than this. For instance, organisations can benefit through an increased reputation, or societal values such as quality of life can be felt. Consequently, a set of non-monetary dimensions have been defined which provide a new framework for the analysis.

Numerical Modelling And Satellite Remote Sensing As Tools For Research And Management Of Marine Fishery Resources,"George, G.",2014,"This chapter outlines the use of modelled and satellite remote sensing (SRS) data in supporting the research, technology-development and management of marine fishery resources. The value of such methods used in marine fisheries management is emphasized. State of art techniques in fisheries resource management utilizing numerical models, and SRS, separately and jointly, are described here. Numerical models are useful for studying fish and other aquatic invertebrate larval transport. SRS data are used to locate fish stocks, locate areas of reef stress and delineate areas of high productivity in the wake of cyclone paths. Coupling SRS with models helps to manage fishery resources on an ecosystem scale, generate potential fishing zones (PFZ), forecast ocean state (OSF), detect meso-scale features such as eddies and track cyclones threatening coastal resources. Modelled, SRS and in situ data sets in combination can be used in the estimation of potential fishery resources in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which in turn can help in fishing fleet management.

"Policy Implications Of Remote Sensing In Understanding Urban Environments: Developing A Wetlands Inventory For Community Decision-Making In Lucas County, Ohio","Lawrence, P. L. and Czajowski, K. and Torbick, N.",2005,"The growth in urbanized land has created a variety of impacts to natural areas. Urbanization has many effects on a wetland in terms of climate, air and water quality, hydrological changes, and boundaries and fragmentation of flora and fauna (Ehrenfeld, 2000). Wetlands must be valued as they provide many public amenities with long-term functions, which may be unrecoverable if the wetlands are lost through development, including drainage, water supply and natural habitat provisions (Mitsch et al, 2000). Because public policy supported the filling and destruction of wetlands for so long, land use planners are often reluctant or uninformed on how to integrate them into urban environments (Tilton, 1995). The use of remote sensing technology for the identification, inventory, mapping, and classification of land wetlands has been a common application of satellite imagery (MacDonald, 1999; Lyon, 2001). Numerous studies have discussed the positive benefits and opportunities presented by the technology as well as the barriers and limitations (Hardisky et al, 1986; Johnston and Barson, 1993; Kindscher et al., 1998; Lunetta and Barlogh, 1999; Munyati, 1999; Schmidt and Skidmore, 2003, Shuman and Ambrose, 2003, Townsend and Walsh, 2001). With recent improvements in the methods, computing advances, and the easier access and availability of the satellite imagery and data, it has become more possible to consider further advancements in the use of remote sensing to specifically address issues associated with wetlands research and related policy implications. The results of such research have important applications in addressing wetland management issues-such as wetland loss, degradation, and potential for restoration and remediation-within urban centers where land use pressures have negative impacts on the existence and health of wetland ecosystems. For a comprehensive review of the issues regarding the use of satellite remote sensing for wetlands, the reader is referred to Ozesmi and Bauer (2002). Beyond the methodological and technological advances-and remaining limitations-related to the use of remote sensing for wetlands inventories there are several other practical related issues in regards to how the results from such studies can be applied to address the management and decision-making at the community scale in urban areas. In addition to overcoming common barriers characteristic to the transfer of advanced computer technology-such as needs for software training, access to data sets, the availability of sufficient computer hardware requirements, and related cost issues-the use of remote sensing requires consideration of several other additional remaining issues. The application and transfer of remote sensing methods and technology for urban planning requires understanding of the complexity of wetland definitions and related management issues, acceptance of the level of accuracy obtained by the remote sensing technology, commitment for the support and funding necessary to continue and maintain inventories, databases, and for future updating of the wetland classification. The technical, educational, and decision-making issues regarding the development and utilization of remote sensing for a wetlands inventory for use in urban planning and decision-making will be examined in this paper. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",lawrence_policyimplicationsremotesensing_2005,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Cooperation In Earth Observation Missions In Africa: A Role For Afrigeoss,"Agbaje, Ganiy I. and John, Olusoji N.",2018,"This paper is aimed at examining the role of African Global Earth Observation System of Systems (AfriGEOSS) in Earth Observation (EO) mission cooperation on the continent of Africa. It discusses the importance of earth observation programs for developing countries as well as the benefits of international cooperative efforts. The paper further examined some collaborative projects on Earth Observation in Africa and their associated problems. It specifically looked at the EO data coordination initiatives such as the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), GEOSS, Africa Discovery Broker, etc. It then situates AfriGEOSS in the context of African Space Agenda (ASA) with recommendations especially to the Africa Union Commission for the realization of ASA set goals. The paper reiterated that regardless of whether developed or developing, Earth observation information provides substantial benefit supporting economic development, decision making and policy implementation of all countries of the world.

Design And Simulation In Sar Satellites' Task Planning System Using Genetic Algorithm With Entropy Operator,"Liu, Wan and Li, Zeyu and Chen, Li and Zhang, Dexin and Shao, Xiaowei",2021,"Purpose - This paper aims to innovatively propose to improve the efficiency of satellite observation and avoid the waste of satellite resources, a genetic algorithm with entropy operator (GAE) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites' task planning algorithm. Design/methodology/approach - The GAE abbreviated as GAE introduces the entropy value of each orbit task into the fitness calculation of the genetic algorithm, which makes the orbit with higher entropy value more likely to be selected and participate in the remaining process of the genetic algorithm. Findings - The simulation result shows that in a condition of the same calculate ability, 85\% of the orbital revisit time is unchanged or decreased and 30\% is significantly reduced by using the GAE compared with traditional task planning genetic algorithm, which indicates that the GAE can improve the efficiency of satellites' task planning. Originality/value - The GAE is an optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. It combines entropy in thermodynamics with task planning problems. The algorithm considers the whole lifecycle of task planning and gets the desired results. It can greatly improve the efficiency of task planning in observation satellites and shorten the entire task execution time. Then, using the GAE to complete SAR satellites' task planning is of great significance in reducing satellite operating costs and emergency rescue, which brings certain economic and social benefits.",liu_designsimulationsarsatellites_2021,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Measuring And Monitoring Restored Ecosystems: Can Remote Sensing Be Applied To The Ecological Recovery Wheel To Inform Restoration Success?,"McKenna, Phillip B. and Lechner, Alex M. and Santin, Lorna Hernandez and Phinn, Stuart and Erskine, Peter D.",2023,"The commencement of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration has highlighted the urgent need to improve restoration science and fast-track ecological outcomes. The application of remote sensing for monitoring purposes has increased over the past two decades providing a variety of image datasets and derived products suitable to map and measure ecosystem properties (e.g. vegetation species, community composition, and structural dimensions such as height and cover). However, the operational use of remote sensing data and derived products for ecosystem restoration monitoring in research, industry, and government has been relatively limited and underutilized. In this paper, we use the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) ecological recovery wheel (ERW) to assess the current capacity of drone-airborne-satellite remote sensing datasets to measure each of the SER's recommended attributes and sub-attributes for terrestrial restoration projects. Based on our combined expertise in the areas of ecological monitoring and remote sensing, a total of 11 out of 18 sub-attributes received the highest feasibility score and show strong potential for remote sensing assessments; while sub-attributes such as gene flows, all trophic levels and chemical and physical substrates have a reduced capacity for monitoring. We argue that in the coming decade, ecologists can combine remote sensing with the ERW to monitor restoration recovery and reference ecosystems for improved restoration outcomes at the local, regional, and landscape scales. The ERW approach can be adapted as a monitoring framework for projects to utilize the benefits of remote sensing and inform management through scalable, operational, and meaningful outcomes.",mckenna_measuringmonitoringrestoredecosystems_2023,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Valuing The Potential Impacts Of Geoss: A Systems Dynamics Approach,"Obersteiner, M. and Rydzak, F. and Fritz, S. and McCallum, I.",2012,"Global earth observations are perceived as instrumental to attaining sustainable development goals. Methods to assess the long-run socioeconomic benefits of the emerging global Earth observation system of systems (GEOSS) as an integrated multisensor infrastructure have been missing to date. This chapter presents a systems dynamics approach to assess the effect of improvements in Earth observations across the nine societal benefit areas of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO). Two types of integration are assessed with the proposed model structure: (1) measuring benefits in an integrated assessment environment (e.g., improved weather forecasting through better measurement of cloud properties could lead to benefits in the agriculture, energy and water sectors); and (2) measuring benefits of an integrated observing system (e.g., in areas with high cloud cover, improvements in the resolution of optical sensors will lead to benefits only if linked to supplementary observing systems such a radar or ground surveys). The benefits from integration relate mostly to economies of scope on both the observation and benefit system sides. Cost reduction from economies of scale are derived from a global or large scale observing system vis-a-vis the currently prevailing patchwork system of national or regional observing systems. Results indicate that the total system benefits of GEOSS are usually orders of magnitude higher than their costs. Benefits are also policy dependent and tend to increase with the degree of implementation of mainly international environmental agreements. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.",obersteiner_valuingpotentialimpactsgeoss_2012,TRUE,class_round2,"Modeled scenarios / ""storylines"" across multiple societal benefit areas to see how GEOSS might create benefits"
The Efficacy Of Tm Satellite Imagery For Rapid Assessment Of Chihuahuan Xeric Habitat Intactness For Ecoregion-Scale Conservation Planning,"Allnutt, TF and Wettengel, WW and Reyna, JV and Garcia, RCD and Elias, EEI and Olson, DM",2002,"A critical step in designing effective conservation landscapes is the identification of relatively intact natural habitats. Satellite remote sensing has been effectively used to distinguish relatively intact and degraded forests at a number of scales. However, the utility of remote sensing data for rapid and cost-effective assessments of habitat intactness across large and regions has not been adequately tested. To this end, we tested the ability of TM imagery to rapidly discriminate different levels of habitat degradation across large regions of the Chihuahuan Desert. We were able to identify relatively intact habitat in many cases. However, degraded habitat was often misidentified as relatively intact. The use of both mid- and late-season imagery provides some improvement by highlighting phenological differences among the intactness classes. Overall, low vegetation cover and inter- and intra-seasonal variability diminish the utility of TM imagery for large-scale conservation planning in the Chihuahuan Desert.

Using Landsat Satellite Data To Support Pesticide Exposure Assessment In California,"Maxwell, Susan K. and Airola, Matthew and Nuckols, John R.",2010,"Background: The recent U. S. Geological Survey policy offering Landsat satellite data at no cost provides researchers new opportunities to explore relationships between environment and health. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential for using Landsat satellite data to support pesticide exposure assessment in California. Methods and Results: We collected a dense time series of 24 Landsat 5 and 7 images spanning the year 2000 for an agricultural region in Fresno County. We intersected the Landsat time series with the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) land use map and selected field samples to define the phenological characteristics of 17 major crop types or crop groups. We found the frequent overpass of Landsat enabled detection of crop field conditions (e. g., bare soil, vegetated) over most of the year. However, images were limited during the winter months due to cloud cover. Many samples designated as single-cropped in the CDWR map had phenological patterns that represented multi-cropped or non-cropped fields, indicating they may have been misclassified. Conclusions: We found the combination of Landsat 5 and 7 image data would clearly benefit pesticide exposure assessment in this region by 1) providing information on crop field conditions at or near the time when pesticides are applied, and 2) providing information for validating the CDWR map. The Landsat image time-series was useful for identifying idle, single-, and multi-cropped fields. Landsat data will be limited during the winter months due to cloud cover, and for years prior to the Landsat 7 launch (1999) when only one satellite was operational at any given time. We suggest additional research to determine the feasibility of integrating CDWR land use maps and Landsat data to derive crop maps in locations and time periods where maps are not available, which will allow for substantial improvements to chemical exposure estimation.",maxwell_landsatsatellitedatasupport_2010,FALSE,class_round2,NA

The Economic Impact Analysis Of Satellite Development And Its Application In Korea,"Park, Jung Ho and Jung, Hojin and Lim, Chang Ho and Chang, Taejin",2020,"Many countries began satellite development from the beginning of the space era and especially after the Apollo era. Korea started satellite development in 1992 by launching small satellite KITSAT-1 more than 20 years after the Apollo 11 lunar landing.

Korea is currently developing KOMPSAT 6 and 7 with advanced optical and radar observation capability, GEO-KOMPSAT 2B, middle-sized Compact Advanced Satellites (CAS), and next generation small satellite (NEXTSat). These efforts will raise Korea's satellite technology to the next level. To prepare strategies for efficient and effective development of satellites, it is essential to elaborately assess the economic impacts of previous satellite development projects and their application. In this paper, we examine the economic impacts of Korea's investment into the research and development of national satellites, and their application in the perspective of satellite value chain. To this end, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis on the development of representative satellites.

Using Very High Resolution Remote Sensing For The Management Of Coral Reef Fisheries: Review And Perspectives,"Hamel, Melanie A. and Andrefouet, Serge",2010,"Coral reef fisheries are critical for food security and as a source of income in developing and developed countries, but they are collapsing in many areas.

The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities. Given the theoretical benefits brought by relevant habitat maps in EBFM frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate fishery technical services demands and local requirements.

M.",2011,"Monitoring and reporting on the state of nature gained increasing importance in the European Union with the implementation of the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 network. Reporting habitat conservation status requires detailed knowledge on many aspects of habitats at different spatial levels. Remote sensing is recognised as a powerful tool to acquire synoptic data on habitats, but to date, its use for Natura 2000 monitoring and reporting is still very limited. One reason for this appears to be the knowledge gap between the nature conservation agencies and the remote sensing community. We conducted a review of legal monitoring and reporting requirements on Natura 2000 habitats, looked into the current use of remote sensing in habitat reporting, and consulted monitoring experts in nature conservation administrations to find out about their attitude and expectations towards remote sensing. In this paper, we disclose and summarise the real data needs behind the legal requirements for Natura 2000 habitat monitoring and reporting, analyse opportunities and constraints for remote sensing, and highlight bottlenecks and pathways to resolve them. Monitoring experts are not unwilling to use remote sensing data, but they are unsure of whether remote sensing can suit their needs in a cost-effective way. They look upon remote sensing as a one-way process of data deliverance and fail to see the importance of their active cooperation. Based on our findings, we argue that the integration of remote sensing into Natura 2000 habitat monitoring could benefit from (1) harmonising and standardising approaches, (2) focusing on data at hand to develop readily useful products, (3) a proper validation of both traditional and remote sensing methods, and (4) an enhanced sharing and exchange of ideas and results between the different research communities involved. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",vandenborre_integratingremotesensingnatura_2011,FALSE,class_round2,NA

As for big data applications, their main improvement to conventional flood management stems from the integration of different data streams to improve situational awareness. Digital twins not only help to improve the speed and quality of management decisions by visualizing complex data in a simple and accessible way during a disaster; they can also simulate the evolution of a disaster while taking into account the unique characteristics and conditions of a city, thereby acting as a critical element of an early warning system.

They are highly productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecological and economic goods and services for humans. In order to develop programs for applying guided conservation and enhancing ecosystem management, accurate and regularly updated maps on their distribution, extent, and species composition are needed. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques have made it possible to gather the required information about mangrove ecosystems. Since costs are a limiting factor in generating land cover maps, the latest remote sensing techniques are advantageous. In this study, we investigated the potential of combining Sentinel-2 and Worldview-2 data to classify eight land cover classes in a mangrove ecosystem in Iran with an area of 768 km(2). The upscaling approach comprises (i) extraction of reflectance values from Worldview-2 images, (ii) segmentation based on spectral and spatial features, and (iii) wall-to-wall prediction of the land cover based on Sentinel-2 images. We used an upscaling approach to minimize the costs of commercial satellite images for collecting reference data and to focus on freely available satellite data for mapping land cover classes of mangrove ecosystems. The approach resulted in a 65.5\% overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.63, and it produced the highest accuracies for deep water and closed mangrove canopy cover.

A Global Vision For Monitoring Ecosystem Services With Satellite Sensors,"Alcaraz-Segura, D. and Di Bella, C.

Repeated efforts have been made to quantify, value, map, monitor, and analyze the various ecosystem service components that sustain human well-being: from the early attempts of Costanza et al. (1997) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005) to the more recent integrative initiatives of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2013) and the Global System for Monitoring Ecosystem Service Change (Tallis et al. 2012; GEO BON ES 2013). The latter initiatives join more than 50 international organizations and 80 governmental representations under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations in order to develop the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Their aim is to compile extensive and standard monitoring of multiple services to allow policymakers and scientists to explore, better understand, and prioritize trade-offs across socioecological settings and scales (from the national to the global level). The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) identified four main sources of data: national statistics, field-based observations, remote sensing, and numerical simulation models (Tallis et al. 2012). Of these, remote sensing offers the potential to use the same standard protocols from local to global scales and through time, which is essential for long-term monitoring and for trade-off assessment across regions. Satellite-based earth observation is probably the most economically feasible means to systematically retrieve global information with high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution over large areas (Ayanu et al. 2012). Decline in the cost involved in obtaining such data and increase in the computational power of higher resolution sensors to cope with larger data sets will maximize this advantage (Kreuter et al. 2001). © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",alcarazsegura_globalvisionmonitoringecosystem_2013,FALSE,class_round2,NA

"Measuring Conservation Value At Fine And Broad Scales: Implications For A Diverse And Fragmented Region, The Agulhas Plain","Rouget, M",2003,"This study explores the implications of spatial scale for conservation planning in the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. Regional planning relies on broad-scale data but fine-scale data are usually required for implementation at local level. This study addresses the implications of broad-scale planning for fine-scale implementation. Two original systems of notional reserves were developed for this region using C-plan, a decision support system for systematic conservation planning. The first conservation plan was derived using broad scale data (1:250,000) and consisted of nine broad habitat units (land classes based on topography, geology, and climate), remote sensing mapping of habitat transformation and large-planning units defined by 1/16th degree squares (average size 3900 ha). The second system was identified at a finer scale (1:10,000) using 36 vegetation types (mapped in the field), ground survey mapping of habitat transformation and cadastral boundaries as planning units (average size 252 ha). Using classification trees, this study compared reserve-design efficiency (the area required to achieve conservation targets), the spatial patterns,of conservation value (the irreplaceability value of planning units), biodiversity features, and habitat transformation at both scales. A similar amount of land was required to meet all conservation targets (identified using minimum set analysis) at the broad and fine scale. There was considerable overlap between the two conservation plans as most of fine-scale conservation targets could be achieved under the broad-scale conservation plan. However, irreplaceability values, which measure the likelihood of selecting planning units for achieving representation targets, were much higher at the fine scale. The use of broad-scale biodiversity features underestimated irreplaceability value at a fine scale in heterogeneous and fragmented portions of the landscape. The implications of moving from broad- to fine-scale conservation planning, as well as their respective benefits are discussed. Maximising biodiversity conservation while minimising cost and resources might be achieved by a combination of broad-scale assessments for relatively homogeneous and untransformed areas and fine-scale ones for heterogeneous and fragmented areas.

Applications Of Remote Sensing To Precision Agriculture With Dual Economic And Environmental Benefits,"Seielstad, G. A. and Laguette, S. and Seelan, S. and Lawrence, R. and Nielsen, G. A. and Clay, D. and Dalsted, K.",2002,"In the U.S. Northern Great Plains, growing seasons are short but extremely productive. Farms and ranches are large, so many of precision agriculture's early adopters reside in the region. Crop yield maps at season's end reveal sizable variations across fields. Farm management relying upon uniform chemical applications is ineffective and wasteful. We provided information about crop and range status in near-real-time, so that in-season decisions could be made to optimize final yields and minimize environmental degradation. We created learning communities, in which information is shared among scientists, farmers, ranchers, and data providers. The new information for agricultural producers was satellite and aerial imagery. Value-added information was derived from ETM+, AVHRR, IKONOS, and MODIS sensors. The emphasis was on reducing the time between acquisition of data by a satellite and delivery of value-added products to farmers and ranchers. To distribute large spatial data sets in short times to rural users we relied upon satellite transmission (Direct PC). Results include: (1) management zone delineation, (2) variable-rate fertilizer applications, (3) weed detection, (4) irrigation efficiency determination, (5) detection of insect infestation, (6) specification of crop damage due to inadvertent chemical application, and (7) determination of livestock carrying capacities on rangelands.",seielstad_applicationsremotesensingprecision_2002,TRUE,class_round2,NA
Using Remote Sensing To Evaluate Environmental Institutional Designs: A Habitat Conservation Planning Example,"Schweik, CM and Thomas, CW",2002,"Objective. Satellite-based remote-sensing analysis is a beneficial, yet underused, tool for environmental policy, planning, and evaluation. We identify its benefits and costs to encourage social scientlists to consider the use of remote sensing as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutions. Methods. We analyze two multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images to evaluate a habitat conservation plan (HCP) implemented Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. Results, Image analysis provides useful broad spatial scale information on HCP performance that is not discernible to the naked eye or through other methodologies. Conclusions. Satellite image analysis should be considered as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutional designs-despite the financial costs and requisite technical training. These images provide ecological and land cover change information that may not be available elsewhere.

Translation Of Remote Sensing Data Into Weed Management Decisions,"Shaw, DR",2005,"Remote sensing and associated spatial technologies provide tremendous opportunity to enhance weed management and improve-protect the environment through judicious use of the most efficacious control methods for a given site. They can also be invaluable assets for detection of invasions, assessment of infestation levels, monitoring rate of spread, and determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts for weed management. In combination with other technologies such as global positioning systems and geographic information systems, sampling strategies can be devised to efficiently determine the location of weed populations in agricultural and wildland situations. Maps created from remote sensing or sampling (or both) allow site-specific weed management of only the areas requiring corrective action. Potential benefits to the land managers and the ecosystem as a whole will come from reductions in inputs, reduced environmental liability from the detrimental effects of applying control measures to entire areas, crop yield increases through better management decisions, and early detection and effective management of invading species. Improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, temporal frequency, image turnaround time, and cost of image acquisition, combined with the realization of the value of the data, are enhancing the acceptance and usage of remote sensing technologies. However, remote sensing will be best used by providing accurate, site-specific data that can be converted into information used by decision support systems (DSSs). Advances in these DSSs, and their ability to incorporate remote sensing data, have been rapid and widespread in the past 10 yr. As a result, federal management and research agencies, academic institutions, and private entities have collectively developed efforts to use this information in monitoring and management efforts for invasive species in western rangelands, aquatic ecosystems and forestry, and site-specific weed management in agronomics.",shaw_translationremotesensingdata_2005,FALSE,class_round2,NA

As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate people’s willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was €21.80 (median €10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80–90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks.

It is urgent to help terminal users make appropriate decisions according to real-time network environment and domain requirements, and obtain the optimal resources efficiently from the massive remote sensing resources. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm using fusion of attention and multi-perspective (MRS_AMRA). Based on MRS_AMRA, we further implement an active service recommendation model (MRS_ASRM) for massive multi-source remote sensing resources by combining streaming pushing technology. Firstly, we construct value evaluation functions from multi-perspective in terms of remote sensing users, data and services to enable the adaptive provision of remote sensing resources. Then, we define multi-perspective heuristic policies to support resource discovery, and fusion these policies through the attention network, to achieve the accurate pushing of remote sensing resources. Finally, we implement comparative experiments to simulate accurate recommendation scenarios, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, such as DIN and Geoportal.

We compared and assessed the utility of Landsat-derived and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived burnt area mapping (30 m and 250 m resolution, respectively) for sub-regional, landscape and habitat scale management. We did so by using Sentinel-2-derived, 10 m resolution, burnt area mapping as a reference, to determine the most appropriate product to support land management planning. At the landscape scale, Landsat had significantly lower average omission and commission errors (3.4\% and 8.0\%, respectively) compared with that of MODIS (42.2\% and 19.9\%, respectively). At the habitat scale, Landsat burnt area percentage was more accurate, in plots of 500 m x 500 m (root mean square error (RMSE) 0.6\% to 8.6\%), but offered lower accuracy when estimating partially burnt habitat plots of 120 m x 120 m (RMSE 14.1\% to 23.9\%).

The conclusion of this benchmark study is that the use of NASA/USGS optical/thermal satellite imagery can considerably improve hydrologic decision support tools compared to their traditional implementations.

Estimating The Benefits Of Land Imagery In Environmental Applications: A Case Study In Nonpoint Source Pollution Of Groundwater,"Bernknopf, R. L. and Forney, W. M. and Raunikar, R. P. and Mishra, S. K.",2012,"Moderate-resolution land imagery (MRLI) is crucial to a more complete assessment of the cumulative, landscape-level effect of agricultural land use and land cover on environmental quality. If this improved assessment yields a net social benefit, then that benefit reflects the value of information (VOI) from MRLI. Environmental quality and the capacity to provide ecosystem services evolve because of human actions, changing natural conditions, and their interaction with natural physical processes. The human actions, in turn, are constrained and redirected by many institutions and regulations such as agricultural, energy, and environmental policies. We present a general framework for bringing together sociologic, biologic, physical, hydrologic, and geologic processes at meaningful scales to interpret environmental implications of MRLI applications. We set out a specific application using MRLI observations to identify crop planting patterns and thus estimate surface management activities that influence groundwater resources over a regional landscape. We tailor the application to the characteristics of nonpoint source groundwater pollution hazards in Iowa to illustrate a general framework in a land use-hydrologic-economic system. In the example, MRLI VOI derives from reducing the risk of both losses to agricultural production and damage to human health and other consequences of contaminated groundwater. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.",bernknopf_estimatingbenefitslandimagery_2012,TRUE,class_round2,NA

This could lead to more efficient field work practices thus enabling more optimal allocations of costs and labour during archaeological excavations. This study explores the contribution of processed satellite bathymetry maps to the recording of two archaeological coastal sites: a submerged prehistoric settlement in Greece and a shipwreck of a modern cargo vessel in Italy. The results indicate that even though the accuracy of satellite derived bathymetry is high, the level of detail (spatial resolution) is not sufficient to fully replace field-based measurements. However, the use of satellite data complements the existing techniques and can help to place the archaeological sites within a broader spatial context as well as to efficiently monitor the deterioration of a site due to natural causes or human activity, which inevitably leads to risk management.

At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration. Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access. The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users. The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities.

Lucille and Hoffman, Laura and McCarty, Jessica L.",2018,"A challenge in addressing climate risk in developing countries is that many regions have extremely limited formal data sets, so for these regions, people must rely on technologies like remote sensing for solutions. However, this means the necessary formal weather data to design and validate remote sensing solutions do not exist. Therefore, many projects use farmers' reported perceptions and recollections of climate risk events, such as drought. However, if these are used to design risk management interventions such as insurance, there may be biases and limitations which could potentially lead to a problematic product. To better understand the value and validity of farmer perceptions, this paper explores two related questions: (1) Is there evidence that farmers reporting data have any information about actual drought events, and (2) is there evidence that it is valuable to address recollection and perception issues when using farmer-reported data? We investigated these questions by analyzing index insurance, in which remote sensing products trigger payments to farmers during loss years. Our case study is perhaps the largest participatory farmer remote sensing insurance project in Ethiopia. We tested the cross-consistency of farmer-reported seasonal vulnerabilities against the years reported as droughts by independent satellite data sources. We found evidence that farmer-reported events are independently reflected in multiple remote sensing datasets, suggesting that there is legitimate information in farmer reporting.

We measure conservation benefits both as the amount of three tree structures and as the number of species in three species groups. We also estimate both the information cost associated with selecting conservation areas and the opportunity cost. we found the key habitat strategy to be the over-all most cost-effective. in this strategy, the areas have a flexible size and are selected by the authorities in a national field survey.

We emphasize that the differences we found are associated with the selection process and that other aspects, such as long-term survival of species, may rank the strategies differently.

We evaluated the impact of satellite image spatial resolution (1m from Digital Globe; 30m from Landsat) on land use classification via ArcGIS Feature Analyst, and on total suspended solids (TSS) load estimates from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Camboriu watershed in Southeastern Brazil. We independently calibrated SWAT models, using both land use map resolutions and short-term daily streamflow (discharge) and TSS load data from local gauge stations. We then compared the predicted TSS loads with monitoring data outside the model training period.

However, the 1m data incurred considerably higher costs relative to the 30m data (\$7000 for imagery, plus additional analyst time). Importantly, the choice of spatial resolution affected the estimated return on investment (ROI) in watershed conservation for the municipal water company that finances much of this conservation, although it is unlikely that this would have affected the company's decision to invest in the program.

Using Remote Sensing Data For Earthquake Damage Assessment In Afghanistan: The Role Of The International Charter,"Korsu Kandeh, J. M. and Ahadi, A. W. and Kumar, L.",2005,"Afghanistan is located in a zone of high-seismic activity. Given the rugged and mountainous nature of the country and the location of villages, towns and cities, there is propensity for widespread death and destruction due to landslides whenever an earthquake occurs. Use of satellite imagery by humanitarian agencies in Afghanistan in preparation for and response to natural and man-made disasters has been very limited, mostly to International organizations such as the United Nations. Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) due to their vantage position have demonstrated their ability to rapidly provide vital information and services in a disaster situation. EOS has been used in emergency situations where the ground resources are often lacking. The perception amongst humanitarian agencies and civil protection authorities in most developing countries is that the cost of satellite imagery is not cheap. With limited budgets available for purchasing satellite data, they tend to opt for less expensive solutions such as interagency survey teams to assess damages. The rugged and mountainous nature of Afghanistan and the lack of roads in most parts of the country, survey teams are most often hampered, leading to delays in delivery of information from the field to the decision makers. Recent earthquake in the Hindu Kush of the country in April 2004 witnessed the triggering of the International Charter for free delivery of satellite imagery. Image analysis and interpretation of both pre and crisis data did not show observable features of damages. The damage assessment maps were used by the humanitarian community for decision-making. Availability and access to space technology in addressing natural disasters have been the main obstacles facing developing countries particularly those poor countries without their own space programs. This problem has been solved through the introduction of The International Charter for major disasters. However, knowledge about the Charter is not common knowledge in most developing countries; Disaster Management Authorities, the Academic Institutions, humanitarian agencies and the affected communities have very little idea about the availability and access to free satellite imagery. There is need for a massive awareness campaign to educate decision makers about the International Charter and the potentials of using space technology in addressing problems relating to disaster management and the environment. The skills to process satellite imagery and integrate it with other GIS layers are lacking in most developing countries; there is need to embark on a massive capacity building exercise to ensure optimization of the benefits of the technology. The Charter needs to find innovative ways of quickly sending value added information products to disaster management authorities instead of relying on in-country skills in image processing. This paper elaborates on the experiences gained working with images received from the International Charter, and the immense pressures from the humanitarian community for rapid delivery of information. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",korsukandeh_remotesensingdataearthquake_2005,FALSE,class_round2,NA

Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (fivefold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future.",peng_assessingbenefitsatellitebased_2020,FALSE,class_round2,NA
Geometric Accuracy Assessment Of Very High-Resolution Optical Data Orthorectified Using Terrasar-X Dsm To Support Disaster Management In Indonesia,"Sari, I. L. and Siwi, S. E. and Brahmantara, R.

A.",2018,"Advanced remote sensing satellite data with detail spatial resolution can be an alternative to aerial photography and outweigh in providing rapid and vast spatial, remote area, and consist of multispectral bands to produce continues information. The various types of very high spatial resolution satellite, benefit in producing information for large-scale mappings, such as updating an urban map and supporting disaster management for mitigation, preparedness, emergency response, and recovery effectively and efficiently. Large-scale mapping information for disaster management, particularly for quick response is essential to map the impacted sites, measure the number of houses and infrastructure damaged and determine the evacuation area. However, in producing large-scale mapping, the information should refer to the geospatial specification standard, such as accurate geometric, detail thematic information and completeness. This study aims to identify the use of Pleiades imagery for supporting large-scale mapping, including for disaster management by assessing the geometry accuracy from a standard product acquired from the ground station and precise orthorectification using different types of DSM, including TerraSAR-X and improvement using ground control points. The results show that the improved accuracy to meet geometric accuracy standard for scale 1:5000 can be achieved using a primary product data which process using an insertion of GCPs and selecting the better DSM, while for the standard ortho product can be achieved using shifting the coordinate position of the image.

Advanced Warning Method For Aircraft Landing Risk Under Air –Ground Data Real-Time Transmission Conditions,"Wang, Y. and Zhao, X.",2023,"At present, the flight safety work of civil aviation in China mainly investigates the probable causes of accidents and analyzes flight data after air accidents, causing numerous problems such as passive safety management and delayed risk control. To realize the early warning of flight risk during flight, a dynamic method for the evaluation of landing risk and early warning under the condition of future air –ground data real-time transmission was proposed. The landing stage, which has the most complex operation program and the highest accident rate during a flight, was taken as the research object, and future air-to-ground high-throughput interconnection scenarios comprising 5G and satellite networks were considered to solve the problem of advanced intelligent warnings and aircraft alarms in abnormal flights. First, according to the accident causation theory, the human factor reliability model, the system model, and other theories or models, a landing warning index system based on multisource real-time operation data and the integration of historical statistics and expert knowledge was established. Then, a grounding parameter prediction model was established to solve the problem of lag in the acquisition of four grounding parameters, namely ground pitch angle, ground speed, ground vertical rate, and 50 ft-ground horizontal flight distance in actual flight. This model classified the pilot’s landing operation mode by clustering ARJ21 historical landing data and determined the attribute mean value of the four parameters for each type of operation mode. Furthermore, according to decision field theory, the model discussed the landing mode selection of pilots with different personalities in different scenarios and calculated the selection probability of the pilot’s landing operation mode, thereby obtaining the predicted values of the four above-mentioned indicators. According to the above, aiming at the complexity and uncertainty of the landing risk early warning system, a reasoning method of the multilayer confidence rule base was proposed. This method improved the traditional reasoning method of the single-layer confidence rule base and adopted the bottom-up hierarchical reasoning method considering the complexity characteristics of the landing process, effectively integrating different sources and forms of qualitative or quantitative data. Thus, the dynamic assessment and reasoning of the landing risk were realized. Finally, using the reasoning-based calculation of the landing process for the “2020.10.16 Panzhihua runway grounding event” and “2010.8.2 Yichun air disaster,” the results verified the effectiveness of the method. It was found that the early warning time of the Panzhihua event can reach 13 s. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved.",wang_advancedwarningmethodaircraft_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
A Comprehensive Survey On Gnss Interferences And The Application Of Neural Networks For Anti-Jamming,"Lorraine, Kambham Jacob Silva and Ramarakula, Madhu",2023,"In recent years, modern systems are highly reliant on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as reliable positioning, navigation, and timing services have become crucial in many safety-critical, security, and emergency applications. Although GNSS technology offers precise and global positioning and navigation, the GNSS signals are susceptible to intentional and unintentional Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) as the signal strength is weak when they reach the receiver. Hence, the receiver's performance gets degraded as the interference signal may cause navigation error or saturate the receiver's operation. Therefore, the research on interference mitigation is of high interest to the GNSS community and is emerging rapidly. In order to have a beneficial and extensive outlook, an in-depth survey on GNSS interferences and the application of metaheuristic based neural networks for interference cancellation has been presented in this paper; with an emphasis on one of the major GNSS threats i.e. jamming. Various solutions adopted by the researchers to cope up with the interference have been surveyed and presented. Also, to have a more intuitive insight, a comparative analysis of the existing mitigating techniques has been summarized. In addition, the review focuses on the neural network approach for anti-jamming and also discusses the implementation strategy of particle swarm optimization based back propagation neural network (PSO-BPNN) to address the shortcomings of traditional training algorithms. Finally, the future aspects to further enhance the neural network algorithms for anti-jamming have also been provided for the benefit of researchers.",lorraine_comprehensivesurveygnssinterferences_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

A water quality management model developed for dry rivers is applied on Wadi Rumah in Saudi Arabia. The sub-basin was delineated from 30-m x 30-m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Hydrologic loss, runoff rates, and time of concentration were determined using the soil conservation service curve number, soil conservation service unit hydrograph methods, and Kirpich formula. Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System estimated the wet weather flows for 10 low-to-medium rainfall events. A steady-state hydrodynamic model including river flows, effluent discharge, and evaporation and infiltration losses estimated the hydraulic retention time for the explicit case of ponding conditions of dry rivers. Mass balance and first-order kinetics modeled the physical (total dissolved solid and total suspended solid), chemical (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, NH3, PO4, and Cl2), and microbiological (total coliform and fecal coliform) parameters. The hydrodynamic model and biokinetic rate coefficients were calibrated with satellite images, reported literature, and field measurements. A water quality index compared the aggregated water quality against the standards for 4 intended uses. The study yields ""very good"" water quality for restricted and unrestricted irrigation for the dry period, ""fair"" for livestock drinking, and ""marginal"" for fishery and recreation for the dry period, while water quality remained ""marginal"" for all the uses in the wet period.

Spatial Distribution Of Xco2 Using Oco-2 Data In Growing Seasons,"Siabi, Z. and Falahatkar, S. and Alavi, S. J.",2019,"The purpose of this research is to assess the spatial distribution of CO2 concentration during the growing seasons (April to September) in 2015 over Iran. The XCO2 data belonging to orbiting carbon observatory-2 (OCO-2) and eight environmental variables data consist of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), net primary productivity (NPP), land surface temperature (LST), leaf area index (LAI), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and national land cover map were modeled by multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The values of R2 and RMSE indices show the good performance of the multi-layer perceptron model for monthly models. Based on sensitivity analysis results, land cover and wind direction had the most important role in the spatial distribution of XCO2. Also, the results revealed that the maximum values of XCO2 observed in the east, south east, and desert areas in central of Iran due to the lack of vegetation cover, lack of local wind current, and high temperature. The western, northwestern and northern regions of Iran have the minimum amounts of XCO2 because of existing valuable ecosystem such as Hyrcanian and Zagrous forests, rangeland, air currents, and low temperature. The findings of this study indicated that the manageable factors such as land cover and vegetation cover play very important roles in the spatial distribution of CO2 and finding carbon dioxide source and sink at national scale. Therefore, policymakers and managers by the logical management of these resources are able to control or even reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in different areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",siabi_spatialdistributionxco2oco_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Investing In Nature: Restoring Coastal Habitat Blue Infrastructure And Green Job Creation,"Edwards, P. E. T. and Sutton-Grier, A. E. and Coyle, G. E.",2013,"This study examines the economic impact of the expenditures from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administered for coastal habitat restoration projects around the United States. Estimates of the total jobs created as well as the average number of jobs created per million dollars spent are provided. The study shows that the 50 ARRA projects administered by NOAA in the first year and half generated a total of 1409 jobs. These habitat restoration projects created, on average, 17 jobs per million dollars spent which is similar to other conservation industries such as parks and land conservation, and much higher than other traditional industries including coal, gas, and nuclear energy generation. This suggests that habitat restoration is indeed an effective way to stimulate job creation. In addition, habitat restoration has longer-term economic benefits, including future job creation in rebuilt fisheries and coastal tourism, and benefits to coastal economies including higher property values and better water quality. Therefore, investing in blue infrastructure habitat restoration is a green opportunity benefiting coastal economies and societies in both the short and the long term. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",edwards_investingnaturerestoringcoastal_2013,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Automatic Site Selection Of Sight-Seeing Route In Ecotourism Destinations Based On Landscape Perception Sensitivity,"Li, J. and Li, R.",2012,"Sight-seeing route is an interactive interface between tourists and ecotourism environments. How to design tourist routes perperly and reduce the interference to the environment is an important issue to be resolved in ecological tourism plannings. Although public attitudes towards landscapes are shaped by many different factors, such as age, sex, social and economic status etc., there are also some common preferences to landscape types, especially for people with similar education background or environmental value orientations. Ecotourists are just such groups. This paper introduced the visible perception affected by landscape visibility, the best viewing distance and the best viewing orientation, and the ecological perception affected by the landscape types and the resource value into the landscape perception sensitivity model, and built a synthesis-weight computation model of ecotourism destination sight-seeing routes selection with the combination of topographic factors such as slope and relief degree of land surface (RDLS). The main steps are as follows. Firstly, the authors calculated the landscape perception degree of each landscape, then added the results together and divided the results into ten levels from high to low using the reclassification tools of ArcGIS, assigned 1-10 to each level; Secondly, calculated the slope and RDLS using terrain analysis tool of ArcGIS platform, and also divided the results into ten levels from low to high using the reclassification tools of ArcGIS, assigned 1-10 to each level; Thirdly, built the suitability computation function of sight-seeing route selection in ecotourism destinations, and calculated the weight results combined with landscape perception degree and terrain factors, then selected the best sight-seeing route using the optimal path analysis of ArcGIS platform; Finally, revised the sight-seeing route acquired automatically with field trips, expert opinion and other factors, so as to the characteristics of scenic landscape to be shown better, and the route is more realistic. This method is tested in the case of Qixiagu scenic region, Wu'an National Geopark in Handan, Hebei Province. Based on Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and high-resolution satellite images, the authors first built the virtual 3D landscape in the ecotourism destination, and then the best scenic sight-seeing route of Qixiagu scenic region was selected automatically based on the virtual geographical environment structured by ArcGIS platform. Finally the sight-seeing route was revised by field trips and other correction factors. Thus a sight-seeing route was determined in easy way where tourists can have better perception. This method can supply us a relatively reasonable sight-seeing route quickly in scenic spot planning period. The synthesis-weight computation model of ecotourism destination sight-seeing route selection provides a quantitative analysis method for the plannings of ecotourism and landscape designs in micro-scale. This method can be also applied to the evaluation the existing sight-seeing route in scenic spot.

Seasonality Of Soil Erosion Under Mediterranean Conditions At The Alqueva Dam Watershed,"Ferreira, Vera and Panagopoulos, Thomas",2014,"The Alqueva reservoir created the largest artificial lake of Western Europe in 2010. Since then, the region has faced challenges due to land-use changes that may increase the risk of erosion and shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, increasing the need to promote land management sustainability. This paper investigates the aspect of seasonality of soil erosion using a comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and remote-sensing. An experimental agro-silvo pastoral area (typical land-use) was used for the RUSLE factors update. The study confirmed the effect of seasonality on soil erosion rates under Mediterranean conditions. The highest rainfall erosivity values occurred during the autumn season (433.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)), when vegetation cover is reduced after the long dry season. As a result, the autumn season showed the highest predicted erosion (9.9 t ha(-1)), contributing 65 \% of the total annual erosion. The predicted soil erosion for winter was low (1.1 t ha(-1)) despite the high rainfall erosivity during that season (196.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)). The predicted annual soil loss was 15.1 t ha(-1), and the sediment amount delivery was 4,314 x 10(3) kg. Knowledge of seasonal variation would be essential to outline sustainable land management practices.

Based On The Gaussian Fitting Method To Derive Daily Evapotranspiration From Remotely Sensed Instantaneous Evapotranspiration,"Liu, Suhua and Su, Hongbo and Zhang, Renhua and Tian, Jing and Chen, Shaohui and Wang, Weimin and Yang, Lijun and Liang, Hong",2019,"Evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant component in the water cycle, and the estimation of it is imperative in water resource management. Regional ET can be derived by using remote sensing technology which combines remote sensing inputs with ground-based measurements. However, instantaneous ET values estimated through remote sensing directly need to be converted into daily totals. In this study, we attempted to retrieve daily ET from remotely sensed instantaneous ET. The study found that the Gaussian fitting curve closely followed the ET measurements during the daytime and hence put forward the Gaussian fitting method to convert the remotely sensed instantaneous ET into daily ETs. The method was applied to the middle reaches of Heihe River in China. Daily ETs on four days were derived and evaluated with ET measurements from the eddy covariance (EC) system. The correlation between daily ET estimates and measurements showed high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.82, a mean average error (MAE) of 0.41mm, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.46mm. To make more scientific assessments, percent errors were calculated on the estimation accuracy, which ranged from 0\% to 18\%, with more than 80\% of locations having the percent errors within 10\%. Analyses on the relationship between daily ET estimates and land use status were also made to assess the Gaussian fitting method, and the results showed that the spatial distribution of daily ET estimates well demonstrated ET differences caused by land use types and was intimately linked with the vegetation pattern. The comparison between the Gaussian fitting method and the sine function method and the ETrF method indicated that results derived through the Gaussian fitting method had higher precision than that obtained by the sine function method and the ETrF method.",liu_basedgaussianfittingmethod_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Application Of Multiple-Optimization Filtering Algorithm In Remote Sensing Image Denoising,"Zhang, Xuelin and Li, Yuan and Feng, Xiang and Hua, Jian and Yue, Dong and Wang, Jianxiong",2023,"Denoising remote sensing images is crucial in the application and research of remote sensing imagery. Noise in remote sensing images originates from sensor characteristics, signal transmission, and environmental conditions, among which Gaussian noise is the most common type. In this paper, we proposed a multiple-optimization bilateral filtering (MOBF) algorithm based on edge detection and differential evolution (DE) methods. The proposed algorithm optimizes the spatial domain filtering kernel and the spatial domain Gaussian kernel by using the standard deviation and width of the edge response. By employing the DE algorithm, the individuals in the population based on the standard deviation of the gray value domain are subjected to iterative mutation, crossover, and selection operations to refine the latent solution vectors and determine the optimal color space for optimizing the standard deviation of the pixel range domain kernel. As a result, the MOBF algorithm, which does not require any parameter input, is realized. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, denoising experiments were conducted on remote sensing images by using evaluation metrics such as the mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index. The experimental results revealed that the MOBF algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms for all three evaluation metrics.",zhang_applicationmultipleoptimizationfiltering_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Remote Sensing Estimation Of Cotton Water Productivity In Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis Based On Google Earth Engine,"He, X. and Sawut, M. and Sheng, Y. and Li, R.",2023,"An accurate and quantitative evaluation of crop water productivity is the basis for the improvement of crop yield in arid regions and is of great significance to alleviate water shortage and drive sustainable agricultural development. We have considered the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis on the north bank of the Tarim Basin of China as the subject area, and the watershed SEBAL remote sensing evapotranspiration model and cotton distribution identification model are established employing the Google Earth Engine cloud platform from 2009 to 2020. The production estimation model was used to evaluate the moisture productivity of cotton in the watershed. The following results were observed. (1) The cotton production in the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis ranges from 1610.10 kg·hm−2 in 2009 to 1855.05 kg·hm−2 in 2020, with a growth rate of 13.20%. The cotton planting area extends to the edge of oasis year by year, and the center of gravity of cotton production moves 2485 m from west to east. (2) The average evapotranspiration (ET) value during the cotton growth period was 686.80 mm in 2009 and was 738.66 mm in 2020, indicating an overall upward trend, with a growth rate of 7.02%. The maximum value of ET during the cotton growth period was observed during the flowering and boll-opening stages. The higher ET value is mainly distributed in the interior of the oasis and at the edge of the north bank of the Tarim River. (3) The average water productivity in 2009 and 2020 was 0.21 kg·m−3 and 0.25 kg·m−3, respectively, indicating a growth rate of 16% in 12 years. In terms of space, the gravity center of water productivity in the Ugan-Kuqa River Oasis moved 1832 m from the northeast to the southwest of Hongqi Town, with an average annual moving speed of 152.67 m·a−1. The water productivity of oasis cotton showed an expanding trend in the east-west direction compared with that in the north-south direction. The trend of spatial distribution direction had been enhanced, and the spatial pattern tended to be agglomerated. (4) After 12 years, the increased yield rate exceeded the increased evapotranspiration rate, promoting the increase of water productivity. Moreover, water productivity is closely related to the cotton planting area and reasonable water irrigation technology. High water productivity is mainly distributed in Xinken Farm in Xayar County and Sangtamu Farm in Xinhe County, respectively.

"Impact Of Anthropological Activities On Land-Use And Land-Cover Changes In The Lower Okavango Delta, Botswana","Gondo, R. and Mutanga, C. N.",2024,"Anthropogenic land alterations in Maun village have transformed natural vegetation into urban infrastructure, including pavements, and residential and commercial areas, leading to elevated Land Surface Temperature (LST). This urban expansion resulted from economic growth driven by population increase and tourism-related development. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCCs) and LST. Utilising Landsat 5-TM and Landsat-8 data from 1990, 2000, and 2020, we employed a random forest algorithm for supervised classification, generating Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. The mono-window algorithm was used to extract LST data from Landsat 5 and 8 images, alongside Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps. s regression analysis assessed the LST-NDVI correlation. Results indicate that urban LULCCs significantly contribute to rising LST. Minimum and maximum LST values for 1990, 2000, and 2020 were 18.6°C, 22.8°C, 22.6°C, and 26.7°C, 34.5°C, and 42.1°C, respectively. NDVI values ranged from −0.2 to 0.56 in 1990, −0.17 to 0.58 in 2000, and 0.07 to 0.46 in 2020. Roads, pavements, barren land, and built-up areas displayed the highest LST (44.6°C), while water bodies and healthy vegetation exhibited the lowest (16.1°C). Additionally, NDVI exhibited a negative correlation with LST. Our findings emphasise the role of human activities in exacerbating LST. They highlight the need for regulated urban growth patterns to ensure sustainable development. Moreover, quantifying spatiotemporal variations in LULC, LST, and NDVI holds importance for conserving land resources and enhancing land use planning policies.

Sustainable Aquifer Management For Food Security,"Funk, Bryana and Amer, Saud A. and Ward, Frank A.",2023,"In aquifer-dependent regions, balancing aquifer protection, desalination, economic development, agricultural irrigation, and food security can be better managed through discovery and development of sources of sustainable groundwater pumping. Aquifer desalination for irrigation to protect food security can mitigate pressure on local freshwater aquifers. Despite its importance, little peer reviewed work to date has identified the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer drawdown. The novel contribution of this work is the development and application of an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation for a recently discovered large saline aquifer. It develops an original framework to assess the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination, the results of which can help guide policymakers on efficient and sustainable pumping approaches across users, aquifers, and time periods. A mathematical programming model is developed to economically analyze the 200 billion cubic meter Lotikipi Aquifer, discovered in 2013 in northern Kenya using modern remote sensing methods. While initial pumping of the Lotikipi Aquifer was halted due to high groundwater salinity levels, interest remains strong in assessing the economic capacity to pay for groundwater desalination because of its potential role in protecting regional food security generated by aquifer pumping for irrigation. The model is formulated by calibrating optimized pumping patterns in two existing freshwater aquifers to replicate observed historical pumping levels. Based on that exercise, a second model is developed to identify a least cost set of pumping restrictions that return each of three regional aquifers to starting conditions over a seven-year time period. A third model extends the second by adding a constraint of a minimum required level of food grain security supported by irrigation pumping from the aquifer system. Results show that the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture lies in the range of \$0.08 - \$0.18 USD per cubic meter under current economic conditions and desalination technologies available. While this economic capacity to pay is lower than its current cost in most places, the future could be more optimistic. Advances in desalination technology, higher crop prices, technical advance in agriculture, and development of drought-resistant crops can all contribute to a future capacity to economically justify the expense of desalination.",funk_sustainableaquifermanagementfood_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Monitoring Soil Elements For Irrigation Management Using Internet Of Things (Iot) Sensors,"Bouhachlaf, L. and Benslimane, O. and El Hajjaji, S.",2023,"Smart farming focuses on three crucial areas: soil quality, weather conditions, and crop health. Because of the significant impact of weather and irrigation factors, many smart farming solutions are tightly integrated with smart environment and smart water (pollution, turbidity, nutrients) systems for a holistic approach. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing soil monitoring, giving farmers and growers the means to optimize yields, minimize disease risks, and rationalize resource use. Thanks to IoT sensors, it is possible to measure various parameters such as soil temperature, NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) levels, and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors is then transmitted to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth analysis, visual representation, and trend identification. The application of the IoT in agriculture is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential pillar of precision agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management of resources. Smart sensor systems provide more information about water and crop water requirements. This information can be used to mechanically manage the water supply system and help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information acquired by the first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article proposes and evaluates the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were selected to test the IoT system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically designed for soil and irrigation water analysis.

Accounting And The Enactment Of Power: Municipal Reform By Peter Leopold 1774-1775,"Maran, Laura and Funnell, Warwick and Castellini, Monia",2019,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the enduring, fundamental contributions of accounting practices in the pursuit of decentralization by governments, with an examination of Peter Leopold's reform of the municipalities in the late eighteenth century in Italy. Design/methodology/approach An extensive textual analysis of the very comprehensive collection of primary sources of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany during the de' Medici and Hapsburg-Lorraine's rule identified the reasons for Peter Leopold's decision to decentralize his government's authority and responsibilities. A systemic comparison of the 1765-1766 and 1775-1776 financial reports of the Municipality of Castrocaro and Terra del Sole disclosed the importance of the micro-practices of accounting and reporting for the reform. Findings In the context of the eighteenth century enlightenment, Peter Leopold legitimized his reform by the introduction of a modern style of government based on the rationalization of the municipal administrative system and decentralization of central authority and responsibility. The reform was made feasible by the substitution of a birth right principle with an economic discourse which linked tax payments to property ownership. This had the unintended consequence of increased taxes, higher municipal expenditures and possible inequalities between municipalities. Originality/value Few accounting studies have considered the micro-aspects of decentralization reforms at the municipal level and tried to identify their impact on the wealth of the population. Moreover, Peter Leopold's reform is considered one of the most innovative and enlightened of the eighteenth century, while the remainder of Europe was still overwhelmingly committed to the centralization of administrative apparatuses. Finally, this study relates to the multi-disciplinary debate about the recognition, qualification and accountization of the impact of decentralization of responsibility for the delivery of government services.",maran_accountingenactmentpowermunicipal_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Surface Behavior Of Pelagic Juvenile Loggerhead Sea Turtles In The Eastern North Atlantic,"Freitas, Carla and Caldeira, Rui and Dellinger, Thomas",2019,"Sea turtles bask at the ocean surface, but little is known about the patterns and ecological context of surface behavior in the wild. This study investigated the surface behavior of ten juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (34 - 58 cm straight carapace length) satellite tagged in Madeira, in the pelagic eastern North Atlantic. During a total of 2273 tracking days, turtles moved through oceanic areas with a mean depth of similar to 3400 m. On average, turtles spent one third of the time at the surface (0 - 1 m depth), spending 43\% of the time at the surface during the day and 29\% of the time during the night. Generalized linear mixed modelling showed that the proportion of time at the surface was significantly larger during the day, particularly during spring and summer. Time spent at the surface during the day increased with elevated air temperatures and weak winds, probably to maximize the benefits of solar absorption. Conversely, the probability of being at the surface during the day decreased as horizontal search effort increased, suggesting a trade-off between basking and daytime foraging activities. At night, time spent at the surface was not associated with air temperature or wind speed but was instead positively associated with moon illumination.

Quantifying Variance Across Spatial Scales As Part Of Fire Regime Classifications,"Scholtz, Rheinhardt and Fuhlendorf, Samuel D. and Leis, Sherry A. and Picotte, Joshua J. and Twidwell, Dirac",2018,"The emergence of large-scale fire classifications and products informed by remote sensing data has enabled opportunities to include variability or heterogeneity as part of modem fire regime classifications. Currently, basic fire metrics such as mean fire return intervals are calculated without considering spatial variance in a management context. Fire return intervals are also only applicable at a particular grain size (defined as the spatial unit of interest) even though they are typically applied homogeneously. In this study, we utilized a 29-yr fire occurrence database to show how spatial variance changes with respect to grain as postulated by Wiens (1989) when reporting fire patterns within the Great Plains, USA. We utilized data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database of fire occurrence for the years 1984-2012. We analyzed median numbers of fire along with their variance at four spatial grains ranging from small units (e.g., plots at 3 x 3 km resolution) to large units (e.g., landscapes at 1500 x 2700 km resolution). Median number of fire occurrences was consistently low, irrespective of grain. Despite the consistency in low median numbers of fires across grain, variance in the numbers of fires between units decreased. Variance within units, however, did not change as grain increased indicating fire-pattern-scale inconsistencies. Fire pattern interpretations depended entirely on the scale at which it is calculated. Given that the Great Plains region has a large disparity in fire patterns (i.e., some regions burn often, while others may never burn), fire regime classifications will benefit from including scale-specific variance estimates as a foundation for understanding changes in fire regimes and corresponding social-ecological and policy responses.",scholtz_quantifyingvariancespatialscales_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Balancing Model Generality And Specificity In Management-Focused Habitat Selection Models For Gunnison Sage-Grouse,"Saher, D. Joanne and O'Donnell, Michael S. and Aldridge, Cameron L. and Heinrichs, Julie A.",2022,"Identifying, protecting, and restoring habitats for declining wildlife populations is foundational to conservation and recovery planning for any species at risk of decline. Resource selection analysis is a key tool to assess habitat and prescribe management actions. Yet, it can be challenging to map suitable resource conditions across a wide range of ecological contexts and use the resulting models to identify effective and universal habitat improvement actions. We developed a management-centric modeling approach that sought to balance the need to evaluate the consistency of key habitat conditions and improvement actions across multiple, distinct populations, while allowing context-specific environmental variables and spatial scales to nuance selection responses that form the basis of location-specific management prescriptions. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a set of habitat selection models for Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus), a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation, species recovery, and habitat management efforts are needed in six isolated satellite populations (San Miguel, Crawford, Pinon Mesa, Dove Creek, Cerro Summit-Cimarron-Sims, and Poncha Pass) where environmental conditions differ, and the already small number of birds are declining. We used multi-scale and seasonal resource selection analyses to quantify relationships between environmental conditions and sites used by animals. All models included key habitat variables often altered through management actions to assess their differential influences across models. We found important similarities and differences among satellites, indicating that, although some rules of thumb are generally well-grounded, the consideration of population-specific environmental differences could increase the efficiency of local habitat improvement actions. Sagegrouse also had diverse responses to resource conditions at different scales, indicating that regional spatial (e.g., landscape) and local patch scale can differentially influence expected habitat improvements associated with where such management actions are implemented. Although context variables such as topography cannot be manipulated, sage-grouse associations revealed information that could guide the siting of improvement actions. This approach to balancing management objectives associated with habitat assessment may benefit spatially-structured populations with different environmental contexts and species with complex habitat needs and associations.",saher_balancingmodelgeneralityspecificity_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
From Ers 1/2 To Sentinel-1: Subsidence Monitoring In Italy In The Last Two Decades,"Solari, Lorenzo and Del Soldato, Matteo and Bianchini, Silvia and Ciampalini, Andrea and Ezquerro, Pablo and Montalti, Roberto and Raspini, Federico and Moretti, Sandro",2018,"The use of InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) products has greatly increased in the last years because of the technological advances in terms of both acquisition sensors and processing algorithms. The development of multi-interferogram techniques and the availability of free SAR analysis tools has significantly increased the number of worldwide applications of satellite measurements for mapping and monitoring geohazards. InSAR techniques excel in determining ground deformation in urban areas, where the coherence of the radar images is high, and the obtainable results are particularly reliable. Thus, measuring urban subsidence has always been one of the main targets of the InSAR analysis. In this paper, we present a brief review on the applications, in the last decades, of both single and multi-interferogram techniques to monitor ground lowering in urban areas along the Italian Peninsula. Because of its geological context, Italy is prone to slow natural subsidence phenomena sometimes aggravated and accelerated, especially along the coasts and in urbanized areas, by anthropogenic factors (i.e., groundwater overexploitation, consolidation in recent urban expansion, geothermal activities). The review will show how the interferometric data allowed the scientific community to increase the knowledge of the phenomena, map their spatial distribution, and reconstruct their temporal evolution. The final goal of the review is to demonstrate the added value of InSAR data in supporting groundwater management and urban development in Italy.",solari_ers12sentinel_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Mapping And Detection Of Land Use Change In A Coal Mining Area Using Object-Based Image Analysis,"Pei, Wenming and Yao, Suping and Knight, Joseph F. and Dong, Shaochun and Pelletier, Keith and Rampi, Lian P. and Wang, Yan and Klassen, Jim",2017,"Object-based image analysis was used to map land use in the Panxie coal mining area, East China, where long-term underground coal mines have been exploited since the 1980s. A rule-based classification approach was developed for a Pleiades image to identify the desired land use classes, and the same rule-based classification strategies, after the threshold values had been modified slightly, were applied to the Landsat series images. Five land use classes were successfully captured with overall accuracies of between 80 and 94\%. The classification approach was validated for its flexibility and robustness. Multitemporal classification results indicated that land use changed considerably in the Panxie coal mining area from 1989 to 2013. The urban, coal and coal gangue, and water areas increased rapidly in line with the growth in mine production. Urban areas increased from 9.38 to 20.92\% and showed a tendency to increase around the coal mines. From 1989 to 2013 the coal and coal gangue area increased by 40-fold, from 0.02 to 0.58\%. Similarly, the water area increased from 2.77 to 7.84\% over this time period, mainly attributable to the spread of waterlogged areas. The waterlogged areas increased to about 2900 ha in 2013, which was about 80 times more than their area in 1989. In contrast, the area of cultivated land was negatively related to the increase in mine production and decreased from 73.11 to 57.25\%.

Classification Of County Leading Function Types And Pattern Recognition Of Its Spatial Structure Based On Multi-Source Data,"Chen, Z. and Wang, F. and Li, S. and Feng, Y. and Chen, J.",2021,"It is of great significance to study the types of dominant function at county level and analyze the spatial structure pattern for the guidance and planning regulation of regional comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, this paper uses K-means clustering analysis to classify 124 dominant functional areas of county units. Based on the Tencent location big data, the spatial structure index was constructed using the rank-size rule. The spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were identified and analyzed by combining remote sensing data. Research results show that, firstly, the use of statistics, remote sensing, social media, night lighting multi-source data, and K means clustering method in county dominant function classification can get nice results, which can objectively reflect the features of area. The dominant function of counties in Guangdong can be divided into five classes, including ecological leading, agricultural leading, industry leadership, center service, and balanced developmental. Secondly, the rank-size law method based on Tencent location big data can break through the city scale. It can be used together with the quantitative analysis of remote sensing data in the study of spatial structure pattern recognition at the meso-county scale. Thirdly, the average value of spatial structure index of agriculture-oriented and ecology-oriented counties is greater than 1, showing a trend of single center spatial structure. The mean value of spatial structure index of industrial dominated county is less than 1, showing a polycentric spatial structure trend. The mean value of spatial structure index of balanced development county is close to 1. There are differences in spatial structure characteristics of balanced development county in different regions. Fourthly, the spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were significantly different. The ecology-dominated counties showed a single central pole core pattern, while the agriculture-dominated counties showed a single central pole core and scattered point pattern. The balanced development counties had obvious coexistence characteristics of multiple patterns, while the industrial-dominated counties showed a multi-center network distribution pattern. © 2021, Science Press.

Characterization Of Near-Infrared Imaging And Indocyanine-Green Use Amongst General Surgeons: A Survey Of 263 General Surgeons,"Verhoeff, K. and Mocanu, V. and Fang, B. and Dang, J. and Sun, W. and Switzer, N. J. and Birch, D. W. and Karmali, S.",2022,"Background: Near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) is an increasingly utilized imaging modality, however its use amongst general surgeons and its barriers to adoption have not yet been characterized. Methods: This survey was sent to Canadian Association of General Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons members. Survey development occurred through consensus of NIRFI experienced surgeons. Results: Survey completion rate for those opening the email was 16.0% (n = 263). Most respondents had used NIRFI (n = 161, 61.2%). Training, higher volumes, and bariatric, thoracic, or foregut subspecialty were associated with use (P <.001). Common reasons for NIRFI included anastomotic assessment (n = 117, 72.7%), cholangiography (n = 106, 65.8%), macroscopic angiography (n = 66, 41.0%), and bowel viability assessment (n = 101, 62.7%). Technical knowledge, training and poor evidence were cited as common barriers to NIRFI adoption. Conclusions: NIRFI use is common with high case volume, bariatric, foregut, and thoracic surgery practices associated with adoption.

Quantifying Abundance And Mapping Distribution Of Loggerhead Turtles In The Mediterranean Sea Using Aerial Surveys: Implications For Conservation,"Pierantonio, Nino and Panigada, Simone and Lauriano, Giancarlo",2023,"In the Mediterranean, incidental captures in fishing gear contribute to the high mortality of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Understanding the effects of bycatch is complex and requires robust knowledge of baseline population parameters such as abundance and density, as well as an understanding of animals' distribution in relation to commercial fishing efforts. Based on data collected during multi-species line transect aerial surveys conducted between 2009 and 2017, we present density and abundance estimates, corrected for availability bias, for a large sector of the central Mediterranean, discuss temporal and spatial patterns and provide Potential Biological Removal (PBR) values for the monitored areas. Sightings data were also used to evaluate the spatial and temporal usage areas. Strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in density, abundance and area usage emerged from the analysis, with turtles occurring in higher numbers in the deeper pelagic waters of the Tunisian Plateau, the Ionian Sea and the Gulf of Taranto, irrespective of the season. PBR values derived from this study are likely unsustainable. This paper investigates the implications of commercial fisheries for Mediterranean loggerhead turtles across an area rarely included in sea turtle monitoring and has the potential to be relevant towards informed management and conservation of this species and highlights the necessity of international collaborative efforts in the region.",pierantonio_quantifyingabundancemappingdistribution_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Quantifying The Impacts Of Land Use Change On Flooding In Data-Poor Watersheds In El Salvador With Community-Based Model Calibration,"Tellman, Beth and Saiers, James Edward and Cruz, Oscar Antonio Ruiz",2016,"Urbanization can decrease the flood mitigation capacity of a catchment, and these impacts can be measured with hydrologic modeling. Models are typically calibrated against observed discharge and satellite data, but in a developing country context like El Salvador, these data are often unavailable. Even if a model is well calibrated and tested, its ability to influence land use plans requires additional stakeholder engagement. This study uses a participatory modeling approach to calibrate a watershed model and estimate flood impacts of land use scenarios in two urbanizing catchments in El Salvador with a linked land use-catchment hydrology-hydraulic model calibrated on flood height observed by community members. This paper explores both the value of household flood observation in model calibration and differences of flood extent estimates for land use scenarios with an uncalibrated versus community-calibrated model. We find that calibration using household surveys improves model performance. Results of scenario modeling suggest that while past urbanization has significantly increased household flood exposure in one catchment, future land use scenarios that further urbanize or reforest large areas of either catchment have little effect on the number of houses at risk for flooding. The success of the participatory methodology to increase model accuracy and link results to local land use planning makes clear the contribution of social science to traditional hydrological methods to understand land use-flood links in data-poor catchments.",tellman_quantifyingimpactslandchange_2016,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Flood Effects On An Alaskan Stream Restoration Project: The Value Of Long-Term Monitoring,"Densmore, R. V. and Karle, K. F.",2009,"On a nationwide basis, few stream restoration projects have long-term programs in place to monitor the effects of floods on channel and floodplain configuration and floodplain vegetation, but long-term and event-based monitoring is required to measure the effects of these stochastic events and to use the knowledge for adaptive management and the design of future projects. This paper describes a long-term monitoring effort (15 years) on a stream restoration project in Glen Creek in Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. The stream channel and floodplain of Glen Creek had been severely degraded over a period of 80 years by placer mining for gold, which left many reaches with unstable and incised streambeds without functioning vegetated floodplains. The objectives of the original project, initiated in 1991, were to develop and test methods for the hydraulic design of channel and floodplain morphology and for floodplain stabilization and riparian habitat recovery, and to conduct research and monitoring to provide information for future projects in similar degraded watersheds. Monitoring methods included surveyed stream cross-sections, vegetation plots, and aerial, ground, and satellite photos. In this paper we address the immediate and outlying effects of a 25-year flood on the stream and floodplain geometry and riparian vegetation. The long-term monitoring revealed that significant channel widening occurred following the flood, likely caused by excessive upstream sediment loading and the fairly slow development of floodplain vegetation in this climate. Our results illustrated design flaws, particularly in regard to identification and analysis of sediment sources and the dominant processes of channel adjustment. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.",densmore_floodeffectsalaskanstream_2009,FALSE,class_round1,NA
National-Scale Assessment Of Current And Future Flood Risk In England And Wales,"Hall, JW and Sayers, PB and Dawson, RJ",2005,"In recent years, through the availability of remotely sensed data and other national datasets, it has become possible to conduct national-scale flood risk assessment in England and Wales. The results of this type of risk analysis can be used to inform policy-making and prioritisation of resources for flood management. It can form the starting point for more detailed strategic and local-scale flood risk assessments. The national-scale risk assessment methodology outlined in this paper makes use of information on the location, standard of protection and condition of flood defences in England and Wales, together with datasets of floodplain extent, topography, occupancy and asset values. The flood risk assessment was applied to all of England and Wales in 2002 at which point the expected annual damage from flooding was estimated to be approximately (sic)1 billion. This figure is comparable with records of recent flood damage. The methodology has subsequently been applied to examine the effects of climate and socio-economic change 50 and 80 years in the future. The analysis predicts increasing flood risk unless current flood management policies, practices and investment levels are changed - up to 20-fold increase in real terms economic risk by the 2080s in the scenario with highest economic growth.

Tissue-Level Biomarkers In Sentinel Slugs As Cost-Effective Tools To Assess Metal Pollution In Soils,"Marigómez, I. and Kortabitarte, M. and Dussart, G. B. J.",1998,"In previous laboratory experiments, slugs were shown to be sensitive to metal pollution. Therefore, they might be invaluable instruments for biological assessment of soil pollution. The present investigation was carried out to validate previous laboratory results in a field study. Slugs were collected from an abandoned copper mine (Parys mountain top, PMT), from a site 7 km away from the mine (Parys mountain bottom, PMB), and from a clean site (Snowdonia Cwm Idwal, SCI) in Wales in early July 1994. Whole soft body and digestive gland Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations were measured by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The digestive gland was the main tissue for metal accumulation, with significant differences in tissue metal levels between samples from different sites. PMB presented the highest Cd and Zn levels and the highest Cu levels were found at PMT. In addition, metals were demonstrated in situ by autometallography as black silver deposits (BSD) on histological sections of digestive gland tissue. The extent of BSD within lysosomes of digestive cells was closely related to metal levels determined by AAS. Histochemistry revealed that Ca metabolism and structural and reserve connective tissues might be altered in slugs living in metal-polluted soils. Finally, tissue-level biomarkers of biological effect [mean epithelial thickness (MET), mean diverticular radius (MDR), mean luminal radius (MLR), MET/MDR and MLR/MET] were quantified by image analysis of digestive gland histological sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. MET and MDR values of slugs collected from SCI were high, while slugs from PMB presented low MLR/MET associated with environmental stress induced by metal exposure. We conclude that exposure and effect biomarkers recorded in sentinel slugs could be sensitive, quick, and cheap indices of metal pollution in soils.

Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660 ha) in the agreste of Paraíba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation.

"Gis-Based Sustainable City Compactness Assessment Using Integration Of Mcdm, Bayes Theorem And Radar Technology","Abdullahi, Saleh and Pradhan, Biswajeet and Jebur, Mustafa Neamah",2015,"In recent decades, compact urban development and smart cities are recognised as most sustainable urban form in an effort to protect natural environment. Therefore, evaluation of existing compactness and sustainability of an area is an essential task before the real development takes place. In the literature, it is possible to see some studies on city's compactness assessment and most of them have considered only a few aspects of compact development analysis. This paper aims to analyse urban sustainability of Kajang city (Malaysia) through a comprehensive city compactness assessment using geographical information system and radar remote sensing technology. To measure building density, a RADAR image of the study area was used to extract built-up areas with the aid of pixel-based and object-based classification schemes. Mixed land use development, urban density and intensity were the main indicators of the analysis. Finally, multicriteria decision-making and Bayes theorems were applied for overall compactness assessment. Building density analysis was validated using standard confusion matrix, which showed more than 90\% accuracy. Similarly, the root-mean squared error showed 0.35 for object-based classification.

Applications And Challenges Of Artificial Intelligence In Space Missions,"Oche, P. A. and Ewa, G. A. and Ibekwe, N.",2021,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding acceptance in the space community, especially Machine Learning (ML), a subdomain of AI. ML algorithms now find numerous applications in autonomous navigation, spacecraft health monitoring and operational management of satellite constellations. However, a large number of surveys on the applications of AI in space missions can be classified into two categories. The first category suffers from the limitation of being old and not covering some crucial and recent developments in the field; such as the contributions of Deep Learning (DL) and bioinspired AI algorithms. The challenge with the second category lies in its being too detailed with respect to the development and application of specific AI techniques or algorithms. These limitations have necessitated the need to have a concise survey with a wider scope for those interested in the applications and challenges of AI in the space industry, especially those with technical backgrounds in other fields. In this paper, we surveyed the use of traditional AI techniques in various domains of space missions without delving into formal methods. Some bioinspired AI algorithms were also surveyed and their potential application areas highlighted. Unlike similar surveys that focus only on technological challenges, we also addressed some crucial legal drawbacks that emanate from the reliance and use of AI in space. Summarily, while discussing future directions we reviewed some advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technologies. Our review prioritized three application domains positioned to benefit immensely from the inevitable AI-Blockchain convergence in the space community. These include the Internet of Space Things (IoST), Satellite Communication and Spacecraft Data Security. Author",oche_applicationschallengesartificialintelligence_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"A Network To Understand The Changing Socio-Ecology Of The Southern African Woodlands (Seosaw): Challenges, Benefits, And Methods","Ryan, Casey M. and SEOSAW Partnership",2021,"Societal Impact Statement The sustainable management of the southern African woodlands is closely linked to the livelihoods of over 150 M people. Findings from the Socio-Ecological Observatory for the Southern African Woodlands (SEOSAW) will underpin the sustainability of two of the largest industries on the continent: woodfuels and timber. SEOSAW will also improve our understanding of how human use shapes the biogeography and functioning of these ecosystems. Summary Here we describe a new network of researchers and long-term, in situ, measurements that will characterize the changing socio-ecology of the woodlands of southern Africa. These woodlands encompass the largest savanna in the world, but are chronically understudied, with few long-term measurements. A network of permanent sample plots (PSPs) is required to: (a) address management issues, particularly related to sustainable harvesting for energy and timber; (b) understand how the woodlands are responding to a range of global and local drivers, such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, and harvesting; and (c) answer basic questions about biogeography, ecosystem function, and the role humans play in shaping the ecology of the region. We draw on other successful networks of PSPs and adapt their methods to the specific challenges of working in southern African woodlands. In particular we suggest divergences from established forest monitoring protocols that are needed to (a) adapt to a high level of ecosystem structural diversity (from open savanna to dry forest); (b) quantify the chronic disturbances by people, fire, and herbivores; (c) quantify the diversity and function of the understory of grasses, forbs, and shrubs; (d) understand the life histories of resprouting trees; and (e) conduct work in highly utilized, human-dominated landscapes. We conclude by discussing how the SEOSAW network will integrate with remote sensing and modeling approaches. Throughout, we highlight the challenges inherent to integrating work by forest and savanna ecologists, and the wide range of skills needed to fully understand the socio-ecology of the southern African woodlands.",ryan_networkunderstandchangingsocio_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Tree-Related Microhabitats Are Promising Yet Underused Tools For Biodiversity And Nature Conservation: A Systematic Review For International Perspectives,"Martin, Maxence and Paillet, Yoan and Larrieu, Laurent and Kern, Christel C. and Raymond, Patricia and Drapeau, Pierre and Fenton, Nicole J.",2022,"Sustainable management of forest ecosystems requires the use of reliable and easy to implement biodiversity and naturalness indicators. Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) can fulfill these roles as they harbor specialized species that directly or indirectly depend on them, and are generally more abundant and diverse in natural forests or forests unmanaged for several decades. The TreM concept is however still recent, implying the existence of many knowledge gaps that can challenge its robustness and applicability. To evaluate the current state of knowledge on TreMs, we conducted a systematic review followed by a bibliometric analysis of the literature identified. A total of 101 articles constituted the final corpus. Most of the articles (60.3\%) were published in 2017 or after. TreM research presented a marked lack of geographical representativity, as the vast majority (68.3\%) of the articles studied French, German or Italian forests. The main themes addressed by the literature were the value of TreMs as biodiversity indicators, the impact of forest management on TreMs and the factors at the tree- and stand-scales favoring TreMs occurrence. Old-growth and unmanaged forests played a key role as a ""natural "" forest reference for these previous themes, as TreMs were often much more abundant and diverse compared to managed forests. Arthropods were the main phylum studied for the theme of TreMs as biodiversity indicators. Other more diverse themes were identified, such as restoration, remote sensing, climate change and economy and there was a lack of research related to the social sciences. Overall, current research on TreMs has focused on assessing its robustness as an indicator of biodiversity and naturalness at the stand scale. The important geographical gap identified underscores the importance of expanding the use of the TreMs in other forest ecosystems of the world. The notable efforts made in recent years to standardize TreM studies are an important step in this direction. The novelty of the TreM concept can partially explain the thematic knowledge gaps. Our results nevertheless stress the high potential of TreMs for multidisciplinary research, and we discuss the benefits of expanding the use of TreMs on a larger spatial scale.",martin_treerelatedmicrohabitatspromising_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Data Assimilation For Leaf Area Index Of Tobacco On The Basis Of The Ensemble Kalman Filter In Nanxiong,"Chen, H. and Fan, F. L.",2017,"Leaf area index (LAI) can be used as a monitoring index for assessing tobacco health in different growing periods. Hence, acquiring and updating accurate LAI data in a timely manner are necessary for managing the growth of tobacco. Growth information for tobacco in different seasons could provide valuable information for management on a national scale. Accurate and continuous tobacco LAI dynamics data are based on the data fusion framework of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which is an efficient recursive filter to estimate the state of a dynamic system from a series of incomplete and noise measurements, can be used to obtain optimal results. Nanxiong City in Guangdong Province was selected as the study area to extract LAI data for tobacco and test the effect of EnKF method on the basis of quantitative remote sensing data for the growing state of tobacco in 2014. Tobacco canopy hyperspectral reflectance data in different growing seasons were collected every 15 days by using AvaSpec-ULS2048 HandHeld spectroradiometer made by Avantes company in the Netherlands. Tobacco LAI data were retrieved using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which was calculated using the reflectance data. An improved tobacco growth model (LOGISTIC) was established using the LAI data collected around Nanxiong. This improved model used LAI and accumulated temperature to reveal the changes in LAI in different growing seasons. On the basis of integration of LAI data (obtained using remote sensing data) and LAI data (obtained using the simplified LOGISTIC model and EnKF method), continuous LAI data were obtained in the time series during the tobacco growing season in Nanxiong. Finally, we compared three different LAI computing methods in tobacco study: (a) calculated by NDVI, (b) simulated by the LOGISTIC model and (c) data assimilation was based on EnKF. The results indicated that these three methods could describe the growth status of tobacco to a certain extent, especially in the mature growth period, however, the LAI assimilation method was the best, which was able to adjust measured values and model values dynamically, LAI data were more consistent with the practical growth conditions of tobacco. Method (a) was imperfect at early and late growth seasons of tobacco (in these two seasons, the LAI data were either less or more), and method (b) was more dependent on accumulated temperature data (LOGISTIC model could not effectively describe the unexpected changes in tobacco LAI). The results showed that the EnKF algorithm could obtain better estimation on the basis of the dynamic model, and assimilate remote sensing data into the dynamic model to obtain optimal estimation for LAI. The assimilated LAI data were closer to the real values, and the LAI curve was more consistent with actual tobacco growth status. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Technological Advances In Drifters For Oil Transport Studies,"Novelli, Guillaume and Guigand, Cedric M. and Ozgokmen, Tamay M.",2018,"Advances in drifter technology applied to oil spill studies from 1970 to the present are summarized here. Initially, drifters designed for oil spill response were intended to remotely track trajectories of accidental spills and help guide responders. Most recently, inexpensive biodegradable drifters were developed for massive deployments, making it possible to significantly improve numerical transport models and to investigate, via observations, the processes leading to dispersion and accumulation of surface pollutants across multiple scales. Over the past 50 years, drifters have benefited from constant improvements in electronics for accurate and frequent location and data transmission, as well as progress in material sciences to reduce fabrication costs and minimize the environmental impact of sacrificial instruments.

Deep Low-Rank And Sparse Patch-Image Network For Infrared Dim And Small Target Detection,"Zhou, X. and Li, P. and Zhang, Y. and Lu, X. and Hu, Y.",2023,"Detection of infrared dim and small targets with diverse and cluttered background plays a significant role in many applications. In this article, we propose a deep low-rank and sparse patch-image network, termed as Deep-LSP-Net, to effectively detect small targets in a single infrared image. Specifically, by using the local patch construction scheme, we first transform the original infrared image into a patch image, which can be decomposed as a superposition of the low-rank background component and the sparse target component. The target detection is thus formulated as an optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularizations, which can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). We unroll the iterative algorithm into deep neural networks, where a generalized sparsifying transform and a singular value thresholding (SVT) operator are learned by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to avoid tedious parameter tuning and improve the interpretability of the neural networks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two public datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain improved performance in small infrared target detection compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",zhou_deeplowranksparse_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Distributional Implications Of Supply Constraints In Water Markets,"Chaudhry, Anita M. and Fairbanks, Dean H. K.",2022,"In California, after three decades of water market development, volume of water traded in the market remains lower than desired. Total volume of water traded annually accounts for just around 2\%-5\% of total water used. Vast difference in the marginal values of water in agriculture and urban or environmental uses suggest that significant economic gains can be achieved by easing the barriers to trading water across sectors. This paper draws attention to the role of state and local policies in restricting water transfers. Using novel, purpose-built, satellite-mapped data of a sample of water-trading irrigation districts in California, this paper shows how districts' water transfer decisions are made in response to conflicting pressures of drought-induced high-water demand against the need to support the agricultural economy and the environment in water-exporting areas. The time period under study is 1991-2019, which spans the entire history of water market activity in California from inception to maturity, and helps illustrate the role of changing local and state policies on irrigation districts' water market participation. Despite policy-induced restrictions, this paper shows that sample irrigation districts are highly responsive to demand in water-buying areas, have increased the volume and frequency of water transfers, particularly in the last decade. This paper highlights important research and policy questions about the distribution of economic and environmental effects of water transfers in source area communities that could affect the future potential of water markets in easing structural and drought-induced water scarcity in California.",chaudhry_distributionalimplicationssupplyconstraints_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Salivary Biomarkers For Clinical Applications,"Zhang, L. and Xiao, H. and Wong, D. T.",2009,"For clinical applications such as monitoring health status, disease onset and progression, and treatment outcome, there are three necessary prerequisites: (i) a simple method for collecting biologic samples, ideally noninvasively; (ii) specific biomarkers associated with health or disease; and (iii) a technology platform to rapidly utilize the biomarkers. Saliva, often regarded as the 'mirror of the body', is a perfect surrogate medium to be applied for clinical diagnostics. Saliva is readily accessible via a totally noninvasive method. Salivary biomarkers, whether produced by healthy individuals or by individuals affected by specific diseases, are sentinel molecules that could be used to scrutinize health and disease surveillance. The visionary investment by the US National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, the discovery of salivary biomarkers, and the ongoing development of salivary diagnostic technologies have addressed its diagnostic value for clinical applications. The availability of more sophisticated analytic techniques gives optimism that saliva can eventually be placed as a biomedium for clinical diagnostics.

These lead to overexploitation, aggravated levels of groundwater pollution, and seawater intrusion. Integrated analyses can create holistic insights into the quality and the vulnerability of aquifers to seawater intrusion. In this study, Mombasa North coast’s coastal aquifer was characterized by integrating multiple approaches—GALDIT overlay index, seawater intrusion groundwater quality index GQISWI, total hardness, water quality index (WQI)—and the results were further explored and interpreted with geospatial analysis techniques. The study suggests that the predominant water type in areas under moderate or high vulnerabilities to seawater intrusion is the Na-Cl water type. However, similar Na-Cl water types can produce a range of total hardness from soft to hard. GQISWI classification can be used to narrow down the observations from Stuyfzand’s TH-based classification system. In the aquifer studied, the results of the GALDIT overlay index, a weighted aggregation of intrinsic parameters contributing to seawater intrusion, show that 29%, 59%, and 12% of the aquifer have low, moderate, and high vulnerabilities, respectively. The GQISWI analysis indicates that the groundwater is largely brackish (68%) but saline towards the southern end of the aquifer at 32%. Total hardness values indicate that 67% of the aquifer’s coverage falls under the “moderately hard” category. The geodatabase creation introduced in the study provides a template for similar studies and a baseline for future WQI and water quality monitoring.

Monitoring Land Surface Processes With Thermal Infrared Data: Calibration Of Svat Parameters Based On The Optimisation Of Diurnal Surface Temperature Cycling Features,"Coudert, B. and Ottlé, C. and Briottet, X.",2008,"Land Surface Models (LSM) have been designed to describe water and energy transfers at the soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface, and are therefore essential in many environmental disciplines. These numerical models, driven by the boundary conditions in the atmosphere and in the soil, require adequate knowledge of those vegetation and soil characteristics which are determinant in the characterisation of mass and energy transfers. In view of the fact that, firstly this information is often only partially known, and secondly the transfers are sometimes incorrectly represented, these models can rapidly drift and need to be regularly corrected. To this aim, remote sensing is a promising tool and many studies are currently devoted to the development of assimilation techniques to control their inputs or internal variables. The research presented in this paper contributes to this effort. Its ambition is to explore new methodologies, designed to make use of remote sensing thermal infrared data recorded from space. This study is based on the analysis of links between the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of the surface brightness temperature and the soil-atmosphere interface parameters and variables. The proposed methodology takes advantage of these temperatures cycling features, instead of absolute temperature values, to calibrate the LSM. The results show that the model parameters have a significant impact on the diurnal temperature dynamics, sometimes to a greater extent than on the temperature itself, and that these relationships have diurnal and seasonal variations. As a consequence, the use of TIR data for LSM calibration can be optimised by considering only those parts of the information which are really relevant to parameter calibration. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This study analyzed the dynamics of LULC and land degradation as revealed in landscape fragmentation in the Gördes, Kavacιk, Ilιcak, Kumçay and Marmara Lake basins based on Landsat data for 1975 and 2000. A hybrid supervised/ unsupervised classification approach coupled with GIS analyses was employed to generate LULC maps. Various class-level Landscape Pattern Metrics (LPMs) were calculated using FRAGSTATS, in order to analyze landscape fragmentation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been prepared from the satellite data to understand the vigour and density of vegetation. The results indicated that the study area had a decrease in NDVI values, which meant a decrease in the vegetation cover, land degradation and the soil moisture during the study period. Consequently, the landscape became more highly fragmented. This suggests that anthropogenic activities driven by agricultural expansion were the main causes of landscape fragmentation, leading to landscape degradation in the study area.

Subways And Co2 Emissions: A Global Analysis With Satellite Data,"Dasgupta, Susmita and Lall, Somik and Wheeler, David",2023,"This paper estimates a global CO2 emissions model using satellite data at 25 km resolution. The model incorporates industrial sources (including power, steel, cement, and refineries), fires, and non-industrial population-related factors associated with household incomes and energy requirements. It also tests the impact of subways in the 192 cities where they operate. We find highly significant effects with the expected signs for all model variables, including subways. In a counterfactual exercise estimating CO2 emissions with and without subways, we find they have reduced population-related CO2 emissions by about 50 \% for the 192 cities and about 11 \% globally. Extending the analysis to future subways for other cities, we estimate the magnitude and social value of CO2 emissions reductions with conservative assumptions about population and income growth and a range of values for the social cost of carbon and investment costs. Even under pessimistic assumptions for these costs, we find that hundreds of cities realize a significant climate co-benefit, along with benefits from reduced traffic congestion and local air pollution, which have traditionally motivated subway construction. Under more moderate assumptions, we find that, on climate grounds alone, hundreds of cities realize high enough social rates of return to warrant subway construction.",dasgupta_subwaysco2emissionsglobal_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Models Of Earth's Main Magnetic Field Incorporating Flux And Radial Vorticity Constraints,"Jackson, A. and Constable, C. G. and Walker, M. R. and Parker, R. L.",2007,"We describe a new technique for implementing the constraints on magnetic fields arising from two hypotheses about the fluid core of the Earth, namely the frozen-flux hypothesis and the hypothesis that the core is in magnetostrophic force balance with negligible leakage of current into the mantle. These hypotheses lead to time-independence of the integrated flux through certain 'null-flux patches' on the core surface, and to time-independence of their radial vorticity. Although the frozen-flux hypothesis has received attention before, constraining the radial vorticity has not previously been attempted. We describe a parametrization and an algorithm for preserving topology of radial magnetic fields at the core surface while allowing morphological changes. The parametrization is a spherical triangle tesselation of the core surface. Topology with respect to a reference model (based on data from the Oersted satellite) is preserved as models at different epochs are perturbed to optimize the fit to the data; the topology preservation is achieved by the imposition of inequality constraints on the model, and the optimization at each iteration is cast as a bounded value least-squares problem. For epochs 2000, 1980, 1945, 1915 and 1882 we are able to produce models of the core field which are consistent with flux and radial vorticity conservation, thus providing no observational evidence for the failure of the underlying assumptions. These models are a step towards the production of models which are optimal for the retrieval of frozen-flux velocity fields at the core surface.",jackson_modelsearth'smainmagnetic_2007,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Similar spatial principles can also be used to inform the selection, prioritisation and monitoring of sites for restoration, but it is not clear whether these variables consistently shape the delivery of benefits from restoration. This study aimed to determine whether, and how, seascape connectivity and landscape context combine to influence the recovery of fish and crustacean communities at a restoring coastal wetland. We measured changes to biodiversity (fish species richness), fisheries benefits (fisheries harvested abundance) and functioning (fish functional diversity) bi-annually at a 200 ha restoring wetland, and three control sites, in eastern Australia between 2017 and 2021. Connectivity and landscape context were quantified using a combination of in-field measurements, remote sensing techniques and least-cost path analysis. Biodiversity, fisheries benefits, and functional diversity increased at the restoration site over time, but these metrics did not change significantly at any of the control sites over the same time period. The delivery of each of the three co-benefits at the restoration site was also positively linked to increased wetland connectivity, larger areas of mangroves and higher salinity levels in the recovering seascape. These results support tighter integration of connectivity and landscape context to optimise and inform spatial planning in restoration, and we suggest that this is essential for supporting the delivery of multiple benefits from recovering habitats and seascapes.

Effects Of Land Cover On Ecosystem Services In Tanzania: A Spatial Assessment Of Soil Organic Carbon,"Winowiecki, L. and Vågen, T. G. and Huising, J.",2014,"The multiple ecosystem services provided by healthy soil are well known and include soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, a medium for plant and agricultural production and regulating the hydrologic cycle. Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify SOC stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. SOC was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082-1000m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0-20 and 20-50cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of MIR spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an R2 of >0.95 and RMSEP of 4.3gkg-1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil OC (and range) was 12.4 (1.5-81.4) gCkg-1 (n=1082) and average subsoil OC (and range) was 7.3 (0.64-53.8) gCkg-1 (n=970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3gCkg-1) followed by cropland (13.3gCkg-1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites.

An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of SOC stocks at 30cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of SOC stocks has promising potential, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and RMSEP values from 0.90 to 1.03kgm-2 for the three validation datasets.

Review Of Remote Sensing Algorithms For Monitoring Forest Disturbance From Time Series And Multi-Source Data Fusion,"Shen, W. and Li, M. and Huang, C.",2018,"Spatio-temporally explicit forest disturbance information is regarded as a critical mechanism for net ecosystem productivity. However, quantitative and spatio-temporally explicit information on forest disturbance is currently rare for most regions of the world. Unique among earth observation programs, Landsat data are systematically collected and archived following a global acquisition strategy. The provision of free, robust data products since 2008 has spurred a renaissance of interest in Landsat and resulted in an increasingly widespread use of Landsat Time Series (LTS) for multi-temporal characterizations. The science and application capacity of Landsat have developed steadily since 1972, with the increase in sophistication offered over time incorporated into Landsat processing and analysis practices. With the successful launch of Landsat-8, the continuity of measures at scales of relevance to management and scientific activities is ensured in a short time. The spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution offered by Landsat data is well suited, increasingly established, and operational in usage for forest management and analysis. Particularly, forest change detection algorithms based on LTS stack provide robust tools for detecting near real-time forest ecosystem changes, whereby a baseline of conditions can be determined for both abrupt and gradual changes and attributed to different drivers. Interest in LTS has been further enhanced by the recent introduction of several novel automated data processing techniques suitable for multi-temporal analysis, especially after the successful launch of highly spatio-temporal resolution satellites. The benefits are enabled by data availability, analysis-ready image products, increased computing power and storage, and sophisticated image processing approaches. Thus, change detection research for forest disturbance with time series remote sensing data has entered a brand-new stage. This review systematically summarizes the research progress and application of multi-temporal forest disturbance monitoring methods based on remote sensing data sources. Considering the significance and advantage of applying time series analysis in change detection, data availability selection, and data processing, various spectral indexes and dense time automatic monitoring methods for forest disturbance are analyzed extensively, and the characteristics of multi-source data and algorithms are summarized. Finally, the improvements based on the existing limitations are explored. At the time of this review, three forest disturbance change detection algorithms are commonly used for LTS: spectral variables, classification analysis, and trajectory analysis. Spectral-based techniques range from single-band reflectance to a host of indexes calculated from different algebraic manipulations of the original spectral bands and their derivatives. Classification-based techniques are an extension of traditional change detection techniques based on two-year images. Trajectory-based methods identify trends and breakpoints corresponding to disturbance events, stability, and recovery time, and they are useful for characterizing different disturbance regimes. The strength and limitations of each method prior to conducting an LTS analysis should be understood by forestry and remote sensing communities, who should ideally select a given method depending on their information needs. In summary, unprecedented advances in the assessment of forest disturbance have been realized in recent and future years using LTS data combined with other high spatial and temporal resolution imagery, especially domestic satellites as information sources. © 2018, Science Press.

Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of No2 Concentration With Linear Mixed Models: A Bangladesh Case Study,"Islam, K. M. Ashraful and Adnan, Mohammed Sarfaraz Gani and Zannat, Khatun E. and Dewan, Ashraf",2022,"There is currently a limited understanding of how climatic and anthropogenic factors affect atmospheric NO2 concentration, and how these factors are associated with air pollution over space and time. Using high-resolution TROPOMI satellite data, this study estimates both the degree of association between climatic and anthropogenic factors, and the spatiotemporal variability of NO2 concentration over Bangladesh. Several linear mixed models were developed to isolate possible factors affecting the NO2 concentration values recorded between July 2018 and June 2019). This included monthly mean maximum temperature (MMAXT), rainfall, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), population density, and distance from industrial activities. The study revealed that the very urbanized central region of Bangladesh experienced high NO2 concentrations, particularly from September through to March. Dynamic variables such as RH, MMAXT, RAIN, and WS can positively or negatively influence NO2 depending on the time of year. Areas with a high vegetation cover, a low population density, and located some distance from industrial areas tended to have low NO2 concentrations. This study concluded that policy measures such as transboundary air quality agreements, the introduction of a month-specific green tax, decentralization, industrial relocation, and increased urban tree plantation activities could all prove valuable in reducing NO2 pollution in Bangladesh.",islam_spatiotemporaldynamicsno2concentration_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Hiv Drug Resistance Surveillance For Prioritizing Treatment In Resource-Limited Settings,"Walensky, Rochelle P. and Weinstein, Milton C. and Yazdanpanah, Yazdan and Losina, Elena and Mercincavage, Lauren M. and Toure, Siaka and Divi, Nomita and Anglaret, Xavier and Goldie, Sue J. and Freedberg, Kenneth A. and CEPAC International Investigators",2007,"Background: Sentinel testing programs for HIV drug resistance in resource-limited settings can inform policy on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and drug sequencing. Objective: To examine the value of resistance surveillance in influencing recommendations toward effective and cost-effective sequencing of ART regimens. Methods: A state-transition model of HIV infection was adapted to simulate clinical care in Cote d'Ivoire and evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of (1) no ART; (2) ART beginning with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen followed by a boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen; and (3) ART beginning with a boosted PI-based regimen followed by an NNRTI-based regimen. Results: At a 5\% prevalence of NNRTI resistance, a strategy that started with a PI-based regimen had a smaller health benefit and higher cost-effectiveness ratio than a strategy that started with an NNRTI-based regimen (cost-effectiveness ratio \$910/year of life saved). Results consistently favored initiation with an NNRTI-based regimen, regardless of the population prevalence of NNRTI resistance (up to 76\%) and the efficacy of an NNRTI-based regimen in the setting of resistance. The most influential parameters on the cost-effectiveness of sequencing strategies were boosted PI-based regimen costs and the efficacy of this regimen when used as second-line therapy. Conclusions: Drug costs and treatment efficacies, but not NNRTI resistance levels, were most influential in determining optimal HIV drug sequencing in Cote d'Ivoire. Results of surveillance for NNRTI resistance should not be used as a major guide to treatment policy in resource-limited settings.

County Government As The “Administrative Arm” Of State Government,"Waugh, W.

In England, county governments were created to provide regional representation for the Crown, with sheriffs responsible for collecting taxes, adjudicating disputes among residents and between residents and the Crown, and enforcing the laws of the Crown. County governments are developing new roles as home rule charters and legislative acts have expanded their authority and responsibility as local governments since World War II. The utility of county government as an administrative arm of stategovernment can also be seen in the organization of California's State Emergency Management System.

Can More Accurate Night-Time Remote Sensing Data Simulate A More Detailed Population Distribution?,"Gao, Nannan and Li, Fen and Zeng, Hui and van Bilsen, Daniel and De Jong, Martin",2019,"Aging, shrinking cities, urban agglomerations and other new key terms continue to emerge when describing the large-scale population changes in various cities in mainland China. It is important to simulate the distribution of residential populations at a coarse scale to manage cities as a whole, and at a fine scale for policy making in infrastructure development. This paper analyzes the relationship between the DN (Digital number, value assigned to a pixel in a digital image) value of NPP-VIIRS (the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and LuoJia1-01 and the residential populations of urban areas at a district, sub-district, community and court level, to compare the influence of resolution of remote sensing data by taking urban land use to map out auxiliary data in which first-class (R1), second-class (R2) and third-class residential areas (R3) are distinguished by house price. The results show that LuoJia1-01 more accurately analyzes population distributions at a court level for second- and third-class residential areas, which account for over 85\% of the total population. The accuracy of the LuoJia1-01 simulation data is higher than that of Landscan and GHS (European Commission Global Human Settlement) population. This can be used as an important tool for refining the simulation of residential population distributions. In the future, higher-resolution night-time light data could be used for research on accurate simulation analysis that scales down large-scale populations.",gao_accuratenighttimeremote_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Effects Of Land Use Transitions Due To Rapid Urbanization On Ecosystem Services: Implications For Urban Planning In The New Developing Area Of China,"Long, Hualou and Liu, Yongqiang and Hou, Xuegang and Li, Tingting and Li, Yurui",2014,"With the rapid development of Chinese economy, many negative effects of land use transitions under the pressure of rapid urbanization on local ecological system and environment have occurred. This paper examines the dynamic patterns of land use in Tianjin Binhai New Area experienced rapid urbanization, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2010, and socioeconomic data from both research institutes and government departments, and assesses the changes of ecosystem services value (ESV) by drawing a connection between the observed land use dynamics and the evaluation of ESV, based on the latest research of Costanza et al. (2014) and some revisions adapted to the situation of China. The outcomes indicated that, during the period 1985-2010, ESV of the study area decreased by 25.9\%, from 12,194 to 9037 billion RMBY, due to the losses of large quantities of ecological land (e.g., farmland and water body) to construction land. Then, some of the major implications for improving the urban planning of Tianjin Binhai New Area were discussed. The authors argue that it is fundamental to meet the demand of construction land for socio-economic development, meanwhile protect regional ecosystem services function and maintain its stability; only in this way can the new developing area of China realize the sustainable use of ecological resources in the process of rapid urbanization, as well as the integration of economic, social and ecological benefits.

Structural health assessment is the first pivotal step towards creating a strategy for long-term life-cycle management. Historical structures provide an abundance of unique challenges that when combined serve as a great qualifying test for the study of as-built structures. This paper explores the diagnostic value of terrestrial laser scanning for the structural health assessment of the Baptistery di San Giovanni in Florence, Italy and proposes an integrative methodology for repeatable data acquisition, processing, visualization and analysis. The presented study proves that even under challenging circumstances, efficient documentation of entire structures is possible. The case study at the Baptistery demonstrates that even when objectives are not formed prior to the survey, comprehensive data sets of high quality and reliability will enable meaningful structural health assessments.

Deep Learning And Boosting Framework For Piping Erosion Susceptibility Modeling: Spatial Evaluation Of Agricultural Areas In The Semi-Arid Region,"Chen, Yunzhi and Chen, Wei and Janizadeh, Saeid and Bhunia, Gouri Sankar and Bera, Amit and Quoc Bao Pham and Nguyen Thi Thuy Linh and Balogun, Abdul-Lateef and Wang, Xiaojing",2022,"Piping erosion is one of the water erosions that cause significant changes in the landscape, leading to environmental degradation. To prevent losses resulting from tube growth and enable sustainable development, developing high-precision predictive algorithms for piping erosion is essential. Boosting is a classic algorithm that has been successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. Therefore, this work investigated the predictive performance of the Boosted Linear Model (BLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (Boost GLM), and Deep Boosting models for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in Zarandieh Watershed located in the Markazi province of Iran. A piping inventory map including 152 piping erosion locations was prepared for algorithm training and testing. 18 initial predisposing factors (altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, rainfall, land use, soil type, bulk density, CEC, pH, clay, silt, sand, topographical position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) was derived from multiple remote sensing (RS) sources to determine the piping erosion prone areas. The most significant predisposing factors were selected using multi-collinearity analysis which indicates linear correlations between predisposing factors. Finally, the results were evaluated for Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive values (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV), and Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve. The best Sensitivity (0.80), Specificity (0.84), PPV (0.85), NPV (0.79), and ROC (0.93), were obtained by Deep Boosting model. The results of the piping erosion susceptibility study in agricultural land use showed that 41\% of agricultural lands are very sensitive to piping erosion. This outcome will enable natural resource managers and local planners to assess and take effective decisions to minimize damages to agricultural land use by accurately identifying the most vulnerable areas. Hence, this research proved Deep Boosting model's ability for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in comparison to other popular methods such as BLM, BRT, and Boost GLM.",chen_deeplearningboostingframework_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Utilization Of Global Precipitation Datasets In Data Limited Regions: A Case Study Of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania","Koutsouris, Alexander J. and Seibert, Jan and Lyon, Steve W.",2017,"This study explored the potential for bias correction of global precipitation datasets (GPD) to support streamflow simulation for water resource management in data limited regions. Two catchments, 580 km(2) and 2530 km(2), in the Kilombero Valley of central Tanzania were considered as case studies to explore three GPD bias correction methods: quantile mapping (QM), daily percentages (DP) and a model based (ModB) bias correction. The GPDs considered included two satellite rainfall products, three reanalysis products and three interpolated observed data products. The rainfall-runoff model HBV was used to simulate streamflow in the two catchments using (1) observed rain gauge data; (2) the original GPDs and (3) the bias-corrected GPDs as input. Results showed that applying QM to bias correction based on limited observed data tends to aggravate streamflow simulations relative to not bias correcting GPDs. This is likely due to a potential lack of representativeness of a single rain gauge observation at the scale of a hydrological catchment for these catchments. The results also indicate that there may be potential benefits in combining streamflow and rain gauge data to bias correct GPDs during the model calibration process within a hydrological modeling framework.",koutsouris_utilizationglobalprecipitationdatasets_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Characterizing Spatial Patterns Of Invasive Species Using Sub-Pixel Classifications,"Frazier, A. E. and Wang, L.",2011,"Invasive species disrupt landscape patterns and compromise the functionality of ecosystem processes. Non-native saltcedar poses significant threats to native vegetation and groundwater resources in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, and quantifying spatial and temporal distribution patterns is essential for monitoring its spread. Considerable research focuses on determining the accuracy of various remote sensing techniques for distinguishing saltcedar from native woody riparian vegetation through sub-pixel, or soft classifications. However, there is a lack of research quantifying spatial distribution patterns from these classifications, mainly because landscape metrics, which are commonly used to statistically assess these patterns, require bounded classes and cannot be applied directly to soft classifications. This study tests a new method for discretizing sub-pixel data to generate landscape metrics using a continuum of fractional cover thresholds. The developed approach transforms sub-pixel classifications into discrete maps compliant with metric terms and computes and interprets metric results in the context of the region to explain patterns in the extent, distribution, and connectivity of saltcedar in the Rio Grande basin. Results indicate that landscape metrics are sensitive to sub-pixel values and can vary greatly with fractional cover. Therefore spectral unmixing should be performed prior to metric calculations. Analysis of metric trends provides evidence that saltcedar has expanded away from the immediate riparian zones and is displacing native vegetation. This information, coupled with control management strategies, can be used to target remediation activities along the Rio Grande. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",frazier_characterizingspatialpatternsinvasive_2011,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Effects Of Building Density On Land Surface Temperature In China: Spatial Patterns And Determinants,"Song, Jinchao and Chen, Wei and Zhang, Jianjun and Huang, Ke and Hou, Boyan and Prishchepov, V, Alexander",2020,"The effects of building density on land surface temperature (LST) and its spatial patterns remain poorly understood over large areas. Using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, we quantified the effects of building density on land surface temperature (K) across 21 cities in China and analysed their spatial patterns, possible factors, and mechanisms. Results showed that the effects of building density on LST were more significant in areas with dry climates compared to humid climates. The spatial variability in the effects of building density on LST was closely related to climate conditions, soil type, and vegetation. The results from stepwise regression analysis showed that precipitation (climate) controlled the spatial variability, indicating that there is a complex mechanism underlying these potential factors. Furthermore, the results from climatic zoning statistics revealed that the K-values of northern Chinese cities were positively correlated with the areas of local water bodies. However, the K-values of southern Chinese cities were significantly and positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and aridity and were negatively correlated with population density. Stepwise regression results further indicated that the mean annual temperature may be the most influential factor for southern cities. These results highlight the spatial variance and different determinants of K and suggest that climate-adapted urban design and planning standards are needed in different climate zones.",song_effectsbuildingdensityland_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Potential Drivers Of Common Brusntail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Decline On A Murray River Floodplain,"Neilly, H. and McKenzie, T. and Ward, M. and Chaber, A. and Cale, P.",2023,"Australia's terrestrial mammalian fauna have experienced severe declines since European settlement. On the Murray-Darling floodplain in south-eastern Australia, common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula, 'possums'), have contracted to riparian zones. Although an important possum refuge, little is known about possum population dynamics here. We examined possum population dynamics and potential drivers across two decades on the Murray River floodplain at Calperum Station. We related possum density to satellite derived fractional cover, (a measure of the proportion of green, non-green and bare ground cover), and contextualised these findings using tree condition and grazing pressure datasets. Possum surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2019 in riparian and non-riparian habitats and density was modelled in relation to fractional cover values of green, non-green, and bare ground. Possum density fluctuated between 1998 and 2008 but in 2018 and 2019, possums were undetectable. Possum density was negatively associated with bare ground and positively associated with non-green. Overgrazing by kangaroos likely reduced vegetation cover and diversity and contributed to possum decline, via a reduction in possum food resources and increased exposure to predation. Inconsistent monitoring meant that the population decline was not detected until after it had occurred, and management interventions were not triggered, highlighting the dilemma of allocating scarce monitoring resources.",neilly_potentialdriverscommonbrusntail_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Development Of A Telemetry And Yield-Mapping System Of Olive Harvester,"Castillo-Ruiz, Francisco J. and Perez-Ruiz, Manuel and Blanco-Roldan, Gregorio L. and Gil-Ribes, Jesus A. and Agueera, Juan",2015,"Sensors, communication systems and geo-reference units are required to achieve an optimized management of agricultural inputs with respect to the economic and environmental aspects of olive groves. In this study, three commercial olive harvesters were tracked during two harvesting seasons in Spain and Chile using remote and autonomous equipment that was developed to determine their time efficiency and effective based on canopy shaking for fruit detachment. These harvesters work in intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards. A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters. The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system. The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective field capacity or field efficiency. A saving of 40\% in effective field capacity was achieved with a reduction from 4 m or higher to 3.5 m in alley width for SHD olive harvester.

Spatiotemporal Variations In Drought And Vegetation Response In Inner Mongolia From 1982 To 2019,"Wei, Yujiao and Zhu, Lin and Chen, Yun and Cao, Xinyu and Yu, Huilin",2022,"Drought events cause ecological problems, including reduced water resources and degraded vegetation. Quantifying vegetation responses to drought is essential for ecological management. However, in existing research, the response relationships (correlations and lags) were typically determined based on Pearson correlation coefficient and the resultant lag times were constrained by the spatial and temporal resolutions of the analyzed data. Inner Mongolia is an important ecological barrier in northern China. Ecological security is one of the most concerned issues of the region's sustainable development. Herein, we combined Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3g) with Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terra-vegetation (SPOT-VGT) NDVI data through spatial downscaling. The obtained 1 km-resolution NDVI dataset spanning Inner Mongolia from 1982 to 2019 was used to represent the refined vegetation distribution. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) derived from gridded meteorological data was used to measure drought over the same period. We investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation and drought in the region in the past 38 years. We then discussed changes in different vegetation responses to drought across eastern Inner Mongolia using cross wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC). The results reveal that in 82.4\% of the study area, NDVI exhibited rising trends, and the SPEI values exhibited declining trends in 78.5\% of the area. In eastern Inner Mongolia, the grassland NDVI was positively correlated with SPEI and significantly affected by drought events, while NDVI in forestlands, including shrubs, broad-leaved forests, and coniferous forests, was negatively correlated with SPEI in the short term and weakly affected by drought. The NDVI lag times behind SPEI in grasslands, coniferous forests, and broad-leaved forests were 1-1.5, 4.5, and 7-7.5 months, respectively.

Unsupervised Bayesian Inference To Fuse Biosignal Sensory Estimates For Personalizing Care,"Zhu, T. and Pimentel, M. A. F. and Clifford, G. D. and Clifton, D. A.",2019,"The role of sensing technologies, such as wearables, in delivering precision care is becoming widely acceptable. Given the very large quantities of sensor data that rapidly accumulate, there is a need to employ automated algorithms to label biosignal sensor data. In many real-life clinical applications, no such expert labels are available, and algorithms for processing sensor data must be relied upon, without access to the 'ground truth.' It is therefore extremely difficult to choose which algorithms to trust or discard at any point in time, where different algorithms may be optimal for different patients, or even for different points in time for the same patient. We propose two fully Bayesian approaches for fusing labels from independent and potentially correlated annotators (i.e., algorithms or, where available, experts). These are generative models to aggregate labels (i.e., the outputs of the algorithms, such as identified ECG morphology) in an unsupervised manner, to estimate jointly the assumed bias and precision of each algorithm without access to the ground truth. The latter fused estimate may then be used to infer the underlying ground truth. For the first time in the biomedical context, we show that modeling correlations between annotators, and fusing information concerning task difficulty (such as the estimated quality of the sensor data), improve these estimates with respect to commonly employed strategies in the literature. Also, we adopt a strongly Bayesian approach to inference using Gibbs sampling to improve estimates over the existing state of the art. We present results from applying the proposed pair of models to simulated and two publicly available biomedical datasets, to demonstrate proof-of-principle. We show that our proposed models outperform all existing approaches recreated from the literature. We also show that the proposed methods are robust when dealing with missing values (as often occurs in real-life biomedical applications), and that they are suitably efficient for use in real-Time applications, thereby providing the basis for the reliable use of sensors for personalizing the care of the individual. © 2013 IEEE.",zhu_unsupervisedbayesianinferencefuse_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Regional Distribution Of Salt-Rich Dust Across Southwest Asia Based On Predictive Soil-Geomorphic Mapping Techniques,"Bacon, S. N. and McDonald, E. V.",2016,"Understanding the source regions of soluble salt-rich dust is critical for military operations, monitoring potential environmental health impacts to military personnel, and for mitigating abrasion and corrosion to military materiél operating in desert regions. Arid regions are characterized by saline soils which are formed by a lack of precipitation and influenced by surrounding and underlying geology, among other factors. The dust content in soils and surface sediments in southwest Asia is commonly associated with specific landforms. This paper uses a soil-geomorphic conceptual model that integrates geographic datasets of Landsat imagery, soil and landforms, precipitation data, and geologic maps to produce derivative map-based predictions of the spatial distribution and content of salt-rich dust-sized particle in soils and surface sediments in the region. The derivative map is based on three regional dust and salt content maps and the assignment of a five-fold rating class and numerical factor value system to individual map polygons [e.g., Very High (5), High (4), Moderate (3), Low (2), Very Low (1)]. The three regional maps include: (1) dust content based on the identification of distinct landform assemblages from 15-m resolution compressed LANDSAT TM+ imagery at a scale of 1:750,000, (2) salt content developed from 1 km 2 -resolution mean annual precipitation data, and (3) geologic-based salt content developed from published geologic maps. This study presents an initial step towards the prediction of salt-rich dust sources at regional scales that is aimed to provide information to planning military operations and for mitigating the hazards of dust on military personnel and equipment operating in desert regions.

The Assessment Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Salinity Risk Using Neural Network,"Akramkhanov, A. and Vlek, P. L. G.",2012,"Soil salinity in the Aral Sea Basin is one of the major limiting factors of sustainable crop production. Leaching of the salts before planting season is usually a prerequisite for crop establishment and predetermined water amounts are applied uniformly to fields often without discerning salinity levels. The use of predetermined water amounts for leaching perhaps partly emanate from the inability of conventional soil salinity surveys (based on collection of soil samples, laboratory analyses) to generate timely and highresolution salinity maps. This paper has an objective to estimate the spatial distribution of soil salinity based on readily or cheaply obtainable environmental parameters (terrain indices, remote sensing data, distance to drains, and long-term groundwater observation data) using a neural network model. The farm-scale (~15 km 2) results were used to upscale soil salinity to a district area (~300 km 2). The use of environmental attributes and soil salinity relationships to upscale the spatial distribution of soil salinity from farm to district scale resulted in the estimation of essentially similar average soil salinity values (estimated 0.94 vs. 1.04 dS m -1). Visual comparison of the maps suggests that the estimated map had soil salinity that was uniform in distribution. The upscaling proved to be satisfactory; depending on critical salinity threshold values, around 70-90% of locations were correctly estimated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",akramkhanov_assessmentspatialdistributionsoil_2012,FALSE,class_round1,NA

G.",2018,"Monitoring estuarine ecological-geomorphological dynamics has become a crucial aspect of studying the impacts of climate change and worldwide infrastructure development in coastal zones. Together, these factors have changed the natural eco-geomorphic processes that affect estuarine regimes and comprehensive modelling of coastal resources can assist managers to make appropriate decisions about their sustainable use. This study has utilised Towamba estuary (southeastern NSW, Australia), to demonstrate the value and priority of modelling estuarine dynamism as a measure of the rates and consequences of eco-geomorphic changes. This research employs several geoinformatic modelling approaches over time to investigate and assess how climate change and human activities have altered this estuarine eco-geomorphic setting. Multitemporal trend/change analysis of sediment delivery, shoreline positions and land cover, determined from fieldwork and GIS analysis of remote sensing datasets, shows significant spatio-temporal changes to the elevation and areal extent of sedimentary facies in the Towamba estuary over the past 65 years. Geomorphic growth (~ 2600 m2 annually) has stabilised the estuarine habitats, particularly within native vegetation, salt marsh and mangrove areas. Geomorphic changes have occurred because of a combination of sediment runoff from the mostly unmodified terrestrial catchment, nearshore processes (ocean dynamics) and human activities. The construction of GIS models, verified with water and sediment samples, can characterise physical processes and quantify changes within the estuarine ecosystem. Such robust models will allow resource managers to evaluate the potential effects of changes to the current coastal ecosystems. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",alnasrawi_assessmentanthropogenicclimaticstressors_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms For Predicting And Digitally Mapping Surface Soil Available Phosphorous: A Case Study From Southwestern Iran,"Hojati, Saeid and Biswas, Asim and Masir, Mojtaba Norouzi",2023,"In developing countries like Iran, where information is scarce, understanding the spatial variability of soil available phosphorous (SAP), one of the three major nutrients, is crucial for effective agricultural ecosystem management. This study aimed to predict and digitally map the spatial distribution and related uncertainty of SAP while also assessing the impact of environmental factors on SAP variability in the topsoils. A study area from northern Khuzestan province, Iran was selected as case study area. Three machine learning (ML) models, namely, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were used to develop predictive relationship between surface soil (0-10 cm) SAP content and environmental covariates derived from a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 images. A total of 250 topsoil samples were collected following the conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) approach and several soil properties were measured in the laboratory. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) were used to determine the accuracy of models. The findings indicated that the RF algorithm demonstrated the most favorable performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 mg SAP kg-1, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.99 mg SAP kg-1, and the highest linear correlation coefficient (LCCC) values of 0.96. This suggests that the RF algorithm had the least tendency to overestimate or underestimate SAP contents compared to other methods. Consequently, the RF algorithm was selected as the optimal choice. Predictive ML models were employed to digitally map SAP contents within the region. Spatial patterns of SAP contents showed an increasing gradient from west to east. The spatial variability information provides a basis for developing sustainable production system in the area.",hojati_comparingmachinelearningalgorithms_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Globalisation And The Middle Classes In India: The Social And Cultural Impact Of Neoliberal Reforms,"Ganguly-Scrase, R. and Scrase, T. J.",2008,"This book fills an important gap in the existing literature on economic liberalization and globalisation in India by providing much needed ethnographic data from those affected by neoliberal globalisation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, it reveals the complexity of the globalisation process and describes and accounts for the contradictory attitudes of the lower middle classes. The authors challenge the notion of a homogeneous Indian middle class as being the undoubted beneficiaries of recent neoliberal economic reforms, showing that while the lower middle classes are generally supportive of the recent economic reforms, they remain doubtful about the long term benefits of the country's New Economic Policy and liberalisation. Significantly, this book discusses and analyzes both the economic and cultural sides to globalisation in India, providing much-needed data in relation to several dimensions including the changing costs of living; household expenditure, debt and consumerism; employment and workplace restructuring; gender relations and girls' education; global media and satellite television; and the significance of English in a globalising India. Globalisation and the Middle Classes in India will be of interest to scholars and students working in the fields of Sociology, Social Anthropology and Development Studies, as well as Asian Studies - in particular studies of South Asia and India - and Globalisation Studies. © 2009 Ruchira Ganguly-Scrase and Timothy J.

Evaluation Of River Water Quality In A Tropical South Sumatra Wetland During Covid-19 Pandemic Period,"Rendana, Muhammad and Yandriani and Izzudin, Muhammad and Lestari, Mona and Fattullah, Muhammad Ilham and Maulana, Jimmy Aldian",2023,"The COVID-19 outbreak affected the world badly in this 21st century leading to the closure of all types of anthropogenic activities. It is declared that there was an environmental betterment in names of water quality and air quality during the COVID-19 period. In this study, we analyzed the improvement in water quality by evaluating the suspended particulate matter (SPM) using the remote sensing technique in a tropical South Sumatra wetland i.e., Musi River in Southern Sumatra, Indonesia.

"Development, Optimization, And Validation Of Radium-226 Measurement In Oyster, A Sentinel Organism By Mass Spectrometry","Landry, Alexandre and Banville, Samuel and Clarisse, Olivier",2023,"Radium-226 (226Ra) measurement in living organisms, such as the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), is an analytical challenge: the matrix complexity and the extremely low Ra levels require a purification/preconcentration step prior to its quantification. In this study, 5 g of dry oyster soft tissues and 1.6 g of shell were both mineralized, preconcentrated on an AG50W-X8 and a strontium-specific resin, and measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The volumes of digestate used in the method for both matrices were optimized to reach a high preconcentration factor without any risk of oversaturating the columns. Out of the 50 mL of digestates, 48 mL and 2.5 mL were determined as optimal volumes for soft tissues and shell, respectively. To obtain a higher preconcentration factor and a lower limit of quantification (LOQ) for shell samples, three aliquots of 2.5 mL digestate were run on three different sets of resins and, ultimately, combined for Ra analysis using ICP-MS. LOQs of 7.7 and 0.3 fg/g (260 and 11 mu Bq/g) were achieved for the oyster shell and soft tissues, respectively. The new protocols were applied on relevant samples: oyster soft tissues and shell from New Brunswick, Canada, and different types of reference materials, such as IAEA-470, oyster soft tissue and IAEA-A-12, and animal bones. 226Ra recovery of 105 +/- 3\% (n = 6) was achieved for IAEA-A-12 (animal bones), the closest available reference material to shell with a recommended value for 226Ra. Resin performances were investigated using 226Ra standard solution and real samples: each set of columns could be used more than 100 times without any significant reduction in Ra preconcentration efficiency. Although the method proposed and validated in this work was developed for oysters, it could easily be applied to other matrices by adjusting the volume of digestate run on the resins to avoid their oversaturation.",landry_developmentoptimizationvalidationradium_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Forest Burned Area Detection Using A Novel Spectral Index Based On Multi-Objective Optimization,"Wu, Bo and Zheng, He and Xu, Zelong and Wu, Zhiwei and Zhao, Yindi",2022,"Forest fires cause environmental and economic damage, destroy large areas of land and displace entire communities. Accurate extraction of fire-affected areas is of vital importance to support post-fire management strategies and account for the environmental impact of fires. In this paper, an analytical burned area index, called ABAI, was proposed to map burned areas from the newly launched Sentinel-2 images. The innovation of this method is to separate the fire scars from other typical land covers by formulating different objective functions, which involved three main components: First, spectral differences between the burned land and other land covers were characterized by analyzing the spectral features of the existing burned area indices. Then, for each type of land cover, we formed an objective function by linear combination of bands with the values of band ratios. Second, all the objective functions and possible constraints were formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and then it was solved using a linear programming approach. Finally, the ABAI spectral index was achieved with the optimizing coefficients derived from the multi-objective problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral index, three experimental datasets, clipped from Sentinel-2 images at different places, were tested and compared with baseline indices, such as normalized burned area (NBR) and burned area index (BAI) methods. Experimental results demonstrated that the injection of a green band to the spectral index has led to good applicability in burned area detection, where the ABAI can avoid most of the confusion presented by shadows or shallow water. Compared to other burned area indices, the proposed ABAI achieved the best classification accuracy, with the overall accuracy being over 90\%. Visually, our approach significantly outperforms other spectral indexed methods, especially in confused areas covered by water bodies and shadows.",wu_forestburneddetectionspectral_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Knowledge Graph Construction Method Of Gold Mine Based On Ontology,"Zhang, C. and Liu, W. and Zhang, X. and Ye, P. and Wang, C. and Zhu, S. and Zhang, D.",2023,"Geological and mineral resource survey and scientific research in ""geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and remote sensing "" have established a large amount of geological and mineral survey data, which contain rich knowledge related to mineralization and distribution of gold mine, such as the metallogenic and tectonic setting, geological environment of occurrence, geological characteristics of mineral mine, genesis and metallogenic model of mine, and so on. The transformation from massive mineral related data to effective metallogenic knowledge has become one of the most important breakthroughs to improve the accuracy of geological prospecting. To solve this problem, through the in- depth analysis of knowledge representation, information extraction, and knowledge fusion in knowledge engineering, this paper explores the knowledge graph construction method of gold mine based on ontology. Firstly, referring to industry norms, gold mine knowledge base, and reference material of geological and mineral resource exploration, the metallogenic model of gold mine is sorted out, and the gold mine concept, gold mine entity, gold mine relationship, gold mine geological attribute, and gold mine metallogenic attribute are determined. In addition, the schema layer of gold mine knowledge graph is constructed by using the top- down ontology knowledge representation method, which represents the conceptual model and logical basis of gold mine knowledge graph. Secondly, based on structured, semi-structured, and unstructured multi-source heterogeneous geological data, the deep learning model is used to realize gold mine knowledge extraction, semantic analysis, and knowledge fusion, which enriches the data layer of gold mine knowledge graph and provides data support for gold mine knowledge graph. The gold mine knowledge graph is constructed in a bottom- up way, and the gold mine knowledge triplet is stored by Neo4j graph database, in which nodes represent gold mine concept, gold mine entity, and gold mine attribute value, while edges represent relation and attribute. Finally, the gold mine knowledge management system is developed based on the graph database. It can be applied to the management of gold mine data, acquisition of knowledge, visualization representation of gold mine knowledge graph, inquiry of knowledge, management and presentation of knowledge base, and other functions well, so as to lay a foundation for the intelligent analysis and mining of geological big data. This study develops a geological prospecting method driven by data and knowledge, and provides a reference for identifying, controlling, and managing mineral resources, which can improve the prospecting accuracy in geological exploration. © 2023 Journal of Geo-Information Science.

Intercalibration Of Vegetation Indices From Different Sensor Systems,"Steven, MD and Malthus, TJ and Baret, F and Xu, H and Chopping, MJ",2003,"Spectroradiometric measurements were made over a range of crop canopy densities, soil backgrounds and foliage colour. The reflected spectral radiances were convoluted with the spectral response functions of a range of satellite instruments to simulate their responses. When Normalised Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) from the different instruments were compared, they varied by a few percent, but the values were strongly linearly related, allowing vegetation indices from one instrument to be intercalibrated against another. A table of conversion coefficents is presented for AVHRR, ATSR-2, Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+, SPOT-2 and SPOT-4 HRV, IRS, IKONOS, SEAWIFS, MISR, MODIS, POLDER, Quickbird and MERI S (see Appendix A for glossary of acronyms). The same set of coefficients was found to apply, within the margin of error of the analysis, for the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index SAVI. The relationships for SPOT vs. TM and for ATSR-2 vs. AVHRR were directly validated by comparison of atmospherically corrected image data. The results indicate that vegetation indices can be interconverted to a precision of 1-2\%.

Multi-Index Time Series Monitoring Of Drought And Fire Effects On Desert Grasslands,"Villarreal, Miguel L. and Norman, Laura M. and Buckley, Steven and Wallace, Cynthia S. A. and Coe, Michelle A.",2016,"The Western United States is expected to undergo both extended periods of drought and longer wildfire seasons under forecasted global climate change and it is important to understand how these disturbances will interact and affect recovery and composition of plant communities in the future. In this research paper we describe the temporal response of grassland communities to drought and fire in southern Arizona, where land managers are using repeated, prescribed fire as a habitat restoration tool. Using a 25-year atlas of fire locations, we paired sites with multiple fires to unburned control areas and compare satellite and field-based estimates of vegetation cover over time. Two hundred and fifty Landsat TM images, dating from 1985-2011, were used to derive estimates of Total Vegetation Fractional Cover (TVFC) of live and senescent grass using the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) and post-fire vegetation greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also implemented a Greenness to Cover Index that is the difference of time-standardized SATVITvFc and NDVI values at a given time and location to identify post-fire shifts in native, non-native, and annual plant cover. The results highlight anomalous greening and browning during drought periods related to amounts of annual and non-native plant cover present. Results suggest that aggressive application of prescribed fire may encourage spread of non-native perennial grasses and annual plants, particularly during droughts.

"Heritage As Restitution: The Dadaab Refugee Camps, Kenya","Siddiqi, Anooradha Iyer",2022,"Recognizing architectures of unelected migration as sites of modern history and heritage not only expands the consideration of modernities in Africa but also constitutes a form of restitution to those who have fled insecurity and violence imposed by others. In this paper and pictorial presentation based on 12 years of archival and on-site research, I argue that the Dadaab refugee camps and their inhabitation of the Kenya-Somalia borderland may be understood and valued for a long history as well as a recent materiality, which has taken form in architecture, spatial practices, and territorial construction. Rather than accepting the relegation of refugee architecture to policy studies or the applied social sciences, which privilege the logics of emergency and an epistemology of the security state over knowledge stemming from people's migratory lives, this paper takes seriously the paradoxes of Dadaab as a heritage site. At Dadaab, the Kenyan government and UNHCR established relief operations in a region inscribed with colonial and postcolonial frontiers and wars, carrying a memory of detention and an imaginary of a borderland. These modern historical forces are reiterated in humanitarian settlements holding half a million registered refugees and unregistered migrants, enacting confinement in architectures figured as much by the visual frailty of dwellings dusted red by the wind and clad in recovered textile fragments as by a spectacular array of satellite dishes, aeronautic fleets on tarmac, aluminum and polyvinyl chloride water storage towers, and hydraulic extraction machinery penetrating a Jurassic-era aquifer. These architectures signal transience even if anchored in the earth and sky, part of an ecology that once supported pastoralists and now undergirds another migratory world. My pictorially oriented paper uses these historical and aesthetic paradoxes to argue for this complex African heritage site, and with it, restitution of a fraught landscape of migration through a meaningful reconsideration of modern heritage.",siddiqi_heritagerestitutiondadaabrefugee_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Assessment Of Water Quality In Lake Garda (Italy) Using Hyperion,"Giardino, Claudia and Brando, Vittorio E. and Dekker, Amold G. and Strombeck, Niklas and Candiani, Gabriele",2007,"For testing the integration of the remote sensing related technologies into the water quality monitoring programs of Lake Garda (the largest Italian lake), the spatial and spectral resolutions of Hyperion and the capability of physics-based approaches were considered highly suitable. Hyperion data were acquired on 22nd July 2003 and water quality was assessed (i) defining a bio-optical model, (ii) converting the Hyperion atsensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectances, and (iii) adopting a bio-optical model inversion technique. The bio-optical model was parameterised using specific inherent optical properties of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. A MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction code, complemented with an air/water interface correction was used to convert Hyperion at-sensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectance values. These reflectance values were comparable to in situ reflectance spectra measured during the Hyperion overpass, except at longer wavelengths (beyond 700 nm), where reflectance values were contaminated by severe atmospheric adjacency effects. Chlorophyll-a and tripton concentrations were retrieved by inverting two Hyperion bands selected using a sensitivity analysis applied to the bio-optical model. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the assessment of coloured dissolved organic matter was not achievable in this study due to the limited coloured dissolved organic matter concentration range of the lake, resulting in reflectance differences below the environmental measurement noise of Hyperion. The chlorophyll-a and tripton image-products were compared to in situ data collected during the Hyperion overpass, both by traditional sampling techniques (8 points) and by continuous flow-through systems (32 km). For chlorophyll-a the correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-inferred concentrations was 0.77 (data range from 1.30 to 2.16 mg m(-3)). The Hyperion-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations also match most of the flow-through transect data. For tripton, the validation was constrained by variable re-suspension phenomena. The correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-derived concentrations increased from 0.48 to 0.75 (data range from 0.95 to 2.13 g m(-3)) if the sampling data from the re-suspension zone was avoided. The comparison of Hyperionderived tripton concentrations and flow-through transect data exhibited a similar mismatch. The results of this research suggest further studies to address compatibilities of validation methods for water body features with a high rate of change, and to reduce the contamination by atmospheric adjacency effects on Hyperion data at longer wavelengths in Alpine environment. The transferability of the presented method to other sensors and the ability to assess water quality independent from in situ water quality data, suggest that management relevant applications for Lake Garda (and other subalpine lakes) could be supported by remote sensing.

An Evaluation Of Ecosystem Services As A Result Of Land Use Changes In Inland And Coastal Areas: A Comparative Study Of Beijing And Freetown,"Abd El-Hamid, Hazem T. T. and Mustafa, Elhadi K. K. and Osman, Hanan E. E.",2022,"Ecosystems provide a number of functions that are essential to human existence and well-being. However, anthropogenic activities and climate change are severely pressuring these ecosystem services. Changes in land use/cover (LU/LC) induced by human activities affect the environment's ecosystem and alter the ecosystem services value (ESV). Decision-making on development based on ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment is significant for the sustainable utilization of resources. In the current study, Beijing in China from 1995 to 2015 and Freetown in Sierra Leone from 2000 to 2018 were used for monitoring the change in (LU/LC) and ecosystem services. To investigate the changes in ESV utilizing an ESV model, cross-sectional field research, GIS technology and economic valuation of natural capital were all combined. In Beijing, land use and land cover (LU/LC) were as follows: forest > farm > urban > water in all periods of the investigated sites. Furthermore, LULC in Freetown was as follows: dense vegetation > spare vegetation > urban > bare > water in 2018. Changes in LU/LC in two areas reflect the trend toward the agriculture sector. Prediction of LU/LC showed a significant decrease in the agriculture areas in Beijing and Freetown that negatively affected the ecosystem. Results showed a lower ESV after prediction than before prediction in Beijing and Freetown, with loss and decrease in ESV caused by excessive economic benefits. Results showed that dense vegetation contributed the most to ecosystem services overall.

The Cost Of Renal Dialysis In A Uk Setting - A Multicentre Study,"Baboolal, Keshwar and McEwan, Philip and Sondhi, Seema and Spiewanowski, Piotr and Wechowski, Jaroslaw and Wilson, Karen",2008,"Background. The UK National Health Service (NHS) will fund renal services using Payment by Results (PbR), from 2009. Central to the success of PbR will be the creation of tariffs that reflect the true cost of medical services. We have therefore estimated the cost of different dialysis modalities in the Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust and six other hospitals in the UK. Methods. We used semi-structured interviews with nephrologists, head nurses and business managers to identify the steps involved in delivering the different dialysis modalities. We assigned costs to these using published figures or suppliers' published price lists. The study used mixed costing methods. Dialysis costs were estimated by a combination of microcosting and a top-down approach. Where we did not have access to detailed accounts, we applied values for Cardiff. Results. The most efficient modalities were automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the mean annual costs of which were 21 pound 655 and 15 pound 570, respectively. Hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) cost 35 pound 023 per annum and satellite-unit-based HD cost 32 pound 669. The cost of home-based HD was 20 pound 764 per year (based on data from only one unit). The main cost drivers for PD were the costs of solutions and management of anaemia. For HD they were costs of disposables, nursing, the overheads associated with running the unit and management of anaemia. Conclusions. Renal tariffs for PbR need to reflect the true cost of dialysis provision if choices about modalities are not to be influenced by erroneous estimates of cost. Knowledge of the true costs of modalities will also maximize the number of established renal failure patients treated by dialysis within the limited funds available from the NHS.",baboolal_costrenaldialysisuk_2008,FALSE,class_round1,NA

"Variation Of Airborne Bacteria And Fungi At Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum, Xi'an, China, During The ""Oct. 1"" Gold Week Period Of 2006","Chen, Y. P. and Cui, Y. and Dong, J. G.",2010,"Background, aim, and scope: To stimulate the national economy, a so-called ""gold week"" comprising May Day and National Day has been put in force by the government, and the first golden-week holiday began on October 1, 1999. Statistical data show that about 15,000 visitors were received each day by Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum during just such a gold week period. To evaluate the effects of tourism on indoor air, airborne samples were collected by the sedimentation plate method for 5 min during the ""Oct. 1"" gold week period of 2006, and both composition and changes of airborne bacteria and fungi in indoor/outdoor air in the museums were investigated. Materials and methods: Airborne microbes were simultaneously collected by means of gravitational sedimentation on open Petri dishes. Three parallel samples were collected at the same time each day, and samples were subsequently incubated in the lab. Microbiology media were prepared before each experiment by a professional laboratory. Concentrations were calculated and presented as average data of colony-forming units per cubic meter of air (CFU/m3). Results: The results show that (1) 13 bacterial genera and eight genera of fungi were identified from indoor and outdoor air at Emperor Qin's Terra-Cotta Museum during ""Oct. 1"" gold week in 2006. The bacterial groups occupied 61%, the fungi groups occupied 36%, and others occupied 3% of the total number of isolated microorganism genera. (2) As for the comparison of indoor and outdoor samples, the average concentrations of fungi were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (09:00). The average concentrations of bacteria in indoor air were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00), and in outdoor air, they were lower during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00). (3) The average concentrations of five dominant groups of bacteria and three dominant groups of fungi were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than for the morning (9:00) in the indoor air, but the average concentrations of fungi were higher and those of bacteria were lower during the afternoon than for the morning, for outdoor air. (4) As for the comparison of indoor samples, the bacterial daily concentrations and fungal daily concentrations were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than those for the mornings (9:00) over the 10 days. For the comparison of outdoor samples, the bacterial concentration was lower, and the fungal concentrations were higher during the afternoon (13:00) than those for the morning (9:00) over the 10 days. Discussion: The results also show that the numbers of airborne bacteria and fungi had a daily character in indoor air and were higher in the afternoon. The airborne microbe concentrations were found to be similar to residential indoor values from other reports; the indoor museum maximum of microbial concentrations was 90 CFU/m3 and did not exceed the Chinese indoor bioaerosol guideline. However, microorganisms may fall on the surface of display items as a result of particle sedimentation and would, as such, be capable of degrading objects by way of their secretions, e.g., enzymes and organic acids. Therefore, the right steps should be taken to prevent any deterioration in the quality of displayed artifacts. Conclusions: The results show that museum air was affected by human activity; therefore, it is imperative that the number of visitors be strictly limited and that windows be opened regularly to avoid air pollution. Recommendations and perspectives: The data provide a significant scientific basis for indoor air quality control and museum scientific management. It is recommended that the number of visitors be strictly limited. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",chen_variationairbornebacteriafungi_2010,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"A Scale-Adjusted Measure Of ""Urban Sprawl"" Using Nighttime Satellite Imagery","Sutton, PC",2003,"""Urban Sprawl"" is a growing concern of citizens, environmental organizations, and governments. Negative impacts often attributed to urban sprawl are traffic congestion, loss of open space, and increased pollutant runoff into natural waterways. Definitions of ""Urban Sprawl"" range from local patterns of land use and development to aggregate measures of per capita land consumption for given contiguous urban areas (UA). This research creates a measure of per capita land use consumption as an aggregate index for the spatially contiguous urban areas of the conterminous United States with population of 50,000 or greater. Nighttime satellite imagery obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is used as a proxy measure of urban extent. The corresponding population of these urban areas is derived from a grid of the block group level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. These numbers are used to develop a regression equation between Ln(Urban Area) and Ln(Urban Population). The 'scale-adjustment' mentioned in the title characterizes the ""Urban Sprawl"" of each of the urban areas by how far above or below they are on the ""Sprawl Line"" determined by this regression. This ""Sprawl Line"" allows for a more fair comparison of ""Urban Sprawl"" between larger and smaller metropolitan areas because a simple measure of per capita land consumption or population density does not account for the natural increase in aggregate population density that occurs as cities grow in population. Cities that have more ""Urban Sprawl"" by this measure tended to be inland and Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Surprisingly, west coast cities including Los Angeles had some of the lowest levels of ""Urban Sprawl"" by this measure. There were many low light levels seen in the nighttime imagery around these major urban areas that were not included in either of the two definitions of urban extent used in this study. These areas may represent a growing commuter-shed of urban workers who do not live in the urban core but nonetheless contribute to many of the impacts typically attributed to ""Urban Sprawl"". ""Urban Sprawl"" is difficult to define precisely partly because public perception of sprawl is likely derived from local land use planning decisions, spatio-demographic change in growing urban areas, and changing values and social mores resulting from differential rates of international migration to the urban areas of the United States. Nonetheless, the aggregate measures derived here are somewhat different than similar previously used measures in that they are 'scale-adjusted'; also, the spatial patterns of ""Urban Sprawl"" shown here shed some insight and raise interesting questions about how the dynamics of ""Urban Sprawl"" are changing.

A Bayesian Game Theoretic Based Bidding Strategy For Demand Response Aggregators In Electricity Markets,"Abapour, Saeed and Mohammadi-Ivatloo, Behnam and Hagh, Mehrdad Tarafdar",2020,"In recent years, significant development in smart metering and remote sensing systems in the electricity industry, especially on the side of consumers, it has made in implementation demand response programs in peak periods possible. The present study aims to present a game theoretical approach to the optimal bidding strategies for demand response (DR) aggregators in deregulated energy market. This model is based on the customer benefit function and price elasticity so that an economic responsive load model is applied to DR implementation. In this paper, the interaction between a system operator and aggregators in a deregulated market is modeled in this paper, where DR aggregator provides DR service to the system operator. It is assumed that a system operator collects bids from DR aggregators and determines each aggregator share in the demand response programs by maximizing its revenue function, and also, offers rewards to DR aggregators to reach this goal. On the other hand, DR aggregators compete together to offer their DR services to the network operator and in this way provide compensation for customers.

Prediction Of Blueberry (Vaccinium Corymbosum L.) Yield Based On Artificial Intelligence Methods,"Niedbała, G. and Kurek, J. and Świderski, B. and Wojciechowski, T. and Antoniuk, I. and Bobran, K.",2022,"In this paper, we present a high-accuracy model for blueberry yield prediction, trained using structurally innovative data sets. Blueberries are blooming plants, valued for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Yield on the plantations depends on several factors, both internal and external. Predicting the accurate amount of harvest is an important aspect in work planning and storage space selection. Machine learning algorithms are commonly used in such prediction tasks, since they are capable of finding correlations between various factors at play. Overall data were collected from years 2016–2021, and included agronomic, climatic and soil data as well satellite-imaging vegetation data. Additionally, growing periods according to BBCH scale and aggregates were taken into account. After extensive data preprocessing and obtaining cumulative features, a total of 11 models were trained and evaluated. Chosen classifiers were selected from state-of-the-art methods in similar applications. To evaluate the results, Mean Absolute Percentage Error was chosen. It is superior to alternatives, since it takes into account absolute values, negating the risk that opposite variables will cancel out, while the final result outlines percentage difference between the actual value and prediction. Regarding the research presented, the best performing solution proved to be Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, with MAPE value equal to 12.48%. This result meets the requirements of practical applications, with sufficient accuracy to improve the overall yield management process. Due to the nature of machine learning methodology, the presented solution can be further improved with annually collected data. © 2022 by the authors.",niedbala_predictionblueberryvacciniumcorymbosum_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Determination Of Spatiotemporal Changes In Erzurum Plain Wetland System Using Remote Sensing Techniques,"İrdemez, Ş and Eymirli, E. B.",2021,"This study takes place in Erzurum city of Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey Erzurum Plain Wetland, one of the wetlands of international importance that has biodiversity and countless benefits to its environment. Studies to offer opportunities to monitor long-term changes in the area by using advanced technology economically and effectively are expected to guide decision makers. In the present study, the changes in surface area of Erzurum Plain Wetland were investigated between 1998 and 2017 by using remote sensing techniques. As a result of the change analysis conducted using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data, it has been determined there is an expansion in deep and shallow water areas of the wetland. According to the results of the study, deep water areas expanded by 118.64% in 28 years. During this period, the total of deep water and shallow water reed areas increased by 9.08%. In the period of 1989–2017, the total area of the Erzurum Plain Wetland consisting of deep water, shallow water/reeds, and wet meadow/soil parts grew by 26.88%. In the study, the effects of change and human activities on this surface area change were also examined and it was found as a result of the evaluation that more than climatic factors, change of hydrological structure caused by increase in underground water reserves may be effective on the expansion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",irdemez_determinationspatiotemporalerzurumplain_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
The Economic Impact Of Tourism In Central Finland: A Regional Input-Output Study,"Tohmo, Timo",2018,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional taxes in Central Finland. Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central Finland are quite significant. Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings, consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism jobs are often low paying. Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries. Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism impact studies using the input-output technique have also been conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes.

Sub-Nyquist Sampling And Measurement Of Mpsk Signal Based On Parameter Matching,"Yun, S. and Fu, N. and Qiao, L.",2023,"Accurate measurement of the M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signal determined by finite parameters per unit of time is significant in engineering fields, such as digital microwave and satellite communication. In this article, we propose a sub-Nyquist sampling system with two channels for measuring characteristic parameters of MPSK signals based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) sampling theory. The carrier frequency parameter measurement process is modeled as a convex optimization problem, solvable using the parameter matching method on the estimated grid. The minimum harmonic frequency of the carrier is determined to build the exact grid, and the carrier frequency is estimated through a greedy search based on the given cost function. Even when the truth value of the carrier frequency is unknown, the discontinuity location parameters can be measured with high precision using the spectral estimation method on the Fourier coefficients of the MPSK signal. We propose an upper bound on the estimation error of this separable measurement method for signals with one segment. The amplitude and phase parameters can be measured by solving a least square problem. Our proposed measurement system, with lower hardware complexity, can accurately measure the MPSK signal with K segments by sampling only 2K + 5 points in a period, at a much lower sampling rate than the carrier frequency. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our state-of-the-art measurement method. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",yun_nyquistsamplingmeasurementmpsk_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Synchronization, Decoupling, And Regime Shift Of Urban Thermal Conditions In Xi'an, An Ancient City In China Under Rapid Expansion","Guo, Rui and Liu, Shuguang and Shi, Yi and Zhao, Shuqing and Yuan, Wenping and Li, Yuanyuan and Wu, Yiping",2022,"Urbanization has profound impacts on economic development and environmental quality. Some of the serious consequences of urbanization are the changes in the thermal environment, which directly affect the greater environment and quality of life. Although many studies have been performed on urban heat islands, few have specifically examined the thermal evolution of rapidly expanding ancient cities and the impacts of urbanization on the thermal environments of important heritage sites. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of the thermal environment quantified as the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and land surface temperature (LST) values from 2000 to 2018 in Xi'an, an ancient city with rich cultural heritage in China. Specifically, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the thermal environments of the functional zones and heritage sites and explore their coupling relationships with the overall temperature of the study area using a statistical analysis approach. Furthermore, we revealed time-sensitive changes in temperature regimes using the newly proposed double temperature curve approach (DTCA). The results showed that the heat island phenomenon has been intensifying in Xi'an, as evidenced by the summer daytime mean SUHI values being greater than 7 degrees C continuously since 2010 and the increased frequency of high-intensity SUHI effects. Extreme heat conditions were more frequent in the old urban area (built-up and in existence before 2000) than in the new urban area, while SUHI values in the new area deteriorated more rapidly. The changes in temperature in the functional zones were strongly synchronized with the overall temperature changes in Xi'an, and the temperature differences increased linearly with the overall temperature. The LST values in the four major historical heritage sites investigated in this study were 2-8 degrees C higher than the background temperature and were decoupled from background temperature changes. From the DTCA, we found the time periods of the thermal environment regime changes for each functional zone or heritage site, which were largely the result of policy guidance. Regional synchronization, site decoupling, and regime shifts in LST suggest opportunities for regional planning and urban landscape optimization to reduce adverse effects of urbanization on the urban environment, particularly in cities with rich historical heritage sites.",guo_synchronizationdecouplingregimeshift_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Water Harvesting In The Garmian Region (Kurdistan, Iraq) Using Gis And Remote Sensing","Aziz, Shvan F. and Abdulrahman, Kawa Z. and Ali, Salahaldin S. and Karakouzian, Moses",2023,"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of the essential alternative sources of water that may be used. However, finding potential RWH locations on a broad scale has always been challenging, requiring further research. The effectiveness of RWH structures depends on their design and the selection of suitable sites. This study aimed to select potential sites for rainwater harvesting in the Garmian region of Kurdistan-Iraq, using GIS and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. Two multicriteria analysis (MCA) techniques: the analytical hierarchal process (AHP) and Fuzzy analytical hierarchal process (FAHP) were used for comparison purposes to identify potential RWH sites. A suitability map of potential RWH systems was then generated following the weighted linear combination (WLC) and the Fuzzy Gamma methods. The outcomes showed that, unlike most recent studies, which relied on the minimum and maximum local rainfall values, a minimum agreed-upon rainfall depth should be used as a benchmark when classifying rainfall to obtain realistic results. The findings also showed that 9.7\%, 43.4\%, 33.6\%, and 13.3\% of the sites have very high, high, moderate, and low suitability for rainwater harvesting, respectively, depending on the suitability map produced by the WLC method. However, the outcome of the Fuzzy Gamma technique appeared more realistic and revealed that 10.6\%, 15.6\%, 26.6\%, 21.9\%, and 25.3\% of the sites have very high, high, moderate, low, and very low appropriateness for rainwater harvesting, respectively. The methods adopted in this study can be helpful for researchers in the field of RWH to achieve reliable results.

"On The Absurdity Of Rapid Urbanization: Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Land-Use Changes In Morogoro, Tanzania","Sumari, Neema Simon and Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful and Ujoh, Fanan and Xu, Gang",2020,"This study questions the frequent overemphasis on population growth aspects of African urbanization with little consideration of the spatial extent by analyzing the influence of population growth on the spatial expansion of the Morogoro urban municipality (MUM) in Tanzania between 2000 and 2016. Shannon's Entropy, a random forest supervised classifier, and spatial analysis were adopted to analyze Multi-temporal Landsat images obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution and pattern of land-use change. Findings from this research show that Shannon's entropy values for MUM increased from 0.522 in 2000, to 0.761 in 2007, and to 0.901 in 2016 with the urban land cover recording a considerable and consistent increase. Similarly, the municipality's annual rate of change in population decreased from 4.17\% in 1967 to 3.81\% in 2016, and is estimated to rise to 4.54\% by 2030 with a corresponding population of 25,262 in 1967 and 622,000 in 2016. From the results, the rate of population growth is not commensurate with the rate of spatial expansion, as the spatial extent is more than twice the population growth. An important contribution from this research relates to the limited attention to the faster rate of urban expansion compared to population growth in African cities; a situation that is inconsistent with sustainable and resilient urban futures. It is recommended that municipal authorities should consider initiatives (e.g., environmental planning models) to reverse the current trend of urban growth in order to improve the health, density, sustainability and resilience of the urban environment.",sumari_absurdityrapidurbanizationspatio_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Identifying Causal Changes In Landscape Greenness With Very High-Resolution Airborne Multispectral Imagery And A Panel Data Model,"Lassiter, A.",2022,"To effectively manage urban environmental systems, interventions on private lands may sometimes be necessary. This is illustrated in many water districts where water agencies run programs that provide incentives to landholders to change their landscaping to meet the water agency's management goals. It is difficult to monitor, track, and evaluate landscape change programs on private land, however. To most efficiently do so, very high-resolution, time-series measurements of urban landcover would be useful, but such data is often unavailable. This study evaluates how private urban landscape change is represented in the highest resolution, publicly available, multispectral data product distributed in the United States. The study focuses on residential parcels that participated in a lawn replacement rebate program run by the East Bay Municipal Utility District, a water agency in California. Each parcel has a known quantity of turfgrass converted to drought-tolerant landscaping. The study asks if Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data can be used to detect participation in a lawn replacement program at the parcel-level. While the NAIP data product has substantial error in a time-series and urban context, this study finds that approaching change detection using a fixed effect panel data model accommodates error, making it possible to identify NDVI change. With control groups defined by matching and weighing with Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores, results indicate that observed browning at the parcel-level can be causally attributed to participating in the lawn replacement program. This ability to detect small, causal changes in a heterogenous environment opens possibilities for monitoring and evaluating programs acting on private urban landscapes, contributing to more effective and efficient design, pricing and implementation. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",lassiter_identifyingcausallandscapegreenness_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Harmonic Distortions In Smart Devices: A Comprehensive Survey From Conventional To Future Smart Iot Devices,"Gupta, U. K. and Sethi, D. and Goswami, P. K. and Goswami, G. and Gautam, K.",2023,"Smart devices are playing a vital role in remote sensing and monitoring of devices over a wide range of applications. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is leading the world to the next level of technology. This helps the data transmission, monitoring, and control among devices without human intervention. The extensive utility of sensor technology and M2M networking is the future of industries for the production of commercial and non-commercial applications. One such application, the Internet of Things (IoT), is the universally accepted technology of sensors and wide area networking. The extensive use of nonlinear onboard electronic components and power converter units in smart devices generates higher-order current harmonics. This causes the severe effect of low power quality and results in device malfunctioning. The increase in the use of smart devices will be a future challenge for power quality and its effect on associative devices. The main contribution of this chapter is to analyze harmonic distortions due to nonlinear load characteristics in the power management unit of traditional systems and advanced smart IoT devices. It helps us to understand the utility of conventional harmonic mitigation techniques and the need for adaptive features for the latest technology. The conventional compensation techniques are incorporated with machine learning approaches to deal with the uncertainty of load variation on real-time signals. This survey gives a brief insight into the present scope of conventional compensation techniques and futuristic soft computing techniques to mitigate harmonic distortions. Additionally, the survey is intended to call attention to researchers of the future perspective of smart devices and to make the academic community aware of existing practices. © 2024 selection and editorial matter Gunjan Soni, Om Prakash Yadav, Gaurav Kumar Badhotiya and Mangey Ram; individual chapters, the contributors.",gupta_harmonicdistortionssmartdevices_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Geographically Weighted Machine Learning And Downscaling For High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Estimations Of Wind Speed,"Li, L.",2019,"High-resolution spatiotemporal wind speed mapping is useful for atmospheric environmental monitoring, air quality evaluation and wind power siting. Although modern reanalysis techniques can obtain reliable interpolated surfaces of meteorology at a high temporal resolution, their spatial resolutions are coarse. Local variability of wind speed is difficult to capture due to its volatility. Here, a two-stage approach was developed for robust spatiotemporal estimations of wind speed at a high resolution. The proposed approach consists of geographically weighted ensemble machine learning (Stage 1) and downscaling based on meteorological reanalysis data (Stage 2). The geographically weighted machine learning method is based on three base learners, which are an autoencoder-based deep residual network, XGBoost and random forest, and it incorporates spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity to boost the ensemble predictions. With reanalysis data, downscaling was introduced in Stage 2 to reduce bias and spatial abrupt (non-natural) variation in the predictions inferred from Stage 1. The autoencoder-based residual network was used in Stage 2 to adjust the difference between the averages of the fine-resolution predicted values and the coarse-resolution reanalysis data to ensure consistency. Using mainland China as a case study, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) ensemble predictions were shown to perform better than individual learners' predictions (with an approximately 12-16% improvement in R2 and a decrease of 0.14-0.19 m/s in root mean square error). Downscaling further improved the predictions by reducing inconsistency and obtaining better spatial variation (smoothing). The proposed approach can also be applied for the high-resolution spatiotemporal estimation of other meteorological parameters or surface variables involving remote sensing images (i.e. reliable coarsely resolved data), ground monitoring data and other relevant factors. © 2019 by the authors.",li_geographicallyweightedmachinelearning_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Multi-Year Simulation Of Mediterranean Forest Transpiration By The Integration Of Noaa-Avhrr And Ancillary Data,"Maselli, F and Chiesi, M and Bindi, M",2004,"The estimation of transpiration fluxes through wide vegetated land surfaces is of great importance for the proper planning and management of environmental resources, particularly in areas where water is a main limiting factor during at least part of the growing cycle. While remotely sensed techniques cannot directly measure these fluxes, they can provide useful information on vegetation variables such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), which are functionally related to the mentioned processes. The aims of the present work were: ( a) to illustrate the use of multi-temporal LAI profiles derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data as input for a biogeochemical model (Forest-BGC) which simulates the main processes of forest vegetation ( transpiration and photosynthesis); and (b) to analyse the sensitivity of the calibrated model to its main driving variables ( meteorological data and NDVI-derived LAI profiles) in order to assess their relative importance for operational transpiration monitoring. In particular, the model was applied to two oak stands in the Tuscany Region ( central Italy), which are representative of Mediterranean forests and for which a calibration phase had already been performed. Simulations were carried out for a 15-year period ( 1986 - 2000) using as inputs daily meteorological data and NDVI-derived monthly LAI profiles. The sensitivity of the model to both input types was then assessed through other model runs with fixed values of the two variables. The results of these experiments indicated that the remotely sensed LAI estimates are the main determinant of simulated transpirations, especially during the Mediterranean arid season ( summer) when water resources are the primary limiting factor for vegetation development.",maselli_multisimulationmediterraneanforest_2004,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Bale Mountain Eco-Region in Ethiopia is a biodiversity-rich ecosystem where such LULCC have occurred. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) determine which LULC types gained or lost most as a result of the observed LULCC; (ii) identify the major drivers of the LULCC/deforestation; and (iii) assess the approximate amount of carbon stock removed as a result of deforestation during the study period. Remote sensing and GIS were used to analyze LULCC. Landsat images acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015 were used. Additionally, data from the Central Statistics Agency on cropland expansion, and human and livestock population growth were analyzed and correlations were made. The results showed that forest lost 123,751 ha while farmland gained 292,294 ha. Farmland and urban settlement expansion were found to be major drivers of LULCC. Aboveground carbon stock removed from forest and shrubland was more than 24 million tons. In the future, allocation of land to different uses must be based on appropriate land use policies.

Focussing on the Yesanpo Scenic Area with more than 4.5 million visitors each year and annual tourism revenue of 150 million yuan, flood risk modelling was undertaken using HEC-HMS and FlO-2D. Three flood scenarios (a real event that occurred in 2012, a hypothetical flood in 2017, and a future flood scenario) were evaluated using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. The results show that from 2012 to 2017, due to the development of tourism and changes in land-use in the area, the flash flood risk increased by 28%. During this six-year period, most of the agricultural land surrounding the Juma River has been changed to tourist use and the land value has increased by 38%. Based on an inundation depth of 0.5 m, land value losses are expected in the order of 104 yuan m−2 for business use land and 0.8 yuan m−2 for agricultural land. Relative to the baseline flood scenario, the flood risk in three studied villages is expected to increase significantly by 103% under the modelled future scenario. Even where disasters have been experienced, risks are often ignored in tourist areas because tourism in these areas can generate high revenue. Our findings provide important new information for tourism planners facing the long-term effects of flash floods.

Spatiotemporal Variation Of Evapotranspiration On Different Land Use/Cover In The Inner Mongolia Reach Of The Yellow River Basin,"Zhang, Xiaojing and Wang, Guoqiang and Xue, Baolin and Wang, Yuntao and Wang, Libo",2022,"The accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understanding the water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the Earth system. This study focused on the Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River Basin, a typical arid and semi-arid region. Although there are many remote sensing ET datasets, many of the ET algorithms have not considered the impact of soil moisture, especially in water-limited areas. In this paper, the new PT-JPL model, which incorporates soil moisture into ET simulation, is used to improve the accuracy of ET simulation in water-limited areas. The simulation value is evaluated using two Hobq Desert eddy-covariance towers and the Penman-Monteith-Leuning version 2 (PML-V2) dataset. The new PT-JPL model shows the most significant improvements in water-limited regions; the coefficient of determination can reach 0.826, and the RMSE can reduce to 9.645 W/m(2). Soil evaporation is central to the actual ET increase in the study area. Implementing ecological restoration projects reduced the exposed area of land in the study area and reduced the rate of total ET effectively. Furthermore, the most advanced machine learning local interpretation algorithm-the TreeExplainer-based Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method-was used to identify the driving factors of ET capacity under different land use types. Temperature, NDVI, and root zone soil moisture were the main environmental factors causing ET changes in different plants. Meanwhile, temperature and root zone soil moisture had a noticeable coupling effect, except for grassland. Furthermore, a threshold effect of temperature to ET was found, and the value is 25, 30, and 30 degrees C in the forest, grassland, and cropland, respectively.

Evidence Supporting The Value Of Surgical Procedures: Can We Do Better?,"Darrow, Jonathan J. and Robertson, Christopher T. and Kasoff, Willard S.",2021,"There is an acknowledged need for higher-quality evidence to quantify the benefit of surgical procedures, yet not enough has been done to improve the evidence base. This lack of evidence can prevent fully informed decision-making, lead to unnecessary or even harmful treatment, and contribute to wasteful expenditures of scare health care resources. Barriers to evidence generation include not only the long-recognized technical difficulties and ethical challenges of conducting randomized surgical trials, but also legal challenges that limit incentives to conduct surgical research as well as market-based challenges that make it difficult for those funding surgical research to recoup investment costs. These legal and market dynamics differ substantially from those surrounding new drug or device development. Nevertheless, obstacles could be overcome and overall expenditures could be reduced if a share of federal health care agency budgets were reallocated to generating randomized trial data, standardizing outcome measures, and conducting observational studies analogous to those that have been facilitated for drugs via the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative.

Available segments of remotely-sensed and in situ datasets (including hydrological, altimetry, digital elevation model, bathymetry, aerial photo, optical imagery, and radar imagery data) available to different degrees in the Niger-South hydrological area were systematically integrated to draw maximum benefits from all available data. Retrospective modelling, calibration, and validation were undertaken for the whole Niger- South hydrological catchment area of Nigeria, and then these data were segmented into sub-domains for re-validation to understand how data variability and uncertainties impact the accuracy of model outcomes. Furthermore, aerial photos were applied for the first time in the study area for flood model validation and for understanding how different physio-environmental properties influenced the synthetic aperture radar flood delineation capacity in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.

Water Body Extraction From Sentinel-2 Imagery With Deep Convolutional Networks And Pixelwise Category Transplantation,"Billson, Joshua and Islam, M. D. Samiul and Sun, Xinyao and Cheng, Irene",2023,"A common task in land-cover classification is water body extraction, wherein each pixel in an image is labelled as either water or background. Water body detection is integral to the field of urban hydrology, with applications ranging from early flood warning to water resource management. Although traditional index-based methods such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have been used to detect water bodies for decades, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have recently demonstrated promising results. However, training these networks requires access to large quantities of high-quality and accurately labelled data, which is often lacking in the field of remotely sensed imagery. Another challenge stems from the fact that the category of interest typically occupies only a small portion of an image and is thus grossly underrepresented in the data. We propose a novel approach to data augmentation-pixelwise category transplantation (PCT)-as a potential solution to both of these problems. Experimental results demonstrate PCT's ability to improve performance on a variety of models and datasets, achieving an average improvement of 0.749 mean intersection over union (mIoU). Moreover, PCT enables us to outperform the previous high score achieved on the same dataset without introducing a new model architecture. We also explore the suitability of several state-of-the-art segmentation models and loss functions on the task of water body extraction. Finally, we address the shortcomings of previous works by assessing each model on RGB, NIR, and multispectral features to ascertain the relative advantages of each approach. In particular, we find a significant benefit to the inclusion of multispectral bands, with such methods outperforming visible-spectrum models by an average of 4.193 mIoU.",billson_waterbodyextractionsentinel_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Concepts Of Geotechnical Mapping For River Valley Projects In Western India,"Srinivasan, P. B. and Shenoi, R. S.",1979,"The paper discusses the significance of engineering geology maps, choice of mappable units and scale, and their utility in feasibility, design, construction and post-construction stages. These aspects and the scale are governed by the nature of the superstructure, geomorphological, geological, tectonic and geoseismological setting of the area. In India, it is incumbent to have a geological appraisal (preferably by the Geological Survey of India) before major Civil Engineering Projects are taken up. Engineering geology mapping is expected to suit the phases of planning, design and construction. The scale of engineering geology maps varies from 1:63,360 to 1:120. Large scale maps are prepared to project specific geological features. Base maps are primarily conventional geological maps, aerial photos and Landsat imageries. Maps for construction materials portray the utility of particular deposits and their economics. For environmental and urban geology studies, a separate method of mapping is adopted. Collection of subsurface data from underground exploration by drifts, adits etc., in the form of detailed logs and maps enable evaluation of the competence of the rock mass vis-a-vis the superincumbent structure. The existing methods present the geological, lithological and structural data with particular attention to tectonic features likely to influence Civil Engineering Works.

Soil Moisture Monitoring By Downscaling Of Remote Sensing Products Using Lst/Vi Space Derived From Modis Products,"Rostami, Amin and Raeini-Sarjaz, Mahmood and Chabokpour, Jafar and Chadee, Aaron Anil",2023,"Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earth's water cycle and is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, as a novel and effective tool for agricultural and water resource management. Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODIS's image scale (similar to 1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630. Also, based on the evaluation of the obtained results with the ground stations data, the LPRM and the ESA-CCI downscaled images had the best statistical indices values accordingly in 2010 and 2014 that confirm the promising application of remote sensing soil moisture data (rLPRM (2010) = 0.92, MAELPRM (2010) = 4.14\%, RMSELPRM (2010) = 6.39\% and rESA-CC I(2014) = 0.7, MAEESA-CCI (2014)=2.23\%, RMSEESA-CCI (2014)=2.59\%).",rostami_soilmoisturemonitoringdownscaling_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Exploring Temperature Indices By Deriving Relationship Between Land Surface Temperature And Urban Landscape,"Nimish, G. and Bharath, H. A. and Lalitha, A.",2020,"Global warming and climate change are two indispensable phenomena that cannot be overlooked. These can be inferred to the unrelenting rise in surface temperature globally. Unplanned and speedy urbanization is one of the foremost causes of surface temperature rise as it alters the landscape. Urbanization defines the socio-economic value of city and management but if inadvertent, it can lead to serious insinuations on environmental parameters. As a result of globalization and industrialization, a sheer increase in population was observed due to migration, improved health facilities, better job opportunities and superior living standards. It is necessary to inculcate the demand of these rising urban dwellers in the form of infrastructure, energy, clean air and water. As a result of this, landscape restructuring befalls that can be understood by conversion of green or open spaces into concrete structures. This alters the surface properties causing changes in latent and sensible heat flux leading to increased surface temperature as well as ambient air temperatures. With clustered urban spaces and decrease in vegetation cover and water that acts as sinks, the temperature of urban region shoots more than nearby rural areas leading to the development of urban heat islands. These parameters are directly and indirectly related to air pollution, increased summer days, energy requirement, heat-related diseases, emission of GHGs (greenhouse gases). The communication focuses on the recent challenges and criticism faced by developing Indian cities with very minimum landscape to house burgeoning population, immediate strategies and action-plan required to tackle increasing temperatures and mitigate negative environmental impacts and effects on human beings. The study is an attempt to establish a relationship between surface temperature and land use pattern for Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Study also deals with the estimation of various temperature indices for defining and understanding the variation in surface temperature precisely. Application of these results will help in developing necessary policy measures and sustainable actions that are required to reduce anthropogenic effects on urban and natural environment.",nimish_exploringtemperatureindicesderiving_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Among several models, the combination of a cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) model is being widely used for assessing future LULC changes using satellite images. This study aimed to investigate LULC changes in Gazipur City Corporation (GCC), Bangladesh, and the changes in LULC patterns over the last two decades (2002 to 2022). In this study, the maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was used for processing the available satellite images. The results show that the urban area and vegetation coverage increased by 150\% and 22.78\%, whereas the bare land and waterbody decreased by 7.02\% and 78.9\%, respectively, from 2002 to 2022 inside the GCC area.

"Interannual Variation In Commercial Oyster (Crassostrea Gigas) Farming In The Sea (Florianopolis, Brazil, 27°44′ S; 48°33′ W) In Relation To Temperature, Chlorophyll A And Associated Oceanographic Conditions","Mizuta, D. D. and Silveira Junior, N. and Fischer, C. E. and Lemos, D.",2012,"Aquaculture of filter-feeding bivalve mollusks involves the fruitful conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g. temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48 W 30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture management and genetics were standardized significant differences verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Nino period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Two Concepts Of Secularism,"Jahanbegloo, R.",2011,"Secularism, for many of us, is not a terra incognita, and yet it is certainly an improperly defined and unexplained concept. For more than 150 years, intellectuals, politicians, and theologians have used secular and secularism in a rather ambiguous way. These terms therefore need to be clarified. The time has come to rethink our whole approach to the question of secularism. Given the inapplicability of the French model of secularism to the Muslim world, it becomes necessary to find a criterion by which state involvement, when it occurs in the domain of religion, can appear to the members of a religious group as both legitimate and fair. The Indian concept of secularism based on the toleration and equal protection of all religious communities without being supportive of any particular religion can supply this criterion. That said, to pursue a secular politics of rejecting sectarianism and demanding toleration requires that strategic priorities be rearranged without making historical shortcuts. In this case, a secular politics of toleration is a twofold struggle, a resistance to uniformization and an invitation to democratization. If such a strategy is to find any role in the regulation of the lives and activities of Islamic societies today, an alternative concept of secularism, rather than simply an alternative to it, needs to be worked out. The challenge is not to abandon secularism but to formulate it as a philosophy with spiritual values, rather than solely a policy of the state. This is the only way of rethinking our whole approach to the future in Muslim societies to the extent that the pluralist model of a ""shared home"" can be presented as ""a third way"" solution to the crisis of political societies in the Middle East and in opposition to the secular authoritarianism of the state and the rise of religious fundamentalism in civil society. © 2011 by Duke University Press.",jahanbegloo_conceptssecularism_2011,FALSE,class_round1,NA
A Meta-Analysis Of Terrestrial Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Lidar Remote Sensing,"Zolkos, S. G. and Goetz, S. J. and Dubayah, R.",2013,"Estimating biomass of terrestrial vegetation is not only a rapidly expanding research area, but also a subject of tremendous interest for reducing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). The accuracy of biomass estimates, and rate of biomass change, is not only important in the context of carbon markets emerging under REDD, but also for characterizing uncertainty in estimates of carbon cycling and the global carbon budget. There is particular interest in mapping biomass so that carbon stocks and stock changes can be monitored consistently across a range of scales - from relatively small projects (tens of hectares) to national or continental scales - but also so that other benefits of forest conservation can be factored into decision making (e.g. biodiversity and habitat corridors). We conducted an analysis of reported biomass accuracy estimates from more than 70 refereed articles using different remote sensing platforms (airborne and spaceborne) and sensor types (optical, radar, and lidar), with a particular focus on lidar since those papers reported the lowest errors when used in a synergistic manner with other coincident multi-sensor measurements. We show systematic differences in accuracy between different types of Iidar systems flown on different platforms but, perhaps more importantly, differences between forest types (biomes) and plot sizes used for field calibration and assessment. We discuss these findings in relation to monitoring, reporting and verification under REDD, and also in the context of more systematic assessment of factors that influence accuracy and error estimation.

Agro-Climatic Classification Systems For Estimating The Global Distribution Of Livestock Numbers And Commodities,"White, DH and Lubulwa, GA and Menz, K and Zuo, HP and Wint, W and Slingenbergh, J",2001,"Investment in agricultural research in developing countries is being increasingly targeted at those agro-climatic zones and issues where the economic and environmental benefits may be expected to be greatest. This first requires that the zones themselves be defined, along with information on domestic livestock numbers and commodity output within agro-climatic zones in different countries. Different methods for classifying agro-climatic zones were compared. These included methods based on estimated length of growing period (LGP) using rainfall and temperature data, the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (PET), and on more detailed agronomic models, remote sensing data and land use information. Zonation based on LGP has already been linked to existing national livestock data. By defining agro-climatic zones and relating concentrations of livestock populations to those of humans, it is possible to make realistic estimates of livestock populations and the production of livestock commodities for most developing countries. Detailed agro-climatic analyses. of Mainland East Asia and Sri Lanka have recently been undertaken using the GROWEST agronomic model. Using this model as the basis of agro-climatic classification appears to be significantly superior, particularly in temperate environments, to approaches based solely on LGP. Different ways of subdividing countries and continents into agro-climatic or agro-ecological zones (AEZs) are reviewed in this paper. In addition, we show how the numbers of production and commodities from domestic livestock can be allocated to such zones. We also indicate how some of this information can be applied.

Home Telemonitoring And Remote Feedback Between Clinic Visits For Asthma,"Kew, K. M. and Cates, C. J.",2016,"Background: Asthma is a chronic disease that causes reversible narrowing of the airways due to bronchoconstriction, inflammation and mucus production. Asthma continues to be associated with significant avoidable morbidity and mortality. Self management facilitated by a healthcare professional is important to keep symptoms controlled and to prevent exacerbations. Telephone and Internet technologies can now be used by patients to measure lung function and asthma symptoms at home. Patients can then share this information electronically with their healthcare provider, who can provide feedback between clinic visits. Technology can be used in this manner to improve health outcomes and prevent the need for emergency treatment for people with asthma and other long-term health conditions. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of home telemonitoring with healthcare professional feedback between clinic visits, compared with usual care. Search methods: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to May 2016. We also searched www.clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information. Selection criteria: We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults or children with asthma in which any form of technology was used to measure and share asthma monitoring data with a healthcare provider between clinic visits, compared with other monitoring or usual care. We excluded trials in which technologies were used for monitoring with no input from a doctor or nurse. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors screened the search and independently extracted risk of bias and numerical data, resolving disagreements by consensus. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) while using study participants as the unit of analysis, and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) while using random-effects models. We rated evidence for all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach. Main results: We found 18 studies including 2268 participants: 12 in adults, 5 in children and one in individuals from both age groups. Studies generally recruited people with mild to moderate persistent asthma and followed them for between three and 12 months. People in the intervention group were given one of a variety of technologies to record and share their symptoms (text messaging, Web systems or phone calls), compared with a group of people who received usual care or a control intervention. Evidence from these studies did not show clearly whether asthma telemonitoring with feedback from a healthcare professional increases or decreases the odds of exacerbations that require a course of oral steroids (OR 0.93, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.44; 466 participants; four studies), a visit to the emergency department (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.58; 1018 participants; eight studies) or a stay in hospital (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.49; 1042 participants; 10 studies) compared with usual care. Our confidence was limited by imprecision in all three primary outcomes. Evidence quality ratings ranged from moderate to very low. None of the studies recorded serious or non-serious adverse events separately from asthma exacerbations. Evidence for measures of asthma control was imprecise and inconsistent, revealing possible benefit over usual care for quality of life (MD 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; 796 participants; six studies; I2 = 54%), but the effect was small and study results varied. Telemonitoring interventions may provide additional benefit for two measures of lung function. Authors' conclusions: Current evidence does not support the widespread implementation of telemonitoring with healthcare provider feedback between asthma clinic visits. Studies have not yet proven that additional telemonitori g strategies lead to better symptom control or reduced need for oral steroids over usual asthma care, nor have they ruled out unintended harms. Investigators noted small benefits for quality of life, but these are subject to risk of bias, as the studies were unblinded. Similarly, some benefits for lung function are uncertain owing to possible attrition bias. Larger pragmatic studies in children and adults could better determine the real-world benefits of these interventions for preventing exacerbations and avoiding harms; it is difficult to generalise results from this review because benefits may be explained at least in part by the increased attention participants receive by taking part in clinical trials. Qualitative studies could inform future research by focusing on patient and provider preferences, or by identifying subgroups of patients who are more likely to attain benefit from closer monitoring, such as those who have frequent asthma attacks. © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.",kew_hometelemonitoringremotefeedback_2016,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Artificial Intelligence Framework For Modeling And Predicting Crop Yield To Enhance Food Security In Saudi Arabia,"Al-Adhaileh, Mosleh Hmoud and Aldhyani, Theyazn H. H.",2022,"Predicting crop yields is a critical issue in agricultural production optimization and intensification research. Accurate foresights of natural circumstances a year in advance can have a considerable impact on management decisions regarding crop selection, rotational location in crop rotations, agrotechnical methods employed, and long-term land use planning. One of the most important aspects of precision farming is sustainability. The novelty of this study is to evidence the effective of the temperature, pesticides, and rainfall environment parameters in the influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, predicting the future values of main crop yield in Saudi Arabia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the impact of environment factors and agrotechnical parameters on agricultural crop yields and to anticipate yields is examined in this study. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), a highly effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was built to accurately predict the crop yield, temperature, insecticides, and rainfall based on environmental data. The dataset is collected from different Saudi Arabia regions from 1994 to 2016, including the temperature, insecticides, rainfall, and crop yields for potatoes, rice, sorghum, and wheat. For this study, we relied on five different statistical evaluation metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R\%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Analyses of datasets for crop yields, temperature, and insecticides led to the development of the MLP models. The datasets are randomly divided into separate samples, 70\% for training and 30\% for testing. The best-performing MLP model is characterized by values of (R = 100\%) and (R-2 = 96.33) for predicting insecticides in the testing process. The temperature, insecticides, and rainfall were examined with different crop yields to confirm the effectiveness of these parameters for increasing product crop yields in Saudi Arabia; we found that these items had highest relationships. The average values are R = 98.20\%, 96.50, and 99.14\% with for the temperature, insecticides, and rainfall, respectively. Based on these findings, it appeared that each of the parameter categories that are considered (temperature, pesticides, and rainfall) had a similar contribution to the accuracy of anticipated yield projection.",aladhaileh_artificialintelligenceframeworkmodeling_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Soil Erosion Estimates In Arid Region: A Case Study Of The Koutine Catchment, Southeastern Tunisia","Ben Zaied, Mongi and Jomaa, Seifeddine and Ouessar, Mohamed",2021,"Soil erosion remains one of the principal environmental problems in arid regions. This study aims to assess and quantify the variability of soil erosion in the Koutine catchment using the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) model. The Koutine catchment is located in an arid area in southeastern Tunisia and is characterized by an annual mean precipitation of less than 200 mm. The model was used to examine the influence of topography, extreme rainstorm intensity and soil texture on soil loss. The data used for model validation were obtained from field measurements by monitoring deposited sediment in settlement basins of 25 cisterns (a traditional water harvesting and storage technique) over 4 years, from 2015 to 2018. Results showed that slope is the most controlling factor of soil loss. The average annual soil loss in monitoring sites varies between 0.01 and 12.5 t/ha/y. The storm events inducing the largest soil losses occurred in the upstream part of the Koutine catchment with a maximum value of 7.3 t/ha per event. Soil erosion is highly affected by initial and preceding soil conditions. The RUSLE model reasonably reproduced (R-2 = 0.81) the spatiotemporal variability of measured soil losses in the study catchment during the observation period. This study revealed the importance of using the cisterns in the data-scarce dry areas as a substitute for the classic soil erosion monitoring fields. Besides, combining modeling of outputs and field measurements could improve our physical understanding of soil erosion processes and their controlling factors in an arid catchment. The study results are beneficial for decision-makers to evaluate the existing soil conservation and water management plans, which can be further adjusted using appropriate soil erosion mitigation options based on scientific evidence.",benzaied_soilerosionestimatesarid_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA

To design effective conservation and restoration policies, maps of the location and carbon storage of tropical peatlands are vital.

Here field and remote sensing data support the model development of peatland extent and thickness for lowland Peruvian Amazonia.

Combining the map of peatland extent with national land-cover data we reveal small but growing areas of deforestation and associated CO2 emissions from peat decomposition due to conversion to mining, urban areas and agriculture. The emissions from peatland areas classified as forest in 2000 represent 1-4\% of Peruvian CO2 forest emissions between 2000 and 2016.

Results showed that they all tend to target similar locations in both watersheds which traces to the importance of larger contributing area to the rankings by each index. Disagreement among indexes traces to other variables which enable more accurate targeting under particular hydrologic circumstances. Effective use of these indexes poses special challenges, including selecting an index that better describes the hydrologic circumstances in a watershed and is simple enough to use, ensuring the accuracy of the DEM, and determining a maximum index value for the appropriateness of vegetative buffers.

Satellites provide large-scale and long-term near-surface soil moisture retrievals, which can be used to estimate RZSM through various methods. In this study, we tested the utility of an exponential filter (ExpF) using in situ soil moisture by optimizing the optimal characteristic time length T_opt for different soil depths. Furthermore, the parameter analysis showed that T_opt correlated negatively with precipitation and had no significant correlation with selected soil properties. Two approaches were taken to obtain T_opt: (1) optimization of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE); (2) calculation based on annual average precipitation. The precipitation-based T_pre outperformed the station-specific T_opt and stations-averaged T_opt. To apply the ExpF on grid scale, the precipitation-based T_pre considering spatial variability was adopted in the ExpF to obtain RZSM from a new soil moisture dataset RF_SMAP_L3_P (Random Forest Soil Moisture Active Passive_L3_Passive) continuous in time and space over Huai River Basin. Finally, the performance of RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM (0–100 cm) was evaluated using in situ measurements and compared with mainstream products, for instance, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Level 4 (SMOS L4) RZSM. The results indicated that RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM could captured the temporal variation of measured RZSM best with R value of 0.586, followed by SMAP L4, which had the lowest bias value of 0.03, and SMOS L4 significantly underestimated the measured RZSM with bias value of −0.048 in the basin. Higher accuracy of RF_SMAP_L3_P RZSM was found in the flood period compared with the non-flood period, which indicates a better application for ExpF in wetter weather conditions. © 2023 by the authors.",liu_estimationassessmentrootzone_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Composition of information and modules for simulation environment composed of GIS must contain the software for analysis of condition of the components of pipeline infrastructure: primary and backup threads, loopings, branches, bends, site and on-site facilities, industrial buildings, tanks, process piping, etc., and preparation of cartographic materials to ensure prevention and organization of emergency. Methods: decoding of aerospace images of pipeline systems, analysis of space survey materials, data from unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, studying the possibilities of technologies of geoinformation mapping, computer modeling of the state of natural-anthropogenic complexes. Results. The authors have analyzed the regulatory documents that determine the composition of the information necessary for formation of GIS thematic layers on the state of environmental components and the dynamics of natural processes along the routes of pipeline systems. The modules of the information system concentrate data on the disturbance and pollution of the environment, allowing you to create maps of man-made impact scenarios and formulate recommendations for assessing the state and reducing negative consequences. The work shown that the data of remote sensing of the Earth with different spatial resolutions, unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, accurate geodetic reference make it possible to form arrays of geospatial data required for modeling. The environmental safety of hydrocarbon transport is ensured by modeling the development of natural processes that have negative impact on the objects of the pipeline system. For example, when pipeline sections are flooded during floods, as well as when oil and petroleum products enter watercourses, it is necessary to use high-precision digital terrain models. It is proposed to include modules in system that support the analysis of observational data and facilitate decision-making depending on the scenarios of process dynamics, including in the case of emergency oil spills. Conclusions. The significance of the work performed is to develop a methodology for solving a number of issues that contribute to decision-making to minimize the risk of possible accidents during the operation of pipeline systems. The practical value of the proposed technology for collecting and processing primary information for filling databases of geoinformation systems is that it allows you to obtain information sufficient for decision-making in preparation of plans for preventive measures and the elimination of emergency oil spills and the organization of emergency recovery operations. © 2021 Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House.

"Climate Change Patterns Of Wild Blueberry Fields In Downeast, Maine Over The Past 40 Years","Tasnim, Rafa and Drummond, Francis and Zhang, Yong-Jiang",2021,"Maine, USA is the largest producer of wild blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), an important native North American fruit crop. Blueberry fields are mainly distributed in coastal glacial outwash plains which might not experience the same climate change patterns as the whole region. It is important to analyze the climate change patterns of wild blueberry fields and determine how they affect crop health so fields can be managed more efficiently under climate change. Trends in the maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min) and average (T-avg) temperatures, total precipitation (P-total), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were evaluated for 26 wild blueberry fields in Downeast Maine during the growing season (May-September) over the past 40 years. The effects of these climate variables on the Maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVImax) were evaluated using Remote Sensing products and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. We found differences in the increase in growing season T-max, T-min, T-avg, and P-total between those fields and the overall spatial average for the region (state of Maine), as well as among the blueberry fields. The maximum, minimum, and average temperatures of the studied 26 wild blueberry fields in Downeast, Maine showed higher rates of increase than those of the entire region during the last 40 years. Fields closer to the coast showed higher rates of warming compared with the fields more distant from the coast. Consequently, PET has been also increasing in wild blueberry fields, with those at higher elevations showing lower increasing rates. Optimum climatic conditions (threshold values) during the growing season were explored based on observed significant quadratic relationships between the climate variables (T-max and P-total), PET, and EVImax for those fields. An optimum T-max and PET for EVImax at 22.4 degrees C and 145 mm/month suggest potential negative effects of further warming and increasing PET on crop health and productivity. These climate change patterns and associated physiological relationships, as well as threshold values, could provide important information for the planning and development of optimal management techniques for wild blueberry fields experiencing climate change.",tasnim_climatechangepatternswild_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Stand Delineation And Composition Estimation Using Semi-Automated Individual Tree Crown Analysis,"Leckie, D. G. and Gougeon, F. A. and Walsworth, N. and Paradine, D.",2003,"Stand delineation and species composition estimation are cornerstones of forest inventory mapping and key elements to forest management decision making. Improved mapping techniques are constantly being sought in terms of speed, consistency, accuracy, level of detail, and overall effectiveness. Semi-automated analysis of high-resolution imagery at the individual tree crown level may offer such benefits. Methods, however, need to be developed and tested under a variety of forest conditions. High-resolution (60 cm) multispectral airborne imagery was acquired over a predominantly young conifer forest and plantation test area on the west coast of Canada. Automated tree isolation algorithms were applied to the data in order to delineate tree crowns or clusters of crowns. An object-oriented single tree classification was conducted using a maximum likelihood classifier. Stands of similar species composition, closure, and stem density were defined through a sequence that first generated images of these parameters from the automated delineation and classification, used these as input to an unsupervised classification, and then filtered and smoothed the resulting classification clusters. Because of the dense nature of the stands and small crowns on the site, the isolation process often delineated clusters of several trees. Species classification accuracy was determined by comparing the average stand composition from the automated technique to that derived from ground transects or plots. Species classification was good, with average composition error (difference between field measured and automated composition) over all 16 test stands being 7.25%. Most errors for individual species in stands were below 20%, but a few were up to 30%. The automatically generated stand boundaries mimicked well those of known plantation and interpreted inventory boundaries. The automated technique created a few larger stands and some additional small stands in areas of complex forest structure. Overall, for the young fairly uniform stands of the site, both stand delineation and species composition estimation were of a quality suitable for operational use in inventory and forest management. Further development and testing is needed to extend results to situations covering large areas, multiple flight lines, varied topography, and different forest conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Waterbody Extraction From Sar Imagery Based On Improved Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion And Maximum Between-Cluster Variance,"Li, Y. and Yang, Y. and Zhao, Q.",2019,"The use of remote sensing technology to obtain surface waterbody information is of great significance for water resource investigation, natural disaster assessment, watershed planning, and ecological environment monitoring. As a reliable data source for large- scale ground monitoring, SAR imaging has unique advantages that optical remote sensing systems of all- weather, all- weather, and wide coverage do not have, and has been widely used in waterbody mapping. However, due to the influence of speckle noise of SAR imagery, existing methods for waterbody mapping are difficult to extract the complex and fine natural water structures from SAR imagery quickly and accurately. In this paper, a new waterbody extraction method for SAR imagery based on improved speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion and maximum between-cluster variance was proposed. First, the SAR imagery were filtered by improved speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion. The iterative process was adaptively controlled by calculating the average structural similarity between imagery in the iterative filtering process, so that the fine edges and texture structure could be preserved simultaneously. Then, based on the criterion of maximum variance between classes, the threshold value was determined adaptively, and the binary segmentation of the filtered image was conducted. In the binarized segmentation result, connected foreground regions composed of the pixel points that have same intensity values and adjoin to each other spatially, are searched. In so doing, each connected region formed an identified block. By obtaining geometric parameters of these blocks, the false segmentation of the imagery was eliminated, and real waterbody areas were precisely identified based on the SAR imagery. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, water boundaries extracted by this method were on manually drawn waterbody boundaries. Results of comparing the two methods show that they are pretty consistent with each other. Meanwhile, the results of our proposed method were compared with the results of three other kinds of water extraction algorithms commonly used for SAR imagery, in terms of the visual level, extraction accuracy, and running time. The running time of the proposed method meets the requirement of real-time application. The overlap degree of the extracted boundary in two pixels rating areas has reached 80%, which is obviously superior to other methods and the extraction results of the proposed method are also more significant in visual aspects such as boundary and detail information. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows the superiority of our proposed method. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.",li_waterbodyextractionsarimagery_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
A New Remote-Sensing-Based Indicator For Integrating Quantity And Quality Attributes To Assess The Dynamics Of Ecosystem Assets,"Huang, Binbin and Li, Ruonan and Ding, Zhaowei and O'Connor, Patrick and Kong, Lingqiao and Xiao, Yi and Xu, Weihua and Guo, Yanan and Yang, Yanying and Li, Ruida and Zhiyun, Ouyang and Wang, Xiaoke",2020,"Ecological benefits provided by ecosystem assets play an important role in improving human wellbeing. However, there are few feasible methods to combine data on the quantity and quality of ecosystem assets to describe their state and trend. Here, we developed a new remote-sensing-based indicator by synthesizing ecosystem asset quantity and quality data for effective assessment at a regional or national scale. The new indicator includes a typological ecosystem asset index (TEAI) (e.g., forest ecosystem asset index) and an integrated ecosystem asset index (IEAI). The TEAI and IEAI can be used to assess the state and trend of a specific ecosystem or set of regional ecosystems, respectively. We applied the new indicator in the context of ecological protection policy in the Three-Rivers Source Region (TRSR), a region known as the 'Chinese water tower'. From 2000 to 2015, the IEAI increased by 4.02\% due to an increase in the ecosystem asset area (0.2\%) and the ecosystem asset quality (0.66\% and 0.02\% increases in excellent and good level ecosystem assets, respectively). The implementation of ecological protection and ecological restoration programs was the main direct driver of regional ecological asset improvement. Our results suggest the new indicator is feasible for quickly and accurately evaluating the state and trend of ecosystem assets and can be used to guide ecosystem management at a large regional scale.

"Hybrid Bermudagrass And Tall Fescue Turfgrass Irrigation In Central California: Ii. Assessment Of Ndvi, Cwsi, And Canopy Temperature Dynamics","Haghverdi, Amir and Reiter, Maggie and Singh, Amninder and Sapkota, Anish",2021,"As the drought conditions persist in California and water continues to become less available, the development of methods to reduce water inputs is extremely important. Therefore, improving irrigation water use efficiency and developing water conservation strategies is crucial for maintaining urban green infrastructure. This two-year field irrigation project (2018-2019) focused on the application of optical and thermal remote sensing for turfgrass irrigation management in central California. We monitored the response of hybrid bermudagrass and tall fescue to varying irrigation treatments, including irrigation levels (percentages of reference evapotranspiration, ETo) and irrigation frequency. The ground-based remote sensing data included NDVI and canopy temperature, which was subsequently used to calculate the crop water stress index (CWSI). The measurements were done within two hours of solar noon under cloud-free conditions. The NDVI and canopy temperature data were collected 21 times in 2018 and 10 times in 2019. For the tall fescue, a strong relationship was observed between NDVI and visual rating (VR) values in both 2018 (r = 0.92) and 2019 (r = 0.83). For the hybrid bermudagrass, there was no correlation in 2018 and a moderate correlation (r = 0.72) in 2019. There was a moderate correlation of 0.64 and 0.88 in 2018 and 2019 between tall fescue canopy minus air temperature difference (dt) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for the lower CWSI baseline. The correlation between hybrid bermudagrass dt and VPD for the lower baseline was 0.69 in 2018 and 0.64 in 2019. Irrigation levels significantly impacted tall fescue canopy temperature but showed no significant effect on hybrid bermudagrass canopy temperature. For the same irrigation levels, increasing irrigation frequency slightly but consistently decreased canopy temperature without compromising the turfgrass quality. The empirical CWSI values violated the minimum expected value (of 0) 38\% of the time. Our results suggest NDVI thresholds of 0.6-0.65 for tall fescue and 0.5 for hybrid bermudagrass to maintain acceptable quality in the central California region. Further investigation is needed to verify the thresholds obtained in this study, particularly for hybrid bermudagrass, as the recommendation is only based on 2019 data. No CWSI threshold was determined to maintain turf quality in the acceptable range because of the high variability of CWSI values over time and their low correlation with VR values.",haghverdi_hybridbermudagrasstallfescue_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Use Of Satellite Remote Sensing As A Monitoring Tool For Land And Water Resources Development Activities In An Indian Tropical Site,"Behera, M. D. and Gupta, A. K. and Barik, S. K. and Das, P. and Panda, R. M.",2018,"With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time. Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016–2017, respectively. We applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial, and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities were established based on the presence and absence of existing vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403 plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",behera_satelliteremotesensingmonitoring_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Nineteenth-Century Land-Use Legacies Affect Contemporary Land Abandonment In The Carpathians,"Munteanu, Catalina and Kuemmerle, Tobias and Boltiziar, Martin and Lieskovsky, Juraj and Mojses, Matej and Kaim, Dominik and Konkoly-Gyuro, Eva and Mackovcin, Peter and Muller, Daniel and Ostapowicz, Katarzyna and Radeloff, Volker C.",2017,"Historical land use may shape landscapes for centuries into the future, but it remains unclear how much land-use legacies affect contemporary land use. Knowing for how long and how strongly land-use legacies affect agricultural systems is important for contemporary land-use planning and conservation. We assessed the effect of nineteenth-century agricultural legacies for contemporary agricultural abandonment by integrating historic maps and satellite imagery in the Carpathian region. We modeled the choice of agricultural land, and the legacies of Habsburg and Socialist regimes, while controlling for agro-ecological, accessibility and sociopolitical variation. Farming during the Habsburg era was concentrated in agro-ecologically suitable areas, but socialist agricultural expansion occurred mostly in less suitable areas, leading to subsequent abandonment. In addition, our results showed that historic land use affected abandonment even 100 years later. Although legacies diminished over time, their effects were amplified when political transformations occurred, likely due to land tenure systems, land owner attitudes, cultural values and differences in land improvement over time. Taken together, land-use legacies and shifts in political systems can constrain current land management and possible future land-use options, suggesting that contemporary land-use decisions can affect future land use for decades and even centuries.",munteanu_nineteenthcenturylandlegacies_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
An Intelligent Hot-Desking Model Harnessing The Power Of Occupancy Sensing Data,"Cooper, Peter Benjamin and Maraslis, Konstantinos and Tryfonas, Theo and Oikonomou, George",2017,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model to harness occupancy sensing in a commercial hot-desking environment. Hot-desking is a method of office resource management designed to reduce the real estate costs of professional practices. However, the shortcoming is often in the suitability and appropriateness of allocated work environments. The Internet of Things could produce new data sets in the office at a resolution, speed and validity of which that they could be factored into desk-allocation, distributing seats based on appropriate noise levels, stay length, equipment requirements, previous presence and proximity to others working on the same project, among many others. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilises primary data from a commercial office environment in Central London (numerical building system data and semi-structured interviews) to feed a discrete events simulator. To test the hypothesis, the authors look at the potential for intelligent hot-desking to use ""work type"" data to improve the distribution of individuals in the office, increasing productivity through the creation of positive ""work type environments"" - where those working on specific tasks perform better when grouped with others doing the same task. The simulation runs for a typical work day, and the authors compare the intelligent hot-desking arrangement to a base case. Findings - The study shows that sensor data can be used for desk allocation in a hot-desking environment utilising activity-based working, with results that outweigh the costs of occupancy detection. The authors are not only able to optimise desk utilisation based on quality occupancy data but also demonstrate how overall productivity increases as individuals are allocated desks of their preference as much as possible among other enabling optimisations that can be applied. Moreover, the authors explore how an increase in occupancy data collection in the private sector could have key advantages for the business as an organization and the city as a whole. Research limitations/implications - The research explores only one possible incarnation of intelligent hot-desking, and the authors presume that all data have already been collected, and while not insurmountable, they do not discuss the technical or cultural difficulties to this end. Furthermore, final examination of the productivity benefit - because of the difficulty in defining and measuring the concept - is exploratory rather than definitive. This research suggests that not only human-centric smart building research should be prioritised over energy or space-based themes but also large-scale private sector collection of occupancy data may be imminent, and its potential should be examined. Practical implications - Findings strongly suggest that the hot-desking may cost more in lost productivity than it gains in reduced rental costs and as such many commercial offices should revaluate the transition, particularly with a view to facilitate intelligent hot-desking. Companies should begin to think strategically about the wider benefits of collecting occupancy data across their real estate portfolio, rather than reviewing use cases in silos. Finally, cities should consider scenarios of widespread collection of occupancy data in the private sector, examining the value these data have to city systems such as transport, and how the city might procure it for these ends. Social implications - This paper raises positive and negative social concerns. The value in occupancy data suggested herein, bringing with it the implication it should be collected en mass, has a noted concern that this brings privacy concerns. As such, policy and regulation should heed that current standards should be reviewed to ensure they are sufficient to protect those in offices from being unfairly discriminated, spied or exploited through occupancy data. However, the improved use of occupancy data improving workplaces could indeed make them more enjoyable places to work, and have the potential to become a staple in company's corporate social responsibility policies. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for better understanding the specific uses of occupancy data in the smart building mantra. Several sources suggest the current research focus on energy and rental costs is misguided when the holistic cost of an office is considered, and concepts related to staff although less understood - may have an order of magnitude bigger impact. This research supports this hypothesis through the example of intelligent hot-desking. The value of this paper lies in redirecting industry and research towards the considering occupancy data in smart building uses cases including - but not limited to-intelligent hot-desking.",cooper_intelligenthotdeskingmodel_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Floral Abundance And Richness Drive Beneficial Arthropod Conservation And Biological Control On Golf Courses,"Dale, Adam G. and Perry, Rebecca L. and Cope, Grace C. and Benda, Nicole",2020,"Golf courses are among the largest, most ubiquitous highly maintained urban green spaces in the U.S. Although their primary function is recreation, a large portion of golf course land is not actively in use, which presents opportunities to create more ecologically functional areas. Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the biological control services of flying natural enemies and few investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas by up to 50\% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of turfgrass pests.",dale_floralabundancerichnessdrive_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Combining Hyper-Resolution Land Surface Modeling With Smap Brightness Temperatures To Obtain 30-M Soil Moisture Estimates,"Vergopolan, Noemi and Chaney, Nathaniel W. and Beck, Hylke E. and Pan, Ming and Sheffield, Justin and Chan, Steven and Wood, Eric F.",2020,"Accurate and detailed soil moisture information is essential for, among other things, irrigation, drought and flood prediction, water resources management, and field-scale (i.e., tens of m) decision making. Recent satellite missions measuring soil moisture from space continue to improve the availability of soil moisture information. However, the utility of these satellite products is limited by the large footprint of the microwave sensors. This study presents a merging framework that combines a hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM), a radiative transfer model (RTM), and a Bayesian scheme to merge and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological variables to a 30-m spatial resolution. The framework is based on HydroBlocks, an LSM that solves the field-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface processes through interacting hydrologic response units (HRUs). The framework was demonstrated for soil moisture by coupling HydroBlocks with the Tau-Omega RTM used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The brightness temperature from the HydroBlocks-RTM and SMAP L3 were merged to obtain updated 30-m soil moisture. We validated the downscaled soil moisture estimates at four experimental watersheds with dense in-situ soil moisture networks in the United States and obtained overall high correlations (> 0.81) and good mean KGE score (0.56). The downscaled product captures the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics better than SMAP L3 and L4 product alone at both field and watershed scales.

They provide constructive information to emergency and disaster managers, critical infrastructure providers, the insurance industry, and wider society. Post-eruption clean-up of tephra deposits is a prevalent and expensive (time and resource) activity which is often not planned for. Here, we present an overview of the clean-up efforts undertaken in four communities after the VEI 4 eruption of Calbuco volcano in 2015. We narratively reconstruct clean-up efforts in Ensenada (Chile), Junín de los Andes (Argentina), San Martín de los Andes (Argentina), and Villa La Angostura (Argentina) using semi-structured interviews, syn- and post-deposition photographs, pre- and post-event visual spectrum satellite imagery, and media reports. We compare these reconstructions with estimates based on a geospatial modelling approach adapted from Hayes et al. (Journal of Applied Volcanology 6:1; 2017). Specifically, we compare reported and geospatially derived estimates for volume of tephra removed, and clean-up operation duration. Our modelling approach performed well for Junín de los Andes but did not adequately capture volume and clean-up operation duration for the three remaining case study locations. We discuss several sources of uncertainty (including observational errors and natural variance of tephra deposit thickness), reported tephra removal volume estimates, clean-up methods, land use, and temporal evolution of clean-up operation demand.

The impact of urban sprawl is examined by computing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) values. Land surface temperature (LST) is also calculated using thermal band of multi-temporal Landsat data. Regression analysis is used to calculate the correlation between LST and NDVI, NDWI and NDBI. The study showed a negative correlation between NDVI, NDWI and LST and a positive correlation between NDBI and LST. Urban areas in Surat have grown an approximately 60.41 sq.km, a 102\% increase while surface temperature in Surat inner city has risen by 5.1 degrees C during the study period.

"Sar-Based Subsidence Monitoring And Assessment Of The Factors Involved In The Occurrence Of Subsidence, Lahore City","Ahmad, A. and Wang, C. and Tang, Y. and Sultan, M. and Falak, A. and Duan, W. and Wang, J.",2022,"The judicious use and management of natural resources is vital to achieve sustainable development. Land and water are prime natural resources, and their depletion and degradation can lead to serious threats like land subsidence. Land subsidence is a phenomenon of the alteration of elevation at a point on the earth through the sinking of the surface. It occurs when the earth’s surface loses its support. The major causes of land subsidence include groundwater extraction, mining, construction overload, and other similar factors that increase pressure on the surface and eventually subsidize the land. Urban centers with excessive groundwater extraction and infra-structure development are at a high risk of subsidence. Lahore, the second-largest city in Pakistan, is undergoing an enormous increase in population density, uncontrolled urbanization with very large-scale construction projects, and intensive groundwater extraction which are responsible for subsidence directly or indirectly. Therefore, studies on groundwater status and unplanned urban appraisals have seriously urged monitoring of the subsidence in La-hore. Herein, we used freely available Sentinel-1 data for one year (from August 2018 to August 2019), with a high spatial and temporal resolution, to monitor subsidence in Lahore. The data were processed using the SNAP/StaMPS approach for Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI) analysis, which is an advanced InSAR technique. The displacement velocity map from InSAR processing shows a significant land deformation in the area with values ranging from −114 to 15 mm yr–1. Along with the Sentinel-1 data, we also used supplementary data obtained from various government agencies of Pakistan to study the land cover map, transportation network and waterways of Lahore, soil types, population density, and field points for assessing the results and understanding the roles of various factors in the occurrence of uplift or subsidence. A strong correlation was established between subsidence and various parameters such as groundwater extraction and lowering of the water table, soil type variations, land cover changes, surface water channels, and population density. The deformation map confirms the greatest subsidence in the central part of Lahore, while the uplift is observed in the less populated and rural areas situated near Ravi River. The land subsidence and uplift could be attributed to groundwater extraction and recharge through the canal system and the river, respectively. © 2022, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

"Predicting Occurrence, Abundance, And Fruiting Of A Cultural Keystone Species To Inform Landscape Values And Priority Sites For Habitat Enhancements","Nielsen, Scott E. and Dennett, Jacqueline M. and Bater, Christopher W.",2020,"Environmental niche modeling is an increasingly common tool in conservation and management of non-timber species. In particular, models of species' habitats have been aided by new advances in remote sensing and it is now possible to relate forest structure variables to understory species at a relatively high resolution over large spatial scales. Here, we model landscape responses for a culturally-valued keystone shrub, velvet-leaf blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloidesMichaux), in northeast Alberta, Canada, to better understand the environmental factors promoting or limiting its occurrence, abundance, and fruit production, and to guide regional planning. Occurrence and abundance were measured at 845 and 335 sites, respectively, with both strongly related to land cover type and topo-edaphic factors. However, their influence varied widely, reflecting differences in the processes affecting occurrence and abundance. We then used airborne laser scanning (ALS) to characterize horizontal forest canopy cover for the study area, and related this and other geospatial variables to patterns in fruit production where we demonstrated a five-fold increase in fruit production from closed to open forest stands. We then simulated forest canopy thinning across the study area to identify places where gains in fruit production would be greatest following natural disturbance or directed management (e.g., thinning, prescribed burning). Finally, we suggest this approach could be used to identify sites for habitat enhancements to offset direct (land use change) or indirect (access) losses of resources in areas impacted with resource extraction activities, or simply to increase a culturally-valued resource through management.",nielsen_predictingoccurrenceabundancefruiting_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
4d-Trajectory Air Traffic Management: Are There 'Killer Apps'? - Part 2,"Brooker, Peter",2012,"The USA and Europe are developing plans - NextGen and SESAR - to transform the processes of Air Traffic Management (ATM). These will improve safety and efficiency, and match predicted increases in air transportation demand. They use advanced networking technology updated with information from satellite navigation and digital non-voice communication. The strategic goal, envisaged for 15-20 years hence, is a new ATM paradigm. Aircraft would fly on Four-Dimensional (4D) trajectories, incorporating altitude, position, time, and other aircraft positions and vectors. This vision would involve extremely large investments from the airline industry and ATM service providers. Thus, development priorities need to be based on sound business cases. But will these necessarily lead to the strategic vision of a 4D-trajectory system? Will the changes in practice be limited to a series of short and medium term operational improvements rather than strategic improvements? So, are there 'Killer Apps' for 4D-trajectory ATM? 'Killer App(lication)s' is jargon for innovations so valuable that they prove the core value of some larger technology. Killer Apps generate high degrees of stakeholder technical and financial cooperation. Ironically, most past ATM Killer Apps have improved safety, e. g., modern radar data processing led to collision avoidance systems. The analysis here attempts to identify and then size potential 4D-trajectory ATM Killer Apps. The evidence for Killer Apps has to pass key tests. Killer Apps obviously have to offer enormous benefits to stakeholders in the context of the potential costs. The bulk of these benefits must not be obtainable through technologically 'cut down' non-4D-trajectory versions. Part 1 of this paper (Brooker, 2012a) sets out the framework for investigating these questions. Part 2 examines potential Killer Apps derived from improvements in Fuel Efficiency, Capacity and Cost. An abbreviated version of this paper was first presented at the European Navigation Conference (ENC 2011), London in November 2011.",brooker_4dtrajectoryairtraffic_2012,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Nest Site Selection And The Effects Of Land Use In A Multi-Scale Approach On The Distribution Of A Passerine In An Island Arid Environment,"Illera, J. C. and von Wehrden, H. and Wehner, J.",2010,"We examine the predictive ability of habitat-species relationship models in island semi-desert environments using as model species the Canary Islands stonechat (Saxicola dacotiae), an endemic bird inhabiting the arid island of Fuerteventura. We investigated nest site selection and the effects of land use on its distribution in a multi-scale approach using nest positions obtained during three consecutive breeding seasons. We identified two environmental predictors, namely Tasseled cap 1 (a range value of land brightness) and slope, and three variables derived from human use (house densities, unpaved roads and fences) as the best predictors of occurrence of the species. Only slope had a positive and significant effect on stonechat occurrence; the rest being negative. Results were not restricted by the scale, indicating that design of special protection areas should be developed considering the landscape scale. Our results provide a robust prediction of the species distribution throughout Fuerteventura, demonstrating that our approach can also cope for the low vegetation signal within small arid regions such as islands. Future land use planning and management for the island should avoid the presence of negative impact elements such as opening new roads and new urbanisations in nearby habitats with the highest probabilities of species occurrence.

The Role Of Agroforestry In Restoring Brazil's Atlantic Forest: Opportunities And Challenges For Smallholder Farmers,"Shennan-Farpon, Yara and Mills, Morena and Souza, Aline and Homewood, Katherine",2022,"1. Restoring the degraded Atlantic Forest is one of the biggest conservation challenges in Brazil. In a biome with high human presence, understanding the potential for restoration approaches, such as agroforestry, to provide benefits to smallholder farmers and biodiversity is essential in developing equitable restoration strategies. 2. Smallholder or family farmers are essential to national food security, producing most fruit and vegetables consumed in Brazil. Their farms can also provide ecological stepping stones for biodiversity. To better understand their role in Atlantic Forest restoration, this study explores the use of agroforestry by smallholder farmers from the Movimento Sem Terra (MST), the Rural Landless Workers' Movement, in Pontal do Paranapanema. 3. We use quantitative and qualitative data to assess farmer perceptions of the measures which support agroforestry farming, barriers to implementation and its impact on indicators of wellbeing. We find agroforestry farmers report significant benefits in 8 of 18 tested indicators. Attitudes to agroforestry are varied, but common themes emerge including the high value of tree cover for shade and cooling effects, and the difficulties in selling agroforestry products. Our results show lack of policy support and initial investment needs are the biggest constraints to agroforestry, but opportunity cost is not considered a large barrier. 4. Tailored policies and financial measures are needed to integrate thousands of smallholder farmers into the Atlantic Forest restoration agenda, helping to reach biome restoration targets while supporting rural livelihoods and national food security. Further research is required into links between additional socio-economic and biogeographical variables and agroforestry uptake in the region.",shennanfarpon_roleagroforestryrestoringbrazil's_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Model-Based Assessment Of The Pattern Differences And The Equity Of National Carbon Emissions In China During 2000-2010,"Wang, Qiuxian and Gao, Zhiqiang and Ning, Jicai",2015,"Land cover information of China was extracted using the supervised classification of remote sensing data and the carbon sink and carbon emissions of each province were calculated by combining the statistical data with the method of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 listing. With the newly built 3E model, the three indexes of ESI (ecological support index), EDI (equitable distribution index) and EEI (economic efficiency index) were calculated and their spatial pattern characteristics and regional differences over time were analyzed. The research results indicated that as the forest coverage rate increased, the carbon sink of the ecosystem in China also increased. ESI in the central and western China was tending to decrease, while ESI in the eastern coast was growing. Although the EEI gap between eastern China and western China was large, their EDI value gap was becoming shrinking as the economic growth shifted towards the central China and western China. The 3E values which were calculated with the consideration of ecology, equity and efficiency for China's carbon emissions indicated that the carbon emissions in half provinces of China were in good conditions, with benign ecosystem circulation, fairness and high economic efficiency in the recent 11 years. These results could act as references for China's low carbon economic development and also could provide guidance for the spatial pattern planning of China's carbon emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban Green Accessibility Index: A Measure Of Pedestrian-Centered Accessibility To Every Green Point In An Urban Area,"Jang, Kee Moon and Kim, Jaeman and Lee, Hye-Yeong and Cho, Hyemin and Kim, Youngchul",2020,"Advancements in remote sensing techniques and urban data analysis tools have enabled the successful monitoring and detection of green spaces in a city. This study aims to develop an index called the urban green accessibility (UGA) index, which measures people's accessibility to green space and represents the citywide or local characteristics of the distribution pattern of green space. The index is defined as the sum of pedestrians' accessibility to all vegetation points, which consists of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with integration and choice values from angular segment analysis. In this study, the proposed index is tested with cases of New York, NY, and San Francisco, CA, in the US. The results reveal differences based on the significance of streets. When analysis ranges are on a neighborhood scale, a few hotspots appear in well-known green areas on commonly accessible streets and in local neighborhood parks on residential blocks. The appearance of high-accessibility points in low-NDVI areas implies the potential of the efficient and proper distribution of green spaces for pedestrians. The proposed measure is expected to help in planning and managing green areas in cities, taking people's accessibility and spatial relationships into consideration.",jang_urbangreenaccessibilityindex_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Investigation Of Potential Of Solar Photovoltaic System As An Alternative Electric Supply On The Tropical Island Of Mantanani Sabah Malaysia,"Abd Hamid, Ag Sufiyan and Makmud, Mohamad Zul Hilmey and Abd Rahman, Abu Bakar and Jamain, Zuhair and Ibrahim, Adnan",2021,"This article reports on the potential use of a photovoltaic solar system on Mantanani Island. This island has its attractions in terms of flora and fauna as well as the uniqueness of its local community. The electricity supply status of the island is minimal, and the local electricity provider only provides two units of electrical generator that only supply energy from 18:00 to 06:00. This study is motivated by the hypothesis that if the target resident can obtain a better electricity supply, they can generate higher income and improve their standard of living. This study aims to identify the status of solar energy sources, estimate the basic electrical load, and conduct a techno-economic analysis of homestay enterprises of residents. Geostationary satellite data on solar energy resources were gathered and analyzed using Solargis. The electricity load was calculated based on the daily routine activities of the residents and usage of primary electrical appliances. Techno-economic analysis was done by determining the key parameters to calculate the return on investment and payback period. The results showed that Mantanani Island had great potential for implementing a photovoltaic system, by the estimated value of the total annual solar energy and peak sun hour of 1.447 MWh/m(2)/y and 4.05 h, respectively. The variation in total monthly solar energy was minimal, with a range of only 61.3 Wh/m(2). The calculated electrical load was 7.454 kWh/d. The technoeconomic assessment showed that the return on investment was MYR 3600 per year. However, the value of the payback period varies according to the value of the cost of capital spent. Regarding the cost of capital of this study, the shortest and longest payback periods achievable were 2.78 and 13.89 years, respectively.

Porto Alegre 2006: Called To Be The One Church: Ecumenism Beyond Its Crisis?,"Houtepen, Anton W. J.",2007,"From 9-23 February 2006 the World Council of Churches held its 9th Assembly in Porto Alegre, Brasil with the theme God, in your grace, transform the world. It gathered in an atmosphere of crisis in the ecumenical movement, caused by global political and religious developments, post-modern thinking on the value of plurality and difference(1) and by the slow reception of ecumenical agreements. The Assembly, though, became a sign of hope beyond the ecumenical crisis. Its reflections and proposals on Globalisation and economic injustice, on Christian identity and religious plurality and on Church Unity and the Mission of the Church demonstrate a matured ecumenical and ecclesiological awareness, strengthened by a new method of decision-making by consensus. The document Called to be the one Church might be seen as the constitutional basis for a reconfiguration of the ecumenical movement and as a refinement of the Toronto Declaration of 1950.

Hydrological Simulation Using Trmm And Chirps Precipitation Estimates In The Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin,"Luo, Xian and Wu, Wenqi and He, Daming and Li, Yungang and Ji, Xuan",2019,"Satellite-based products with high spatial and temporal resolution provide useful precipitation information for data-sparse or ungauged large-scale watersheds. In the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, rainfall stations are sparse and unevenly distributed, and the transboundary characteristic makes the collection of precipitation data more difficult, which has restricted hydrological processes simulation. In this study, daily precipitation data from four datasets (gauge observations, inverse distance weighted (IDW) data, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) estimates, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) estimates), were applied to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and then their capability for hydrological simulation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin were examined. TRMM and CHIRPS data showed good performances on precipitation estimation in the Lower Lancang-Mekong River Basin, with the better performance for TRMM product. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of gauge, IDW, TRMM, and CHIRPS simulations during the calibration period were 0.87, 0.86, 0.95, and 0.93 for monthly flow, respectively, and those for daily flow were 0.75, 0.77, 0.86, and 0.84, respectively. TRMM and CHIRPS data were superior to rain gauge and IDW data for driving the hydrological model, and TRMM data produced the best simulation performance. Satellite-based precipitation estimates could be suitable data sources when simulating hydrological processes for large data-poor or ungauged watersheds, especially in international river basins for which precipitation observations are difficult to collect. CHIRPS data provide long precipitation time series from 1981 to near present and thus could be used as an alternative precipitation input for hydrological simulation, especially for the period without TRMM data. For satellite-based precipitation products, the differences in the occurrence frequencies and amounts of precipitation with different intensities would affect simulation results of water balance components, which should be comprehensively considered in water resources estimation and planning.",luo_hydrologicalsimulationtrmmchirps_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Clinical Research In Telemedicine: Evaluation Of The Medical Service To Patients,"Simon, P.",2012,"Telemedicine is a remote medical practice which uses tools related to information and communication technologies (ICT). Since July 21, 2009, French law permits this new medical practice and the decree of October 19, 2010, indicates the main procedures (tele-consultation, tele-expertise, medical tele-surveillance, medical tele-assistance, tele-advice from the hospital call center) and the conditions of their implementation. Clinical research is the practice of clinical trials which have the aim of evaluating the safety and efficacy of a diagnostic method or a new treatment. Clinical research is the main purpose of the National Association of Telemedicine (ANTEL) and of its new official journal European Research in Telemedicine. This editorial is opening the first issue of our journal. Several examples can illustrate the importance of clinical research in telemedicine. In type 1 diabetes, after the first discordant results due to insufficient or weak methodologies, the French study TeleDiab 1 brought for the first time a clinical improvement over 6 months in patients followed-up remotely by Diabeo software and teleconsultation. The main medical service to patients was a decrease of complication risks due to a significant decrease of HbA1c. Nevertheless, the encouraging results of this pilot study need confirmation over a longer period (the TELESAGE study over two years). In chronic heart failure, the first results of two meta-analyses showed a significant 30% reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, these results were not confirmed by two, more recent, prospective and randomised studies. Most authors think that it is necessary to define several subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure in order to recognize patient subgroups who could benefit from telemedicine at home. The medical service to stroke patients brought by telemedicine is not open to debate. Telestroke allows patients away from neurology centres to benefit from emergency thrombolysis (less than 4 h 30 min after the first signs) treatment that can allow the total or partial regression of a neurological deficit. Other telemedicine applications have been able to demonstrate a medical service to patients, for example remote blood pressure self-monitoring at home in hypertensive patients, live interactive teledermatology, teledialysis by peritoneal dialysis at home or by haemodialysis by a remote satellite unit, etc. Teleradiology brings a medical service to patients if it is carried out according to international or national guidelines. Many other applications of telemedicine may be the subject of clinical research such as telegeriatry, tele-psychiatry, tele-surgery, tele-rhumatology, tele-obstetric, tele-pathology, etc.). Telemedicine practice can have a significant economical impact, particularly due to reductions in hospitalisation numbers. Risk factors due to telemedicine are beginning to be known. Clinical research on the medical service to patients followed-up by telemedicine can prevent risks. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",simon_clinicalresearchtelemedicineevaluation_2012,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Adjoint Inverse Modeling Of NoX Emissions Over Eastern China Using Satellite Observations Of No2 Vertical Column Densities,"Kurokawa, Jun-ichi and Yumimoto, Keiya and Uno, Itushi and Ohara, Toshimasa",2009,"A four-dimensional variational data assimilation system for optimization of NOx emissions (RC4-NOx) was developed. A parameterized NOx chemistry scheme was introduced into the RC4-NOx system, and key parameters such as chemical production and loss terms of NOx were calculated in advance using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. RC4-NOx was applied to optimize NOx emissions over eastern China (EC) in July 1996,1999, and 2002 using Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite observations of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and a priori emissions from the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS). After assimilation, RC4-NOx generally reproduced the spatial distribution, regional averaged values, and time evolution of GOME NO2 VCDs. Over EC, a priori emissions were reduced by 20\% in 1996 and by 8\% in 1999, whereas a posteriori emissions were almost the same as a priori emissions in 2002. A priori emissions in the Beijing region were reduced by optimization over the whole simulation period. A posteriori emissions over the Yangtze Delta were larger than a priori emissions in 2002, although they were smaller in both 1996 and 1999. As in other areas, a priori emissions over the North China Plain were reduced in 1996; but those over the eastern part of the plain were increased in 1999, and the area of increased emissions moved slightly westward in 2002. In each region, the growth rates of a posteriori emissions during both 1996-1999 and 1999-2002 became generally larger than those of a priori emissions, and the trends of a posteriori emissions became similar to those of GOME NO2 VCDs. Our inverse modeling analysis indicates that the rate of increase of NO, emissions over EC from 1996 to 2002 was much larger for a posteriori emissions (49\%) than for a priori emissions (19\%).

Node-Based Optimization Of Gnss Tomography With A Minimum Bounding Box Algorithm,"Ding, N. and Yan, X. and Zhang, S. and Wu, S. and Wang, X. and Zhang, Y. and Wang, Y. and Liu, X. and Zhang, W. and Holden, L. and Zhang, K.",2020,"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) tomography plays an important role in the monitoring and tracking of the tropospheric water vapor. In this study, a new approach for improving the node-based GNSS tomography is proposed, which makes a trade-off between the real observed region and the complexity of the discretization of the tomographic region. To obtain dynamically the approximate observed region, the convex hull algorithm and minimum bounding box algorithm are used at each tomographic epoch. This new approach can dynamically define the tomographic model for all types of study areas based on the GNSS data. The performance of the new approach is tested by comparing it against the common node-based GNSS tomographic approach. Test data in May 2015 are obtained from the Hong Kong GNSS network to build the tomographic models and the radiosonde data as a reference are used for validating the quality of the new approach. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square errors of the new approach, in most cases, have a 38 percent improvement and the values of standard deviation reduce to over 43 percent compared with the common approach. The results indicate that the new approach is applicable to the node-based GNSS tomography. © 2020 by the authors.",ding_nodebasedoptimizationgnss_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"A Study On Avalanche-Triggering Factors And Activity Characteristics In Aerxiangou, West Tianshan Mountains, China","Liu, J. and Zhang, T. and Hu, C. and Wang, B. and Yang, Z. and Sun, X. and Yao, S.",2023,"Through analyzing the triggering factors and activity characteristics of avalanches in Aerxiangou in the Western Tianshan Mountains, the formation and disaster-causing process of avalanches were studied to provide theoretical support and a scientific basis for avalanche disaster prevention. In this paper, based on remote sensing interpretation and field investigation, a spatial distribution map of avalanches was established, and the induced and triggering factors in disaster-prone environments were analyzed using the certainty factor model. The degree of influence (E) of the disaster-causing factors on avalanche triggering was quantified, and the main control conditions conducive to avalanche occurrence in different periods were obtained. The RAMMS-avalanche model was used to analyze the activity characteristics at points where multiple avalanches occurred. Research results: (1) The E values of the average temperature, average snowfall, and surface roughness in February were significantly higher than those of other hazard-causing factors, reaching 1.83 and 1.71, respectively, indicating strong control. The E values of the surface cutting degree, average temperature, and average snow depth in March were all higher than 1.8, indicating that these control factors were more prominent than the other factors. In contrast, there were four hazard-causing factors with E values higher than 1.5 in April: the mean temperature, slope, surface roughness, and mean wind speed, with clear control. (2) Under the influence of the different hazard-causing factors, the types of avalanches from February–April mainly included new full-layer avalanches, surface avalanches, and full-layer wet avalanches. (3) In the RAMMS-avalanche simulation test, considering the deposition effect, compared to the previous avalanche movement path, the secondary avalanche flow accumulation area impact range changes were slight, while the movement area within the avalanche path changes was large, as were the different categories of avalanches and their different movement characteristic values. Overall, wet snow avalanches are more hazardous, and the impact force is larger. The new snow avalanches start in a short period, the sliding rate is fast, and the avalanche sliding surface (full-snow surface and face-snow) of the difference is mainly manifested in the differences in the value of the flow height. © 2023 by the authors.",liu_studyavalanchetriggeringfactors_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Current Value Of Historical And Ongoing Surveillance For Disease Freedom: Surveillance For Bovine Johne's Disease In Western Australia,"Martin, P. A. J.",2008,"'Confidence' in freedom from disease is generally derived from multiple sources of varied surveillance information, and typically this surveillance evidence has been accumulated over time. In the state of Western Australia (WA) the main surveillance evidence supporting Free Zone status in the national bovine Johne's disease (BJD) program comprises periodic surveys and the ongoing clinical diagnostic system. This paper illustrates a simple approach to current valuation of historical surveillance information, based on the calculated sensitivity of the surveillance processes, the time elapsed since the data were accumulated, and the probability of new introduction of disease into the population during that elapsed time. Surveillance system components (SSCs) contributing to the overall sensitivity of the surveillance system were the clinical diagnostic system and periodic targeted surveys. Sensitivity of each component was estimated using a stochastic scenario tree model of the surveillance process as implemented. Probability of introduction of BJD into WA during each time period was estimated retrospectively from a stochastic import risk analysis model applied to actual cattle importation data. The probability that the WA cattle population was free from infection (at design prevalences of 0.2% of herds and 2% of animals within an infected herd) was estimated following each of 11 years, giving a median probability that the State was free of BJD (at these design prevalences) at the end of 2005 of 0.89.

‘My Own Slender Remarks’: Global Networks Of Slavery And Sociability In Mary Ann Parker’s Voyage To New South Wales (1795),"O’Loughlin, K.",2016,"The long history of Terra Australis describes a space sketched in lines of speculation, ambition and multiple desire. Even at the end of the eighteenth century – after Cook’s exemplary curiosity and minute mapping produced the fabled space of Terra Australis as a place of English settlement and incarceration – knowledge of the new continent of Australia remained provisional and speculative. As was the case in its earliest incarnations, the representation of Terra Australis responds to contemporary preoccupations and imaginative investments, in this case the intermeshing late eighteenth-century realities of slavery, anti-slavery, trade, transportation and colonialism. Mary Ann Parker’s account of Australia shortly after European settlement reveals a network of such influences at work in her encounters with the landscape and culture of the new settlement. The Voyage Around the World (1795) positions Port Jackson at its narrative centre, but Parker’s perception of New South Wales is shaped by a broader circulation of people, information and ideas through the Atlantic. Parker’s approach to the colonial project at New South Wales is formed through anterior networks of hospitality and commerce connecting trading communities and colonial settlements along global travel routes. These material networks provide powerful cultural and ideological models for the voyageuse: the mediating values of Parker’s text are the forms of politeness and global hospitality she enjoys in the West Indies and the Cape, complicated by the ethical dilemmas of enforced labour. © Anne M.

A Novel Modelling Approach To The Identification Of Optimum Sites For The Placement Of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (Otec) Power Plant: Application To The Tropical Island Climate Of Mauritius,"Doorga, Jay Rovisham Singh and Gooroochurn, Oomarsing and Motah, Beenesh Anand and Ramchandur, Vimal and Sunassee, Shane",2018,"The geographical location of Mauritius near the warm tropical waters of the Indian Ocean coupled to the vast exclusive economic zone approximating 2.3 million square kilometers, encourage the promotion of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems. Technological advancements have enabled offshore structures to pump the cold water lying at 1000m depth in the seawater column to the surface, and through the temperature difference set up with the warm surface layer, drives a turbine and generates electricity. In this study, a model has been developed to compute the temperature difference between the deep (1000m) and surface (20m) seawater layers around Mauritius. An algorithm has been implemented to determine the net power generated from a proposed OTEC power plant, acquired through the processing of sea surface temperature satellite images, at a resolution of 1 km. The spatial and temporal variations of the net power generated has been observed by splitting the annual data into four monsoonal time frames. Results show that the south-western region of Mauritius possesses high OTEC resources, with annual mean daily net power generation capacity of about 95MW, representing about 20\% of the peak power demand of the island. Moreover, the bathymetry of the southern region is propitious due to deep cold water availability at a proximity of less than 5km from the coastline. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the OTEC system are found to be 1.9 and 22.8\%, respectively.

In this study, taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example, we compared a traditional machine learning method (random forest, RF) and three deep learning (DL) models, including DNN (deep neural networks), 1D-CNN (1D convolutional neural networks), and LSTM (long short-term memory networks) to predict crop yields by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data. The results showed that all four models could capture winter wheat yield variations in all the county-years, with R-2 of recorded and simulated yields ranging from 0.83 to 0.90 and RMSE ranging from 561.18 to 959.62 kg/ha. They all performed well for winter wheat yield prediction at a county level from 2011 to 2015, with mean R-2 >= 0.85 and RMSE <= 768 kg/ha. At a field level, the spatial pattern of estimated winter wheat yield could capture the spatial heterogeneity and yield differences between individual fields across a county fairly well. However, only the DNN and RF models had relatively good performance at the field level, with mean R2 values of 0.71, 0.66 and RMSE values of 1127 kg/ha and 956 kg/ha, respectively.

"Using Deep Ensemble Forest For High-Resolution Mapping Of Pm2.5 From Modis Maiac Aod In Tehran, Iran","Bagheri, Hossein",2023,"High-resolution mapping of PM2.5 concentration over Tehran city is challenging because of the complicated behavior of numerous sources of pollution and the insufficient number of ground air quality monitoring stations. Alternatively, high-resolution satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data can be employed for high-resolution mapping of PM2.5. For this purpose, different data-driven methods have been used in the literature. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated their ability to estimate PM2.5 from AOD data. However, these methods have several weaknesses in solving the problem of estimating PM2.5 from satellite AOD data. In this paper, the potential of the deep ensemble forest method for estimating the PM2.5 concentration from AOD data was evaluated. The results showed that the deep ensemble forest method with R-2 = 0.74 gives a higher accuracy of PM2.5 estimation than deep learning methods ( R-2 = 0.67 ) as well as classic data-driven methods such as random forest ( R-2 = 0.68 ). Additionally, the estimated values of PM2.5 using the deep ensemble forest algorithm were used along with ground data to generate a high-resolution map of PM2.5. Evaluation of produced PM2.5 map revealed the good performance of the deep ensemble forest for modeling the variation of PM2.5 in the city of Tehran.",bagheri_deepensembleforestresolution_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Trends Of Greening And Browning In Terrestrial Vegetation In China From 2000 To 2020,"Yi, Kunpeng and Zhao, Xueming and Zheng, Zhaoju and Zhao, Dan and Zeng, Yuan",2023,"Terrestrial vegetation condition is altering generally as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activity during the past few decades. To reveal the impact of long-term climate factors and artificial protection on multiple vegetation types, it is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of vegetation greening and browning and the effect of national ecological restoration programs. In this study, we established a persistent vegetation change index (P-value) to characterize greening (restoration) and browning (degradation) in China in 2000-2020. Firstly, we generated annual time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from MODIS product by averaging the monthly maximum NDVI values for each year. Secondly, we calculated the Pvalue to investigate the continuous change in vegetation state by incremental time interval. Finally, patterns and trends of greening and browning in forests, shrublands, and grasslands were quantified and mapped at pixel and sample point levels. The findings of our study revealed that Chinese wild vegetated lands greened up by -3.4 x 104 km2 (25\%) and turned brown in -1.6 x 104 km2 (11\%) between 2000 and 2020. Net greening was detected in all biomes, most conspicuously in several ecological program regions in northern China. The NDVI time-series data in 31\% of field plots showed a consistent result, 11\% of field plots showed a browning trend, and 58\% of field plots showed a stable state. These results indicated a synergistic effect on forests, shrublands, and grasslands, but with regional variations attributed to differences in precipitation abundance, the implementation of positive ecological programs by the government and negative human activities. Additionally, these findings provide valuable insight into large-scale terrestrial vegetation transitions and have practical applications for decision-making and policy development in the assessment and restoration of ecosystems aimed at reducing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and conserving water resources in China.",yi_trendsgreeningbrowningterrestrial_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Testing The Utility Of The Blue Spectral Region In Burned Area Mapping: Insights From Savanna Wildfires,"Mpakairi, Kudzai Shaun and Kadzunge, Shamiso Lynnet and Ndaimani, Henry",2020,"Monitoring ecosystem events such as wildfires with remote sensing is fundamental to natural resources management. However, precisely delineating burned areas with remote sensing remains a challenge for post-fire ecological assessment. Burned area mapping methods with spectral indices are affected by several interferences such as soil background, water surfaces and atmospheric effects. In this study, we test the applicability of a normalized difference spectral index with the shortwave infrared and blue spectral bands in accurately mapping burned areas. The spectral index was tested in two study sites and compared to six spectral indices commonly used in burned area mapping. Random forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm, was used to classify the spectral indices and map burned areas. Although the True Skill Statistic (TSS) was relatively low, we found out that the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and Normalized Burned Index (NBI) performed better than all the other spectral indices considered in the two study sites. The Burned Area Index (BAI) was the third highest performing spectral index. OSAVI and NBI performed well in the study sites plausibly because they were adjusted for soil effects and the blue spectral band was included to account for atmospheric effects. Our results indicate the need to adjust spectral indices for soil, water and atmospheric effects when using them for burned area mapping. The study also adds rudimentary knowledge on the potential of the blue spectral band in monitoring burned area vegetation.",mpakairi_testingutilitybluespectral_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Role And Impact Of Urban Water Prices On The Management Of Groundwater Consumption Due To Covid-19 Outbreaks,"Mazyaki, Ali and Sajadifar, Seyedhossein and Bagheri, Mehrdad",2023,"The main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental role and impact of urban water prices, and hence its consumption in Tehran on its groundwater level drawdown. The issue gets vital in times of drought when the scarcity value of water exceeds benefits of groundwater environmental flow. Hence, the argument is that urban water tariffs may play a role in managing groundwater flow. In this regard, the harmful impact of urban water consumption on the environmental flow of groundwater resources is distinguished. Then the objective would be to identify determinants of urban water consumption. To do so, an urban water's demand function, including important key regressors such as price, income, temperature, and rainfall is estimated. Moreover, the role of Covid-19 in urban water consumption is highlighted. Results show a demand elasticity of -0.29 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 for urban water consumption, or that a 10 percent increase in average price results in a decline in urban water consumption of 1.9-3.9 percent. In addition, one percent lower urban water consumption causes 1.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 percent less groundwater extraction, or that response of a 10 percent decrease in the consumption could cause a decline in groundwater extraction of 12-14 percent. Last but not least, a 1 percent decrease in underground extraction for urban water raises 13.2 \& PLUSMN; 6.7 cm of GRACE water level after three months. The results show that groundwater exploitation for urban drinking water is a responsible contributor to the water level drawdown in Tehran. In addition, the significant elasticity of 0.29 shows that price mechanisms are useful to manage hydrological scarcity and the consequent disasters. Moreover, observing significant effects of covid-related determinants for calming down the upward trend of groundwater extraction, we alert for postcovid deterioration of subsidence areas due to regrowth of water consumption.",mazyaki_roleimpacturbanwater_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Deep Learning For Automatic Outlining Agricultural Parcels: Exploiting The Land Parcel Identification System,"Garcia-Pedrero, A. and Lillo-Saavedra, M. and Rodriguez-Esparragon, D. and Gonzalo-Martin, C.",2019,"Accurate and up-to-date information on the spatial and geographical characteristics of agricultural areas is an indispensable value for the various activities related to agriculture and research. Most agricultural studies and policies are carried out at the field level, for which precise boundaries are required. Today, high-resolution remote sensing images provide useful spatial information for plot delineation; however, manual processing is time-consuming and prone to human error. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of deep learning (DL) approach, in particular a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, for the automatic outlining of agricultural plot boundaries from orthophotos over large areas with a heterogeneous landscape. Since DL approaches require a large amount of labeled data to learn, we have exploited the open data from the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) from the Chartered Community of Navarre, Spain. The boundaries of the agricultural plots obtained from our methodology were compared with those obtained using a state-of-the-art methodology known as gPb-UCM (global probability of boundary followed by ultrametric contour map) through an error measurement called the boundary displacement error index (BDE). In BDE terms, the results obtained by our method outperform those obtained from the gPb-UCM method. In this regard, CNN models trained with LPIS data are a useful and powerful tool that would reduce intensive manual labor in outlining agricultural plots. © 2013 IEEE.",garciapedrero_deeplearningautomaticoutlining_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Fusion Of Lidar And Aerial Imagery To Map Wetlands And Channels Via Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"Xu, Haiqing and Toman, Elizabeth Myers and Zhao, Kaiguang and Baird, John",2022,"Wetlands and channels provide significant ecological and societal services. Mapping their locations and types at high resolution remains a challenge for scientific communities and regulatory agencies. In the U.S.A., the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) provides the best nationwide wetland maps, but the NWI for some locations has not been updated for up to four decades and includes omission errors. To address these problems, we developed a deep learning framework for identifying wetlands and channels from lidar point clouds and 1 m aerial images. Both deep learning and terrain analysis were applied to classify wetlands and identify channels. The deep learning classifier was a convolutional neural network that utilized both image color information and lidar-derived canopy height. When tested on a 94 km(2) Ohio watershed, the method achieved a classification accuracy of 85.6\%. Compared with the NWI maps, the results included 76\% more forested wetlands by area and 168\% more channels by length. It was also found that only leaf-off images were useful for detecting forested wetlands and typical commission errors (i.e., false positives) were attributed to tree shadows. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining lidar structural and aerial spectral information over the use of each alone and exemplifies the utility of deep learning as an effective means to leverage open-source data for high resolution mapping of wetlands.",xu_fusionlidaraerialimagery_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Diversification Of Land Surface Temperature Change Under Urban Landscape Renewal: A Case Study In The Main City Of Shenzhen, China","Liu, Yanxu and Peng, Jian and Wang, Yanglin",2017,"Unprecedented rapid urbanization in China during the past several decades has been accompanied by extensive urban landscape renewal, which has increased the urban thermal environmental risk. However, landscape change is a sufficient but not necessary condition for land surface temperature (LST) variation. Many studies have merely highlighted the correlation between landscape pattern and LST, while neglecting to comprehensively present the spatiotemporal diversification of LST change under urban landscape renewal. Taking the main city of Shenzhen as a case study area, this study tracked the landscape renewal and LST variation for the period 1987-2015 using 49 Landsat images. A decision tree algorithm suitable for fast landscape type interpretation was developed to map the landscape renewal. Analytical tools that identified hot-cold spots, the gravity center, and transect of LST movement were adopted to identify LST changes. The results showed that the spatial variation of LST was not completely consistent with landscape change. The transformation from Green landscape to Grey landscape usually increased the LST within a median of 0.2 degrees C, while the reverse transformation did not obviously decrease the LST (the median was nearly 0 degrees C). The median of LST change from Blue landscape to Grey landscape was 1.0 degrees C, corresponding to 0.5 degrees C in the reverse transformation. The imbalance of LST change between the loss and gain of Green or Blue landscape indicates the importance of protecting natural space, where the benefits in terms of temperature mitigation cannot be completely substituted by reverse transformation.",liu_diversificationlandsurfacetemperature_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Drought Impact Assessment Based On Principal Component Analysis And Copula Function,"Wang, P. and Feng, M. and Sun, H. and Li, L. and Zhang, S. and Jing, Y.",2016,"Drought is one of the most important agricultural disasters in the Guanzhong Plain, China. Assessing the influence of the droughts in the plain accurately can provide reference for drought mitigation and maintaining stable crop yields. Based on remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which was calculated at ten-day intervals for monitoring droughts in the years of 2008-2013 in the plain, the Copula function method was used to assess the effect of drought at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yields. The mutually independent principal factors were extracted from the VTCIs at the main growth stages of winter wheat by using principal component analysis (PCA), overcoming difficulty of parameter estimation for multivariate Copula, and then incorporated into the Copula function to establish a PCA-Copula method. The comprehensive values of VTCIs at the main growth stages were determined by the PCA-Copula method, and then linear regression model between the comprehensive VTCIs and wheat yields was established to assess the effect of drought on the yields. The results showed that the linear correlation coefficient between the wheat yields and comprehensive VTCIs was at the extremely significant level (P<0.001). Compared with the linear regression model based on the entropy value method, the determination coefficient of the model with the PCA-Copula method reached 0.49 from 0.39, which indicated that the fitting degree of the model was improved, and the root mean square error and average relative error between the estimated and measured yields reduced by 30.2 kg/hm2 and 0.66%, respectively. These results indicated that the PCA-Copula method was a better approach for accessing the impact of droughts at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yield. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

A Multiscalar Approach To Mapping Marginal Agricultural Land: Smallholder Agriculture In Malawi,"Peter, Brad G. and Messina, Joseph P. and Snapp, Sieglinde S.",2018,"Marginal agricultural lands are defined here by suboptimal biophysical conditions and historically variable or low agricultural production. We characterize these areas using remotely sensed information to disentangle the biophysical and possible social factors driving marginality. Considering both the modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy problem, the heuristic we propose is generalizable across geographies and scales and provides information at multiple decision-making levels through a multiscalar interannual variability model. We present results from our study of Malawi, where the landscape is densely cultivated and smallholder farmers frequently occupy marginal lands, to illustrate the potential of a multiscalar analysis in a place where food insecurity alleviation is needed and where remote sensing can provide necessary information. Our framework for identifying marginal agricultural lands consists of (1) locating long-term agricultural land, (2) measuring interannual productivity of long-term farmed locations, and (3) assessing marginal biophysical land characteristics and the fundamental climate niche for the dominant crop (in this case maize). Productivity and marginality in Malawi are spatially organized, and an assessment of productivity at multiple scales highlights the importance of presenting both global and local spatiotemporal variability for managing agroecological variance. By disaggregating broad classes of historically marginal production and the underlying drivers of marginality, different intervention efforts can intelligently target areas most likely to receive maximum benefit. These methodologies can be applied by both policymakers and scholars to identify and target marginal agricultural areas for improved productivity and for the support of smallholder farmer livelihoods.",peter_multiscalarapproachmappingmarginal_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Adaptive Estimation Of Aircraft Flight Parameters For Engine Health Monitoring System,"Yang, L. F. and Ioachim, I. and Yang, L.

Biologically Important Areas Ii For Cetaceans Within Us And Adjacent Waters - Aleutian Islands And Bering Sea Region,"Brower, Amelia and Ferguson, Megan and Clarke, Janet and Fujioka, Ei and DeLand, Sarah",2022,"We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for cetaceans in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region. BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the known ranges of small and resident populations. This effort, the second led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA's BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for BIA II came from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification data; whaling data, including stomach and fecal contents; prey studies; and genetics. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, the BIA II products incorporate a scoring and labeling system, which will improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans. In the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region, a total of 19 BIAs were identified, delineated, and scored for seven species, including bowhead, North Pacific right, gray, humpback, fin, and sperm whales, and belugas. These include one hierarchical BIA for belugas that consists of one localized ""child"" BIA within an overarching ""parent"" BIA. There were 15 feeding, 3 migratory, and 1 small and resident population BIAs; no reproductive BIAs were identified.

Field Spectroscopy For Weed Detection In Wheat And Chickpea Fields,"Shapira, Uri and Herrmann, Ittai and Karnieli, Arnon and Bonfil, David J.",2013,"Weed control is commonly performed by applying selective herbicides homogeneously over entire agricultural fields. However, applying herbicide only where needed could have economical and environmental benefits. The objective of this study was to apply remote sensing to the detection of grasses and broadleaf weeds among cereal and broadleaf crops. Spectral relative reflectance values at both leaf and canopy scales were obtained by field spectroscopy for four plant categories: wheat, chickpea, grass weeds, and broadleaf weeds. Total reflectance spectra of leaf tissues for botanical genera were successfully classified by general discriminant analysis (GDA). The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for specific narrow bands was 95 +/- 4.19\% for wheat and 94 +/- 5.13\% for chickpea. The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for future Vegetation and Environmental Monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VENS) bands was 77 +/- 8.09\% for wheat and 88 +/- 6.94\% for chickpea, and for the operative satellite Advanced Land Imager (ALI) bands was 78 +/- 7.97\% for wheat and 82 +/- 8.22\% for chickpea. Within the critical period for weed control, an overall classification accuracy of 87 +/- 5.57\% was achieved for >5\% vegetation coverage in a wheat field, thereby providing potential for implementation of herbicide applications.

Successful natural regeneration of mangroves after disturbance depends on the dispersal, establishment, early growth and survival of propagules. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Peninsular Malaysia, we investigated how the location of a mangrove forest patch might influence the early regeneration of mangroves after clear-felling events that regularly take place on an approximately 30-year rotation as part of local management. We used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) annual time series from 1988 to 2015 to indicate the recovery of canopy cover during early regeneration, which was determined as the average time (in years) for the NDMI to recover to values associated with the mature forests prior to their clear felling. We found that clear-felled mangrove patches closer to water and/or to already established patches of Rhizophora regenerated more rapidly than those farther away. In contrast, patches located closer to dryland forests regenerated slower compared to patches that were farther away. The study concludes that knowledge of the distribution of water, hydro-period and vegetation communities across the landscape can indicate the likely regeneration of mangrove forests through natural processes and identify areas where active planting is needed. Furthermore, time-series comparisons of the NDMI during the early years of regeneration can assist monitoring of mangrove establishment and regeneration, inform on the success of replanting, and facilitate higher productivity within the MMFR. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",otero_spatialanalysismangroveregeneration_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Mechanisms Of Group-Hunting In Vertebrates,"Hansen, Matthew J. and Domenici, Paolo and Bartashevich, Palina and Burns, Alicia and Krause, Jens",2023,"Group-hunting is ubiquitous across animal taxa and has received considerable attention in the context of its functions. By contrast much less is known about the mechanisms by which grouping predators hunt their prey. This is primarily due to a lack of experimental manipulation alongside logistical difficulties quantifying the behaviour of multiple predators at high spatiotemporal resolution as they search, select, and capture wild prey. However, the use of new remote-sensing technologies and a broadening of the focal taxa beyond apex predators provides researchers with a great opportunity to discern accurately how multiple predators hunt together and not just whether doing so provides hunters with a per capita benefit. We incorporate many ideas from collective behaviour and locomotion throughout this review to make testable predictions for future researchers and pay particular attention to the role that computer simulation can play in a feedback loop with empirical data collection. Our review of the literature showed that the breadth of predator:prey size ratios among the taxa that can be considered to hunt as a group is very large (10(2)). We therefore synthesised the literature with respect to these predator:prey ratios and found that they promoted different hunting mechanisms. Additionally, these different hunting mechanisms are also related to particular stages of the hunt (search, selection, capture) and thus we structure our review in accordance with these two factors (stage of the hunt and predator:prey size ratio). We identify several novel group-hunting mechanisms which are largely untested, particularly under field conditions, and we also highlight a range of potential study organisms that are amenable to experimental testing of these mechanisms in connection with tracking technology. We believe that a combination of new hypotheses, study systems and methodological approaches should help push the field of group-hunting in new directions.",hansen_mechanismshuntingvertebrates_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Specifically, we analysed and extended the current understanding of the topic by focusing on the concepts of technology adoption and well-being. The data were sourced from 30 papers that were selected based on specific criteria from the WoS and Scopus databases. They were acquired through a systematic search and quality appraisal process. The adopted technology can be grouped into sustainable agricultural practices and innovations, digital agriculture and information technology, precision farming and resource management, financial inclusion and agricultural transactions, remote sensing and satellite technology, and agricultural programs and initiatives. Most papers indicated that technology adoption improved farmers' well-being which was basically measured using productivity and income. The measure however lacked farmers' value judgments, such as happiness. Agricultural technology could have a mixed effect on farmers' well-being, depending on the type of technology adopted and the compatibility of farmers with technology in their agricultural practices. This study will assist researchers in developing an appropriate framework and strategy to improve farmers' welfare, which can alleviate poverty. These may further help policymakers identify the best technological innovations that can improve farmers' economic and social welfare, thereby facilitating the development of plans to meet farmers’ needs and interests.

"Constraints Of Grassland Science, Pastoral Management And Policy In Northern China: Anthropological Perspectives On Degradational Narratives","Taylor, J.",2012,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the implications of policies, practices and new “non-equilibrium” management approaches in mobile grassland management. Design/methodology/approach – The author takes an actor-oriented perspective on the narrative of land-use practices, notional sustainable stocking rates and the problematic of state policy interventions in local context. The paper is based on two years in the field on a bilateral aid-funded grassland management project at Xing'an League, Inner Mongolia and follow-up among selected informants. Findings – The constitution of grasslands “degradation” is in fact contested by resource users. Most grassland scientists, Party and Government officials in China have tended to associate ethnic “minority” mobile pastoralists with destructive cultural practices that, they argue, have led to ecological decline on the steppes. This argument is integral to the “degradation narrative” that underpins the discourse on grassland science. The conventional bio-ecology emphasis on species dominance (growth-form), in fact says little about the extent of anthropogenic impacts on above-ground biomass and whether these factors have been the cause of degradation. The paper suggests that greater consideration is given to specific changes in human activity, climatic and plant productivity over time and space, based on endogenous, flexible seasonal estimates. Research limitations/implications – Although presenting challenges to conventional grassland science based on endogenous experiences and herder practices, it may have specific geopolitical limits to more general scaling-up in different contexts. Practical implications – The paper discusses new modalities of non-equilibrium grassland management, inverting normative top-down approaches to controlling environmental degradation, livestock distribution and stocking rates. Social implications – The paper suggests rethinking the use of customary practices, vernacular knowledge and the social organisation of herders in the design of sustainable grassland management. Originality/value – The paper may be valuable to practitioners, rural development planners, funders and researchers interested in the use of integrated, cross-disciplinary, new ecological knowledge in grassland management. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",taylor_constraintsgrasslandsciencepastoral_2012,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Periods of long-term water deficit observed in GRACE TWS products for the region are found to coincide with periods of meteorological drought. Multiple linear regression is employed to generate seasonal forecasting models for each region. We find that the skill of the resulting models varies from region to region, withR(2)from 0.33 to 0.73 and correlation from 0.27 to 0.77 between predicted and observed values (using leave-one-out cross-validation).

Tidal Location Method,"Hunter, E and Aldridge, JN and Metcalfe, JD and Arnold, GP",2003,"Demersal fish cannot readily be tracked using satellite-based or light-based geolocation techniques. As an alternative, we describe the tidal location method, which uses tidal data recorded by electronic data storage tags (DSTs), to determine geoposition. Times of high water (H) and tidal ranges (R) recorded by DSTs moored at known locations, and from free-swimming tagged plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, were compared with a North Sea tidal database to identify all positions with matching values of H and R. Within the recording precision of the tag (+/-0.2 m, +/-10 min) and the predicted accuracy of the model generated tidal data (+/-0.15 m, +/-20 min), geolocations over much of the North Sea and eastern English Channel were predicted to be accurate to within 40 kin, sometimes to within 10 km. Positional estimates of the moored tags were within 15.7+/-3.5 km of the actual locations. Geolocations made from tagged plaice within 5 days of release and 5 days pre-recapture were within 35+/-24 km and 37+/-23 km of release and recapture positions respectively. Our results demonstrate the ability of this method to accurately describe the migrations of North Sea plaice throughout their geographical range with a level of accuracy unattainable using light-based geolocation. The method could equally be applied to any shelf-dwelling demersal fish that periodically rests on the sea-bed for the duration of a tidal cycle.

In order to objectively evaluate the EEQ of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) and explore the impact of the urbanization process on it, this paper is based on the Modified Remote Sensing Ecological Index (MRSEI) and the Comprehensive Night Light Index (CNLI), respectively, and conducts a quantitative assessment of the YRDUA in China from 2000 to 2020. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the MRSEI of the YRDUA first decreased and then increased, and the ecological environment quality degraded first and then improved; however, there were significant differences between regions. The ecological environment quality in the south is obviously better than that in the north, and the ecological environment quality in the north changes more drastically, and the low value area of MRSEI will gradually move downstream as time changes; (2) During the study period, the YRDUA formed a hierarchical and progressive urbanization pattern. The inland urbanization process expanded from east to west along the Yangtze River, and the urbanization process of coastal cities expanded from Shanghai as the center to the north and south with high-intensity urbanization cities concentrated in Shanghai and its surrounding cities and low-intensity urbanization cities distributed in the western part of the urban agglomeration; (3) The Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) between urbanization and EEQ in the YRDUA has continuously improved with an increase of 28.57\% in the past 21 years, and the number of cities with high level coupling continues to rise, while the number of medium level coupling cities and low level coupling cities has declined.

The mono-window algorithm has been applied in retrieving the LST. Results show that LST builds a positive relation with NDBI, NDBaI, and NDWI and a negative relation with NDVI and NMDI. These relationships are stronger in the area below mean LST (low LST zones) and weaker in the area above mean LST (high LST zones). It indicates that the values of LST are largely influenced by the different land surfaces, like vegetation, water, soil, and built-up area.",guha_studyrelationshiplandsurface_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Retrieval Of Forest Stand Age From Sar Image Texture For Varying Distance And Orientation Values Of The Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix,"Champion, Isabelle and Germain, Christian and Da Costa, Jean Pierre and Alborini, Arnaud and Dubois-Fernandez, Pascale",2014,"Data on forest variables (e. g., biomass, trunk height, density) are necessary for environmental and forest management applications. It has been shown that texture can be used instead of the usual sigma(0)/age relationships at P-band to retrieve plantation forest parameters, but the analysis of sigma(0) spatial characteristics has not been fully explored. The aim of this letter is to investigate the relationships between stand age (which is correlated to forest variables) and texture descriptors calculated from statistics generated by the gray-level co-occurrence matrix for varying distance d, and orientation alpha, values used to calculate the matrix. Synthetic aperture radar images are P-band airborne data acquired by the ONERA RAMSES instrument over a controlled homogeneous test site located in the Landes region, France. It is found that texture descriptors contrast, inverse difference moment, homogeneity, and correlation are strongly influenced by the parameters (d, alpha) related to forest stand structure (forest rows, stand density) and image resolution. In contrast, energy and entropy are observed to be highly correlated to stand age and displayed a stable performance whatever the distance and orientation parameters (d, alpha), thus rendering them a good contender as an alternative to the usual sigma(0) based relationships applied to this type of forest.",champion_retrievalforeststandage_2014,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Research Progress On Trade-Offs And Synergies Of Ecosystem Services: An Overview,"Li, P. and Jiang, L. and Feng, Z. and Yu, X.",2012,"Being the core of ecosystem assessment, studies on ecosystem services have been becoming a focus in the field of ecology. The formation and provisioning capacity of ecosystem services are tremendously affected by human activities. Conversely, the magnitudes of ecosystem service changes also influence the preferences of human being's daily decision- making. Investigation into the dynamics of the trade-offs and synergistic relationships of regional ecosystem services will shed light on interactions and feedbacks between ecosystem services and the stakeholders at different spatial and temporal scales, and avoid double-counting issue in ecosystem services assessment. In addition, information and progress on trade- offs and synergies in the delivery of ecosystem services will provide scientific basis for designing and implementing eco- compensation schemes and optimize the management behavior of ecosystem services, and finally improve human well-being associated with trade-offs and synergies among different ecosystem services. It is revealed from this review that in the last decades, the valuation of ecosystem services has been received lots of attentions in the decision-making and scientific research communities. However, the double-counting issue during the valuation process usually leads to insufficient or biased guidance in the management of ecosystem services. Since ecosystem service is benefit that human receives from the natural ecosystems, the stakeholders' demand for ecosystem services from different spatial and temporal scales often causes competitions and conflicts among ecosystem's various goods and services. The interactions between human being and ecosystem services often give rise to trade-offs and synergies which in turn directly affect human welfare. With regard to the terminologies, trade-offs between ecosystem services refers to the enhancement of one ecosystem service locally in a short term is at the cost of other ecosystem services locally or at a large spatial scale (e. g., globally) in the future. It can be simplified as the ""win-lose"" mode. The term synergies means the synchronous changes between two or among many different ecosystem services, including the ""win-win"" mode and the ""lose-lose"" mode. The trade-offs and synergistic relationships exist not only within different categories of provisioning services, but also among different ecosystem services and like provision services, regulation services, cultural services, and supporting services. Findings from about 12 literatures has shown specific examples of such kind of trade-offs and synergistic relations, for instance, among provisioning services, between regulating services and cultural services, between provisioning services and supporting services, among regulating services, and between provisioning services and regulating services. The spatial scale of trade-offs and synergies contain various scales, for instance, from ecological scale to institutional scale. The temporal scale could be short-term to long-term based. This paper indicates that so far, trade-offs and synergies analysis of ecosystem services is still at its early stage. However, we identified and summarized two research approaches which have already been commonly used for the analysis of ecosystem services' trade-offs: (1) the Integrated Ecological-Economic Model: it is a traditional approach which is often used to quantify trade-offs. The Model consists of several ecological and economic models. The ecological models are mostly used to analyze the magnitudes of the changes of ecosystem services, while the economic models to evaluate the impacts of the change on human welfare. Since land use and land cover change serves as a direct driving factor of the ecosystem services' trade-offs and synergies, it will become even more extensive due to intensification of interactions between the two in the future. (2) Scenarios Analysis based on Landuse is attracting more and more attention in scientific literature. Remote sensing data and management policies of ecosystem services provd strong data basis for the scenarios formulation and analysis. It could provide more objective and spatially-explicit information on the trade-offs and synergies for optimizing ecosystem services management.",li_researchprogresstradeoffs_2012,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"The Temporal Variation Of Sediment Connectivity From 1982 To 2020 In The Wei River Basin, China","Liao, Heng and He, Yi",2023,"Sediment connectivity is a valuable metric that characterizes the relationship between sediment transport from the source to the sink, and the ease of sediment erosion. Over the past four decades, changes in land use types and vegetation cover have significantly altered sediment dynamics in the Wei River basin. In this study, we used the index of connectivity (IC) to assess the temporal changes in sediment connectivity at a watershed scale. We employed Landsat images to analyse the relationship between changes in vegetation cover or land use type and sediment connectivity. We used factor detector and interaction detector in Geodetector to analyse the importance and impact of vegetation and slope on IC changes. We assessed the correlation of sediment yield and connectivity to validate our results and it shows that IC has strong or moderate positive correlation with sediment yield from eight out of nine stations in the Wei River Basin. Our findings demonstrate that soil and water conservation measures, as well as the grain for green project, have led to the transformation of cropland and grassland into woodland. This change is reflected in the decrease of the maximum IC value from 6.24 to 5.72 in the Beiluo sub-basin, indicating a decreasing trend in sediment connectivity. Although the maximum IC value increased from 5.76 to 5.08 in the Jing sub-basin, driven by human activity, showing an increasing trend. Furthermore, the IC value decreased in the western part of the Wei sub-basin. Overall, sediment connectivity exhibits a weak decreasing trend in most regions of the Wei River basin, while it shows an increasing trend slightly in the Jing sub-basin. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.47 to 0.86, with sediment yield being moderately or strongly correlated with IC. Our study identified vegetation, human activity, and slope as the main influencing factors of IC. The results of factor detector showed that the q value of vegetation was 0.63 and the slope was 0.1, Vegetation played a major role in the change of IC. The results of interaction detector showed that interaction between vegetation and slope was greater than the single factor. The temporal variability of sediment connectivity in the basin provides valuable insights for sediment transport management. Our research highlights the importance of studying sediment connectivity and offers proposals for measures that can be taken to address sediment transport challenges in the Wei River basin.

"Long-Time Series Ecological Environment Quality Monitoring And Cause Analysis In The Dianchi Lake Basin, China","Yang, H. and Yu, J. and Xu, W. and Wu, Y. and Lei, X. and Ye, J. and Geng, J. and Ding, Z.",2023,"As the core area in the transformation of Kunming into an international center city, studying the changes in ecological environment quality and causes of the Dianchi Lake Basin is of great significance for its future optimization of the landscape pattern. This study is based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to calculate the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) of the Dianchi Lake Basin from 1990 to 2020. Then we used Mann-Kendall mutation detection to obtain the time points when significant changes in RSEI occurred. Finally, the Geodetector and MGWR models were combined to analyse the driving factors of ecological quality changes in the Dianchi Lake Basin. The results show that: (1) The ecological environment quality of the Dianchi Lake Basin showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2020, with the mean value of RSEI increasing from 0.49 to 0.52. (2) According to the results of the mutation test, the years 1990, 1993, 2006, 2015, and 2020 were used as the time points for monitoring the ecological environment quality of the Dianchi Lake Basin over a long time series. The ecological environment quality of the study area in the past 30 years was mainly in an improved state, accounting for 49.43%. The ecological deterioration areas are mainly located in the northeastern part of Xishan District (north of Caohai Lake), the southwestern part of Guandu District, Kunyang Town in Jining District, and the northern areas of Jincheng and Shangsuan Town. (3) The single factor detection results show that elevation and slope have the strongest influence on RSEI. The q-value of average annual temperature has changed the most, from the 6th to the 3rd place. This indicates that the urban heat island effect and the expansion of construction land have had a greater impact on the quality of the local ecological environment in recent years. The multi-factor interaction test shows that the influence of each factor on RSEI is enhanced after the interaction. (4) The MGWR regression results show that the actual scales of action of the factors are inconsistent, with the most significant spatial heterogeneity in the Percentage of cropland area. Based on the above findings, it can provide data to support the future urban planning of the Dianchi Lake Basin. It also provides a new means of integrating Geodetector and MGWR into the study of ecological quality analysis. © 2023 The Authors",yang_timeseriesecologicalenvironment_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Multi-Temporal Trend Analysis Of Coastal Vegetation Using Metrics Derived From Hyperspectral And Lidar Data,"Suir, Glenn M. and Jackson, Sam and Saltus, Christina and Reif, Molly",2023,"Monitoring and modeling of coastal vegetation and wetland systems are considered major challenges, especially when considering environmental response to hazards, disturbances, and management activities. Remote sensing applications can provide alternatives and complementary approaches to the often costly and laborious field-based collection methods traditionally used for coastal ecosystem monitoring. New and improved sensors and data analysis techniques have become available, making remote sensing applications attractive for evaluation and potential use in monitoring coastal vegetation properties and ecosystem conditions and change. This study involves the extraction of vegetation metrics from airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to quantify coastal dune vegetation characteristics and assesses landscape-level trends from those derived metrics. HSI- and LiDAR-derived elevation (digital elevation model) and vegetation metrics (canopy height model, leaf area index, and normalized difference vegetation index) were used in conjunction with per-pixel linear regression and hot spot analyses to evaluate hurricane-induced spatial and temporal changes in elevation and vegetation properties. These assessments showed areas with greatest decreases in vegetation metric values were associated with direct tropical storm energies and processes (i.e., overwashing events eroding beach and dune features), while those with the greatest increases in vegetation metric values were in areas where overwashed sediments were distributed. This study narrows existing gaps in dune vegetation data by advancing new methodologies to classify, quantify, and estimate critical coastal vegetation metrics. The tools and methods developed in this study will ultimately improve future estimates and predictions of nearshore dynamics and impacts from disturbance events.",suir_multitemporaltrendanalysis_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
The Irrigation Cooling Effect As A Climate Regulation Service Of Agroecosystems,"Antonio Albaladejo-Garcia, Jose and Alcon, Francisco and Miguel Martinez-Paz, Jose",2020,"Agroecosystems provide a range of benefits to society and the economy, which we call ecosystem services (ES). These services can be evaluated on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The irrigation cooling effect (ICE), given its influence on the land surface temperature (LST), is an indicator of climate regulation services from agroecosystems. In this context, the objective of this study is to quantify the ICE in agroecosystems at the local scale. The agroecosystem of citrus cultivation in Campo de Cartagena (Murcia, Spain) is used as a case study. Once the LST was retrieved by remote sensing images for 216 plots, multivariate regression methods were used to identify the factors that explain ICE. The use of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is proposed, instead of ordinary least squares, as it offsets the spatial dependence and gives a better fit. The GWR explains 78\% of the variability in the LST, by means of three variables: the vegetation index, the water index of the crop, and the altitude. Thus, the effects of the change in land use on the LST due to restrictions on the availability of water (up to 1.22 degrees C higher for rain-fed crops) are estimated. The trade-offs between ICE and the other ES are investigated by using the irrigation water required to reduce the temperature. This work shows the magnitude of the climate regulation service generated by irrigated citrus and enables its quantification in agroecosystems with similar characteristics.",antonioalbaladejogarcia_irrigationcoolingeffectclimate_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Monthly and seasonal runoff show that June, July and August have higher runoff values. The high values for these three months correspond to the rainy season in these regions. Trends of the runoff and precipitation are detected using Mann-Kendall test. Apart of the coastal zones where trends are positive, trends in runoff are mostly negative throughout the Western and Central African regions.

Small Range And Distinct Distribution In A Satellite Breeding Colony Of The Critically Endangered Waved Albatross,"Awkerman, Jill A. and Cruz, Sebastian and Proano, Carolina and Huyvaert, Kathryn P. and Jimenez Uzcategui, Gustavo and Baquero, Andres and Wikelski, Martin and Anderson, David J.",2014,"To determine the proximate consequences of the limited breeding distribution of the critically endangered Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata), we present continuous breeding season GPS tracks highlighting differences in behaviour, destinations, and distances travelled between three distinct colonies: two in Galapagos and one closer to the South American continent on Isla de la Plata, where a small number of pairs nest. Accelerometer data paired with GPS locations allowed operational classifications of Waved Albatross behaviour. All birds from Galapagos travelled eastward to the continental shelf and foraged southward along the Peruvian coast. Birds from Isla de la Plata made more and shorter foraging trips and used habitat north of the destinations of Galapagos birds. La Plata birds foraged in areas through which Galapagos birds commuted, and had slower average flight speeds and shorter commutes. Overall, albatrosses from La Plata might operate under a consistently lower return but they also incur lower costs compared to birds from Galapagos, which take fewer trips involving longer time investment. Galapagos birds may be able to forage more effectively based on more abundant or more profitable food patches in those highly productive areas. Foraging destinations of birds from the two Galapagos colonies were similar and overlapped areas that presented localized mortality risk from artisanal fisheries in previous years. This study, performed across the species' breeding range, reveals the different foraging distribution of La Plata albatrosses and the potential conservation value of this small colony in terms of maintenance of spatial diversity and behavioural plasticity.",awkerman_rangedistinctdistributionsatellite_2014,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Mining Subsidence Monitoring Using Distributed Scatterers Insar Based On Goldstein Filter And Fisher Information Matrix-Weighted Optimization,"Tian, Zeming and Zhao, Lifeng and Fan, Hongdong and Lin, Tao and Li, Tao",2024,"Due to the shortcomings of traditional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technologies in mining subsidence monitoring, such as a low density of monitoring points and difficulty obtaining fine surface deformation information, this paper proposes a mining area surface deformation monitoring method based on distributed scatterers InSAR while improving the phase information optimization strategy. This method obtains homogeneous points using the hypothesis test of confidence interval algorithm and constructs an adaptive phase optimization method based on the Goldstein principal phase filtering and Fisher information matrix weighting. It effectively preserves the information of deformation fringes, particularly in regions with dense interferometric fringes, and obtains detailed deformation information from the study area through time processing. In the experiments, 63 Sentinel-1 images were used to extract surface subsidence information for the Peibei mining area from September 24, 2018, to November 12, 2020. Compared with the Permanent Scatterers InSAR (PS-InSAR) results, the point density increased by a factor of 4.2. The correlation coefficient between the homonymous points obtained with the two methods and the deformation rate is 0.94, indicating that they have a good consistency. The monitoring results show that the six mining areas in Peibei have different degrees of subsidence during the monitoring period with a clear nonlinear trend, and the maximum cumulative subsidence over time exceeds 350 mm. The analysis shows that the improved DS-InSAR monitoring results are in line with the general law of mining subsidence and have practical application value.",tian_miningsubsidencemonitoringdistributed_2024,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Spatial And Temporal Variation Of Net Carbon Sink Function Of Farmland In Aksu Oasis In The Past 17 Years,"Li, Y. and Hao, X. and Zhang, J. and Fan, X. and Zhao, Z.",2022,"Studying the spatial and temporal variations of the net carbon sink function of oasis farmland is important for its management and sustainable development. The net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland was estimated on the basis of remote sensing, meteorological data and agricultural inputs, and other related statistics from 2001 to 2017. The following results are presented. (1) In the past 17 years, the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of oasis farmland in Aksu showed an increasing trend yearly, with an average annual growth rate of 7.43%. Among which, the area of oasis farmland with a significant increasing trend of NEP was 1.44 × 104 km2, accounting for 97.7% of its total area, which is mainly distributed in various counties and cities. The area with a significant decreasing trend was 339 km2, accounting for 2.3% of the total area, mainly in the oasis areas of Wensu, Awati, Aksu, and Kuche counties. (2) Carbon emissions from agricultural production inputs increased from 39.94 × 104 t in 2001 to 106.73 × 104 t in 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25.14% and high and low distribution patterns in the Southeast and Northwest, respectively, considering spatial distribution. The largest proportions of agricultural production input pathways are fertilizer and agricultural machinery at 28% and 26%, respectively. (3) From 2001 to 2017, the net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland showed a fluctuating upward trend, spatially demonstrating a gradual increase from Northwest to Southeast, with high values mainly distributed in the southwestern part of Wensu county, the western part of Aksu City, the entire territory of Alar City, and the eastern part of Xinhe County. Overall, Aksu oasis farmland has a high net carbon sink capacity. However, regional differences are found in the net carbon sinks of oasis farmland among counties and cities. Thus, the net carbon sink capacity of oasis farmland should be improved by optimizing the agricultural industry structure and enhancing farming measures. © 2022 Editorial office of Arid Zone Research.

Digital Communications And Information Systems,"Oughton, E. J. and Tran, M. and Jones, C. B. and Ebrahimy, R.",2016,"Introduction: Digital communications and information systems infrastructure is comprised of a variety of communication and computation systems which provide the transmission, processing and storage of digital information. This includes: (i) legacy and fibre-optic cable networks; (ii) mobile, satellite and wireless networks; and (iii) data storage and processing centres. The acronym ICT is often used to describe these systems, though in other contexts ICT can refer to a much broader class of information and communications technologies. Here we use the shorthand ICT to refer to digital communications and information infrastructure systems. In comparison to other physical infrastructure sectors, ICT is relatively new and very rapidly evolving, so is less completely understood from a system-of-systems perspective. ICT infrastructure has become increasingly embedded in nearly all economic and social activities, including for operation of other infrastructure networks. Because of the complexity and rapid innovation in ICT systems, their future is highly uncertain and analysing the systems’ prospective direction is challenging. Yet, issues surrounding digital connectivity are high on the global policy agenda. In many advanced economies in Europe, North America and beyond, significant increases in ICT capacity have been delivered by inducing competition within industry combined with a light-touch, market-led regulatory approach. Innovation has provided new technologies and has helped serve growing consumer demand, which is itself largely driven by innovations in consumer technologies and business practices. Globally, the telecommunications sector has increased dramatically over the past decade to serve almost three billion Internet users, amounting to over 40% of the world's population (ITU, 2014a). Investment in competitive markets by network operators is underpinned by analysis comparing prospective revenues with investment costs (Tselekounis and Varoutas, 2013) so is determined by population density, topology and the capital cost of new technologies (Gotz, 2013). Population density is an important factor in serving local telecommunication markets because, like other infrastructure systems, large fixed-capital investments need to be spread over many consumers with the purchasing power to acquire service subscriptions. However, if left to its own devices the market would likely be considered to be socially unjust and not provide all the potential welfare benefits, as the majority of investment would likely flow into pockets of dense, wealthy and well-educated urban areas. This would particularly leave remote rural or other uneconomically viable locations at a severe disadvantage. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",oughton_digitalcommunicationsinformationsystems_2016,FALSE,class_round1,NA

A.",2022,"Background: Intravenous thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombectomy are proven emergency treatments for acute ischaemic stroke, but they require rapid delivery to selected patients within specialist services. National audit data have shown that treatment provision is suboptimal. Objectives: The aims were to (1) determine the content, clinical effectiveness and day 90 cost-effectiveness of an enhanced paramedic assessment designed to facilitate thrombolysis delivery in hospital and (2) model thrombectomy service configuration options with optimal activity and cost-effectiveness informed by expert and public views. Design: A mixed-methods approach was employed between 2014 and 2019. Systematic reviews examined enhanced paramedic roles and thrombectomy effectiveness. Professional and service user groups developed a thrombolysis-focused Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment, which was evaluated in a pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial and parallel process evaluation. Clinicians, patients, carers and the public were surveyed regarding thrombectomy service configuration. A decision tree was constructed from published data to estimate thrombectomy eligibility of the UK stroke population. A matching discrete-event simulation predicted patient benefits and financial consequences from increasing the number of centres. Setting: The paramedic assessment trial was hosted by three regional ambulance services (in north-east England, north-west England and Wales) serving 15 hospitals. Participants: A total of 103 health-care representatives and 20 public representatives assisted in the development of the paramedic assessment. The trial enrolled 1214 stroke patients within 4 hours of symptom onset. Thrombectomy service provision was informed by a Delphi exercise with 64 stroke specialists and neuroradiologists, and surveys of 147 patients and 105 public respondents. Interventions: The paramedic assessment comprised additional pre-hospital information collection, structured hospital handover, practical assistance up to 15 minutes post handover, a pre-departure care checklist and clinician feedback. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes included day 90 health (poor status was a modified Rankin Scale score of > 2). Economic outputs reported the number of cases treated and cost-effectiveness using quality-adjusted life-years and Great British pounds. Data sources: National registry data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme and the Scottish Stroke Care Audit were used. Review methods: Systematic searches of electronic bibliographies were used to identify relevant literature. Study inclusion and data extraction processes were described using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: The paramedic assessment trial found a clinically important but statistically non-significant reduction in thrombolysis among intervention patients, compared with standard care patients [197/500 (39.4%) vs. 319/714 (44.7%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.08; p = 0.15). The rate of poor health outcomes was not significantly different, but was lower in the intervention group than in the standard care group [313/489 (64.0%) vs. 461/690 (66.8%), respectively] (adjusted odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.2; p = 0.39). There was no difference in the quality-adjusted life-years gained between the groups (0.005, 95% confidence interval –0.004 to 0.015), but total costs were significantly lower for patients in the intervention group than for those in the standard care group (–£1086, 95% confidence interval –£2236 to –£13). It has been estimated that, in the UK, 10,140–11,530 patients per year (i.e. 12% of stroke admissions) are eligible for thrombectomy. Meta-analysis of published data confirmed that thrombectomy-treated patients were significantly more likely to be functionally independent than patients receiving standard care (odd ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.88 to 3.04; n = 1841). Expert consensus and most public survey respondents favoured selective secondary transfer for accessing thrombectomy at regional neuroscience centres. The discrete-event simulation model suggested that six new English centres might generate 190 quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval –6 to 399 quality-adjusted life-years) and a saving of £1,864,000 per year (95% confidence interval –£1,204,000 to £5,017,000 saving per year). The total mean thrombectomy cost up to 72 hours was £12,440, mostly attributable to the consumables. There was no significant cost difference between direct admission and secondary transfer (mean difference –£368, 95% confidence interval –£1016 to £279; p = 0.26). Limitations: Evidence for paramedic assessment fidelity was limited and group allocation could not be masked. Thrombectomy surveys represented respondent views only. Simulation models assumed that populations were consistent with published meta-analyses, included limited parameters reflecting underlying data sets and did not consider the capital costs of setting up new services. Conclusions: Paramedic assessment did not increase the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis, but outcomes were consistent with improved cost-effectiveness at day 90, possibly reflecting better informed treatment decisions and/or adherence to clinical guidelines. However, the health difference was non-significant, small and short term. Approximately 12% of stroke patients are suitable for thrombectomy and widespread provision is likely to generate health and resource gains. Clinician and public views support secondary transfer to access treatment. © 2022, NIHR Journals Library. All rights reserved.",price_improvingemergencytreatmentpatients_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Modeling Regional Crop Yield And Irrigation Demand Using Smap Type Of Soil Moisture Data,"El Sharif, Husayn and Wang, Jingfeng and Georgakakos, Aris P.",2015,"Agricultural models, such as the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM), have been developed for predicting crop yield at field and regional scales and to provide useful information for water resources management. A potentially valuable input to agricultural models is soil moisture. Presently, no observations of soil moisture exist covering the entire United States at adequate time (daily) and space (similar to 10 km or less) resolutions desired for crop yield assessments. Data products from NASA's upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will fill the gap. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of the SMAP soil moisture data in modeling and forecasting crop yields and irrigation amount. A simple, efficient data assimilation algorithm is presented in which the agricultural crop model DSSAT-CSM is constrained to produce modeled crop yield and irrigation amounts that are consistent with SMAP-type data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating the SMAP data into the agricultural model provides an added benefit of reducing the uncertainty of modeled crop yields when the weather input data to the crop model are subject to large uncertainty.",elsharif_modelingregionalcropyield_2015,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Avulsions Drive Ecosystem Services And Economic Changes In The Brazilian Pantanal Wetlands,"Louzada, Romullo O. and Bergier, Ivan and Roque, Fabio O. and McGlue, Michael M. and Silva, Aguinaldo and Assine, Mario L.",2021,"The Pantanal wetland is a mosaic of landscapes that brings together rich biodiversity with the valuable activities of fishing, tourism and ranching. Human occupation and land use in the headwaters have intensified the rate of channel avulsions in the lower reaches of the largest megafan on the Taquari River. This study evaluates the longterm changes of landscapes in the active depositional lobe of the Taquari megafan from the perspective of local communities of pantaneiros. Maps derived from multiple decades of multispectral Landsat data have proven useful for studying land cover changes through the relationship between dry (terrestrial vegetation and soil/dry pastures) and humid landscapes (open waters, aquatic macrophytes and wet soils), as well as through Sankey diagrams and spatiotemporal mapping with Boolean operations according to the rate of dryland recovery. We found that dryland recovery associated with an older and smaller avulsion (known as Ze ' da Costa) is analogous to that of a most recent and much larger avulsion (known as Caronal), which is still ongoing and has greater importance due to the scale of the impacts. Land value and fish capture depreciate as the partial Caronal avulsion still evolves, increasing the likelihood of environmental conflicts. While pantaneiros no longer profit from ecosystem services of provision (e.g., livestock or fishing), dryland recovery may deliver quantifiable ecosystem services of regulation. The strengthening of partnerships among stakeholders and the implementation of environmental compensation mechanisms are central for the best management of the Pantanal's megafans that ensure quality of life for all pantaneiros.",louzada_avulsionsdriveecosystemservices_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Integration Of Urban Growth Modelling Products With Image-Based Urban Change Analysis,"Jin, Huiran and Mountrakis, Giorgos",2013,"Urban change detection using remotely sensed data has been extensively studied. One current application of detection products is the formulation of calibration data for urban change prediction models. As multi-temporal scenes become available and urban growth prediction models increase in popularity and accuracy, it is natural to envisage a bi-directional relationship where, in addition to detection products assisting prediction models, the prediction information acts as ancillary input to enhance spectral-based change detection products. This closed feedback loop has the potential to significantly increase the accuracy of both detection and prediction efforts. Consequently, our objective is to evaluate the integration of prediction information with spectral data for urban change monitoring. A case study was carried out in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. Probabilities of urban change generated from two existing urban prediction models (based on decision trees and logistic regression) are combined as additional information content with a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene. Detailed assessments at the pixel and block scales are implemented to evaluate urban change classification accuracy using different input data and training sample sizes. Results show that in pixel-based assessments, the fusion of decision tree change probabilities and TM spectral bands with sufficient training samples leads to improvements. In terms of overall accuracies, the improvement is 2.02.4\%, from 87.3\% (spectral-only model) and 87.7\% (prediction probability model) to 89.7\% for the fused model. Similarly, the corresponding kappa coefficients show increases of 0.070.08, from 0.60 for the spectral model and 0.61 for the urban prediction model to 0.68 for the fused model. Accuracies aggregated at the block scale present an approximate 2.14.3\% increase when the fusion-based model is employed compared with the exclusive use of either spectral or prediction probability data, namely 87.6\% (fused) vs 83.4\% (spectral) and 85.7\% (prediction). It is also important to state that the standard deviation of accuracies between blocks is significantly reduced by more than 3\% (11.5\% vs 14.9\% and 14.7\%), suggesting higher consistency in classification performance. This is a desirable attribute for subsequent use of these products, for example by the urban planning community. Statistical tests at the block scale also demonstrate that such improvements are significant. It is also observed that to receive the integration benefits, the remote sensing classifier needs a large but reasonable training data set size, while the prediction model should be based on advanced modelling methods. Further assessments on block accuracy with respect to urbanization conditions (i.e. urban presence and change sizes) indicate the ability of the fusion to address spectral limitations, especially in blocks with high relative change. These initial results encourage the expansion of spectral/prediction data fusion to other sites, modelling techniques, and input data.",jin_integrationurbangrowthmodelling_2013,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Integrating New Technologies To Broaden The Scope Of Northern Spotted Owl Monitoring And Linkage With Usda Forest Inventory Data,"Lesmeister, Damon B. and Jenkins, Julianna M. A.",2022,"Wildlife monitoring programs designed to inform forest management and conservation decisions in the face of climate change benefit from long-term datasets with consistent methodology. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs may seek to transition to alternative methods because emerging technologies can improve trend tracking and expand the number of target populations, increase spatial scale, and reduce long-term costs. Integrated models strengthen the capacity to adapt long-term monitoring programs to next generation methods. Here we present a case study of northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) population monitoring that is under transition. The first monitoring phase focused on territory occupancy and mark-resighting individual owls. Owing to rapidly declining populations and increasing costs, traditional methods are less viable for long-term monitoring. A non-invasive approach, passive acoustic monitoring, is effective for detecting spotted owl presence, estimating occupancy rates, distinguishing sex, detecting trends in populations, and monitoring many additional species. A key component to support transition to passive acoustic monitoring was the development of machine learning models to automate species detections that enable rapid and effective data processing and analysis workflows. Coupling passive acoustic monitoring networks with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) datasets provide powerful tools for predicting forest change impacts on wildlife populations and identify winners and losers in dynamic landscapes. The second monitoring phase will leverage new technologies, expand the scope of inference, link forest inventory and remote sensing datasets, and transition the program to broad biodiversity monitoring that assists managers as they face myriad challenges in dynamic landscapes.",lesmeister_integratingtechnologiesbroadenscope_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
An Adaptive Method For Identifying Marine Areas Of High Conservation Priority,"Afan, Isabel and Gimenez, Joan and Forero, Manuela G. and Ramirez, Francisco",2018,"Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation is particularly challenging in the marine environment due to the open and dynamic nature of the ocean, the paucity of information on species distribution, and the necessary balance between marine biodiversity conservation and essential supporting services such as seafood provision. We used the Patagonian seabird breeding community as a case study to propose an integrated and adaptive method for delimiting key marine areas for conservation. Priority areas were defined through a free decision-support tool (Marxan) that included projected at-sea distributions of seabirds (approximately 2,225,000 individuals of 14 species); BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for pelagic bird species; and the economic costs of potential regulations in fishing practices. The proposed reserve network encompassed approximately 300,000 km(2) that was largely concentrated in northern and southern inshore and northern and central offshore regions. This reserve network exceeded the minimum threshold of 20\% conservation of the abundance of each species proposed by the World Parks Congress. Based on marine currents in the study area, we further identified the 3 primary water masses that may influence areas of conservation priority through water inflow. Our reserve network may benefit from enhanced marine productivity in these highly connected areas, but they may be threatened by human impacts such as marine pollution. Our method of reserve network design is an important advance with respect to the more classical approaches based on criteria defined for one or a few species and may be particularly useful when information on spatial patterns is data deficient. Our approach also accommodates addition of new information on seabird distribution and population dynamics, human activities, and alterations in the marine environment.",afan_adaptivemethodidentifyingmarine_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Prediction Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Nutrients Using Terrain Attributes And Remote Sensing Data,"Zhang, S. and Wang, Z. and Zhang, B. and Song, K. and Liu, D. and Li, F. and Ren, C. and Huang, J. and Zhang, H.",2010,"The distribution of the soil organic matter and total nitrogen can provide reliable and useful information for sustainable land management and land use planning. In this study, regression Kriging with environmental predictors was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil nutrients (organic matter and total nitrogen) in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, Northeast China, considering the disadvantages of conventional geo-statistic methods. Terrain and vegetation indicators were chosen for regression Kriging including ten terrain attributes and one vegetation index. The results indicated that relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), roughness of terrain (QFD), rate of gradient (SOS) and NDVI had significant correlations with soil organic matter and total nitrogen. M and Ψ had higher significant correlation with soil organic matter than those with total nitrogen. Relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), surface roughness (M), river dynamic index (Ω) and NDVI were the best predictors for describing soil nutrients in the study area for they described the regression equations most. In Nong'an County, the soil organic matter and total nitrogen distributed regularly from southeast to northwest, and the values were higher in the part of southeast. This distribution pattern was affected by terrain and vegetation factors synthetically, and it had a significant relationship with soil type. Precision assessment results showed that regression Kriging improved the accuracy significantly and it could be an effective method for evaluating the spatial distribution of soil properties.",zhang_predictionspatialdistributionsoil_2010,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"The First Generation Of A Regional-Scale 1-M Forest Canopy Cover Dataset Using Machine Learning And Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform: A Case Study Of Arkansas, Usa","Zurqani, H. A.",2024,"Forest canopy cover (FCC) is essential in forest assessment and management, affecting ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, and water regulation. Ongoing advancements in techniques for accurately and efficiently mapping and extracting FCC information require a thorough evaluation of their validity and reliability. The primary objectives of this study are to: (1) create a large-scale forest FCC dataset with a 1-meter spatial resolution, (2) assess the regional spatial distribution of FCC at a regional scale, and (3) investigate differences in FCC areas among the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) and U.S. Forest Service Tree Canopy Cover products at various spatial scales in Arkansas (i.e., county and city levels). This study utilized high-resolution aerial imagery and a machine learning algorithm processed and analyzed using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to produce the FCC dataset. The accuracy of this dataset was validated using one-third of the reference locations obtained from the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) dataset and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery with a 0.6-m spatial resolution. The results showed that the dataset successfully identified FCC at a 1-m resolution in the study area, with overall accuracy ranging between 83.31% and 94.35% per county. Spatial comparison results between the produced FCC dataset and the Hansen et al., 2013 and USFS products indicated a strong positive correlation, with R2 values ranging between 0.94 and 0.98 for county and city levels. This dataset provides valuable information for monitoring, forecasting, and managing forest resources in Arkansas and beyond. The methodology followed in this study enhances efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, as it enables the processing of large-scale datasets with high computational demands in a cloud-based environment. It also demonstrates that machine learning and cloud computing technologies can generate high-resolution forest cover datasets, which might be helpful in other regions of the world. © 2023",zurqani_generationregionalscale1_2024,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Access To Fertility Care In Geographically Underserved Populations, A Second Look","Brodeur, T. Y. and Grow, D. and Esfandiari, N.",2022,"Infertility has a prevalence of up to 16% worldwide and is on the rise in developed nations, largely due to pursuing childbearing at advanced reproductive ages. Advances in assisted reproductive technology have benefitted socioeconomically advantaged patients disproportionately. High costs of fertility care are largely responsible for this disparity; however, patients in rural areas also face barriers in accessing both gynecology and reproductive endocrinology subspecialty care. Here, focusing on the USA, we discuss fertility care in geographically underserved areas and low-resource settings, and the impact on reproductive outcomes. Increased innovation to improve patient access to fertility care such as assisted reproductive technology is critical for ensuring equity. Remote monitoring is frequently performed by fertility centers, but partnership with local gynecologists has also been demonstrated to be an effective assisted reproductive technology monitoring method. Telehealth is now in mainstream use and the continued application to reduce geographic barriers to infertility patients is imperative. Partnership between local gynecologists and reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialists may improve patient access to fertility care and provide the unique benefits of continuity and ongoing local social support. © 2022, Society for Reproductive Investigation.",brodeur_accessfertilitycaregeographically_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Response Of Vegetation Coverage To Climate Change In Mongolian Plateau During Recent 10 Years,"Miao, L. and Jiang, C. and He, B. and Liu, Q. and Zhu, F. and Cui, X.",2014,"Vegetation in the arid/ semi arid area is highly sensitive to climate change. The Mongolian Plateau climate is mainly controlled by the east Asia monsoon system. Hence both Inner Mongolia and the state of Mongolia (Hereafter: Mongolia) experience a similar arid/semi arid climate but have different anthropological influences via their separate social and economic development histories. In this study, we analyzed in-situ observations from 67 meteorological stations (50 stations in Inner Mongolia and 17 in Mongolia) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) product from SPOT (Satellite pour l') observation de la Terre in French) using Mann-Kendall (MK) tests and Maximum Value Composition (MVC). Our results showed that: (1) Temperature is general higher in the south than the north, while precipitation ranges from low in the west to high in the east. There is a significant warming trend over the whole Mongolian Plateau region from 1961 to 2009, while no obvious trends were found for precipitation; (2) Vegetation coverage in Inner Mongolia was generally greater than that in Mongolia. The time series of vegetation coverage change in these two regions can be divided into two periods. The regional averaged NDVI decreased from 1998 to 2001, fluctuated greatly and then increased continuously from 2009 to 2012. The main degraded areas are located in the Xilingol league, central Inner Mongolia, while they are mostly located in the central and western Mongolia; (3) Positive correlations were found between NDVI and precipitation in desert, steppe vegetation and forest areas in Mongolia, while negative relationships were found for temperature. In Inner Mongolia, NDVI are also positively correlated with precipitation in desert and steppe vegetation areas and also positively correlated with temperature in forests. Recently several major national ecological projects were implemented in Inner Mongolia by national central and local governments, including ""The Return Cropland to Forest"", the ""Return Grazing Land to Grassland"" (Grain for Green), and the Three North Protection Forest Plantation Project. These projects improved the local environment by stopping grazing/ cropping and planting trees. We believe that these policy actions contribute to the vegetation recovery in Inner Mongolia exhibited here in the NDVI. We attribute the different trends and dynamics of vegetation change in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia to human activities since the climate is similar in these two areas. However, the mechanism driving the changes requires further study particularly investigation of the socio-economic drivers of local land use changes. If formal/ informal communication between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia are encouraged in scientific research, cultural exchange and policy making of environmental protection at different levels, it will provide more opportunity for preservation and enhancement of the nomadic culture.",miao_responsevegetationcoverageclimate_2014,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Devices To Support Treatment Decisions In Type 1 Diabetes: The Diabeo System,"Franc, S. and Charpentier, G.",2015,"Blood glucose control in type 1 diabetes has improved considerably since the DCCT due to general diffusion of 'physiological' basal-prandial therapeutic schedules, generalization of therapeutic educational programs, functional insulin therapy, insulin analogues, and insulin pumps. However, glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) averages 8% within various studies, which is still unsatisfactory. The creation of new technological tools could lead to new levels of success, as attested by the Diabeo system. This system comprises three programs. The first program automatically calculates basal and prandial insulin doses while taking account of blood glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, and is equipped with algorithms that allow automatic adjustment based on the results obtained. The entire system must first of all be configured by the doctor according to the patient's characteristics, and then it has to be downloaded to a smartphone from a secure website. All of the patient's results and data are then made available for consultation at all times by authorized caregivers, enabling remote monitoring to be performed. The second program analyzes the results and automatically generates coaching messages for the patient and messages for the caregiver in the event of underuse, unsatisfactory results, or inadequate operation of the system. The caregiver may then intervene in a timely fashion via a telephone consultation or modification of the patient's treatment profile. The third program optimizes the doctor's available time by delegating tasks and allowing action to be undertaken by a specialized telemedicine nurse working in conjunction with the responsible diabetologist. An initial version of the system, comprising only the first of these three programs, resulted in a mean reduction in HbA 1c of 0.9% at 6 months versus the control group in a population of patients with chronic glycemic control problems and treated with multiple injections or insulin pump. Analysis of individual patient data shows that the most compliant patients derived the greatest benefit from the dose calculation function, while less compliant patients benefited considerably from the telemonitoring function, which allowed short but repeated consultations at opportune moments. A large-scale national study is currently being initiated in France to confirm these favorable metabolic results at 1 year and to assess the medicoeconomic impact of this system after 2 years of use. Ultimately, the results may lead to granting of reimbursable status for the Diabeo system by the French national social security authorities, followed by widespread use of the system in France and international availability. © 2015 S.

A Statistical Approach To Mapping Flood Susceptibility In The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region,"Giovannettone, Jason and Copenhaver, Tom and Burns, Margot and Choquette, Scott",2018,"Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between different region types; for each region flood risk factors were extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood susceptibility increased by over 200\% between the rural and urban regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk (80-100\%) and high risk (60-80\%) were located outside of the SFHA and included several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood susceptibility. Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding. Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1, respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope, land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor. An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk factor's influence on flooding in a subregion. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20\%), low risk (20-40\%), medium risk (40-60\%), high risk (60-80\%), and very high risk (80-100\%). It was observed that several areas classified as very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require additional flood risk mitigation.",giovannettone_statisticalapproachmappingflood_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA

We asked whether weekly email reports on monitored use of inhaled, short-acting bronchodilators might improve scores on composite asthma-control measures. Methods: Through an investigational electronic medication sensor attached to each participant's inhaler, we monitored 4 months' use of inhaled, short-acting bronchodilators. Participants completed surveys, including the Asthma Control TestTM (ACT), to assess asthma control at entry and monthly thereafter. After the first month, participants received weekly email reports for 3 months. The reports summarized inhaled bronchodilator use during the preceding week and provided suggestions derived from National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines. Paired t-tests and random-effects mixed models were implemented to assess changes in primary asthma endpoints. Results: Thirty individuals participated in the 4-month study; 29 provided complete asthma control information. Mean age was 36.8 years (range: 19-74 years); 52% of respondents were female. Mean ACT scores were 17.6 (Standard Deviation [SD] = 3.35) at entry and 18.4 (SD = 3.60) at completion of the first month. No significant difference appeared between ACT values at entry and completion of the first month (p = 0.66); however, after participants began receiving email reports and online information about their inhaler use, mean ACT scores increased 1.40 points (95% CI: 0.61, 2.18) for each subsequent study month.

Local 3d Scene Fine Detection Analysis Of Circular Landform On The Southern Edge Of Dinosaur Valley,"Sha, G. and Xiping, Y. and Shu, G. and Milong, Y. and Lin, H. and Rui, B.",2021,"With the continuous advancement of low-altitude UAV (unmanned air vehicle, UAV) technology for the earth observation and its wide popularity, UAV photogrammetry and SfM (Structure from Motion, SfM) methods have received more and more attention as the latest means to obtain true 3D realistic models of the survey area. As the newest means of measuring geomorphological information, UAV low-altitude photogrammetry and SfM methods can quickly obtain a true 3D realistic model of the survey area, and have been applied to a number of research fields. In this paper, the UAV is used to measure the typical local scene of annular landform at the southern edge of Dinosaur Valley in Lufeng, and the high-resolution geomorphological image data of the investigated area are obtained. Combined with the SFM method, a realistic 3D scene model is constructed, and its geomorphological characteristics are discussed and analyzed. The experimental results show that the DSM (digital surface model, DSM) data based on the SFM method can obtain ground points by filtering, diluting, and classifying the data, and the DEM (digital elevation model, DEM) data with a resolution of 0.2m is constructed by using the progressive encrypted triangular mesh method, which can accurately represent the true geomorphological characteristics of the study area. (2) Construction of three typical elevation profiles of the circular scene “inner-middle-outer,” and comparative analysis of the profiles confirmed that the topography of the study area is characterized by the dome ridge line AA' as the main highland ridge line, showing a circular “basin margin” pattern, with gradually decreasing elevations on the inner and outer sides. (3) In order to reveal the complex tectonic geomorphological features of the external scene between the ridge and trough, the ArcGIS surface analysis method was used to extract the ridge lines J1-J7. Accurate quantitative measurements and analysis were carried out to investigate the slope, slope length, slope direction, ridge area face, and other related parameters. (4) Using the multi-view visual interpretation and typical scene analysis of the three-dimensional 3D model, micro-geomorphological features such as the development of washouts in the survey area and the nodal laminar surface of the geological body can be clearly identified. In addition, the coordinates of the geological body’s spatial location and its production, spreading area, square volume, and other rich geological information can be accurately obtained. Through the above experimental study on the detection of 3D scenes of landforms, the advantages of UAV measurement technology and SFM method to construct DSM data and 3D scene models in fine geological structure detection are demonstrated. This will have an important application prospect and practical value for geological survey, monitoring , prevention and control management in mountainous areas.In addition, the fast, low-cost, high-precision, and non-contact measurement mode can provide accurate data basis and technical support for geological structure detection, geological disaster investigation, risk assessment and prevention and control management. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",sha_local3dscenefine_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Mangrove Health Index As Part Of Sustainable Management In Mangrove Ecosystem At Karimunjawa National Marine Park Indonesia,"Prasetya, Johan Danu and Ambariyanto and Supriharyono and Purwanti, Frida",2017,"Background: Monitoring the health of marine ecosystems is an integral part of sustainable management of the ecosystems including mangrove. Distribution and diversity of mangrove ecosystems are two important parameters in Mangrove Health Index (MHI). The index analyses value of mangrove density, diversity, index of similarity and the number of mangrove species. Method: This study investigates mangrove distribution and diversity. Mangrove distribution maps were prepared using Satellite imagery GEO-EYE. Ecological surveys to analyze the diversity of mangrove at five locations, namely Legon Cilik, Legon Gede, Kemujan, Karimunjawa and Menjangan Besar. MHI was calculated by assigning weight for each parameter, multiplied by each parameter score and then summing all of multiplication results value. Results: Satellite image interpretation results showed that mangroves were found at island of Karimunjawa, Menjangan Besar and Sintok. In total, 22 mangrove species identified, 12 species were true mangroves and the rests were mangrove associates. Rhizophora apiculata dominates three of nine survey locations, while Rhizophora stylosa was the dominant species in two of nine locations and the rest are dominated by Ceriops tagal, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora mucronata and Sonneratia alba. Density of mangrove in the category of tree, mangrove average density ranging from medium to high, from 230 to 1060 ind/ha. In the category of sapling, dominant mangrove species was relatively diverse. In general, the Shannon diversity index was low, it means that mangrove diversity is low, it means that mangrove diversity is low. Mangrove in Legon Cilik 1 and Menjangan Besar had the highest Shannon diversity index (1,09) while Karimun 1 were the lowest (0,18). Conclusion: The value of MHI at Karimunjawa was 200, which is in the medium category.

The present study used multi-temporal Landsat and Google earth imageries to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamism of the selected glacial lake (moraine-dammed) in the Satluj basin of Western Himalayas. Furthermore, GLOF susceptibility of the lake was assessed using a multi-criteria decision-based method. The results show that the lake area has increased from 0.11 to 0.26 km(2) over the past 28 years from 1990 to 2018. The susceptibility index value for the lake was calculated as 0.75, which indicates that the lake is highly susceptible to the GLOF. The depth and volume of the lake were estimated to be 16 m and 57 x 10(5) m(3), respectively, using an empirical formula. HEC-RAS, HECGeo-RAS, and Arc-GIS software were utilized in this study to perform unsteady flow analysis and to determine the GLOF impact on the downstream area. The worst-case GLOF scenario (breach width of 75 m) was revealed during an overtopping failure of the moraine dam, resulted in a peak discharge of 4060 m(3)/s and releasing a total water volume of 57 x 10(5) m(3). The breach hydrograph has been routed to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of peak flood, inundation depth, velocity, water surface elevation, and flood peak arrival time along the river channel. The analysis further reveals that the routed flood waves reach the nearest settlement, i.e., Rajpur town, situated at a distance of 102 km in the downstream valley of the lake at 6 h after the beginning of the lake breach event with a peak discharge/flood of 1757 m(3)/s and maximum flow velocity of 1.5 m/s. With the ongoing climate warming and glacier retreat, moraine-dammed lakes are becoming more hazardous and thus increasing the total threat. Therefore, it is mandatory to monitor and assess such lakes at regular intervals of time to lessen the disastrous impacts of GLOFs on the livelihood and infrastructure in the downstream valleys. The findings of this study will aid in the creation of risk management plans, preparatory tactics, and risk reduction techniques for GLOF hazards in the region.",rawat_glaciallakeoutburstflood_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Over the past five decades, remote-sensing techniques have played a vital role in forest AGB estimation at different scales. Here, we present an overview of the progress in remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. More in detail, we first describe the principles of remote sensing techniques in forest AGB estimation: that is, the construction and use of parameters associated with AGB (rather than the direct measurement of AGB values). Second, we review forest AGB remotely sensed data sources (including passive optical, microwave, and LiDAR) and methods (e.g., empirical, physical, mechanistic, and comprehensive models) alongside their limitations and advantages. Third, we discuss possible sources of uncertainty in resultant forest AGB estimates, including those associated with remote sensing imagery, sample plot survey data, stand structure, and statistical models. Finally, we offer forward-looking perspectives and insights on prospective research directions for remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in future forest AGB estimation and carbon cycle studies. Overall, this comprehensive review may (1) benefit the research communities focused on carbon cycle, remote sensing, and climate change elucidation, (2) provide a theoretical basis for the study of the carbon cycle and global climate change, (3) inform forest ecosystems and carbon management, and (4) aid in the elucidation of forest feedbacks to climate change. © 2023 by the authors.",tian_reviewremotesensingbased_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Spatio-Temporal Changes In Urban Green Space In 107 Chinese Cities (1990-2019): The Role Of Economic Drivers And Policy,"Wu, Wan-Ben and Ma, Jun and Meadows, Michael E. and Banzhaf, Ellen and Huang, Tian-Yuan and Liu, Yi-Fei and Zhao, Bin",2021,"Urban green space (UGS) has gained increasing attention due to its environmental and social functions. However, the compound effects of climate change, population growth and economic development on UGS are largely unknown. We selected 107 medium-sized and large cities in China to investigate dynamics in the spatial pattern of UGS in relation to government policy and other drivers based on remote sensing data for the period 1990 to 2019. To explore the effect of different levels of urbanization on changes in green space, we develop a new Normalized Urban Development Index (NUDI) to classify urban-suburban-rural gradients, viz. Long-term Builtup, New Built-up and Non-Built-up. Then, we analysed changes over time in the annual peak value of fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) for 380,000 cloud-free Landsat images, and regional UGS dynamics were evaluated using the proposed Regional Greenness Dynamic Index (RGDI). Finally, to reveal the major driver(s) of changes in UGS and estimate the extent to which patterns of urban greening are due to differences in economic development, we compared the observed UGS spatio-temporal dynamics with data on several climatic, social-economic and land use related factors for the same period. The NUDI are shown to be highly effective in mapping urban development gradients, with overall accuracy in the identified classes of 89\%. Annual maximum FVC analysis indicates that there was significant greening between 1990 and 2019 in both the long-term built up (10,667.52 km(2)) and the non-built up areas (529,310.47 km(2)), while there was a major increase in browning (25,110.43 km(2)) in the newly built-up areas. The RGDI results indicate that 65\% (71/107) of long-term built-up areas in cities trended greener over 2010 to 2019 under consideration. At the whole city scale, RGDI is negatively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP), although when considering the long-term built-up areas only, economic growth exhibits a significant positive correlation during 2010 to 2019 (R = 0.62, p < 0.01). This study offers important insights as to the patterns of change in urban greening extent over time and its underyling drivers across urban-suburbanrural gradients against the background of urban expansion, afforestation, climate change and economic development.",wu_spatiotemporalurbangreen_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Hybrid Rough-Pso Approach In Remote Sensing Imagery Analysis,"Sarkar, Anasua and Das, Rajib",2016,"Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a very challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always the key features for classifying mixed pixels. This paper proposes an approach for pixel classification using a hybrid approach of rough set theory and particle swarm optimization methods. Rough set theory deals with incompleteness and vagueness among data, which property may be utilized for detecting arbitrarily shaped and sized clusters in satellite images. To enable fast automatic clustering of multispectral remote sensing imagery, in this article, we propose a rough set-based heuristical decision rule generation algorithm. For rough-set-theoretic decision rule generation, each cluster is classified using heuristically searched optimal reducts to overcome overlapping cluster problem. This proposed unsupervised algorithm is able to identify clusters utilizing particle swarm optimization based on rough set generated membership values. This approach addresses the overlapping regions in remote sensing images by uncertainties using rough set generated membership values. Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, inspired from the social behavior of bird flock. Therefore, to predict pixel classification of remote sensing imagery, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based membership correction approach over rough set-based initial decision rule generation. We demonstrate our algorithm for segmenting a LANDSAT image of the catchment area of Ajoy River. The newly developed algorithm is compared with fuzzy C-means and K-means algorithms. The new algorithm generated clustered regions are verified with the available ground truth knowledge. The validity analysis is performed to demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms with K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms.",sarkar_hybridroughpsoapproach_2016,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Multilevel Segmentation Algorithm For Agricultural Parcel Extraction From A Semantic Boundary,"Wu, W. and Chen, T. and Yang, H. and He, Z. and Chen, Y. and Wu, N.",2023,"Parcels are the basic unit of crop planting and management. Therefore, parcelwise farmland data become the fundamental basis for precision agriculture applications, and the extraction of parcels from high-resolution remote sensing images is of great importance. The deep learning-based edge detection methods have achieved superior performance, but these methods output edge intensity maps with pixel values from 0 to 255 in raster format. Vectorization, which transforms the rasterized data into vectors, is an important post-processing procedures. In this process, segmentation and thinning are two key steps for deriving the one-pixel-wide binary edge, however, the traditional method suffers deviation from the actual edge and the unclosed edge. To address these problems, based on the hypothesis that the larger the edge intensity value is, the greater the likelihood that the pixel is on or near the boundary, we developed a multilevel segmentation method for agricultural parcel extraction from a semantic boundary, which prioritizes using the pixels with high intensity to ensure that the extracted boundaries adhere closely to the actual boundaries and the pixels with low intensity connect the unclosed boundaries, thus simultaneously improving the fidelity and completeness of boundaries. We selected images acquired in Hangzhou Bay and Denmark to test our method, and the result demonstrates that our method can accurately extract agricultural parcels. Compared with the single threshold segmentation method, our method shows higher boundary fidelity and completeness. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves competitive performance in traditional metrics but outperforms edge preservation and one-to-one correspondence between the extracted parcel and actual parcel. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",wu_multilevelsegmentationalgorithmagricultural_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
High-Resolution Mapping And Driving Factors Of Soil Erodibility In Southeastern Tibet,"Yu, Wu and Jiang, Yefeng and Liang, Wandong and Wan, Dan and Liang, Bo and Shi, Zhou",2023,"Quantifying the spatial distribution of soil erodibility (K factor) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is essential for global soil erosion management. However, many K factor maps have a coarse spatial resolution at the regional scale, and high-resolution mapping is still a challenge. Quantitative analysis of the influence of environmental factors such as soil, topography, climate, and vegetation, and human activities on the K factor is also lacking. Therefore, we mapped the high-resolution (90 m) spatial distribution of the K factor values in southeastern Tibet using a random forest model with multiple environmental variables, based on remote sensing, ground obser-vations (114 sampling points), and gridded datasets. The K factor estimates based on soil particle size compo-sition and organic carbon content ranged from 0.09 to 0.35, showing moderate variation. The random forest model yielded a coefficient of determination > 0.9 and provided detailed information on the spatial distribution of K factor values, especially in large unsampled areas. The predicted K factor values tended to be high in the eastern area and low in the western area. Partial least squares path modeling showed that soil physical properties such as fractal dimension and mean weight diameter of aggregates had the largest influence on the K factor (path coefficient 0.695). Climate and topography also had a considerable influence on the K factor (path coefficient-0.489 and-0.469, respectively), while the influence of vegetation and human activities was minimal. Accordingly, the random forest model is an effective tool for high-resolution spatial distribution mapping of the K factor with limited sampling data.",yu_resolutionmappingdrivingfactors_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
A Gis-Based Methodology For Sustainable Farming Planning: Assessment Of Land Use/Cover Changes And Carbon Dynamics At Farm Level,"Dargains, Alexandre and Cabral, Pedro",2021,"The assessment of carbon dynamics as a climate-regulation ecosystem service (ES) by modeling of scenarios on land use and land cover (LULC) changes is widely used in environmental conservation studies to support public policies. However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007-2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production. These results are useful to support land use planning and management for both environmental conservation policies and sustainable farming production.",dargains_gisbasedmethodologysustainable_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Multifactor Colorimetric Analysis On Ph-Indicator Papers: An Optimized Approach For Direct Determination Of Ambient Aerosol Ph,"Li, G. and Su, H. and Ma, N. and Zheng, G. and Kuhn, U. and Li, M. and Klimach, T. and Pöschl, U. and Cheng, Y.",2020,"Direct measurement of the acidity (pH) of ambient aerosol particles/droplets has long been a challenge for atmospheric scientists. A novel and facile method was introduced recently by Craig et al. (2018), where the pH of size-resolved aerosol droplets was directly measured by two types of pH-indicator papers (pH ranges: 0-2.5 and 2.5-4.5) combined with RGB-based colorimetric analyses using a model of G-B (G minus B) vs. pH2. Given the wide pH range of ambient aerosols, we optimize the RGB-based colorimetric analysis on pH papers with a wider detection range (pH ∼ 0 to 6). Here, we propose a new model to establish the linear relationship between RGB values and pH: pHpredict D a • Rnormal C b • Gnormal C c • Bnormal. This model shows a wider applicability and higher accuracy than those in previous studies and is thus recommended in future RGBbased colorimetric analyses on pH papers. Moreover, we identify one type of pH paper (Hydrion® Brilliant pH dip stiks, lot no. 3110, Sigma-Aldrich) that is more applicable for ambient aerosols in terms of its wide pH detection range (0 to 6) and strong anti-interference capacity. Custommade impactors are used to collect lab-generated aerosols on this type of pH paper. Preliminary tests show that, with a collected particle size range of ∼ 0.4-2.2 μm, the pH paper method can be used to predict aerosol pH with an overall uncertainty = 0.5 units. Based on laboratory tests, a relatively short sampling time (∼ 1 to 4 h) is speculated for pH prediction of ambient aerosols. More importantly, our design of the impactors minimizes potential influences of changed environmental conditions during pH paper photographing processes on the predicted aerosol pH. We further show that the routinely adopted way of using pH color charts to predict aerosol pH may be biased by the mismatch between the standard colors on the color charts and the real colors of investigated samples. Thus, instead of using the producer-provided color charts, we suggest an in situ calibration of pH papers with standard pH buffers. © 2020 Author(s).",li_multifactorcolorimetricanalysisph_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Modeling Of Gully Erosion In Ethiopia As Influenced By Changes In Rainfall And Land Use Management Practices,"Setargie, Tadesual Asamin and Tsunekawa, Atsushi and Haregeweyn, Nigussie and Tsubo, Mitsuru and Rossi, Mauro and Ardizzone, Francesca and Vanmaercke, Matthias and De Geeter, Sofie and Fenta, Ayele Almaw and Ebabu, Kindiye and Yibeltal, Mesenbet and Berihun, Mulatu Liyew and Sultan, Dagnenet and Nzioki, Benedict and Meshesha, Taye Minichil",2023,"Gully erosion is one of the most extreme land degradation processes that exhibit spatial and temporal variation depending on topography, soil, climate, and land use and management characteristics. This study investigated the impact of changes in rainfall, land use/land cover (LULC), and land use management (LUM) practices on gully erosion in two midland watersheds (treated Kecha and untreated Laguna) in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia by using the LANDPLANER model in combination with intensive field measurements and remote sensing products. We simulated gully erosion under past (in 2005), present (in 2021), and three potential future curve number conditions, each time under four rainfall scenarios (10, 30, 60, and 100 mm) using the dynamic erosion index (e), static topographic (esp), and erosion channel (esp\_channel) thresholds. Density plot analyses showed that gullies frequently occur in low-lying gentle slope areas with relatively higher curve number values. The best predictions of gullies identified through true positive rates (TPR) and true negative rates (TNR) were achieved considering the static esp\_channel > 1 for Kecha (TPR = 0.667 and TNR = 0.544) and the dynamic e > 0.1 for 60 mm of rainfall in Laguna (TPR = 0.769 and TNR = 0.516). Despite the 10 mm rainfall having negligible erosion-triggering potential in both watersheds, the 60 and 100 mm rainfall scenarios were 4-5 and 10-17 times, respectively, higher than the 30 mm rainfall scenario. While the LULC change in the untreated Laguna watershed increased the impact of rainfall on gully initiation by only 0-2\% between 2005 and 2021, the combination of LULC and LUM significantly reduced the impact of rainfall in the treated Kecha watershed by 64-79\%. Similarly, the gully initiation area in Kecha was reduced by 28\% (from 33\% in 2005 to 5\% in 2021) due to changes in LULC and LUM practices, whereas Laguna showed little increment by only 1\% (from 42\% in 2005 to 43\% in 2021) due to LULC change. In addition, the future predicted alternative land use planning options showed that gully initiation areas in Laguna could be reduced by 1\% with only LULC conversion; 39\% when only LUM practices were implemented; and 37\% when both were combined. These results indicate that LUM practices outweigh the impact of LULC on gully erosion in the studied paired watersheds. Overall, LANDPLANER successfully simulated the spatio-temporal variation of gully erosion with scenario-based analyses and hence can be used to predict gullies in the study area and other data-scarce regions with similar agro-ecological settings.",setargie_modelinggullyerosionethiopia_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Are Patagonia Grasslands Being Overgrazed? A Response To Marino Et Al. (2020),"Oliva, Gabriel and Paredes, Paula and Ferrante, Daniela and Cepeda, Carla and Rabinovich, Jorge",2020,"Based upon primary productivity estimates, Oliva et al. (2019) concluded that, at the end of last century and after long periods of overgrazing, Patagonia's domestic stocks adjusted to regional-scale herbivore carrying capacity. Populations of guanaco, a native camelid, increased thereafter, driving combined grazing pressures once again over carrying capacity in some areas. Marino et al. (2020) argued that grazing is not really at equilibrium because domestic stocks are concentrated in areas that remain overgrazed. They support the ideas that guanaco density is auto-regulated by resource-defence territoriality, and that guanacos are weak competitors with domestic stock, occupying only marginal areas. In their view, Oliva et al. (2019) put guanacos in the role of scapegoats, leaving domestic stocks unchecked. Equilibrium at regional scale does not preclude overgrazing and under-grazing at local scales. By separating areas with and without domestic stocks, Marino et al. (2020) estimated overgrazing at 28\% in Chubut Province and 73\% in Santa Cruz Province. Our recalculations show 28\% and 47\% domestic overgrazing, respectively. However, when combined with guanaco densities, these increase to 48\% for Chubut and 108\% for Santa Cruz. We question the hypothesised lack of competitive value and efficient self-regulating mechanisms that would prevent guanaco populations from overshooting carrying capacity. A dataset of 13 sheep farms showed mean density of 26 +/- 3.8 guanacos/km(2)and high combined grazing pressures. This was also observed in a protected area of Chubut that reached 42 guanacos/km(2)and crashed during drought, with 60\% mortality. Thereafter, guanacos increased to 70 guanacos/km(2), with recruitment rates that showed a complex response of density dependence but remained relatively elevated at densities above the estimated carrying capacity. Synthesis and applications. Marino et al. (2020) are right to question the apparent equilibrium of domestic stocks that are concentrated in areas that may be still overgrazed. But ground data show that guanaco populations have inefficient density population regulation and can reach densities well over carrying capacity, even in the presence of sheep. This does not mean that the main control should be on growing guanaco populations but it stresses our conclusion that joint management of the native-domestic herbivore system is urgently needed. Joint management can be effected through local plans, as current guanaco management permits can only be issued in areas that are not overgrazed by sheep. Farm management plans may in this way transform an apparent competitor into a valuable resource, complementary to sheep raising.",oliva_patagoniagrasslandsovergrazedresponse_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA

However, the climate adaptive characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies is seldom studied. In this paper, three types of water bodies, i.e., urban inside water bodies, urban outside discrete water bodies and large water bodies are identified according to their relative spatial relationships with built-up areas. The climate adaptive landscape characteristics of water bodies are analyzed based on water bodies' cooling effect (WCE) inside and outside cities in the Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake regions. Seventy-three Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS images acquired from 1989 to 2019 are employed. Landscape scale characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies are described by area, water depth, perimeter to area ratio (PARA) and distance-weighted area index (DWAI). Three temperature-related parameters are calculated to estimate the WCE in different conditions. Climate adaptive characteristics of water bodies inside/outside cities are determined by corre-lation and regression analysis. Results show that: 1) The long river shape, depth, orientation and fluidity of urban inside water bodies are benefit to enhance their cooling effect; 2) the distance of urban outside water bodies from built-up areas are positive correlated with their cooling effect; 3) the optimal acreage of large water bodies are >2500 km2 and 1111-1287.5 km2 for climate adaption of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, respectively. Simultaneously, the WCE of urban outside large water bodies is related with human activities and climate conditions.

Mapping Deciduous Broad-Leaved Forested Swamps Using Alos/Palsar Data,Bian Hongfeng and Yan Tingting and Zhang Zhengxiang and He Chunguang and Sheng Lianxi,2016,"Accurate, updated information on the distribution of wetlands is essential for estimating net fluxes of greenhouse gases and for effectively protecting and managing wetlands. Because of their complex community structure and rich surface vegetation, deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps are considered to be one of the most difficult types of wetland to classify. In this research, with the support of remote sensing and geographic information system, multi-temporal radar images L-Palsar were used initially to extract the forest hydrological layer and phenology phase change layer as two variables through image analysis. Second, based on the environmental characteristics of forested swamps, three decision tree classifiers derived from the two variables were constructed to explore effective methods to identify deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps. Third, this study focused on analyzing the classification process between flat-forests, which are the most severely disturbed elements, and forested swamps. Finally, the application of the decision tree model will be discussed. The results showed that: 1) L-HH band (a L band with wavelength of 0-235 m in HH polarization mode; HH means Synthetic Aperture Radars transmit pulses in horizontal polarization and receive in horizontal polarization) in the leaf-off season is shown to be capable of detecting hydrologic conditions beneath the forest; 2) the accuracy of the classification (forested swamp and forest plat) was 81.5\% based on hydrologic features, and 83.5\% was achieved by combining hydrologic features and phenology response features, which indicated that hydrological characteristics under the forest played a key role. The HHOJ (refers to the band created by the subtraction with HH band in October and HH band in July) achieved by multi-temporal radar images did improve the classification accuracy, but not significantly, and more leaf-off radar images may be more efficient than multi-seasonal radar images for inland forested swamp mapping; 3) the lower separability between forested swamps dominated by vegetated surfaces and forest plat covered with litter was the main cause of the uncertainty in classification, which led to misleading interpretations of the pixel-based classification.

Statistical Modeling Of Extreme Precipitation With Trmm Data,"Demirdjian, L. and Zhou, Y. and Huffman, G. J.",2018,"This paper improves upon an existing extreme precipitation monitoring system that is based on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) daily product (3B42) using new statistical models. The proposed system utilizes a regional modeling approach in which data from similar locations are pooled to increase the quality of the resulting model parameter estimates to compensate for the short data record. The regional analysis is divided into two stages. First, the region defined by the TRMM measurements is partitioned into approximately 28 000 nonoverlapping clusters using a recursive k-means clustering scheme. Next, a statistical model is used characterize the extreme precipitation events occurring in each cluster. Instead of applying the block maxima approach used in the existing system, in which the generalized extreme value probability distribution is fit to the annual precipitation maxima at each site separately, the present work adopts the peak-over-threshold method of classifying points as extreme if they exceed a prespecified threshold. Theoretical considerations motivate using the point process framework for modeling extremes. The fitted parameters are used to estimate trends and to construct simple and intuitive average recurrence interval (ARI) maps that reveal how rare a particular precipitation event is. This information could be used by policy makers for disaster monitoring and prevention. The new method eliminates much of the noise that was produced by the existing models because of a short data record, producing more reasonable ARI maps when compared with NOAA's long-term Climate Prediction Center ground-based observations. Furthermore, the proposed method can be applied to other extreme climate records. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.",demirdjian_statisticalmodelingextremeprecipitation_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Recent Ogallala Aquifer Region Drought Conditions As Observed By Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies From Grace,"Zhang, Y. and Lin, X. and Gowda, P. and Brown, D. and Zambreski, Z. and Kutikoff, S.",2019,"Recent severe drought events have occurred over the Ogallala Aquifer region (OAR) during the period 2011–2015, creating significant impacts on water resources and their use in regional environmental and economic systems. The changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS), as indicated by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), reveals a detailed picture of the temporal and spatial evolution of drought events. The observations by GRACE indicate the worst drought conditions occurred in September 2012, with an average TWS deficit of ~8 cm in the northern OAR and ~11 cm in the southern OAR, consistent with precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project. Comparing changes in TWS with precipitation shows the TWS changes can be predominantly attributable to variations in precipitation. Power spectrum and squared wavelet coherence analysis indicate a significant correlation between TWS change and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and the influence of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures on TWS change is much stronger in the southern OAR than the northern OAR. The results of this study illustrate the value of GRACE in not just the diagnosis of significant drought events, but also in possibly improving the predictive power of remote signals that are impacted by nonregional climatic events (El Nino), ultimately leading to improved water resource management applications on a regional scale.

Minimizing Signal Detection Time In Postmarket Sequential Analysis: Balancing Positive Predictive Value And Sensitivity,"Maro, J. C. and Brown, J. S. and Dal Pan, G. J. and Kulldorff, M.",2014,"Purpose: Outcome misclassification in retrospective epidemiologic analyses has been well-studied, but little is known about such misclassification with respect to sequential statistical analysis during surveillance of medical product-associated risks, a planned capability of the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System. Methods: Using a vaccine example, we model and simulate sequential database surveillance in an observational data network using a variety of outcome detection algorithms. We consider how these algorithms, as characterized by sensitivity and positive predictive value, impact the length of surveillance and timeliness of safety signal detection. We show investigators/users of these networks how they can perform preparatory study design calculations that consider outcome misclassification in sequential database surveillance. Results: Non-differential outcome misclassification generates longer surveillance times and less timely safety signal detection as compared with the case of no misclassification. Inclusive algorithms characterized by high sensitivity but low positive predictive value outperform more narrow algorithms when detecting rare outcomes. This decision calculus may change considerably if medical chart validation procedures were required. Conclusions: These findings raise important questions regarding the design of observational data networks used for pharmacovigilance. Specifically, there are tradeoffs involved when choosing to populate such networks with component databases that are large as compared with smaller integrated delivery system databases that can more easily access laboratory or clinical data and perform medical chart validation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",maro_minimizingsignaldetectiontime_2014,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Temporal And Phenological Profiles Of Open And Dense Caatinga Using Remote Sensing: Response To Precipitation And Its Irregularities,"de Jesus, Janisson Batista and Kuplich, Tatiana Mora and Barreto, Ikaro Daniel de Carvalho and da Rosa, Cristiano Niederauer and Hillebrand, Fernando Luis",2021,"Caatinga is a typical biome of Brazil's semiarid regions and subject to climate changes. Research is needed on the relation of its features to climate events. This study analyzed the influence of rainfall and its irregularities in open and dense woody Caatinga vegetation. Phenological curves were generated by means of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time profiles in the Grota do Angico Conservation Unit study area in Sergipe State. Rainfall data from 2000 to 2018 were collected and phenological curves generated using various estimate methods that produced the following variables: {[}start of season, end of season, peak of season position, length of season, mean growing season and maximum seasonal]. Rainfall showed a standard intra-annual behavior, with inter-annual variations related to irregularities influencing Caatinga response. Dense Caatinga vegetation had higher values of NDVI in all periods, even in anomalous years compared to open Caatinga, in addition to having longer leaf coverage over the year, with an anticipated start and a more extended seasonal end. The analysis of the rainfall regime made it possible to assess its influence on the Caatinga and phenological profiles proved to be fundamental to understand periods of physiological change of open and dense Caatinga. These results indicate that dense Caatinga maintains physiological activity longer, which may be associated with greater moisture maintenance in a semiarid region. In addition, because it has a greater leaf cover for longer periods, the soil may be preserved and maintain its characteristics longer, reducing the effects of desertification. The results may be associated with the type of forest management and conservation in this region. The total or partial suppression of individual remnants of Caatinga should be avoided, since the most open areas have lower photosynthetic capacity, affected to a considerable extent from the effects of adverse climatic conditions. Additionally, open Caatinga has a reduced capacity for regenerating naturally and its use by communities in this semiarid region should be limited.",dejesus_temporalphenologicalprofilesdense_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA

It focused on the main causes for late diagnosis and relatively poor prognosis in these patients. Early detection of melanoma is vital to reduce mortality in these patients and surgery is often curative. Adequate treatment of elderly patients with melanoma requires knowledge of the clinical features and histopathology of the disease, and the therapeutic options. This review also examined the main surgical procedures for primary melanoma and regional lymph node staging, and the curative and palliative procedures indicated for those elderly patients with advanced disease. It is expected that several molecular genetic factors will soon provide further prognostic information of possible benefit for elderly patients with melanoma.

Ecological Risk Pattern Based On Land Use Changes In Jiangsu Coastal Areas,"Xu, F. and Lü, X.",2018,"In order to assess ecological risk caused by land use changes in a region with a rapidly developing economy, based on remote sensing data of land use in Jiangsu coastal areas in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015, this study analyzed the land use changes and its transformation, quantitatively supported by Geographic Information System(GIS). The present study built an ecological risk index based on the landscape disturbance index and vulnerability index, and then the spatial and temporal dynamic changes of landscape ecological risk were quantitatively evaluated using geostatistical analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis. The results showed that the ecological security of Jiangsu coastal areas had improved, and the average ecological risk value of the entire region decreased from 0.1563 in 1990 to 0.1529 in 2015. In the last 25 years, the moderate ecological risk level covered the largest area of the study region; the higher ecological risk level was mainly distributed in the cultivated land of the southwestern region and the waters of the western region of the study area, and its area decreased. Grade reduction zones of ecological risk were mainly concentrated in the higher ecological risk area, moderate ecological risk area, and lower ecological risk area. Meanwhile, grade increase zones of ecological risk were mainly concentrated in the lower ecological risk area and moderate ecological risk area, that is, the grassland and waters of the eastern region of the study area and the cultivated land of the southwestern region. The rapid development of the port industry and new coastal town resulted in the intensification of land use change, which damaged the balance of the ecosystems. The overall spatial difference of ecological risk in the study area had increased, showing the high-high aggregation and low-low aggregation in the local area. The area of high value primarily aggregated gathered south along the western boundary of the study area, and the low value aggregation region was largely distributed in the northeast of the study area and the eastern coastal areas. In addition, arable land, waterbodies, and construction land were the main sources of ecological risk in the study area. The results of the present study could provide a scientific theoretical basis and reliable technical support for the realization of land sustainable utilization, promoting the coordinated development of land use and environment protection, and the policy making of ecological risk management. © 2018 Science Press.

Grazing Influences Biomass Production And Protein Content Of Alpine Meadows,"Jarque-Bascunana, Laia and Ibanez, Miguel and Bartolome, Jordi and Albanell, Elena and Espunyes, Johan and Galvez-Ceron, Arturo and Villamuelas, Miriam and Gasso, Diana and Fernandez-Aguilar, Xavier and Colom-Cadena, Andreu and Serrano, Emmanuel and Calleja, Juan Antonio and Lopez-Martin, Josep Maria and Krumins, Jennifer Adams",2022,"Alpine grasslands are essential for carbon sequestration and food supply for domestic and wild herbivores inhabiting mountainous areas worldwide. These biomes, however, are alternatively threatened by the abandonment of agricultural and livestock practices leading to a fast-growing shrubification process while other mountain grasslands are suffering from the impacts of overgrazing. The functioning of alpine meadow ecosystems is primarily driven by climatic conditions, land-use legacies and grazing. However, although it is critically important, the role of large herbivores on the aboveground biomass and protein content of palatable plants is poorly understood for most alpine meadows. In this work, we explore the effects of grazing on grassland vegetation at two different spatial and temporal scales in the Eastern Pyrenees, Spain. Remote sensing was used to assess the effect of high and moderate grazing (HG and MG respectively) on grass biomass using the leaf area index (LAI) at the meso-scale (patches between 2.3 and 38.7 ha). We also explored the impact of null (NG), overgrazing (MO, mimicked overgrazing) and high (HG) grazing intensities at local scale setting eighteen 1 m2 exclusion boxes in six meadows (three boxes each) commonly used by domestic and wild ungulates. Historical satellite data showed that LAI values are greater in high than in low grazed areas (HG, mean = 0.66, LG, mean = 0.55). Along the same lines, high and moderate grazing pressures improved biomass production at the local-scale (HG, mean = 590.3 g/m(2), MO, mean = 389.3 g/m(2) and NG, mean = 110.8 g/m(2)). Crude protein content reached higher values under MO pressure than under HG pressure. Our results confirm that grazing intensity exerts significant changes on the above-ground biomass production and the protein content of plants consumed by domestic (cattle and horses) and wild ungulates (Southern Chamois, Rupicapra pyrenaica). We can conclude that ungulates sustain biomass and nutritive values of grass exerting a negligible effect on biomass and protein content of woody vegetation. Our results will inform management guidelines to support profitable grazing activities and promote conservation of the open landscapes in the alpine ecosystems under the current global change scenario.",jarquebascunana_grazinginfluencesbiomassproduction_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Development Of A Low Cost, Gps-Based Upgrade To A Standard Handheld Gamma Detector For Mapping Environmental Radioactive Contamination","Paridaens, J.",2006,"A low cost extension to a standard handheld radiation monitor was developed, allowing one to perform outdoor georeferenced gamma measurements. It consists of a commercial wireless Bluetooth® GPS receiver, a commercial RS-232 to Bluetooth® converter combined with a standard Bluetooth® enabled pocket personal computer (PPC). The system is intended for use in difficult to access areas, typically for foot campaigns. As the operator walks, a straightforward homemade visual basic program alternately reads GPS position and gamma dose rate into the PPC, creating a data log. This allows a single operator on foot to map between 50 and 200 ha of environmental radiation per day in very rugged areas, depending on the accessiblity of the terrain and the detail required. On a test field with known contamination, a spatial precision of about 5-10 m was obtainable. The device was also used to reveal complex contamination patterns in the flooding zones of a radioactively contaminated small river. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Gis To Develop A Model For Forest Fire Risk Mapping,"Abedi Gheshlaghi, H.",2019,"Forests are the most beautiful natural resources around the world and play a pivotal role in preserving environmental balance. An important measure taken for managing and protecting forest areas as well as for decreasing the potential damages caused by the fire is the detection of regions susceptible to forest fire through forest fire risk mapping with different models and methods. In recent years, a geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) have been successfully applied in the production of forest fire risk maps. In this study, GIS-based analytical network process as MCDA method was employed in order to provide the fire risk map of Noshahr Forests (North Iran) using slope, slope aspect, altitude, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index, annual rainfall, annual temperature, distance to settlements, and distance to road as input data. Furthermore, to prepare the map of the distribution of occurred fires, MODIS fire product and wide-field observations were used. Thereafter, each of these subcriteria of the utilized factors was standardized according to their significance in a forest fire and then with the extracted coefficients in the analytical network process model merged in ArcGIS software. Finally, the fire risk map was generated. Evaluation of the results obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the designed model has good accuracy with a value of under curve area of 0.783. According to the map prepared, 57.45% of the study area (1034.41 km2) is located in the high and very high-risk classes. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",abedigheshlaghi_gisdevelopmodelforest_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
A Supply-Demand Model Of Vegetation Cooling For Urban Heatwave Mitigation,"Li, Wenning and Sun, Ranhao",2023,"The tradeoff between heatwave-induced human health risks and vegetation heat mitigation benefits is critical for mitigating heatwave hazards in urban regions. Currently, the heat risk study often focuses on the severity of heat risk to human health while the vegetation cooling is often ignored. Here, we proposed a new supply-demand matching model combining the vegetation cooling supply with the cooling demand induced by the high temperature. The cooling demand was assessed based on a heat exposure, population exposure, and heat vulnerability. The vegetation cooling supply was calculated by using a remote sensing-driven evapotranspiration (ET) model. Results showed: (1) The supply-demand matching model can identify cooling supply-demand mismatch zones in urban areas. (2) The vegetation ET model based on remote sensing can better represent the cooling benefits of vegetation compared to the vegetation abundance such as NDVI; (3) There was a special cluster of heat risk and cooling supply-demand mismatch in blocks of Beijing. The cooling supply and demand comparison model can inform vegetation-based intervention measures and urban planning guidelines for heat risk management.",li_supplydemandmodelvegetation_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
New Methods For Studying The Spatiotemporal Variation Of Snow Cover Based On Combination Products Of Modis Terra And Aqua,"Wang, Xianwei and Xie, Hongjie",2009,"Based on multi-day combination of Terra and Aqua MODIS snow cover products (cloud cover less than 10\%), this study developed new snow cover index (SCI), snow-covered duration/days (SCD) map, snow cover onset dates (SCOD) map and snow cover melting dates (SCMD) map, one each per hydrological year, to further examine the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover. Daily in situ snow depth observations in northern Xinjiang, China from 2001 to 2005 were used to validate the new maps. Our results indicate that the SCD maps had an overall agreement of 90\% with in situ observations of snow cover days at 20 stations in the study area, and the SCOD and SCMD maps also had good agreements with the in situ measurements, with a mean value of 1 week forward shift and 1 week back-ward shift, respectively, due to transient snowfall events in early fall and in late spring. The snow cover index (SCI) (km(2) day), first proposed here, contains both snow cover duration and extent for 1 hydrological year and indicates that the 2001-2002 hydrologic year had the most snow cover while the 2005-2006 had the least. While the SCD map provides the snow cover duration/days of each pixel in a hydrologic year, the SCOD and SCMD maps give specific dates when the snow cover begins and when it melts away at the pixel. Together, SCD, SCI, SCOD and SCMD can provide crucial information on spatiotemporal variation of snow cover conditions for any region of interest. This could potentially be critical information for local water agencies for planning water use and for mitigating snow-caused disaster. Long term availability of MODIS type of snow cover data for producing such datasets is key to study the connection between snow cover change and global climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Developments In Organ Preserving Treatments For Renal Cell Cancer: Open Surgery,"Kirkali, Z and Van Poppel, H",2004,"Recent trends in cancer surgery have shown that the same cure rates can be achieved with more organ and tissue sparing techniques and multimodal approaches. Developments in technology and better patient care now render most operations to be possible. In the past radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) used to save many lives because most of the patients were presenting at advanced stages. Thanks to modern imaging techniques and health awareness of the public, today, most of the patients are presenting with small incidentally detected renal masses. Apart from patients requiring organ preservation for absolute and relative indications, most patients today are enjoying the benefits of nephron sparing surgery (NSS) in an elective setting. The crucial step in NSS is to get control of the renal vessels first and to expose the whole kidney to look for satellite cortical lesions. A safe rim of healthy tissue has to be removed together with the tumor. All bleeders are sutured, and if the collecting system is entered, it should be repaired. The parenchyma is sutured for approximation with absorbable sutures. The long term results with NSS show acceptable oncological outcome. The rate of complications of NSS has dramatically decreased with better patient selection, improved techniques and better management. All patients should be informed of the complications, recurrence rates and follow-up conditions. The advances in laparoscopic techniques now render NSS possible in selected patients. However, this is an extremely challenging operation, and can only be performed in expert hands. New technology is also emerging utilizing new forms of energy for tumor destruction and ultimately for nephron sparing approaches in localized RCC. As we are detecting more small renal masses, some of which are benign, NSS will remain to be the treatment of choice for these patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Linking Critical Zone With Watershed Science: The Example Of The Heihe River Basin,"Li, Xin and Cheng, Guodong and Fu, Bojie and Xia, Jun and Zhang, Ling and Yang, Dawen and Zheng, Chunmiao and Liu, Shaomin and Li, Xiubin and Song, Changqing and Kang, Shaozhong and Li, Xiaoyan and Che, Tao and Zheng, Yi and Zhou, Yanzhao and Wang, Haibo and Ran, Youhua",2022,"Watersheds are the basic unit of Earth's terrestrial systems and are therefore ideal units for the study of critical zones (CZs). However, grand challenges remain regarding the observation, modeling, and management of CZs and watershed systems. We synthesize the progress and breakthroughs associated with watershed science and CZ research in the Heihe River basin (HRB), a large-scale endorheic river basin with unique mountain cryosphere-oasis-desert landscapes and prominent human-nature competition for water resources. The HRB observation system consists of mountain cryosphere, agricultural oasis, and natural oasis observatories and is promoted by large-scale comprehensive experiments to achieve multiscale observations. A watershed system model that couples ecohydrological models with socioeconomic models is developed to investigate the complex interactions among water, ecology, and socioeconomics in the HRB. The model is embedded in a decision support system to bridge science and decision-making and to better serve river basin sustainability. Significant progress and breakthroughs have been made in CZ and watershed process research (e.g., cryospheric hydrological processes, ecological and hydrological interactions, and surface-groundwater interactions) in the HRB. Nevertheless, observation and modeling of geochemical and geomorphological processes in the CZ have not been well addressed in integrated watershed studies of the HRB. In the future, new observation technologies, agent-based models, machine learning, and data assimilation will benefit both watershed science and CZ science and help to address complexity and dynamics in the CZ at the river basin scale.

"Effects Of Long-Term Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Ecosystem Service Values: An Example From The Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia","Mekuria, Wolde and Diyasa, Merga and Tengberg, Anna and Haileslassie, Amare",2021,"Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are the leading contributors to the decline and loss of ecosystem services in the world. The present study covered the Central Rift Valley lakes basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the valley floor and the East and West escarpments, to analyze changes in LULC and to estimate associated losses in ecosystem service values (ESVs). Covering both upstream and downstream areas in the basin, the study addressed major gaps in existing studies by connecting the sources and sinks of material (e.g., sediment and water) in source-to-lake systems. Additionally, the study facilitated the identification of critical areas for conserving natural resources and reversing the decline of associated ESVs in the Central Rift Valley. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1973 and 2020 using four Landsat images from 1973, 1990, 2005 and 2020. The value transfer valuation method was used to estimate the changes in ESVs due to LULC changes. Among the seven major identified LULC classes, farmlands, settlements, and bare lands showed positive changes, while forestlands, grasslands, shrublands and waterbodies showed negative changes over the last 47 years. The expansion of farmlands, for example, has occurred at the expense of grasslands, forestlands and shrublands. The changes in LULC over a period of 47 years resulted in a total loss of US \$62,110.4 x 10(6) in ESVs. The contributors to the overall loss of ESVs in decreasing order are provisioning services (US \$33,795.1 x 10(6)), cultural services (US \$28,981.5 x 10(6)) and regulating services (US \$652.9 x 10(6)). The results imply that addressing the degradation of land and water resources is crucial to reversing the loss of ecosystem services and achieving the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food and water security (SDGs 2 and 6) and life on land (SDG 15).",mekuria_effectstermlandland_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Improved Understanding Of Vegetation Dynamics And Wetland Ecohydrology Via Monthly Uav-Based Classification,"Wu, S. and Tetzlaff, D. and Daempfling, H. and Soulsby, C.",2023,"Vegetation classification is an essential prerequisite for understanding vegetation-water relations at a range of spatial scales. However, in site-specific applications, such classifications were mostly based on a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight, which can be challenging in grasslands and/or herbaceous-dominated systems, as those communities are small in size and highly mixed. Here, we conducted monthly UAV flights for two years in a riparian wetland in Germany, with acquired imagery used for vegetation classification on a monthly basis under different strategies (with or without auxiliary information from other flights) to increase understanding in ecohydrology. The results show that multi-flight-based classification outperformed single-flight-based classification due to the higher classification accuracy. Moreover, improved sensitivity of temporal changes in community distribution highlights the benefits of multi-flight-based classification - providing a more comprehensive picture of community evolution. From reference to the monthly community distribution, we argue that a combination of two or three flights in early- and late-summer is enough to achieve comparable results to monthly flights, while mid-summer would be a better timing in case only one flight is scheduled. With such detailed vegetation mapping, we further interpreted the complex spatio-temporal heterogeneity in NDVI and explored the dominant areas and developmental progress of each community. Impacts from management (mowing events) were also evaluated based on the different responses between communities in two years. Finally, we explored how such vegetation mapping could help understand landscape ecohydrology, and found that the spatio-temporal distribution of minimal soil moisture was related to NDVI peaks of local community, while grass distribution was explained by both topography and low moisture conditions. Such bi-directional relationships proved that apart from contributing to an evidence base for wetland management, multi-flight UAV vegetation mapping could also provide fundamental insights into the ecohydrology of wetlands. © 2023 The Authors.

Ecological Conditions Influence Sentinel Decisions,"Hollen, L. I. and Bell, M. B. V. and Wade, H. M. and Rose, R. and Russell, A. and Niven, F. and Ridley, A. R. and Radford, A. N.",2011,"Ecological conditions can influence decisions relating to antipredator behaviour through impacts on the likelihood of detecting predators and the ability to hear vocalizations. Previous studies of antipredator behaviour have tended to focus on foragers, whose vigilance behaviour may be confounded by the type of food they are eating, and on receivers in vocal communication networks. We examined the impact of habitat and wind conditions on the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that suspend their own foraging to adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates continue feeding, and that produce a variety of calls used by foragers to adjust their antipredator behaviour. Sentinels of the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird, started guarding sooner and guarded for longer in long grass compared to more open habitats, and also initiated sentinel bouts sooner in high wind, probably because of the increased predation risk in such circumstances. Sentinels also selected positions that were both lower and closer to the foraging group when it was windy, potentially improving transmission of vocal signals that are valuable to foragers. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour can be influenced by extrinsic factors, as well as the intrinsic factors previously shown, and suggest that ecological variation may affect decisions bearing both selfish and cooperative benefits.

Nevertheless, nearly three decades of controversies resulted in a heavily polarized policy environment, calling for further efforts. Against this backdrop the EU funded project GRACE explored the value of evidence synthesis approaches for GMO impact assessment and developed an evidence synthesis framework with a strong emphasis on openness, stakeholder engagement, transparency, and responsiveness to tackle regulatory science challenges. This framework was tested and implemented in the course of 14 systematic reviews or maps conducted on selected review questions spanning potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts of GMOs. An inclusive development and pri-oritisation of review questions is of key importance in evidence synthesis as it helps to provide a better link between stakeholder demands and concerns and policy relevant outcomes.

Fine Identification And Biomass Estimation Of Mangroves Based On Uav Multispectral And Lidar,"Wu, P. and Ren, G. and Zhang, C. and Wang, H. and Liu, S. and Ma, Y.",2022,"Mangroves are special types of woody plants that grow exclusively in the intertidal zones of the tropics and the subtropics. With respect to environmental and ecological values, mangroves protect the shoreline from tides, winds, and storms and act as the first line of defense against extreme weather in coastal areas. Moreover, mangroves have a continuous carbon fixation capacity, which is much higher than those of peat swamp and coastal salt marsh. Mangroves are an important part of the earth carbon cycle system and considered an important blue carbon sink on the sea and land margin. However, mangrove habitat is threatened all over the world due to human development and utilization activities. Therefore, monitoring the spatial distribution of mangrove types and biomass will help guide policy-makers in taking effective utilization and protection measures. In this paper, on the basis of UAV multispectral images and LiDAR point cloud data, the support vector machine classification method is used for mangrove identification. Furthermore, mangrove species are distinguished according to different heights and distribution areas using the elevation information in the UAV LiDAR point cloud data. The structure characteristics of mangrove single wood are extracted by the point-cloud-based cluster segmentation method, and an estimation model of the tree height, canopy, and aboveground biomass obtained by LiDAR remote sensing is constructed, Finally, the aboveground biomass of mangrove in the study area is calculated, and its spatial distribution information is analyzed. The classification result of the species types of mangroves, which is combined with the multi spectrum and LiDAR point cloud data, can reach 90.69% in total accuracy. The kappa coefficient is 0.88. The accuracies of the algorithm in identifying single trees of Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculata are 86.71% and 60.21%, respectively. Among them, the middle errors of the heights of K. candel and A. corniculata are 0.36 and 0.18 m, respectively, and the crown width extraction precision of K. candel is higher than that of A. corniculata. The regression models of the aboveground biomass of K. candel and A. corniculata are constructed. The accuracy of the fusion model is the highest, and the respective decision coefficients (R²) are 0.678 and 0.832 for K. candel and A. corniculata. Mangroves are mostly planted artificially in the study area and distributed in a belt perpendicular to the dam: K. candel—Cyperus malaccensis Lam. and Acanthus ilicifolius L. —A. corniculata. The area of A. corniculata is the largest, which is approximately 8.91 hm2 and distributed on both sides of the tidal ditch far from the dam. The area of K. candel is 4.69 hm2, which is distributed in the area near the dam. C. malaccensis Lam. and A. ilicifolius L. are scattered in small areas among the different types of objects.

Forecasting Models For Surface Water Quality Using Predictive Analytics,"Veerendra, G. T. N. and Kumaravel, B. and Rao, P. Kodanda Rama and Dey, Subhashish and Manoj, A. V. Phani",2023,"Modeling surface water quality has become crucial in providing better strategies for managing surface water resources, and adequate findings need accurate and geographically dispersed data. Hydrogeological modeling of these data sets is possible using empirically-based models. The other statistical models are also an alternative approach. In this study, a process with maximum probability is considered with the help of machine learning tools (MLT) to have optimized and valid output. The proposed method combines remote sensing and geographic information systems (RS and GIS) and MLT, which are appropriate for the predicament of neither small, large scale, nor long-term simulations. MLT methods such as VAR and ARIMA are developed in the Python programming with Jupyter notebook and tested according to the data in the spatial prediction for surface water quality parameters such as Tr, pH, Ec, TDS, AL, Ca++, NO3-, So, Cl, F-, Fe, and Mg2+ in the Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India-lower delta part. The delta with susceptible zones was identified using RS and GIS as those areas are prone to direct exposure to surface water contaminants from aquaculture, agricultural runoff, small- and medium-scale businesses, and household trash. Achieving effective surface water management for this ecosystem is critical for regional water management. The geographical information about the concentrations acquired via the RS and GIS was compared to the statistical modeling findings and verified using real-time measurements. MLT modeling seems more realistic than the experimental setting; data from the previous 20 years (2000-2020) were used for modeling, and the predicted values presented in the paper are predicted for the year 2021. The computed R-2 value of ranges between 0.75 and 0.96\% is recorded with ARIMA, and VAR posted range between 0.56 and 0.75\% with the trained and tested data. The findings show the potential for MLT of geographically dispersed hydrogeological data to be used for pollution-free surface water management. From the surface water management perspective, combining RS and GIS and MLT offers an alternate data analysis approach for obtaining quick results utilizing a less laborious process that produces acceptable results.",veerendra_forecastingmodelssurfacewater_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Peat Consumption And Carbon Loss Due To Smouldering Wildfire In A Temperate Peatland,"Davies, G. Matt and Gray, Alan and Rein, Guillermo and Legg, Colin J.",2013,"Temperate peatlands represent a substantial store of carbon and their degradation is a potentially significant positive feedback to climate change. The ignition of peat deposits can cause smouldering wildfires that have the potential to release substantial amounts of carbon and to cause environmental damage from which ecosystem recovery can be slow. Direct estimates of the loss of carbon due to smouldering wildfires are needed to inform global estimates of the effect of wildfire on carbon dynamics and to aid with national emissions accounting. We surveyed the effect of a severe wildfire that burnt within an afforested peatland in the Scottish Highlands during the summer of 2006. The fire ignited layers of peat which continued to burn as a sub-surface smouldering wildfire for more than a month after the initial surface fire and despite several episodes of heavy rain. The smouldering fire perimeter enclosed an area of 4.1 ha. Analysis of weather records showed that the fire coincided with unusually warm, dry conditions and a period when the Canadian Fire Weather Index system predicted both generally high danger conditions (high Fire Weather Index) and low fuel moisture content in deep organic soil layers (high Drought Code values). Remaining peat layers in the burn area had comparatively low fuel moisture contents of ca. 250\% dry weight. Within the smouldering fire's perimeter, mean depth of burn was estimated at 17.5 +/- 2.0 cm but ranged from 1 to 54 cm. Based on field measurements, our estimates suggested that, in total, the smouldering wildfire burnt 773 +/- 120 t of organic matter corresponding to 396 +/- 63 t of carbon and a carbon loss per unit area burnt of 96 +/- 15 t ha(-1) (9.6 +/- 1.5 kg m(-2)). This corresponds to between 0.1\% and 0.3\% of the estimated total amount of carbon sequestered annually by UK peatlands. Our results also provide circumstantial evidence that afforestation of peatland soils, and associated site preparation, may contribute to an increased risk of peat fires. Smouldering fires are difficult to detect using remotely sensing techniques due to their low temperature and low heat release and the fact that the tree canopy remains intact for months afterwards. If similar smouldering fires are underreported in other temperate, boreal and tropical peatland regions then emissions from peatland burning may well be a substantially greater issue than currently assumed.

Information Content Of In Situ And Remotely Sensed Chlorophyll-A: Learning From Size-Structured Phytoplankton Model,"Laiolo, Leonardo and Matear, Richard and Baird, Mark E. and Soja-Wozniak, Monika and Doblin, Martina A.",2018,"Chlorophyll-a measurements in the form of in situ observations and satellite ocean colour products are commonly used in data assimilation to calibrate marine biogeochemical models. Here, a two size-class phytoplankton biogeochemical model, with a OD configuration, was used to simulate the surface chlorophyll-a dynamics (simulated surface Chl-a) for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies off East Australia. An optical model was then used to calculate the inherent optical properties from the simulation and convert them into remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). Subsequently, R-rs was used to produce a satellite-like estimate of the simulated surface Chl-a concentrations through the MODIS OC3M algorithm (simulated OC3M Chl-a). Identical parameter optimisation experiments were performed through the assimilation of the two separate datasets (simulated surface Chl-a and simulated OC3M Chl-a), with the purpose of investigating the contrasting information content of simulated surface Chl-a and remotely-sensed data sources. The results we present are based on the analysis of the distribution of a cost function, varying four parameters of the biogeochemical model. In our idealized experiments the simulated OC3M Chl-a product is a poor proxy for the total simulated surface Chl-a concentration. Furthermore, our result show the OC3M algorithm can underestimate the simulated chlorophyll-a concentration in offshore eddies off East Australia (Case I waters), because of the weak relationship between large-sized phytoplankton and remote-sensing reflectance. Although Case I waters are usually characteristic of oligotrophic environments, with a photosynthetic community typically represented by relatively small-sized phytoplankton, mesoscale features such as eddies can generate seasonally favourable conditions for a photosynthetic community with a greater proportion of large phytoplankton cells. Furthermore, our results show that in mesoscale features such as eddies, in situ chlorophyll-a observations and the ocean colour products can carry different information related to phytoplankton sizes. Assimilating both remote-sensing reflectance and measurements of in situ chlorophyll-a concentration reduces the uncertainty of the parameter values more than either data set alone, thus reducing the spread of acceptable solutions, giving an improved simulation of the natural environment.",laiolo_informationcontentsituremotely_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Multi-Scale Model Analysis Of Boundary Layer Ozone Over East Asia,"Lin, M. and Holloway, T. and Oki, T. and Streets, D. G. and Richter, A.",2009,"This study employs the regional Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to examine seasonal and diurnal variations of boundary layer ozone (O-3) over East Asia. We evaluate the response of model simulations of boundary layer O-3 to the choice of chemical mechanisms, meteorological fields, boundary conditions, and model resolutions. Data obtained from surface stations, aircraft measurements, and satellites are used to advance understanding of O-3 chemistry and mechanisms over East Asia and evaluate how well the model represents the observed features. Satellite measurements and model simulations of summertime rainfall are used to assess the impact of the Asian monsoon on O-3 production. Our results suggest that summertime O-3 over Central Eastern China is highly sensitive to cloud cover and monsoonal rainfall over this region. Thus, accurate simulation of the East Asia summer monsoon is critical to model analysis of atmospheric chemistry over China. Examination of hourly summertime O-3 mixing ratios from sites in Japan confirms the important role of diurnal boundary layer fluctuations in controlling ground-level O-3. By comparing five different model configurations with observations at six sites, the specific mechanisms responsible for model behavior are identified and discussed. In particular, vertical mixing, urban chemistry, and dry deposition depending on boundary layer height strongly affect model ability to capture observed behavior. Central Eastern China appears to be the most sensitive region in our study to the choice of chemical mechanisms. Evaluation with TRACE-P aircraft measurements reveals that neither the CB4 nor the SAPRC99 mechanisms consistently capture observed behavior of key photochemical oxidants in springtime. However, our analysis finds that SAPRC99 performs somewhat better in simulating mixing ratios of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate) at flight altitudes below 1 km. The high level of uncertainty associated with O-3 production in Central Eastern China poses a major problem for regional air quality management. This highly polluted, densely populated region would greatly benefit from comprehensive air quality monitoring and the development of model chemical mechanisms appropriate to this unique atmospheric environment.",lin_multiscalemodelanalysis_2009,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Tempo-Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Assessment From The Perspective Of Human Engineering Activity,"Zeng, Taorui and Guo, Zizheng and Wang, Linfeng and Jin, Bijing and Wu, Fayou and Guo, Rujun",2023,"The expansion of mountainous urban areas and road networks can influence the terrain, vegetation, and material characteristics, thereby altering the susceptibility of landslides. Understanding the relationship between human engineering activities and landslide occurrence is of great significance for both landslide prevention and land resource management. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the landslide caused by Typhoon Megi in 2016. A representative mountainous area along the eastern coast of China-characterized by urban development, deforestation, and severe road expansion-was used to analyze the spatial distribution of landslides. For this purpose, high-precision Planet optical remote sensing images were used to obtain the landslide inventory related to the Typhoon Megi event. The main innovative features are as follows: (i) the newly developed patch generating land-use simulation (PLUS) model simulated and analyzed the driving factors of land-use land-cover (LULC) from 2010 to 2060; (ii) the innovative stacking strategy combined three strong ensemble models-Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)-to calculate the distribution of landslide susceptibility; and (iii) distance from road and LULC maps were used as short-term and long-term dynamic factors to examine the impact of human engineering activities on landslide susceptibility. The results show that the maximum expansion area of built-up land from 2010 to 2020 was 13.433 km(2), mainly expanding forest land and cropland land, with areas of 8.28 km(2 )and 5.99 km(2), respectively. The predicted LULC map for 2060 shows a growth of 45.88 km(2) in the built-up land, mainly distributed around government residences in areas with relatively flat terrain and frequent socio-economic activities. The factor contribution shows that distance from road has a higher impact than LULC. The Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM model obtained the optimal AUC value of 0.915 in the landslide susceptibility analysis in 2016. Furthermore, future road network and urban expansion have intensified the probability of landslides occurring in urban areas in 2015. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the PLUS and Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM models in landslide susceptibility analysis in international literature. The research results can serve as a foundation for developing land management guidelines to reduce the risk of landslide failures.",zeng_tempospatiallandslidesusceptibility_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Assessment Of Tropical Cyclone Rainfall From Gsmap And Gpm Products And Their Application To Analog Forecasting In The Philippines,"Bagtasa, Gerry",2022,"Tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall is both a resource and a hazard in the Philippines. Observation of its spatiotemporal distribution is necessary for water and disaster mitigation management. This study evaluated the performance of two high-resolution satellite precipitation datasets-the GSMaP and GPM-IMERG-in estimating accumulated TC rainfall in the Philippines from 2000 to 2021. TC rain is defined as rainfall within 5 degrees of a TC center. Several estimation algorithms were included in the assessment. The uncalibrated near-real-time GSMaP\_NRT and early version GPM\_ER, the reanalysis GSMaP\_RNL, and the gauge-calibrated GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G. The assessment shows the worst scores for the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT and GSMaP\_RNL, followed by GPM\_ER with station correlation coefficient (CC) values of 0.63, 0.67, and 0.73, respectively, compared to GSMaP\_G CC of 0.79 and GPM\_G CC of 0.77. GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G also gave the least bias and error, with a consistently high (>0.6) probability of detection (POD) and Pierce skill score (PSS) up to rainfall of 300 mm. In addition to the evaluation, the GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G were used in the analog forecasting of TC rain. Analog forecasting is based on the principle that past weather conditions can occur again. In TC rain analog forecasting, past TCs with similar intensities and tracks are assumed to bring similar rainfall amounts and distribution as a current TC. Composite mean TC rainfall from historical satellite precipitation estimations was produced to create TC rain forecasts. Results show the analog TC rain forecasts generally captured the spatial distribution of TC rain and performed better than the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT, with a mean station correlation of 0.62-0.67, POD greater than 0.7, and positive PSS indicating good skills. However, forecasts have a false alarm ratio greater than 0.8 for 150 mm rain and have difficulty producing extreme rainfall (>250 mm).",bagtasa_assessmenttropicalcyclonerainfall_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Here, we compared spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in three major cities (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang) in the Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration using multi-temporal Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM+ images data of circa 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and landscape analysis approaches. A multi-scale analysis on the landscape responses to urban expansion from regional landscape to city and within city levels was performed. Results showed that urban area in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang has expanded from 801 km(2), 795 km(2) and 682 km(2) to 2452 km(2), 3343 km(2) and 1699 km(2), increasing annually at 3.7\%, 4.7\% and 3.2\%, respectively. Spatially, Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang have presented a mononuclear concentric polygon pattern, a double-nucleated polygon-line pattern, a sectorial point pattern, respectively, resulting primarily from their respective topographic constraints as well as urban planning and policy. Landscape responses to urban expansion varied with time and scale investigated, suggesting a general understanding on landscape metrics at regional or city level may fail to reveal detailed within city landscape dynamics under the impacts of urban expansion. The Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration faces a great challenge to manage trades-offs between narrowing down intra-regional disparity and maintaining regional economic and ecological benefits.

This study evaluates past and present land use pattern of the basin and determines the spatial variation of land cover classes across it sub-basins. Landsat images, 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2018, were classified using the spectral angle mapping technique. Six land use classes were identified and classified, namely, closed forest, open forest, farm/grassland, settlement, mining, and water. The results showed that the basin has been experiencing changes in the spatial patterns and distribution of LULC classes. Generally, closed forest and open forest decreased with mean values of 10\% and 11\% respectively, towards settlement, farming, and mining which increased with mean values of 7.8\%, 12.4\%, and 1.0\% respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the change in land use classes varied across the sub-basins. Settlement increased consistently in all the sub-basins; however, Oda and Upper Ofin increased greatly towards peri-urban residential and commercial land uses. Similarly, illegal mining activities recorded severe increase in Anum, Birim, Lower Ofin, and Twifu Praso sub-basins. Farm/grassland increased specifically in Lower Pra, Assin Praso, Twifo Praso, Birim, and Upper Ofin sub-basins. The main drivers identified in the study includes population growth and migration, response to socio-economic conditions and policies, and availability of mineral resources.

However, locating the groundwater potential zones in dry and mountainous regions of many developing countries which lack suitable economic and human resources is challenging. The integrated approach of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) can offer a solution to this problem as it is useful to fetch first-hand information and has wider applicability. The present study focuses on delineating of groundwater potential zones in Pohru Watershed, of Jhelum Basin-Western Himalaya, India by integrating RS, GIS and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Seven thematic layers, namely lithology, geomorphology, soil, land use/land cover, slope, drainage density and lineament density have been used in this study. The parameters were weighted using AHP according to their importance in determining the groundwater potential. Five major groundwater potential zones were identified as: Very High (18.14\%), High (18.17\%), Moderate (19.03\%), Low (41.75\%) and Very Low (2.88\%). The findings reveal that High and Very High Potential Zones are concentrated in the alluvial plains and the adjoining fluvio-lacustrine deposits/ Karewas. However, the highly or moderately dissected hills and the mountain ridges mostly comprise of Low and Very Low groundwater potential zones. The residual hills comprise of Medium and Low groundwater potential zones. The analysis of location and water depth of groundwater wells in the study area was found in accordance with the mapped groundwater potential zones, which validates our study. The Area Under Curve (AUC) value of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for AHP method was calculated as 0.7037, which corresponds to the prediction accuracy of 70.37\%, indicating Moderate to High predictability of groundwater recharge zones for the study region.",rather_mappinggroundwaterpotentialzones_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Spatial Heterogeneity Evaluation And Zoning Of Production-Living-Ecological Space Based On Multi-Source Spatial Data,"Zhang, Y. and Luan, Q. and Xiong, C. and Liu, X.",2021,"Production-living-ecological space is a typical spatial carrier to coordinate economic, social, and ecological benefits. Its coordinated development has been greatly significant to promote the ecological civilization, even to optimize the spatial planning in land use. However, the spatial function differentiation is still lacking on the different plots in the same land type, particularly in the most current evaluation on the production-living-ecological space. The clustering or Coordination Degree (CD) is also less sufficient in production-living-ecological space. The purpose of this study is to improve the evaluation system of production-living-ecological space, further to partition its aggregation and coordination degree for the land-use spatial optimization. An integration of multi-source spatial data was implemented to evaluate the functions of production-living-ecological space in different plots with the same land from the grid scale, with emphasis on the perspective of spatial heterogeneity. A systematic analysis was then made on the spatial autocorrelation and trigonometric coordinates. As such, the clustering and coordination characteristics were revealed on the production-living-ecological space on the township scale. Zoning schemes were finally proposed for the optimization of land space. The results are as follows. 1) The high score areas of production space in Hainan Island were concentrated in the coastal cities and counties, indicating the distribution characteristics of ""higher around and lower in the middle, higher in the north and lower in the south"". There were also differences between the urban and rural production spaces. The high score areas of living space were mainly concentrated in the cities and counties, with the spatial pattern of ""small part gathering and most scattered"". The high score areas of ecological space were concentrated in the middle, with the distribution characteristics of ""higher in the middle and lower around"". 2) The Moran's I indexes for the production, life, and ecological space function were 0.569, 0.221 and 0.716, respectively, in Hainan Island obtained from the township scale. It inferred that there was the strongest spatial correlation between the spatial autocorrelation characteristics and ecological space. Therefore, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial clustering. 3) There were great differences in the coordination degree of production-living-ecological space in different towns of Hainan Island. The high value areas were dominated by ecological space and coordinated type, accounting for 51.72% and 43.97% of the total number of towns, respectively. The low value area was dominated by ecology space, accounting for 72.41% of the total number of towns, where no living dominant town was observed. In the case of spatial features, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial coordination. The heterogeneity of spatial functions was effectively identified in the production-living-ecological space for the different plots with the same land type. A specific scheme of production-living-ecological spatial zoning was also proposed from two new perspectives of spatial clustering and coordination degree, suitable for the current practice of land space optimization. An optimization path of production-living-ecological spatial evaluation can provide the zoning schemes, according to the spatial characteristics. The finding can offer a potential decision making for the land space optimization, as well as the construction of free trade port and ecological civilization in Hainan Island of southern China. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

This dominant influence of regional sources was confirmed by in situ measurements during short intensive and longer-term campaigns, aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from ENVISAT, and modeling results from PMCAMx and CHIMERE chemistry transport models. While advection of sulfate is well documented for other megacities, there was surprisingly high contribution from long-range transport for both nitrate and organic aerosol. The origin of organic PM was investigated by comprehensive analysis of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), radiocarbon and tracer measurements during two intensive campaigns. Primary fossil fuel combustion emissions constituted less than 20 % in winter and 40 % in summer of carbonaceous fine PM, unexpectedly small for a megacity. Cooking activities and, during winter, residential wood burning are the major primary organic PM sources. This analysis suggests that the major part of secondary organic aerosol is of modern origin, i.e., from biogenic precursors and from wood burning. Black carbon concentrations are on the lower end of values encountered in megacities worldwide, but still represent an issue for air quality. These comparatively low air pollution levels are due to a combination of low emissions per inhabitant, flat terrain, and a meteorology that is in general not conducive to local pollution build-up.

In this study, Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) is used to observe the drought status of the wetland in the cross-border (China and North Korea) Tumen River Basin from 1991 to 2016. For this purpose, the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data for six periods were used for the analysis. Soil moisture maps acquired from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System Version 1.0 (CLDAS-V1.0) were then introduced for validating the reliability of the drought monitoring method.

Previous studies have shown that a variety of plant functional traits at the species or community level can be successfully retrieved by airborne or spaceborne imaging spectrometer in homogeneous, species-poor ecosystems. However, findings from these studies may not apply to heterogeneous, species-rich ecosystems. Here, we aim to determine whether unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imaging could adequately estimate plant community traits in a species-rich alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. To achieve this, we compared the performance of four non-parametric regression models, i.e., partial least square regression (PLSR), the generic algorithm integrated with the PLSR (GA-PLSR), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for the retrieval of 10 plant community traits using visible and near-infrared (450–950 nm) UAV hyperspectral imaging. Our results show that chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid content, starch content, specific leaf area and leaf thickness were estimated with good accuracies, with the highest R2 values between 0.64 (nRMSE = 0.16) and 0.83 (nRMSE = 0.11). Meanwhile, the estimation accuracies for nitrogen content, phosphorus content, plant height and leaf dry matter content were relatively low, with the highest R2 varying from 0.3 (nRMSE = 0.24) to 0.54 (nRMSE = 0.20). Among the four tested algorithms, the GA-PLSR produced the highest accuracy, followed by PLSR and XGBoost, and RF showed the poorest performance.

The purpose of this research is to fill a knowledge gap on the effects of reservoirs operation of the Idukki and Idamalyar to Periyar River Basin massive flooding. The proposed methodology is implemented on the Periyar River Basin located in Kerala, India, where severe flooding occurred during monsoon season in the year 2018. In this study, modelling technique has been used in two-step: (1) development of 1D physically based, distributed-parameter model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) to compute the stream flow and estimate the stream discharge at different outlet points; and (2) hybrid model is developed by linking SWAT with a well-known 2D hydrodynamic model (International River Interface Cooperative, iRIC) to display flood scenarios and to identify the flood-prone areas. The ArcSWAT user interface employed in the ArcGIS software was utilized to delineate the river basin. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated on daily and monthly basis at two gauge discharge stations, i.e., Neeleeswaram and Kalady. The statistical coefficients result obtained from SWAT model was in good agreement with the measured values for calibration and validation. The hybrid model simulation results compared with observed flood depth and remote sensing data demonstrated good capability of the model.

"Forest, Wetland And Biodiversity: Revealing Multi-Faceted Ecological Services From Ecorestoration Of A Degraded Tropical Landscape","Mallick, Priyanka Halder and Chakraborty, Susanta Kumar",2018,"With the deterioration of tropical forests, the loss of species, their habitat and linked socio-ecological degradation is regrettably becoming widespread. Although having their own contribution to sustainable development separately, the linkages between wetlands and forests exemplify the importance of managing ecosystems in their entirety to protect their ecological character and related ecosystem services (ES) that are vital to human activity. To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.

Classification Of Rare Land Cover Types: Distinguishing Annual And Perennial Crops In An Agricultural Catchment In South Korea,"Bogner, Christina and Seo, Bumsuk and Rohner, Dorian and Reineking, Bjorn",2018,"Many environmental data are inherently imbalanced, with some majority land use and land cover types dominating over rare ones. In cultivated ecosystems minority classes are often the target as they might indicate a beginning land use change. Most standard classifiers perform best on a balanced distribution of classes, and fail to detect minority classes. We used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) with Random Forest to classify land cover classes in a small agricultural catchment in South Korea using MODIS time series. This area faces a major soil erosion problem and policy measures encourage farmers to replace annual by perennial crops to mitigate this issue. Our major goal was therefore to improve the classification performance on annual and perennial crops. We compared four different classification scenarios on original imbalanced and synthetically oversampled balanced data to quantify the effect of SMOTE on classification performance. SMOTE substantially increased the true positive rate of all oversampled minority classes. However, the performance on minor classes remained lower than on the majority class. We attribute this result to a class overlap already present in the original data set that is not resolved by SMOTE. Our results show that resampling algorithms could help to derive more accurate land use and land cover maps from freely available data. These maps can be used to provide information on the distribution of land use classes in heterogeneous agricultural areas and could potentially benefit decision making.",bogner_classificationrarelandcover_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Estimation Of Grain Protein Content In Commercial Bread And Durum Wheat Fields Via Traits Inverted By Radiative Transfer Modelling From Sentinel-2 Timeseries,"Longmire, A. and Poblete, T. and Hornero, A. and Chen, D. and Zarco-Tejada, P. J.",2023,"Wheat (Triticum spp.) is crucial to food security. Grain protein content (GPC) is key to its nutritional and economic value and is controlled by genetic and agronomic factors, soil properties and weather. GPC prediction from remote sensing could reduce nitrogen (N) losses, help management decisions, and improve profit. However, GPC prediction is complex because multiple plant traits influence GPC and their effects change through the growing season. Traits with known physiological links to GPC, which can be retrieved from imaging spectroscopy, include leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll (Ca+b), and stress indicators. Further inspection of these and other traits retrieved from satellite data can advance research relevant to precision agriculture. Sentinel-2 (S2) timeseries (TS) were acquired for 6,355 ha of commercial dryland bread (T. aestivum) and durum (T. durum) wheat fields in south-east Australia through two consecutive years with dissimilar rainfall. Wheat growers provided similar to 92,000 GPC data points from harvester-mounted protein monitors. For each, Ca+b, leaf dry matter, leaf water content (C-w) and LAI were retrieved from the S2 images by radiative transfer model inversion. A gradient boosted machine learning algorithm was applied to analyse these traits' importance to GPC and to predict GPC in 30\% of samples unseen by the algorithm in training. The strongest relationships between predicted and observed GPC (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.56 \%), in a model built from five S2 images across a season, were better than those from single-date hyperspectral (HS). In severe water stress, LAI was the main predictor of GPC early in the season, but this switched to C-w later. Trait importance was more evenly distributed in milder conditions. S2 TS had a clear accuracy advantage over single-date S2 and HS, especially in benign conditions, emphasising the potential of S2 TS for large-scale GPC monitoring.",longmire_estimationgrainproteincontent_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
The Influence Of Morphological Characteristics Of Green Patch On Its Surrounding Thermal Environment,"Liu, Yanhong and Lin, Wenqi and Guo, Jinping and Wei, Qingshun and Shamseldin, Asaad Y.",2019,"In order to explore the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches on its surrounding thermal environment, the remote sensing image data of Taiyuan City was used as the basic data source, and the temperature field under the influence of morphological characteristics of green patches was simulated by CFD technique. The dimensionless parameter of relative temperature change rate was introduced as the index of thermal environment effect. From the existing shape index reflecting the patch characteristics, the indicators of the green patch affecting the surrounding thermal environment were screened out, and the corresponding quantitative relationship between them was established. Based on the statistical analysis of patch shape index and thermal environment effect index, it is pointed out that the deviation degree for equivalent perimeter of patch is positively correlated with the relative change rate of temperature reflecting thermal environment effect. Meanwhile, the smaller area of green space can be used to improve local microclimate. The introduction of CFD technology into the study of urban thermal environment provides a basis for exploring the key parameters to improve the ecological environment benefits of urban green space and determining the shape control index of patch in green space planning and design. On the other hand, the simulation function of CFD technology is used to optimize green space design, which has better significance to guide production practice.",liu_influencemorphologicalcharacteristicsgreen_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA

H. and Meir, P.",2012,"Spatially-explicit maps of aboveground biomass are essential for calculating the losses and gains in forest carbon at a regional to national level. The production of such maps across wide areas will become increasingly necessary as international efforts to protect primary forests, such as the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) mechanism, come into effect, alongside their use for management and research more generally. However, mapping biomass over high-biomass tropical forest is challenging as (1) direct regressions with optical and radar data saturate, (2) much of the tropics is persistently cloud-covered, reducing the availability of optical data, (3) many regions include steep topography, making the use of radar data complex, (5) while LiDAR data does not suffer from saturation, expensive aircraft-derived data are necessary for complete coverage. We present a solution to the problems, using a combination of terrain-corrected L-band radar data (ALOS PALSAR), spaceborne LiDAR data (ICESat GLAS) and ground-based data. We map Gabon's Lopé National Park (5000 km2) because it includes a range of vegetation types from savanna to closed-canopy tropical forest, is topographically complex, has no recent contiguous cloud-free high-resolution optical data, and the dense forest is above the saturation point for radar. Our 100 m resolution biomass map is derived from fusing spaceborne LiDAR (7142 ICESat GLAS footprints), 96 ground-based plots (average size 0.8 ha) and an unsupervised classification of terrain-corrected ALOS PALSAR radar data, from which we derive the aboveground biomass stocks of the park to be 78 Tg C (173 Mg C ha-1). This value is consistent with our field data average of 181 Mg C ha-1, from the field plots measured in 2009 covering a total of 78 ha, and which are independent as they were not used for the GLAS-biomass estimation. We estimate an uncertainty of ± 25% on our carbon stock value for the park. This error term includes uncertainties resulting from the use of a generic tropical allometric equation, the use of GLAS data to estimate Lorey's height, and the necessity of separating the landscape into distinct classes. As there is currently no spaceborne LiDAR satellite in operation (GLAS data is available for 2003-2009 only), this methodology is not suitable for change-detection.

Lidar-Based Classification Of Sagebrush Community Types,"Sankey, T. T. and Bond, P.",2011,"Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) communities constitute the largest temperate semidesert in North America and provide important rangelands for livestock and habitat for wildlife. Remote sensing methods might provide an efficient method to monitor sagebrush communities. This study used airborne LiDAR and field data to measure vegetation heights in five different community types at the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, southwestern Idaho: herbaceous-dominated, low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula) -dominated, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp.) -dominated, bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) -dominated, and other vegetation community types. The objectives were 1) to quantify the correlation between field-measured and airborne LiDAR-derived shrub heights, and 2) to determine if airborne LiDAR-derived mean vegetation heights can be used to classify the five community types. The dominant vegetation type and vegetation heights were measured in 3 × 3 m field plots. The LiDAR point cloud data were converted into a raster format to generate a maximum vegetation height map in 3-m raster cells. The regression relationship between field-based and airborne LiDAR-derived shrub heights was significant (R2=0.77; P value <0.001). An analysis of variance test with all pairwise post hoc comparisons indicated that LiDAR-derived vegetation heights were significantly different among all vegetation community types (all P values <0.01), except for herbaceous-dominated communities compared to low sagebrush-dominated communities. Although LiDAR measurements consistently underestimated vegetation heights in all community types, shrub heights at some locations were overestimated due to adjacent taller vegetation.

Spatial Modeling Of Litter And Soil Carbon Stocks On Forest Land In The Conterminous United States,"Cao, B. and Domke, G. M. and Russell, M. B. and Walters, B. F.",2019,"Forest ecosystems contribute substantially to carbon (C) storage. The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phenology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 ± 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 ± 2.38 Mg ha −1 , and the soil C stock at 0–20 cm depth was 14.68 ± 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 ± 8.98 Mg ha −1 . This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables. © 2018",cao_spatialmodelinglittersoil_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Virtual Laser Scanning With Helios++: A Novel Take On Ray Tracing-Based Simulation Of Topographic Full-Waveform 3d Laser Scanning,"Winiwarter, L. and Esmorís Pena, A. M. and Weiser, H. and Anders, K. and Martínez Sánchez, J. and Searle, M. and Höfle, B.",2022,"Topographic laser scanning is a remote sensing method to create detailed 3D point cloud representations of the Earth's surface. Since data acquisition is expensive, simulations can complement real data given certain premises are met: (i) models of 3D scene and scanner are available and (ii) modelling of the beam-scene interaction is simplified to a computationally feasible while physically realistic level. A number of laser scanning simulators for different purposes exist, which we enrich by presenting HELIOS++. HELIOS++ is an open-source simulation framework for terrestrial static, mobile, UAV-based and airborne laser scanning implemented in C++. The HELIOS++ concept provides a flexible solution for the trade-off between physical accuracy (realism) and computational complexity (runtime, memory footprint), as well as ease of use and of configuration. Features of HELIOS++ include the availability of Python bindings (pyhelios) for controlling simulations, and a range of model types for 3D scene representation. Such model types include meshes, digital terrain models, point clouds and partially transmissive voxels, which are especially useful in laser scanning simulations of vegetation. In a scene, object models of different types can be combined, so that representations spanning multiple spatial scales in different resolutions and levels of detail are possible. HELIOS++ follows a modular design, where the core components of platform, scene, and scanner can be individually interchanged, and easily configured. HELIOS++ further allows the simulation of beam divergence using a subsampling strategy, and is able to create full-waveform outputs as a basis for detailed analysis. We show how HELIOS++ positions among other VLS software in terms of input model support and simulation of beam divergence in a literature survey. We also perform a direct comparison of simulations with DART, where we employ a scene from the Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI). This example shows that HELIOS++ takes about 10 times longer than DART for parsing and preparing the 3D scene, but performs about 314,000 times faster in the beam simulation, achieving 200,000 rays/s. Comparing HELIOS++ to its predecessor, HELIOS, revealed reduced runtimes by up to 99%. Virtually scanned point clouds may be used for a broad range of applications as shown in literature. We could identify four main categories of use cases prevailing at present, which benefit from simulated LiDAR point clouds: data acquisition planning, method evaluation, method training and sensing experimentation. We conclude that a general-purpose LiDAR simulator can be employed for many different scientific applications, as long as it is ensured that the simulation adequately represents reality, which is specific to the given research question. © 2021 The Authors",winiwarter_virtuallaserscanninghelios_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Temporal And Spatial Modelling Of Tropical Deforestation: A Survival Analysis Linking Satellite And Household Survey Data,"Vance, C and Geoghegan, J",2002,"We estimate a spatially explicit model of the forest clearance process among smallholder farmers in an agricultural frontier of southern Mexico. Our analysis takes as its point of departure a simple utility-maximising model that suggests many possible determinants of deforestation in an economic environment characterised by missing or thin markets. Hypotheses from the model are tested on a data set that combines a time series of satellite imagery with data collected from a survey of farm households whose agricultural plots were geo-referenced using a global positioning system (GPS). We implement a survival analysis to identify the effect of household level explanatory variables on the probability of deforestation. This approach allows us to introduce a measure of the time until clearance as a covariate, thereby affording a control for the effect of potentially important explanatory variables that vary through time but are not directly observable. In addition to identifying several variables relevant for policy analysis, including household demographics, proximity to roads, and government provision of agricultural support, model results suggest that the deforestation process is characterised by non-linear duration dependence, with the probability of forest clearance first decreasing and then increasing with the passage of time.

Estimation Of Crop Water Productivity Using Gis And Remote Sensing Techniques,"Talpur, Zenobia and Zaidi, Arjumand Z. and Ahmed, Suhail and Mengistu, Tarekegn Dejen and Choi, Si-Jung and Chung, Il-Moon",2023,"The global demand for food is growing with the population and urbanization, which puts pressure on water resources, which need assessing and quantifying water requirements. Adopting efficient irrigation methods to optimize water use is essential in this situation. In this study, crop water productivity (CWP) of major crops in the Rohri canal command area was estimated by the ratio of yield and actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Analyzing the CWP of major crops, water scarcity challenges can be tackled by selecting the most feasible irrigation methods. However, ETa was calculated and aggregated for all four stages of the crop growth period: initial, crop development, flowering stage, and maturity seasons. The crop yield data were obtained from the districts' agricultural statistics. For this purpose, evapotranspiration products of Landsat 5 and 8 were downloaded from Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux). Landsat images were processed in a GIS environment to calculate ETa. The approach suggests developing a CWP database for major crops like wheat, cotton, and rice to improve irrigation water management. The objectives of this study are to estimate and analyze the difference in the CWP and evapotranspiration of major crops for the Rabi and Kharif seasons with high and moderate flows during 1998-2019.

"A Simple Approach For Monitoring Vegetation Change Using Time Series Remote Sensing Analysis: A Case Study From The Thathe Vondo Area In Limpopo Province, South Africa","Muavhi, Nndanduleni",2021,"This study presents a simple approach of spatiotemporal change detection of vegetation cover based on analysis of time series remotely sensed images. The study was carried out at Thathe Vondo Area, which is characterised by episodic variation of vegetation gain and loss. This variation is attributable to timber and tea plantations and their production cycles, which periodically result in either vegetation gain or loss. The approach presented here was implemented on two ASTER images acquired in 2007 and 2017. It involved the combined use of band combination, unsupervised image classification and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) techniques. True colour composite (TCC) images for 2007 and 2017 were created from combination of bands 1, 2 and 3 in red, blue and green, respectively. The difference image of the TCC images was then generated to show the inconsistencies of vegetation cover between 2007 and 2017. For analytical simplicity and interpretability, the difference image was subjected to ISODATA unsupervised classification, which clustered pixels in the difference image into eight classes. Two ISODATA derived classes were interpreted as vegetation gain and one as vegetation loss. These classes were confimed as regions of vegetation gain and loss by NDVI values of 2007 and 2017. In addition, the polygons of vegetation gain and loss regions were created and superimposed over the TCC images to further demonstrate the spatiotemporal vegetation change in the area. The vegetation change statistics show vegetation gain and loss of 10.62\% and 2.03\%, respectively, implying a vegetation gain of 8.59\% over the selected decade. Significance: Vegetation change detection is essential in environmental monitoring and management of an area. This study presents a simple approach for assessing vegetation change over time.

New Approach For Using Remotely Sensed Chlorophyll A To Identify Seabird Hotspots,"Suryan, Robert M. and Santora, Jarrod A. and Sydeman, William J.",2012,"Satellite imagery of chlorophyll a concentration (chl a) provides the only holistic perspective of productivity in marine ecosystems worldwide, yet its utility for understanding and predicting the distribution of upper trophic-level predators remains equivocal. We tested the hypothesis that remotely sensed chl a measurements spanning a decade can predict marine bird movements and distributions and provide insight into persistent seabird 'hotspots'. To test this hypothesis, we developed a temporally and spatially explicit chl a variance metric that explained up to twice the variation (90\%) in seabird distributions than mean chl a values in our model system, the California Current. Our chl a variance metric-the frequency of chlorophyll peaks index (FCPI) - quantifies the frequency of chl a anomalies that exceed 1 standard deviation from the mean, relative to a spatial model for the ecosystem. Using the FCPI, we identified locations of high chl a anomaly persistence amidst considerable habitat heterogeneity from British Columbia, Canada, to Baja California, Mexico. Calculating variance and persistence metrics such as FCPI over large temporal scales may be preferable to analyzing mean or median chl a values over shorter time scales if understanding or predicting predator distributions is a goal of the research. As a static habitat layer, we suggest that the FCPI integrates time lags, physical forcings, and food web processes that can thwart attempts to link primary productivity and predator distributions in pelagic ecosystems. Additionally, identifying important ecological areas reflecting persistently elevated productivity and predator abundance is critical to marine spatial management and conservation.",suryan_approachremotelysensedchlorophyll_2012,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Local Drivers Of Anthropogenic Climate Change: Quantifying The Impact Through A Remote Sensing Approach In Brisbane,"Mortoja, Md Golam and Yigitcanlar, Tan",2020,"Urban expansions to adjoining greenfield sites, particularly in metropolitan regions, have become a global occurrence. Such urbanization practice results in a significant loss in ecosystem services and triggers climate change-where these changes in land cover and emissions of certain pollutants are the fundamental drivers of climate change. Despite its crucial importance, little is known on how to quantify the impact of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change. This study aims to address the question of how the impacts of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change can be measured.

The methodological steps of the study are two-fold. First, we measure the greenfield development and corresponding ecosystem services losses and, then, we quantify the risk of such losses attributable to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change. The findings of the study reveal the followings: (a) the utilized remote sensing method is a useful technique in quantifying the impacts of climate change; (b) over the last 30-year period, Brisbane and its adjoining areas encountered a total loss of about USD 4.5 billion in ecosystem services, due to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change; (c) peri-urban areas encountered the biggest losses in ecosystem service values; (d) peri-urban areas experienced the highest greenhouse gas emission production levels, and; (e) ecosystem services should be backed up by robust urban management policies-this is critical for mitigating climate change.",mortoja_localdriversanthropogenicclimate_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA

However, due to data and model limitations, obtaining high-quality, high-spatial-resolution surface PM2.5 concentration data is a challenging task, and it is difficult to accurately assess the temporal and spatial changes in PM2.5 levels at a small regional scale. Here, we combined multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol products, ERA5 reanalysis data, etc., to construct an STW-LightGBM model that considers the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution and estimate the PM2.5 concentration of China's surface at 1 km resolution from 2015 to 2020. Our model performed well, and the fitting accuracy of the 10-fold cross-validation between years was 0.877-0.917. The fitting accuracy of the model was >0.85 at different time scales (month, season, and year). The average slope of the regression prediction was 0.9 annually. The results showed that PM2.5 pollution improved from 2015 to 2020. The average PM2.5 concentration decreased by 4.55 mu g/m(3), and the maximum decrease reached 90.51 mu g/m(3). The areas with high PM2.5 concentrations were predominantly in the North China Plain, Sichuan Basin, and Xinjiang in the west, and the levels in areas with elevated PM2.5 levels were consistent across most study years. The standard deviation ellipse for PM2.5 in China showed a 'northeast-southwest' spatial distribution. From an interannual perspective, the average values of the four seasonal stations in the country showed a downward trend from 2015 to 2020, with the most obvious decline in winter, from 70.67 mu g/m(3) in 2015 to 46.75 mu g/m(3) in 2020.

The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R-2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R-2>0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD similar to 0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation.

It involves constructing a multi-tiered, multi-causal data space by extracting causal relationships from data. An attention-based convolutional neural network efficiently captures the causal relationships. Pruning and expert knowledge contribute to an elaborate structure. The fault propagation direction is determined using LSTM-least-square linear (OLS) method, aiding rapid problem location. Experimental verification on float glass production and the Tennessee Eastman demonstrates remarkable results, supporting improved reliability and efficiency in industrial processes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",qiao_rootdiagnosisfaultpropagation_2024,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Distribution Of Volatile Organic Compounds Over Indian Subcontinent During Winter: Wrf-Chem Simulation Versus Observations,"Chutia, L. and Ojha, N. and Girach, I. A. and Sahu, L. K. and Alvarado, L. M. A. and Burrows, J. P. and Pathak, B. and Bhuyan, P. K.",2019,"We investigate the distribution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)over Indian subcontinent during a winter month of January 2011 combining the regional model WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry)with ground- and space-based observations and chemical reanalysis. WRF-Chem simulated VOCs are found to be comparable with ground-based observations over contrasting environments of the Indian subcontinent. WRF-Chem results reveal the elevated levels of VOCs (e. g. propane)over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (16 ppbv), followed by the Northeast region (9.1 ppbv)in comparison with other parts of the Indian subcontinent (1.3–8.2 ppbv). Higher relative abundances of propane (27–31%)and ethane (13–17%)are simulated across the Indian subcontinent. WRF-Chem simulated formaldehyde and glyoxal show the western coast, Eastern India and the Indo-Gangetic Plain as the regional hotspots, in a qualitative agreement with the MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate)reanalysis and satellite-based observations. Lower values of RGF (ratio of glyoxal to formaldehyde <0.04)suggest dominant influences of the anthropogenic emissions on the distribution of VOCs over Indian subcontinent, except the northeastern region where higher RGF (∼0.06)indicates the role of biogenic emissions, in addition to anthropogenic emissions. Analysis of HCHO/NO2 ratio shows a NOx-limited ozone production over India, with a NOx-to-VOC transition regime over central India and IGP. The study highlights a need to initiate in situ observations of VOCs over regional hotspots (Northeast, Central India, and the western coast)based on WRF-Chem results, where different satellite-based observations differ significantly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",chutia_distributionvolatileorganiccompounds_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Analysis Of Extreme Rainfall And Natural Disasters Events Using Satellite Precipitation Products In Different Regions Of Brazil,"Palharini, Rayana and Vila, Daniel and Rodrigues, Daniele and Palharini, Rodrigo and Mattos, Enrique and Undurraga, Eduardo",2022,"The number of natural disasters triggered by extreme events is increasing worldwide and significantly impacts modern society. Extreme rainfall is one of the most important factors contributing to these events. A better understanding of the physical process that causes extreme rainfall can allow rapid responses from decision-makers to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the local population. Satellite monitoring is widely used for this purpose and is essential for regions where terrestrial observations are limited or non-existent. The primary purpose of this study is to describe the performance of satellite products for extreme rainfall events that caused natural disasters in various climate regimes in Brazil and discuss the contribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) to these events. We defined regions based on the climatological rainfall distribution. Cases with rain values above the 99th percentile during 2012-2016 were considered statistically extreme. Our analysis is based on three datasets, with precipitation from (i) rain gauge stations, (ii) different satellite-based estimates, and (iii) mesoscale convective tracking data. The methodology was based on identifying extreme rainfall events, analyzing the performance of satellite precipitation estimates and, finally, quantifying the influence of convective systems on extreme rain. Although all regions of Brazil may be affected by natural disasters caused by extreme rains, the results suggest that the impacts caused in each region are different in magnitude. Convective systems explained over 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in Brazil's south and about 60\% to 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in the Northeast. In general, satellite products have identified rain events; however, in the southern region of Brazil, products have tended to overestimate rainfall, while other regions have tended to underestimate extreme rain values. The methods used in satellite precipitation estimation products have limitations to accurately identifying specific extreme rain events.",palharini_analysisextremerainfallnatural_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Air Pollution Mortality Benefits Of Sustained Covid-19 Mobility Restrictions In Australian Cities,"Chaston, T. B. and Knibbs, L. D. and Morgan, G. and Jalaludin, B. and Broome, R. and Dennekamp, M. and Johnston, F. H. and Vardoulakis, S.",2024,"Objectives: Emissions from road traffic, power generation and industry were substantially reduced during pandemic lockdown periods globally. Thus, we analysed reductions in traffic-related air pollution in Australian capital cities during March-April 2020 and then modelled the mortality benefits that could be realised if similar reductions were sustained by structural policy interventions.Study design: Satellite, air pollution monitor and land use observations were used to estimate ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in all Australian capital cities during: (a) a typical year with no prolonged air pollution events; (b) a hypothetical sustained reduction in NO2 equivalent to the COVID-19 lockdowns.Methods: We use the WHO recommended NO2 exposure-response coefficient for mortality (1.023, 95 \% CI: 1.008-1.037, per 10 mg/m3 annual average) to assess gains in life expectancy and population-wide years of life from reduced exposure to traffic-related air pollution.Results: We attribute 1.1 \% of deaths to anthropogenic NO2 exposures in Australian cities, corresponding to a total of 13,340 years of life lost annually. Although COVID-19-related reductions in NO2 varied widely between Australian cities during April 2020, equivalent and sustained reductions in NO2 emissions could reduce NO2-attributable deaths by 27 \%, resulting in 3348 years of life gained annually.Conclusions: COVID-19 mobility restrictions reduced NO2 emissions and population-wide exposures in Australian cities. When sustained to the same extent by policy interventions that reduce fossil fuel consumption by favouring the uptake of electric vehicles, active travel and public transport, the health, mortality and economic benefits will be measurable in Australian cities.(c) 2023 The Royal Society for Public Health.

The Utility Of Random Forests For Wildfire Severity Mapping,"Collins, L. and Griffioen, P. and Newell, G. and Mellor, A.",2018,"Reliable fire severity mapping is a vital resource for fire scientists and land management agencies globally. Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (Delta FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in Delta FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using Delta FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when Delta FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using Delta NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy ( > 95\%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy ( > 74\%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the Delta NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6\%-21\%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to similar to 55\%. Delta NBR, Delta NDWI and Delta NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.",collins_utilityrandomforestswildfire_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Improving Spatial Resolution Of Grace-Derived Water Storage Changes Based On Geographically Weighted Regression Downscaled Model,"Chen, Zhiwei and Zheng, Wei and Yin, Wenjie and Li, Xiaoping and Ma, Meihong",2023,"Obtaining high-resolution products that can accurately estimate the spatiotemporal changes in regional water resources is essential for the rational utilization of water resources. The temporal gravity field model derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite can effectively monitor the regional terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes. Nevertheless, the main of GRACE products is their coarse spatial resolution, which limits their applicability to small-scale regions. Herein, we propose a geographically weighted regression downscaled model (GWRDM) to improve the spatial resolution of TWS from 0.5 degrees to 0.1 degrees and validate it against the downscaled results provided by the spatial global regression downscaled model (SGRDM) and temporal grid regression downscaled model (TGRDM). The results show that the downscaled products based on GWRDM outperform those based on SGRDM and TGRDM. The GWRDM not only effectively improves the spatial resolution of GRACE products but also maintains the intensity of the original signal. Similarly, the GWRDM is further used to downscale groundwater storage (GWS) and validated against the in situ observations. The downscaled GWS based on GWRDM agrees well with in situ observations. On the monthly scale, the average correlation coefficient (CC) for both is 0.53 and above 0.70 for some in situ observations. On the annual scale, 81.25\% and 37.50\% of the in situ observations have CC values larger than 0.60 and 0.90, respectively, which further verifies the reliability of GWRDM. Consequently, the GWRDM provides a practical algorithm for obtaining high-resolution water storage estimates, which is expected to provide a reference for small-scale regional water resources management.",chen_improvingspatialresolutiongrace_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Integrated Concepts In Water Reuse: Managing Global Water Needs,"Miller, GW",2006,"Communities across the world face water supply challenges due to increasing demand, drought, depletion and contamination of groundwater, and dependence on single sources of supply. Water reclamation, recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies. The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous. Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water, co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including: the need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel applications; the need for public education and increased public acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians. Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting water reuse globally. Current trends include addressing emerging pollutants of concern, the use of advanced wastewater treatments including membranes, indirect potable reuse, public perception, understanding the economics of water reuse, groundwater recharge and aquifer storage and recovery, salinity management (including concentrate disposal), increase in the use of '' alternative sources '', environmental or natural system restoration, innovative uses of nonpotable water reuse, and decentralized and satellite systems. Since these trends are emerging developments in the field of water reclamation and reuse, there are a number of research needs associated with these topics. Research is needed to better understand the issues, to develop innovative technologies, and to develop tools and other assistance for communities and water agencies to implement successful water reclamation and reuse projects.",miller_integratedconceptswaterreuse_2006,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Potential Ecosystem Service Values Of Mangrove Forests In Southeastern China Using High-Resolution Satellite Data,"Wang, Min and Cao, Wenzhi and Jiang, Chao and Yan, Yiyun and Guan, Qingsong",2018,"Mangrove forests provide a large number of important ecological, economic, and social benefits. This study proposes a pixel-based method for estimating the spatial variability of mangrove ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and heavy metal retention) in the Jiulong River Estuary using a combination of high-resolution satellite data with market price and replacement cost approaches. The results indicated that there was a considerable variability in the ecosystem service values caused by the distance of mangroves to the coast and the different growth phases of mangrove forests. The total estimated value of the four selected ecosystem services was US\$ 287,993/year for 174.58 ha (approximately US\$ 1650/ha/year). Coastal protection was estimated to provide the highest value (US\$ 239,683/year), amounting to 83.23\% of the total value of the ecosystem services, followed by nutrient retention (US\$ 25,283/year), contributing 8.78\% of the total value of the ecosystem services and accounting for up to 52.33\% of the total value of regulating services. Heavy metals retention (US\$ 10,289/year) and carbon sequestration (US\$ 12,738 in 2015/year) had relatively low values in comparison to those of coastal protection and nutrient retention. However, there was an underestimation of mangrove ecosystem services because we did not consider other services, such as fisheries, biodiversity, recreation, education and tourism, mainly due to the lack of primary data. Nevertheless, the estimated economic value of mangrove ecosystem services in this area is meaningful to raise awareness of the benefits provided by mangroves to local communities and policy makers.",wang_potentialecosystemservicevalues_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Analyzing networks developed from movements of six sea turtle species reveals marine connectivity and can help prioritize conservation efforts. Location Global. Methods We collated telemetry data from 1235 individuals and reviewed the literature to determine our dataset's representativeness. We used the telemetry data to develop spatial networks at different scales to examine areas, connections, and their geographic arrangement. We used graph theory metrics to compare networks across regions and species and to identify the role of important areas and connections. Results Relevant literature and citations for data used in this study had very little overlap. Network analysis showed that sampling effort influenced network structure, and the arrangement of areas and connections for most networks was complex. However, important areas and connections identified by graph theory metrics can be different than areas of high data density. For the global network, marine regions in the Mediterranean had high closeness, while links with high betweenness among marine regions in the South Atlantic were critical for maintaining connectivity. Comparisons among species-specific networks showed that functional connectivity was related to movement ecology, resulting in networks composed of different areas and links. Main conclusions Network analysis identified the structure and functional connectivity of the sea turtles in our sample at multiple scales. These network characteristics could help guide the coordination of management strategies for wide-ranging animals throughout their geographic extent. Most networks had complex structures that can contribute to greater robustness but may be more difficult to manage changes when compared to simpler forms. Area-based conservation measures would benefit sea turtle populations when directed toward areas with high closeness dominating network function. Promoting seascape connectivity of links with high betweenness would decrease network vulnerability.",kot_networkanalysisseaturtle_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA

The artificial sandy aquifer created by the sand damreduces evaporation losses relative to surface water storage in traditional dams. Recent years have seen a renaissance of studies on sand dams as an effective water scarcity adaptation strategy for drylands. However, many aspects of their functioning and effectiveness are still unclear. Literature reviews have pointed to a range of research gaps that need further scientific attention, such as river corridors and network dynamics, watershed-scale impacts, and interaction with social dynamics. However, the scattered and partially incomplete information across the different reviews would benefit froman integrated framework for directing future research efforts. This paper is a collaborative effort of different research groups active on sand dams and stems from the need to channel future research efforts on this topic in a thorough and coherent way. We synthesize the pivotal research gaps of a) unclear definition of ""functioning"" sand dams, b) lack of methodologies for watershed-scale analysis, c) neglect of social aspects in sand dam research, and d) underreported impacts of sand dams. We then propose framing future research to better target the synthesized gaps, including using the socialecological systems framework to better capture the interconnected social and biophysical research gaps on sand dams, fully utilizing the potential of remote sensing in large-scale studies and collecting sand dam cases across the world to create an extensive database to advance evidence-based research on sand dams.",castelli_sanddamssustainablewater_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Anthropic Effects On The Geomorphology And Morphodynamics Of The Coastal Zone Of La Paz Lagoon, Baja California Sur, Mexico","López, S. C.",2020,"The aridity and geographic isolation of the region currently occupied by the State of Baja California Sur have determined its status as a sparsely populated region for most of its history, which has allowed the ecosystems therein to remain pristine or little impacted. Nevertheless, the State has not been immune to the global trend of vigorous population growth in coastal regions. This trend became evident in La Paz city since the 1990s (population as of 1995: 158,800; as of 2015: 253,021 inhabitants), caused by a tourism-driven economy that has led to accelerated, unplanned urban sprawling (urban area as of 1995: 44.7 km2; as of 2017: 85.7 km2). The objective of this study was to identify and analyze anthropic effects on the geomorphology and morphodynamics of the coastal zone, starting with the geomorphological reconstruction of the likely original conditions, followed by an analysis of the population growth and economic activities leading to urban expansion, to finally elucidating their effects on and the evolutionary response of the coastal zone. We used linear regression methods for analyzing geomorphological and morphodynamic changes from historical documents, particularly those that are, or can be, georeferenced such as maps, aerial photographs, and satellite images. This allows utilizing both methods over long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales. Linear regression methods used all the shoreline location data points available to identify changes over time and estimate evolutionary rates. One distinctive advantage of linear regressions is the possibility of using coastlines as delineated from aerial photographs or historical maps, since beach profiles encompassing long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales are usually not available. The study area comprises two distinct geomorphological units - the alluvial plain and the coastal zone - subject to increasing anthropic activity as evidenced by urban expansion over time. This affects the geomorphological environment, causing major changes in the physical environment, such as fragmentation in parcels and streets, deforestation, and land leveling, as well as the diversion and filling of streambeds. The direct effects of anthropogenic activities on the coastal zone lead to the alteration and partial or total loss of coastal ecosystems such as coastal plains, marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, caused by the construction of tourism infrastructure including hotels, marinas, docks, golf courses, and buildings ranging from residential areas to car junkyards. At the same time, the effects of human activities on the alluvial plain indirectly impact the coastal zone through the reduction of the effective runoff area caused by unabated urban expansion. This, in turn, impairs the sedimentary balance that gave rise to alluvial coastal environments, in which the intensity of the dynamic agents (such as wind, tides, and waves) acting on the coastal zone remained constant. These agents have been acting with the same intensity but, in the absence of sedimentary material, conditions have changed sufficiently to affect the morphodynamics of the coastal fringe of the La Paz lagoon. The evolutionary trend of the La Paz lagoon shows that it has experienced an erosive process at a rate of 0.00227 km2 over 44 years (from 1973 to 2017, or 0.3 m/ year). Paradoxically, the poor or nil urban growth planning is not only causing the loss of the resources that support tourism activities, but is also exacerbating the vulnerability to flooding events in La Paz city and surrounding suburbs. Therefore, it is crucial to properly weigh the benefits of continuing building hotels, marinas, golf courses, residential areas, and other types of infrastructure, versus those of conserving marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, whose proper use and management would contribute to the sustainable economic and environmental development of the region. © 2020 Instituto de Geografia.

As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found a limited reciprocal surrogacy performance, with bird species performing slightly better as a conservation surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. We could also show that areas with a high conservation value based on habitat diversity were represented better in already existing protected areas than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion.",geue_limitedreciprocalsurrogacybird_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Federated Space Systems' Trade-Space Exploration For Strategic Robustness,"Stern, Jordan L. and Grogan, Paul T.",2022,"Motivated by the growth of the commercial space economy and renewed focus on the disaggregation of military space systems, this work develops a method for conceptual design of federated satellite systems as a collaborative system of systems (SOS). Objectives seek to improve the likelihood of successful SOS formation and pursue constituent system utility robustness. The proposed metaheuristic optimization trade-space exploration method accounts for technical and economic design variables and multi-decision-maker strategy dynamics. Constituent system designs are ranked on their simulated net present value. A game-theoretic measure of risk dominance is used in concert with the net present value to assess the robustness and utility of candidate SOS designs. The method is validated with a notional application case that assesses potential collaboration between Earth-observing and telecommunications systems. The proposed methodology reduces the threshold probability of partner collaboration for which SOS participation is economically rational by up to 18\% for the most efficient designs as compared to a typical conceptual design method, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful SOS formation.

Methods The foodborne diseases surveillance data were collected from 11 sentinel hospitals through the National Foodborne Disease Monitoring and Reporting System from 2015 to 2020. R software with version 4.0.3 was used for descriptive and statistical analysis, including epidemic curve, chi-square test, and trend chi-square and so on. Logistic regression was used to analyze norovirus-related factors, OR values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated respectively with the statistical test level of P<0.05. Results There were 1 008 norovirus cases detected, with a detection rate of 12.75% (1 008/7 903). Children with age less than 5 years (OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.13-1.82) and patients at age 20-45 (OR=1.45, 95%CI: 1.13-1.87) were high risk population. The detection rate was higher in autumn (OR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.08-1.53) but lower in summer (OR=0.67, 95%CI: 0.55-0.80).

Aquatic products (OR=1.40, 95%CI: 1.03-1.91), meat and dairy products (OR=1.31, 95%CI: 1.06-1.61) were high-risk foods for norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can reduce the possibility of norovirus by 61% (OR= 0.39, 95%CI: 0.31-0.49) showed a declining trend (Trend χ2=85.33, P<0.001). In addition, prolonged visit time can lead to 19%-23% decrease in the detection rate of norovirus (OR24-48 hours=0.81, 95%CI: 0.70-0.95; OR>48 hours=0.77, 95%CI: 0.63-0.93). Conclusions The epidemic of norovirus presented seasonal and regional distribution in Guangxi with a declining detection rate trend in diarrhea patients during recent 6 years. Young children were high-risk population in infection norovirus. The intake of seafood can increase the risk of norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can sharply decrease the possibility of infection norovirus. The monitoring of key foods such as seafood should be strengthened, and the early screening of suspected cases should be taken. The norovirus monitoring should be improved to ensure the health of the population. © 2023 The authors.",zhong_analysisepidemiccharacteristicsrelated_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Assessment Of Landcover Impacts On The Groundwater Quality Using Hydrogeochemical And Geospatial Techniques,"Iqbal, Javed and Amin, Gomal and Su, Chunli and Haroon, Ehsan and Baloch, Muhammad Yousuf Jat",2023,"Groundwater quality is influenced by urbanization and land use land cover (LULC) changes. This study investigated their impact on groundwater quality in Quetta City, Pakistan, from 2015 to 2021. About 58 groundwater samples from monitoring wells were analyzed using hydrogeochemical and statistical methods. The water quality index (WQI), Wilcox, USSL, and various agricultural indices were employed to assess water quality trends. LULC analysis and NDVI using Sentinel-2 imagery revealed increased urban and agricultural areas and decreased barren land. Rapid urbanization was evident, with the buildup class expanding by 7.50\% during this period. NDVI findings emphasized monitoring vegetation health and water quality for environmental assessments. The groundwater in Quetta was primarily classified as Cl-Ca center dot Mg, Cl-Ca, and Cl-Na according to the Piper diagram, with water-rock interactions and rock weathering evident. Most groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation according to the Wilcox and USSL diagrams. The WQI demonstrated overall safety for human consumption, but declining WQI values in northern parts due to urbanization are concerning. The results also revealed a moderate positive relationship between landcover classes and WQI values. It can be concluded that urbanization and excessive use of pesticides contributed to declining agricultural land quality. The spatial overlay of agricultural indices with landcover class suggested that barren land was most suitable, followed by build-up and agriculture were suitable for drinking and agriculture purposes. Moreover, agricultural indices moderately declined due to excessive fertilizers and pesticides in the agriculture landcover class. Thus, effective water resource management is crucial to address challenges.

E.",2010,"Precise management of nitrogen (N) using canopy color in aerial imagery of corn (Zea mays L.) has been proposed as a strategy on which to base the rate of N fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between canopy color and yield response to N at the field scale. Six N response trials were conducted in 2000 and 2001 in fields with alluvial, claypan and deep loess soil types. Aerial images were taken with a 35-mm slide film from a parts per thousand yen1100 m at the mid- and late-vegetative corn growth stages and processed to extract green and red digital values. Color values of the control N (0 kg N ha(-1)) and sufficient N (280 kg N ha(-1) applied at planting) treatments were used to calculate the relative ratio of unfertilized to fertilized and relative difference color values. Other N fertilizer treatments included side-dressed applications in increments of 56 kg N ha(-1). The economic optimal N rate was weakly related (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.34) or not related to the color indices at both growth stages. For many sites, delta yield (the increase in yield between control N and sufficient N treatments) was related to the color indices (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.67) at the late vegetative growth stage; the best relationship was with green relative difference. The results indicate the potential for color indices from aerial photographs to be used for predicting delta yield from which a site-specific N rate could be determined.",williams_fieldnitrogenresponsecorn_2010,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Optimal Design Of Lightweight Off-Axis Mirror And Flexible Support,Hu Yang and Li Ji and Jia Xuezhi,2020,"This study proposes a design method combining variable density topology optimization and multi-objective integration optimization with minimum size constraints for the overall design of multispectral cameras, adhering to the design concept of integration, miniaturization, and ultra-lightweight. This approach is used for spatial separation, and the optimized design of an axis microcrystalline mirror and a back support structure (heat dissipation mandrel, flexible joint, and backplate). The mirror has an aperture of 218 mm x 166 mm, mass of 0.917 kg, and weight reduction rate of 71.3\%. In addition, the processed and assembled reflector components arc subjected to engineering environmental tests and surface interference detection.

"Physical Flood Vulnerability Mapping Applying Geospatial Techniques In Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan","Rimba, Andi Besse and Setiawati, Martiwi Diah and Sambah, Abu Bakar and Miura, Fusanori",2017,"Flooding has been increasing since 2004 in Japan due to localized heavy rainfall and geographical conditions. Determining areas vulnerable to flooding as one element of flood hazard maps related to disaster management for urban development is necessary. This research integrated Remote Sensing data, the Geography Information System (GIS) method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculation to determine the physical flood-vulnerable area in Okazaki City. We developed this research by applying data from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) to generate the slope map and drainage density; AMEDAS (Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System) from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to generate the rainfall data; Soil map from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) data; and Sentinel-2 imagery to generate the land cover map. We applied the AHP calculation for weighting pairwise the parameters by comparing five iterations of the normalized matrix. We utilized the spatial analysis tool in ArcGIS to run the pairwise comparison to adjudicate the distribution of flooding according to the AHP procedure. The percentage of relative weight was slope (43\%), drainage density (20\%), rainfall intensity (17\%), then both infiltration rate and land cover (10\%). The consistency value was reasonable: consistency index (CI-0.007) and consistency ratio (CR-0.6\%). We generated high accuracy for flood vulnerability prediction; 0.88 for Probability of Detection (POD), 0.28 for Probability of False Detection (POFD), 0.44 for Critical Success Index (CSI), 1.9 for Bias, and 95 of Area under Curve (AUC). The flood vulnerability was matched to the flood inundation survey of Okazaki City in August 2008 and indicated an excellent Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC).",rimba_physicalfloodvulnerabilitymapping_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Predicting Treatment Effects In Unipolar Depression: A Meta-Review,"Gillett, G. and Tomlinson, A. and Efthimiou, O. and Cipriani, A.",2020,"There is increasing interest in clinical prediction models in psychiatry, which focus on developing multivariate algorithms to guide personalized diagnostic or management decisions. The main target of these models is the prediction of treatment response to different antidepressant therapies. This is because the ability to predict response based on patients' personal data may allow clinicians to make improved treatment decisions, and to provide more efficacious or more tolerable medications to the right patient. We searched the literature for systematic reviews about treatment prediction in the context of existing treatment modalities for adult unipolar depression, until July 2019. Treatment effect is defined broadly to include efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability outcomes. We first focused on the identification of individual predictor variables that might predict treatment response, and second, we considered multivariate clinical prediction models. Our meta-review included a total of 10 systematic reviews; seven (from 2014 to 2018) focusing on individual predictor variables and three focusing on clinical prediction models. These identified a number of sociodemographic, phenomenological, clinical, neuroimaging, remote monitoring, genetic and serum marker variables as possible predictor variables for treatment response, alongside statistical and machine-learning approaches to clinical prediction model development. Effect sizes for individual predictor variables were generally small and clinical prediction models had generally not been validated in external populations. There is a need for rigorous model validation in large external data-sets to prove the clinical utility of models. We also discuss potential future avenues in the field of personalized psychiatry, particularly the combination of multiple sources of data and the emerging field of artificial intelligence and digital mental health to identify new individual predictor variables. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",gillett_predictingtreatmenteffectsunipolar_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Antithrombotic Therapy For Long-Term Secondary Prevention Of Acute Coronary Syndrome In High-Risk Patients,"Husted, Steen",2015,"Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represent a major clinical burden, because they tend to experience recurrent ischemic events. Acute management of patients with ACS includes combination antithrombotic therapy composed of a parenteral anticoagulant and dual-antiplatelet therapy. Dual-antiplatelet therapy is also recommended for long-term secondary prevention of ACS. Despite advances in the antithrombotic therapies available, clinical trials suggest that patients with ACS still face a similar to 10\% risk of another event within 12-15 months of the index event. Certain patient populations, such as elderly patients and those with renal impairment or heart failure, are at higher risk of recurrent ACS events, because these patients have more vascular ischemic and bleeding risk factors than most other patients. Evidence from the GRACE and CRUSADE registries suggests underuse of the guideline-recommended evidencebased therapies for the management of ACS in such patients. This review summarizes the current standard of care for patients with ACS, focusing on long-term secondary antithrombotic strategies. Registry data are used to identify high-risk patient populations; the recent antiplatelet and anticoagulant Phase III trial data are summarized to highlight any patient populations who receive greater or lesser benefit from specific long-term antithrombotic strategies.

Monitoring Canada's Forests. Part 2: National Forest Fragmentation And Pattern,"Wulder, Michael A. and White, Joanne C. and Han, Tian and Coops, Nicholas C. and Cardille, Jeffrey A. and Holland, Tara and Grills, Danny",2008,"Canada is one of the world's largest nations, with a land area of nearly one billion hectares. This vast area is home to a number of unique ecosystems, comprised of different climate, land cover, topography, and disturbance characteristics. Depiction of forest composition, based on satellite-derived land cover, is a common means to characterize and identify trends in forest conditions and land use. Forest pattern analyses that consider the size, distribution, and connectivity of forest patches can provide insights to land use, habitat, and biodiversity. In this communication, we present the pattern characteristics of Canada's forests as determined by the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) product, a new land cover classification of the forested area of Canada. The EOSD product (EOSD LC 2000) represents conditions circa the year 2000, mapping each 25 m x 25 m pixel into one of 23 categories. We used the EOSD data to assess forest patterns nationally at four spatial extents: level 1, 13 000 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 250 000 scale National Topographic System (NTS) map sheet); level 2, 800 km(2) (corresponding to the area of a single 1: 50 000 scale NTS map sheet); level 3, 1 km(2); and level 4, 1 ha. For levels 1-3, a total of 95 landscape pattern metrics were calculated; for the 1 ha units, a subset of eight metrics were calculated. The results of this analysis indicate that Canada's forest pattern varies by ecozone, with some ecozones characterized by large areas of contiguous forest (i.e., Boreal Shield, Atlantic Maritime, and Montane Cordillera), while other ecozones have less forest and are characterized by large numbers of small forest patches, reflecting the complex mosaic of land cover types present (Taiga Shield, Taiga Cordillera). Trends for the subset of metrics used to characterize national conditions are relatively consistent across levels 1-3. Level 4 metrics, where the analysis extent is 1 ha, are well-suited to regional or local analyses. As the first regional assessments of the patterns contained in the EOSD LC 2000, these measures of Canada's forest landscape patterns add value to the national land cover baseline.",wulder_monitoringcanada'sforests2_2008,FALSE,class_round1,NA
A Dilemma Between Flood And Drought Management: Case Study Of The Upper Chao Phraya Flood-Prone Area In Thailand,"Pratoomchai, Weerayuth and Ekkawatpanit, Chaiwat and Yoobanpot, Naphol and Lee, Kwan Tun",2022,"Floods are the greatest natural disaster in Thailand, but they are an important part of recharging the water volume for groundwater resources. This paper focused on evaluating and discussing the relationship between flood magnitudes and flood management impacting groundwater storage in the Upper Chao Phraya River basin in Thailand, where the intensive rice production of the region is located. Based on satellite image data, there were annual flood inundations varying from 1950 to 10,470 km(2) over the period 2005-2019. The evaluation shows those flooding events yielded floodwater recharge of approximately 0.5-5.9 km(3). To lessen the flood damage, floodways with 2000 m(3) s(-1) of drainage capacity are proposed by the government. This measure aims to accelerate flood surplus out to the gulf of Thailand and to confine the flooding areas to a maximum value of 4650 km(2). A reduction of approximately 3.4 km(3) of groundwater storage is estimated if the floodways are implemented. Staple crops in the dry season, especially rice fields outside an irrigation project (rainfed area), cope with water stress. To sustain basin water demand in the dry season, approximately 1820 km(2) should be allowed for an area flooded for a month where 0.9 km(3) of water volume is harvested annually. Although flood control is important, potential impact on the reduction of groundwater recharge needs to be carefully considered. Therefore, a flood control policy shows the balance of available basin water occasionally supplied by the groundwater while rice water demand is being proposed.",pratoomchai_dilemmaflooddroughtmanagement_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Remote Sensing Based Binary Classification Of Maize. Dealing With Residual Autocorrelation In Sparse Sample Situations,"Gilcher, M. and Ruf, T. and Emmerling, C. and Udelhoven, T.",2019,"In order to discuss potential sustainability issues of expanding silage maize cultivation in Rhineland-Palatinate, spatially explicit monitoring is necessary. Publicly available statistical records are often not a sufficient basis for extensive research, especially on soil health, where risk factors like erosion and compaction depend on variables that are specific to every site, and hard to generalize for larger administrative aggregates. The focus of this study is to apply established classification algorithms to estimate maize abundance for each independent pixel, while at the same time accounting for their spatial relationship. Therefore, two ways to incorporate spatial autocorrelation of neighboring pixels are combined with three different classification models. The performance of each of these modeling approaches is analyzed and discussed. Finally, one prediction approach is applied to the imagery, and the overall predicted acreage is compared to publicly available data. We were able to show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and Random Forests (RF) were able to distinguish maize pixels reliably, with kappa values well above 0.9 in most cases. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) performed substantially worse. Furthermore, Regression Kriging (RK) as an approach to integrate spatial autocorrelation into the prediction model is not suitable in use cases with millions of sparsely clustered training pixels. Gaussian Blur is able to improve predictions slightly in these cases, but it is possible that this is only because it smoothes out impurities of the reference data. The overall prediction with RF classification combined with Gaussian Blur performed well, with out of bag error rates of 0.5% in 2009 and 1.3% in 2016. Despite the low error rates, there is a discrepancy between the predicted acreage and the official records, which is 20% in 2009 and 27% in 2016. © 2019 by the authors.",gilcher_remotesensingbasedbinary_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Past ocean and coastal data management systems were often very specific to a particular application and region, but this focused approach often lacks real-time data and sharing/interoperating capability. The challenge for the ocean observing community is to devise standards and practices that enable integration of data from sensors across devices, manufacturers, users, and domains to enable new types of application and services that facilitate much more comprehensive understanding and analyses of marine ecosystem. A given kind of sensor may be deployed on various platforms such as floats, gliders or moorings, and thus must be integrated with different operation. and data management systems. Simplifying the integration process in existing or newly established observing systems would benefit system operators and is important for the broader application of diverse sensors. This paper describes a geospatial ""sensor web"" architecture developed by the ""NeXOS"" project for ocean and coastal data management, based on the concepts of spatial data infrastructure and the Sensor Web Enablement framework of the Open Geospatial Consortium. This approach reduces the effort to propagate data front deployed sensors to users.

A Partition Modeling For Anthropogenic Heat Flux Mapping In China,"Wang, S. and Hu, D. and Chen, S. and Yu, C.",2019,"Anthropogenic heat (AH) generated by human activities has a major impact on urban and regional climate. Accurately estimating anthropogenic heat is of great significance for studies on urban thermal environment and climate change. In this study, a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) estimation scheme was constructed based on socio-economic data, energy-consumption data, and multi-source remote sensing data using a partition modeling method, which takes into account the regional characteristics of AH emission caused by the differences in regional development levels. The refined AHF mapping in China was realized with a high resolution of 500 m. The results show that the spatial distribution of AHF has obvious regional characteristics in China. Compared with the AHF in provinces, the AHF in Shanghai is the highest which reaches 12.56W·m-2, followed by Tianjin, Beijing, and Jiangsu. The AHF values are 5.92 W·m-2, 3.35 W·m-2, and 3.10 W·m-2, respectively. As can be seen from the mapping results of refined AHF, the high-value AHF aggregation areas are mainly distributed in north China, east China, and south China. The high-value AHF in urban areas is concentrated in 50-200 W·m-2, and maximum AHF in Shenzhen urban center reaches 267 W·m-2. Further, compared with other high resolution AHF products, it can be found that the AHF results in this study have higher spatial heterogeneity, which can better characterize the emission characteristics of AHF in the region. The spatial pattern of the AHF estimation results correspond to the distribution of building density, population, and industry zone. The high-value AHF areas are mainly distributed in airports, railway stations, industry areas, and commercial centers. It can thus be seen that the AHF estimation models constructed by the partition modeling method can well realize the estimation of large-scale AHF and the results can effectively express the detailed spatial distribution of AHF in local areas. These results can provide technical ideas and data support for studies on surface energy balance and urban climate change. © 2019 by the authors.",wang_partitionmodelinganthropogenicheat_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Barrier-Based Longitudinal Connectivity Index For Managing Urban Rivers,"Li, H. and Zhou, D. and Hu, S. and Zhang, J. and Jiang, Y. and Zhang, Y.",2018,"A large variety of barriers can affect longitudinal connectivity, which leads to shipping blocking and even flood hazard. However, few existing methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the barrier's details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing, China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios' results, the best restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the river channel. © 2018 by the authors.",li_barrierbasedlongitudinalconnectivity_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Increases in urbanization have led to increased LST, and urban ecological systems have been negatively affected. Urban heat islands (UHIs) can be mitigated by understanding how current and future LST phenomena are linked to changes in landscape composition and land use cover (LUC). This study investigated the multi-scale spatial analysis of LUC and LST in Tianjin using remote sensing and GIS data. We used Landsat data from 2005 to 2020 to examine the effects of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration. According to the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), the city's ecological evaluation was carried out. Results show that changes in LUC and other anthropogenic activities affect the spatial distribution of LST. For the study years (2004-2009), the estimated mean LST in Tianjin was 25.32 degrees C, 26.73 degrees C, 27.62 degrees C, and 27.93 degrees C. Between LST and urban areas with other infrastructures, and NDBI, significant positive correlation values were found about 0.53, 0.48, and 0.76 (p < 0.05), respectively. Temperatures would almost certainly increase by 3.87 degrees C to 7.26 degrees C as a result of decreased plant cover and increased settlements. These findings strongly imply a correlation between LST and the vegetation index. Between 2005 and 2020, the anticipated increase in LST of 3.39 degrees C is expected to harm urban environmental health.

Analysis Of Land Damage And Recovery Process In Rare Earth Mining Area Based On Multi-Source Sequential Ndvi,"Li, H. and Lei, J. and Wu, J.",2018,"The problem of land and ecological environment damage caused by ion mining has attracted more and more attention. Taking the Lingbei rare earth mining area as an example, combined with remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time sequence analysis method, we used HJ-1B CCD (charge-coupled device), Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing data during 1990-2016, and analyzed land distribution and rare earth mining area damage and recovery process. In order to reduce the NDVI error caused by the sensor itself, NDVI conversion equation of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8 data was constructed by using the regression analysis method, NDVI image of HJ-1B CCD was transformed into the NDVI image corresponding to the years of Landsat 5/8 (the analog image) by using conversion equation, and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the simulated image and the real Landsat 5/8 NDVI image was calculated and the accuracy of the transformation equation was verified. The results showed that the R2 values of NDVI equations from HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5, HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 8 data were 0.9319 and 0.9552, both more than 0.9, indicating that there is obvious linear positive correlation between the NDVI of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8. The RMSE values of NDVI imaging between simulation images and real Landsat 5, and simulation images and real Landsat 8 were 0.0293 and 0.040, which were less than 0.05, showing that the obtained conversion equation has high accuracy and can eliminate the influence of different data sources on the NDVI. Combining NDVI threshold of mining and non-mining, and threshold of non-rare earth mining interference and rare earth mining interference, Lingbei rare earth mining area had annual rare earth mining activity from 1990 to 2016, rare earth mining area of which was smaller in 1990, 1991,1995 and 2000, mining area was more than 1 km2 in 2001-2006, and the mining area reached 2.546 1 km2 in 2006; after 2006, to maintain the rare earth mining scale at the lower level, the country began to implement control of rare earth mining, and the spatial distribution of rare earth mining was more dispersed, which not only caused difficulties in supervision and waste of resources, but also increased governance difficulties to a certain extent. Testing the extraction accuracy of land destruction and restoration type, extraction accuracy of various types was found above 85%, most of which reached more than 90%, satisfying the requirement of accuracy. Analysis of land destruction and restoration type showed that the area that was not disturbed was 97.082 1 km2, accounting for 45.41% of the total mining area; anthropogenic disturbance area was 116.709 3 km2, accounting for 54.59% of the total mining area; the area affected by deforestation disturbance was the largest, which was 86.534 1 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration was 3 years; the arable land that was not abandoned occupied 5.404 5 km2; cultivated land abandoned for many years and that for returning to forest occupied 9.390 6 km2; orchard development area was 3.148 2 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration for 7 years; rare earth mining occupied 11.354 4 km2, whose average recovery time was 11 years, and the recovery of the reclamation area was 5.004 9 km2, so there was still 6.349 5 km2 area with the regional vegetation that did not be recovered, and relevant departments should pay attention to the situation. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Satellite Altimetry For Ocean And Coastal Applications: A Review,"Srinivasan, Margaret and Tsontos, Vardis",2023,"More than 30 years of observations from an international suite of satellite altimeter missions continue to provide key data enabling research discoveries and a broad spectrum of operational and user-driven applications. These missions were designed to advance technologies and to answer scientific questions about ocean circulation, ocean heat content, and the impact of climate change on these Earth systems. They are also a valuable resource for the operational needs of oceanographic and weather forecasting agencies that provide information to shipping and fishing vessels and offshore operations for route optimization and safety, as well as for other decision makers in coastal, water resources, and disaster management fields. This time series of precise measurements of ocean surface topography (OST)-the ""hills and valleys"" of the ocean surface-reveals changes in ocean dynamic topography, tracks sea level variations at global to regional scales, and provides key information about ocean trends reflecting climate change in our warming world. Advancing technologies in new satellite systems allows measurements at higher spatial resolution ever closer to coastlines, where the impacts of storms, waves, and sea level rise on coastal communities and infrastructure are manifest. We review some collaborative efforts of international space agencies, including NASA, CNES, NOAA, ESA, and EUMETSAT, which have contributed to a collection of use cases of satellite altimetry in operational and decision-support contexts. The extended time series of ocean surface topography measurements obtained from these satellite altimeter missions, along with advances in satellite technology that have allowed for higher resolution measurements nearer to coasts, has enabled a range of such applications. The resulting body of knowledge and data enables better assessments of storms, waves, and sea level rise impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure amongst other key contributions for societal benefit.

A. and Newton, J. and Tolimieri, N.",2017,"Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable.

Hyperspectral Assessment Of Soil Fertility In Farm Fields In Fukushima Decontaminated After The Radioactive Fallout,"Inoue, Yoshio and Saito, Takashi and Iwasaki, Akira and Nemoto, Tomoaki and Ono, Tsukasa",2020,"Farmland in the Fukushima region of Japan experienced unprecedented radioactive contamination as a result of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant disaster in 2011. Many fields (4,950 ha; over 30,000 fields to date) have been decontaminated by replacing the top surface soil with non-contaminated soil. However, the fertility of these fields is quite low and within-field heterogeneity is marked. Accordingly, appropriate management of soil and fertilizer is required for recovery of crop productivity in these decontaminated fields. Remote sensing can play a critical role in rapid spatial assessment of soil fertility. This preliminary study investigated the potential of spectral sensing approaches based on hyperspectral reflectance measurements (400-2500 nm) of soil samples from a decontaminated paddy field in the Fukushima region. Spectral index algorithms (the ratio spectral index {[}RSI] and normalized difference spectral index {[}NDSI]) and multivariate regression methods (partial least-squares regression {[}PLSR] and interval PLSR {[}iPLSR]) were used to identify accurate, robust predictive models. The iPLSR and PLSR showed higher predictive accuracy than the other methods (r(val)(2) = 0.937 and 0.802, respectively). The best spectral indices explored using RSI and NDSI have good potential for assessing the spatial variability of soil carbon content (SC; r(val)(2) = 0.730 similar to 0.844), despite using only two wavebands. The results from the RSI map (or NDSI map) approach provided useful information for creating optimal algorithms for assessing SC values using various sensors, including high-resolution optical satellite sensors. Although we must note that optimal algorithms and their applicability are often site-specific depending on soil type and surface conditions, our results imply that these spectral sensing methods can contribute to the recovery of soil fertility of decontaminated fields in the Fukushima region through careful calibration/validation procedures with sufficient in situ data.",inoue_hyperspectralassessmentsoilfertility_2020,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Mapping Property Redevelopment Via Geoai: Integrating Computer Vision And Socioenvironmental Patterns And Processes,"Liu, C. and Song, W.",2024,"Domain knowledge of social and environmental sciences is generally derived from less structured small data and/or small models. The integration of deep learning with socioenvironmental and geographical patterns and processes is still in an early phase. This study proposes a flexible framework that synthesizes computer vision with patterns and processes of geographical phenomena (e.g., urban redevelopment) via deep convolutional neural networks and spatiotemporal neighborhoods, respectively. Meanwhile, undesirable visual cues (e.g., temporary objects such as cars) cause false alarms in urban change detection. Thus, a masked deep pyramid similarity model (i.e., the computer vision model) is proposed to minimize the negative impact of nonbuilding changes. This pipeline has robustness against obfuscation of undesirable street scene changes and elasticity of geographical knowledge representations in mapping property redevelopment. This model is reproducible and adaptable due to the wide availability of SVI and flexibility of the framework. The results suggest that the domain-driven rules and nonbuilding change masking mechanism can significantly increase the accuracy of a computer vision model. We also find that urban redevelopment should be understood as a locally tuned back-to-the-city process with weak replicability. Hybrid gentrification (i.e., the combination of “seesaw” gentrification and continuous gentrification) is observed globally with local variations. Takeaway for practice: First, the population of those affected should be carefully identified and the benefits of gentrification need to be redistributed on a larger scale. For Auckland, decision-makers should not divert attention away from low-income tenants in outer suburbs that slipped below the radar of local government and scholars. Second, more attention should be given to less resourcing neighborhoods in constantly gentrifying neighborhoods when governments formulate and implement housing subsidy policies. Locally, incessant redevelopment in Auckland CBD, New Market and Remuera, etc., should be contained. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",liu_mappingpropertyredevelopmentgeoai_2024,FALSE,class_round1,NA
The Impact Of Time Separation On Coordination In Global Software Teams: A Conceptual Foundation,"Espinosa, J. A. and Carmel, E.",2003,"While there has been much research on the study of global virtual teams and global software teams, there has been practically no research on the nuances of time separation. We present three converging perspectives on this topic: (a) a view from practices and tactics of global teams; (b) a theoretical view from coordination theories; and (c) a view from our prior research in which we modeled coordination costs for time-separated dyads. Practice suggests that time separation arises not only from time-zone differences but also from factors such as nonoverlapping weekend days and holidays, shifts, and different working schedules. It also suggests that teams employ various coping tactics when faced with time separation - synchronous, asynchronous, and education. Theory suggests that communication is necessary to coordinate and that effectiveness of communication is hampered, both in quality and timeliness, when teams are separated by time. Our model, based on coordination theory, suggests that coordination costs contain four main components - communication, clarification, delay, and rework - and that the various aspects of time-separated work have different effects on each of these components. Our convergent view from these three perspectives shows that distance separation is symmetric - i.e. distance (A,B) = distance (B,A) - while time separation is asymmetric, which affects the planning of team interactions; that the timing of activities matters in time-separated contexts but not in contexts with only distance separation; and that vulnerability costs (i.e. resolving misunderstandings and rework) increase with time separation.

The Annual Cycle For Whimbrel Populations Using The Western Atlantic Flyway,"Watts, Bryan D. and Smith, Fletcher M. and Hines, Chance and Duval, Laura and Hamilton, Diana J. and Keyes, Tim and Paquet, Julie and Pirie-Dominix, Lisa and Rausch, Jennie and Truitt, Barry and Winn, Brad and Woodard, Paul",2021,"Many long-distance migratory birds use habitats that are scattered across continents and confront hazards throughout the annual cycle that may be population-limiting. Identifying where and when populations spend their time is fundamental to effective management. We tracked 34 adult whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from two breeding populations (Mackenzie Delta and Hudson Bay) with satellite transmitters to document the structure of their annual cycles. The two populations differed in their use of migratory pathways and their seasonal schedules. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels made long (22,800 km) loop migrations with different autumn and spring routes. Hudson Bay whimbrels made shorter (17,500 km) and more direct migrations along the same route during autumn and spring. The two populations overlap on the winter grounds and within one spring staging area. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels left the breeding ground, arrived on winter grounds, left winter grounds and arrived on spring staging areas earlier compared to whimbrels from Hudson Bay. For both populations, migration speed was significantly higher during spring compared to autumn migration. Faster migration was achieved by having fewer and shorter stopovers en route. We identified five migratory staging areas including four that were used during autumn and two that were used during spring. Whimbrels tracked for multiple years had high (98\%) fidelity to staging areas. We documented dozens of locations where birds stopped for short periods along nearly all migration routes. The consistent use of very few staging areas suggests that these areas are integral to the annual cycle of both populations and have high conservation value.",watts_annualcyclewhimbrelpopulations_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Impact Of Landscape Patterns On Ecosystem Services In China: A Case Study Of The Central Plains Urban Agglomeration,"Zhong, M.",2024,"Urban agglomeration is the highest stage of urban development, which reasonable planning will be conducive to the rapid and healthy development of the regional economy. However, in recent years, unreasonable urban agglomeration planning has changed landscape patterns and brought huge challenges to ecosystem services. Moreover, there is currently a lack of understanding of the relationship between landscape patterns and ecosystem services, especially in the process of urban agglomeration construction. In this study, we attempt to reveal the impact of landscape patterns on ecosystem services value (ESV) based on many years of remote sensing data in the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration (CPUA). The results show that landscape patterns have significant spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, and there are significant differences between different landscape patterns in the CPUA. Moreover, most of landscape patterns show significant east-west differences. Total ESV has decreased from USD 838.53 million in 2000 to USD 792.32 million in 2018. From a spatial perspective, the areas with high ESV are mostly distributed in the western mountainous and southern hilly areas, but low ESV area are mainly concentrated in the central and northern plains. In addition, the results of model analysis reveal that there is a remarkable positive correlation between ESV and patch density, interspersion juxtaposition index, cohesion index, and splitting index, but a remarkable negative correlation between ESV and total edge. These results provide critical guidance and suggestions for the improvement of future urban agglomeration construction.

A Survey Of Blockchain-Based Strategies For Healthcare,"De Aguiar, E. J. and Faiçal, B. S. and Krishnamachari, B. and Ueyama, J.",2020,"Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area.

Seasonal Forecasts For The Limpopo Province In Estimating Deviations From Grazing Capacity,"Maluleke, P. and Landman, W. A. and Malherbe, J. and Archer, E.",2019,"Application of seasonal forecasts in agriculture has significant potential and realized utility. Other sectors that may also benefit from using seasonal forecasts include (but are not limited to) health, hydrology, water, and energy. This paper shows that seasonal forecast model data, satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT), dry matter productivity (DMP) data (proxy of grass biomass) along with other sets of data are effectively used to estimate grazing capacity (GC) over a 12-year test period (1998/1999–2009/2010) in Limpopo Province. GC comprises a vital consideration in agricultural activities, particularly for a province in South Africa like Limpopo, due to its varying climate. The Limpopo Province capitalizes on subsistence farming, including livestock and crop production. Grazing should thus be regulated in order to conserve grass, shrubs, and trees, thereby ensuring sustainability of rangelands. In a statistical downscaling model, the predictor is the 850 geopotential height fields of a coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation (CGCM) over Southern Africa to predict seasonal DMP values. This model shows that the mid-summer rainfall totals are important predictors for the November through April (NDJFMA) DMP (as well as grazing capacity) growing season. Forecast verification is conducted using the relative operating characteristics (ROC) and reliability diagrams. The CGCM model shows skill in discriminating high and low DMP (GC) seasons in the Limpopo Province, as well as reliability in the probabilistic forecasts. This paper demonstrates the development of a tailored forecast, an avenue that should be explored in enhancing relevance of forecasts in agricultural production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",maluleke_seasonalforecastslimpopoprovince_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Quantitative Catchment Profiling To Apportion Faecal Indicator Organism Budgets For The Ribble System, The Uk's Sentinel Drainage Basin For Water Framework Directive Research","Stapleton, C. M. and Wyer, M. D. and Crowther, J. and McDonald, A. T. and Kay, D. and Greaves, J. and Wither, A. and Watkins, J. and Francis, C. and Humphrey, N. and Bradford, M.",2008,"Under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 20/60/EC and the US Federal Water Pollution Control Act 2002 management of water quality within river drainage basins has shifted from traditional point-source control to a holistic approach whereby the overall contribution of point and diffuse sources of pollutants has to be considered. Consequently, there is a requirement to undertake source-apportionment studies of pollutant fluxes within catchments. The inclusion of the Bathing Water Directive (BWD), under the list of 'protected areas' in the WFD places a requirement to control sources of faecal indicator organisms within catchments in order to achieve the objectives of both the BWD (and its revision - 2006/7/EC) and the WFD. This study was therefore initiated to quantify catchment-derived fluxes of faecal indicator compliance parameters originating from both point and diffuse sources. The Ribble drainage basin is the single UK sentinel WFD research catchment and discharges to the south of the Fylde coast, which includes a number of high profile, historically non-compliant, bathing waters. Faecal indicator concentrations (faecal coliform concentrations are reported herein) were measured at 41 riverine locations, the 15 largest wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and 15 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) across the Ribble basin over a 44-day period during the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme included targeting rainfall-induced high flow events and sample results were categorised as either base flow or high flow. At the riverine sites, geometric mean faecal coliform concentrations showed statistically significant elevation at high flow compared to base flow. The resultant faecal coliform flux estimates revealed that over 90\% of the total organism load to the Ribble Estuary was discharged by sewage related sources during high flow events. These sewage sources were largely related to the urban areas to the south and east of the Ribble basin, with over half the load associated with the relatively small subcatchment of the River Douglas. The majority of this load was attributed to two WwTWs that discharge through a common outfall close to the tidal limit of this catchment. Budgets adjusted to accommodate the impact of proposed UV disinfection of these effluents showed that the load from these sources would be reduced significantly during base flow conditions. However, during high flow events loads would still remain high due to the operation of storm sewage overflows from stormwater retention tanks. The study identified untreated storm sewage spills from urban infrastructure and WwTW stormwater retention tanks as the dominant component of the high flow flux of faecal indicators to receiving waters of the Fylde coast and the associated bathing waters.

A New Temperature-Vegetation Triangle Algorithm With Variable Edges (Tave) For Satellite-Based Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation,"Zhang, Hua and Gorelick, Steven M. and Avisse, Nicolas and Tilmant, Amaury and Rajsekhar, Deepthi and Yoon, Jim",2016,"The estimation of spatially-variable actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a critical challenge to regional water resources management. We propose a new remote sensing method, the Triangle Algorithm with Variable Edges (TAVE), to generate daily AET estimates based on satellite-derived land surface temperature and the vegetation index NDVI. The TAVE captures heterogeneity in AET across elevation zones and permits variability in determining local values of wet and dry end-member classes (known as edges). Compared to traditional triangle methods, TAVE introduces three unique features: (i) the discretization of the domain as overlapping elevation zones; (ii) a variable wet edge that is a function of elevation zone; and (iii) variable values of a combined-effect parameter (that accounts for aerodynamic and surface resistance, vapor pressure gradient, and soil moisture availability) along both wet and dry edges. With these features, TAVE effectively addresses the combined influence of terrain and water stress on semi-arid environment AET estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in one of the driest countries in the worldJordan, and compare it to a traditional triangle method (TA) and a global AET product (MOD16) over different land use types. In irrigated agricultural lands, TAVE matched the results of the single crop coefficient model (-3\%), in contrast to substantial overestimation by TA (+234\%) and underestimation by MOD16 (-50\%). In forested (non-irrigated, water consuming) regions, TA and MOD16 produced AET average deviations 15.5 times and -3.5 times of those based on TAVE. As TAVE has a simple structure and low data requirements, it provides an efficient means to satisfy the increasing need for evapotranspiration estimation in data-scarce semi-arid regions. This study constitutes a much needed step towards the satellite-based quantification of agricultural water consumption in Jordan.",zhang_temperaturevegetationtrianglealgorithm_2016,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Spatiotemporal Continuous Estimates Of Daily 1 Km Pm2.5 From 2000 To Present Under The Tracking Air Pollution In China (Tap) Framework,"Xiao, Qingyang and Geng, Guannan and Liu, Shigan and Liu, Jiajun and Meng, Xia and Zhang, Qiang",2022,"High spatial resolution PM2.5 data covering a long time period are urgently needed to support population exposure assessment and refined air quality management. In this study, we provided complete-coverage PM2.5 predictions with a 1 km spatial resolution from 2000 to the present under the Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, http://tapdata.org.cn/, last access: 3 October 2022) framework. To support high spatial resolution modeling, we collected PM2.5 measurements from both national and local monitoring stations. To correctly reflect the temporal variations in land cover characteristics that affected the local variations in PM2.5, we constructed continuous annual geoinformation datasets, including the road maps and ensemble gridded population maps, in China from 2000 to 2021. We also examined various model structures and predictor combinations to balance the computational cost and model performance.

Variability Of Water Use Efficiency Associated With Climate Change In The Extreme West Of Bahia,"Santiago, Dimas de Barros and Barbosa, Humberto Alves and Correia Filho, Washington Luiz Felix and Oliveira-Junior, Jose Francisco de and Paredes-Trejo, Franklin and Buriti, Catarina de Oliveira",2022,"Water has become more important in agricultural implementations over the years, as has the need for water management. Thus, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) has been used as an alternative form of detecting the variability of water management based on the carbon-water cycle. The study aimed to map and quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of WUE based on its interactions with environmental changes. It focused on an agricultural area in the westernmost region of Bahia, Northeast Brazil (NEB). For WUE estimation, data from Collection 6 MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Evapotranspiration (ET) products with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees were obtained from the Earth Explorer website. Subsequently, annual WUE anomalies were calculated based on the 2001-2019 period. The results obtained indicated that the highest values of GPP (580 gC/m(2)), ET (3000 mm), and WUE (3.5 gC/mm center dot m(2)) occurred in agricultural areas, associated with cultural treatments and insertion of irrigation, which helped in the higher WUE values and consequently increased agricultural productivity in the study region. In addition, there was a marked influence of the phases of the climate variability mode-El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-on the annual variability of the WUE, with a reduction of 96\% during the La Nina of 2016 (an increase of 89\% during El Nino of 2005). During El Ninos, vegetation had greater efficiency resulting from the adaptation of vegetation in maintaining the carbon-water balance, using water more efficiently. However, unlike Las Ninas, with excessive precipitation there is an interference in the WUE, which interferes with the absorption of radiation and nutrients for the biophysical processes of vegetation and agriculture and, consequently, agricultural production. The use of WUE for agriculture is extremely important, especially for Brazil and countries with an economy based on primary production. This information on the way vegetation (native or agricultural) responds to interactions with the environment aids in decision-making about water management, possibly lowering losses or agricultural damage caused by a lack of water.",santiago_variabilitywaterefficiencyclimate_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Spatial-Spectral Clustering With Anchor Graph For Hyperspectral Image,"Wang, Q. and Miao, Y. and Chen, M. and Yuan, Y.",2022,"Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering, which aims at dividing hyperspectral pixels into clusters without labeled training data, has drawn significant attention in practical applications. Recently, many graph-based clustering methods, which construct an adjacent graph to model the data relationship, have shown dominant performance. However, the high dimensionality of HSI data makes it hard to construct the pairwise adjacent graph. Besides, abundant spatial structures are often overlooked during the clustering procedure. To better handle the high dimensionality problem and preserve the spatial structures, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach called spatial-spectral clustering with anchor graph (SSCAG) for HSI data clustering. The SSCAG has the following contributions: 1) the multiscale filtering module is utilized to smooth the homogeneous regions, so that it can increase the similarity and consistency of neighboring pixels and capture the multiple views of a local region with different scales; 2) a new similarity metric is proposed to embed the spatial-spectral features into the combined adjacent graph, which can mine the intrinsic property structure of HSI data; and 3) the anchor graph (AG)-based strategy is adopted to construct the adjacent graph by a neighbor assignment scheme without hyperparameters, and its optimization employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to replace eigenvalue decomposition to reduce the computational complexity. Extensive experiments on three public HSI datasets show that the proposed SSCAG is competitive against the state-of-the-art approaches. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",wang_spatialspectralclusteringanchor_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Model-Assisted Regional Forest Biomass Estimation Using Lidar And Insar As Auxiliary Data: A Case Study From A Boreal Forest Area,"Naesset, Erik and Gobakken, Terje and Solberg, Svein and Gregoire, Timothy G. and Nelson, Ross and Stahl, Goran and Weydahl, Dan",2011,"There is a need for accurate inventory methods that produce relevant and timely information on the forest resources and carbon stocks for forest management planning and for implementation of national strategies under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD). Such methods should produce information that is consistent across various geographical scales. Airborne scanning Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is among the most promising remote sensing technologies for estimation of forest resource information such as timber volume and biomass, while acquisition of three dimensional data with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from space is seen as a relevant option for inventory in the tropics because of its ability to ""see through the clouds"" and its potential for frequent updates at low costs. Based on a stratified probability sample of 201 field survey plots collected in a 960 km(2) boreal forest area in Norway, we demonstrate how total above-ground biomass (AGB) can be estimated at three distinct geographical levels in such a way that the estimates at a smaller level always sum up to the estimate at a larger level. The three levels are (1) a district (the entire study area), (2) a village, local community or estate level, and (3) a stand or patch level. The LiDAR and InSAR data were treated as auxiliary information in the estimation. At the two largest geographical levels model-assisted estimators were employed. A model-based estimation was conducted at the smallest level. Estimates of AGB and corresponding error estimates based on (1) the field sample survey were compared with estimates obtained by using (2) LiDAR and (3) InSAR data as auxiliary information. For the entire study area, the estimates of AGB were 116.0, 101.2, and 111.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Corresponding standard error estimates were 3.7, 1.6, and 3.2 Mg ha(-1). At the smallest geographical level (stand) an independent validation on 35 large field plots was carried out. RMSE values of 17.1-17.3 Mg ha(-1) and 42.6-53.2 Mg ha(-1) were found for LiDAR and InSAR, respectively. A time lag of six years between acquisition of InSAR data and field inventory has introduced some errors. Significant differences between estimates and reference values were found, illustrating the risk of using pure model-based methods in the estimation when there is a lack of fit in the models. We conclude that the examined remote sensing techniques can provide biomass estimates with smaller estimated errors than a field-based sample survey. The improvement can be highly significant, especially for LiDAR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",naesset_modelassistedregionalforest_2011,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Efficient Storage Method For Massive Remote Sensing Image Via Spark-Based Pyramid Model,"Yang, Mengzhao and Mei, Haibin and Yang, Yuhao and Huang, Dongmei",2017,"The amount of remote sensing (RS) image has grown considerably and the Big Data era of images has truly emerged.

MSFAs are pre-configured based on application-where filter channels are selected corresponding to targeted absorption spectra-making the design of optimal MSFAs vital for a given application. Despite the availability of many design and optimization approaches for spectral channel selection and spatial arrangement, major limitations remain. There are few robust approaches for joint spectral-spatial optimization, techniques are typically only applicable to limited datasets and most critically, are not available for general use and improvement by the wider community. Here, we reconcile current MSFA design techniques and present Opti-MSFA: a Python-based open-access toolbox for the centralized design and optimization of MSFAs. Opti-MSFA incorporates established spectral-spatial optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent and simulated annealing, multispectral-RGB image reconstruction, and is applicable to user-defined input of spatial-spectral datasets or imagery. We demonstrate the utility of the toolbox by comparing against other published MSFAs using the standard hyperspectral datasets Samson and Jasper Ridge, and further show application on experimentally acquired fluorescence imaging data. In conjunction with end-user input and collaboration, we foresee the continued development of Opti-MSFA for the benefit of the wider research community.

Remote Sensing Dynamic Monitoring On The Development Status Of Typical Cities In Shanxi Province Based On Dmsp/Ols Data,"Zhao, S. and Zhang, S.",2020,"Acquiring city development situations at long time series is meaningful for rational planning of the city and resolving urbanization issues. The Operational Line Scan System (OLS) sensor aboard on the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) can acquire night time light image at long time series. Taking typical cities of Shanxi Province (Taiyuan City, Datong City, and Yuncheng City) as the research regions, this research analysed the spatial distribution change of brightness value for DMSP/OLS data at five years period from 1992 to 2013, so as to understand the development progress during the past 20 years for the three cities. Research results show: Taiyuan City has the strongest economic foundation, and presents continuous quick developing speed, so it is the city with the strongest and best developing trend city; Datong City has less economic foundation, which develops slowly in the previous three periods, but starts fast development in the latter two periods; Yuncheng City has the least economic foundation, but presents a developing tendency with continuous fast speed, and thus has the quickest development speed in the three cities. © 2020, Taiyuan University of Technology.

Collective Forest Tenure Reform And Forest Conditions: Evidence From The Social-Ecological System In Southwest China,"Li, Wenqing and Chen, Jiahui and Wu, Fengwen and Zhang, Zhiming",2023,"China's recent collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to improve forest conditions by devolution of forest management rights from community collectives to individual households. Studies reveal substantial local variation in CFTR implementation, but the ecological effects and underlying mechanism have received little attention. Our study focused on community-managed forests and household-managed forests in four communities located in the mountains of Southwest China. The objective was to investigate the relationship between CFTR and forest conditions at the local scale. We employed a combination of remote sensing technology, field forest observations and socioeconomic surveys to gather data for analysis. The results showed that the forest cover change trends of collective forests and household forests in each community were consistent from 1994 to 2014. There was no significant relationship between CFTR implementation and local-level differences in species diversity and soil fertility in forests. The aboveground biomass of collective forests was significantly higher than that of household forests. Differentiated access and use, low compensation amounts, and loose payment terms jointly affected CFTR's effectiveness to improve local-scale forest conditions in the study area. Attempts to formalize forest tenure rights must be flexible enough and adapted to the local environment so that changes induced by the CFTR can improve local access to forest resources and its benefits.",li_collectiveforesttenurereform_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

A Blind Convolutional Deep Autoencoder For Spectral Unmixing Of Hyperspectral Images Over Waterbodies,"Alfaro-Mejia, Estefania and Manian, Vidya and Ortiz, Joseph D. and Tokars, Roger P.",2023,"Harmful algal blooms have dangerous repercussions for biodiversity, the ecosystem, and public health. Automatic identification based on remote sensing hyperspectral image analysis provides a valuable mechanism for extracting the spectral signatures of harmful algal blooms and their respective percentage in a region of interest. This paper proposes a new model called a non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing to perform endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation. The model is assessed in benchmark datasets, such as Jasper Ridge and Samson. Additionally, a case study of the HSI2 image acquired by NASA over Lake Erie in 2017 is conducted for extracting optical water types. The results using the proposed model for the benchmark datasets improve unmixing performance, as indicated by the spectral angle distance compared to five baseline algorithms. Improved results were obtained for various metrics. In the Samson dataset, the proposed model outperformed other methods for water (0.060) and soil (0.025) endmember extraction. Moreover, the proposed method exhibited superior performance in terms of mean spectral angle distance compared to the other five baseline algorithms. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing approach achieved better results for abundance map estimation, with a root mean square error of 0.091 for water and 0.187 for soil, compared to the ground truth. For the Jasper Ridge dataset, the non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing model excelled in the tree (0.039) and road (0.068) endmember extraction and also demonstrated improved results for water abundance maps (0.1121). The proposed model can identify the presence of chlorophyll-a in waterbodies. Chlorophyll-a is an essential indicator of the presence of the different concentrations of macrophytes and cyanobacteria. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing achieves a value of 0.307 for the spectral angle distance metric compared to a reference ground truth spectral signature of chlorophyll-a.

The Role Of Habitat Features In Patterns Of Population Connectivity Of Two Mediterranean Amphibians In Arid Landscapes Of Central Iberia,"Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Jorge and Goncalves, Joao and Civantos, Emilio and Maia-Carvalho, Bruno and Caballero-Diaz, Carlos and Goncalves, Helena and Martinez-Solano, Inigo",2023,"Context Mediterranean wetland ecosystems are in continuous decline due to human pressure. Amphibians are key elements of biotic communities of Mediterranean temporary ponds and streams, and their persistence depends on the availability and inter-connectivity of breeding sites. Objectives We investigated the role of different factors potentially driving functional connectivity patterns in two amphibian species at the landscape and local scales. We focused on two Mediterranean endemic pond-breeding amphibians inhabiting semi-arid landscapes of central Spain, the common parsley frog (Pelodytes punctatus) and the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans). Methods We genotyped 336 individuals of P. punctatus and 318 of A. obstetricans from 17 and 16 breeding populations at 10 and 17 microsatellite loci, respectively. We used remotely sensed vegetation/moisture indices and land use/cover data to derive optimized resistance surfaces and test their association with estimates of gene flow and migration rates across populations. Results We found evidence for higher population connectivity in common midwife toads than in common parsley frogs, with a strong effect of water availability in patterns of population connectivity of both species. However, the two species differ in the role of landscape features on population connectivity, with the distance and spatial distribution of artificial land-use types positively influencing connectivity in A. obstetricans and meadows/pastureland favouring P. punctatus. This is in line with reported breeding site preferences for the two species, with A. obstetricans successfully breeding in artificial water bodies that P. punctatus generally avoid. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of assessing species-habitat relationships shaping connectivity when developing and implementing conservation and management actions to benefit fragmented amphibian populations in the Mediterranean region. Our results show that amphibian species respond differently, even contrastingly to landscape features and thus require alternative, complementary strategies to improve population connectivity and ensure long-term viability.",gutierrezrodriguez_rolehabitatfeaturespatterns_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Long-Term Spatiotemporal Variability In High Andean Wetlands In Northern Chile,"de la Fuente, A. and Meruane, C. and Suárez, F.",2021,"High Andean wetlands of the elevated plateaus of the Andes Mountains of Chile, Argentina, Perú and Bolivia are true oases that sustain life in this arid region. Despite their ecological value, they have been rarely studied and are vulnerable to climate change and human activities that require groundwater resources. One such activity that may be intensified in the near future is mining for nonmetallic minerals such as lithium, whose worldwide demand is expected to increase with the rise of electric vehicles that need batteries. To determine a baseline of the natural dynamics of these systems, which allows sustainable management, it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of these wetlands. In this article, we studied the temporal and spatial dynamics of high Andean wetlands of Chile, with the aim of identifying the key processes that govern their dynamics. To do this, we used time series of Landsat data from 1984 to 2019 to study 10 high Andean wetlands. Furthermore, to characterize the climate variability in these systems, we studied the long-term relation between the changes in water and vegetation areas with rainfall and evaporation variability. It was found that the groundwater reservoir plays a key role in sustaining the high Andean wetlands. Wet years with a period of occurrence of 20–30 years are the years in which the groundwater reservoirs are actually recharged, and in between wet years, the groundwater reservoirs gradually release the water that sustains the aquatic ecosystems. Hence, groundwater exploitation should be carefully designed from a long-term perspective, as groundwater levels could take decades to recover. © 2020 The Authors",delafuente_termspatiotemporalvariabilityandean_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
"Implication Of Drainage Basin Parameters Of Chhoti Gandak River, Ganga Plain, India","Sen Singh, Dhruv and Awasthi, Amit",2011,"The drainage basin parameters of the groundwater-fed Chhoti Gandak River originating in the terai area of the Ganga Plain were analyzed using topographical sheets, satellite data, and field documentation with emphasis to its implication for flood mitigation and recharging of groundwater. The analyses indicate dominance of first order streams, gentle slope gradient, low surface run-off, low sediment production, high infiltration rate, and low value of basin relief. The low water storage capacity, spreading of water and concentration of peak discharge in the distal part of the river basin explain that whenever precipitation is high in the catchment area there is flood in the distal part of the basin. The bifurcation ratio value (4.34) of this basin describes that the drainage is carved naturally by slope and local relief and not influenced by geological structures like lineaments and faults. These parameters provide useful information for the prediction of basin behavior during prolonged heavy rainfall that generate floods and suggest that water resource management and developmental planning should be done with reference to the drainage basin parameters.",sensingh_implicationdrainagebasinparameters_2011,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Distribution Characteristics And Influencing Factors Of Milk-Tea Consumption Space From The Perspective Of Scene-Symbol And Physical-Information,"Zhang, Y. and Lu, Y. and Chen, X.",2023,"In the era of digital economy, the influence of new retail consumption space which combines scene consumption and symbol consumption, and physical space and information space, on the development of urban space is constantly expanding. Taking the consumption space of milk-tea in Xi 'an as the research object, space syntax is used to analyze the distribution characteristics of milk-tea consumption space. Threshold regression and multi- scale geographical weighted regression are constructed to analyze the influencing factors of the distribution of milk-tea consumption space. The results show that: (1) Location selection for new retail milk-tea is highly sensitive to market information and can respond to space regulatory decisions. The factors involved in the traditional retail location theory, such as consumer market, spatial proximity, land price, and industrial development, have a significant impact on the spatial distribution of new retail milk-tea consumption. However, there is a game between physical and information entities in new retail milk-tea consumption space, with the role of information growing significantly with the expansion of scale; (2) The spatial distribution of new retail milk-tea consumption reflects the characteristics of organizational behaviors displayed by brand community. The consumption subjectivity of consumer community is enhanced. The new retail milk-tea consumption space of different brands promotes the growth of consumer communities in various ways; (3) Social culture perception has price threshold effect in both physical and information consumption space. Information flow and material flow are mutually exclusive in the action mechanism of low-priced consumption space scene and symbol value, and cultural dissemination depends on the density, propagation rate, and frequency of scene and symbol. In the action mechanism of high-priced consumption space scene and symbol value, information flow and material flow promote each other, and cultural dissemination depends on the influence and propagation distance of scene and symbol; (4) Spatial syntactic model simulates the extension of information in the consumption space.

Useful data were available for analysing vertical and horizontal habitat use from 28 individuals. Time at liberty ranged from 10 to 181 d (mean 115, SD 53.3). Seasonal southerly fall migration routes were documented for fish released off the northeastern United States, while those released off Aruba remained in the Caribbean basin. Horizontal movements ranged from 228 to 8084 km (19-100 km d(-1)) based on light-level geolocation estimates using a sea surface temperature and bathymetry-corrected Kalman filter. Analyses included an evaluation of vertical movements using Delta T, the time spent at temperature relative to the uniform temperature surface layer. Movements included exploration of depths as great as 387 m and ambient temperatures as low as 7.8 degrees C. However, the greatest proportion of time was spent in the upper 20 m of the water column for both day (50.8\%) and night (81.6\%), and time spent in water colder than 7 degrees C below the uniform temperature surface layer was negligible. Overall, this group showed less variability in vertical movement, and less tolerance to colder temperatures compared with similar studies for blue marlin Makaira nigricans and sailfish Istiophorus platypterus. Values for Delta T are presented in tabular format to allow direct input into habitat standardization models used to estimate vertical distribution and population abundance.

The surface water bodies and other crucial natural resources in the study area are being depleted at an alarming rate. This study explored the implications of the changing land-use diversity on surface water resources by using a random forest (RF) classifier machine-learning algorithm and remote-sensing models in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Landsat datasets from 1993 to 2022 were used and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using the RF classifier. The results indicate nine land-use diversity classes having increased and decreased tendencies, with high F-score values ranging from 72.3\% to 100\%. In GP, the spatial coverage of BL has shrunk by 100.4 km(2) every year over the past three decades.

Atlantic halibut in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) is of great economic value, although little is known about its spatiotemporal distribution, seasonal migrations, and spawning areas. To investigate these aspects, 114 pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) were deployed on halibut from 2013 up to 2018 throughout the GSL. A total of 62 physically recovered PSATs provided complete archived datasets with high temporal resolution. PSAT detachment locations revealed specific summer site fidelity. In contrast, the reconstruction of movement tracks with a geolocation model revealed that all fish converged to the Gulf's deep channels to overwinter and spawn. This suggests strong mixing during the spawning period and thus one reproductive population within the GSL. These findings illustrate the utility of large-scale PSAT tagging combined with dedicated PSAT-recovery surveys to reveal critical stock-scale information on movements and spawning locations.

Forest Stand Spectrum Reconstruction Using Spectrum Spatial Feature Gathering And Multilayer Perceptron,"Song, L. and Liu, X. and Zhong, S. and Wang, J. and Zhang, Y. and Wu, Y. and Wang, F.",2023,"Introduction: Three-dimensional spectral distributions of forest stands can provide spatial information on the physiological and biochemical status of forests, which is vital for forest management. However, three-dimensional spectral studies of forest stands are limited. Methods: In this study, LiDAR and multispectral data were collected from Masson pine stands in southern Fujian Province, China, and a method was proposed for inverting forest spectra using point clouds as a unit. First, multispectral values were mapped to a point cloud, and the isolated forest algorithm combined with K-means clustering was applied to characterize fusion data. Second, five deep learning algorithms were selected for semantic segmentation, and the overall accuracy (oAcc) and mean intersection ratio (mIoU) were used to evaluate the performance of various algorithms on the fusion data set. Third, the semantic segmentation model was used to reconfigure the class 3D spectral distribution, and the model inversion outcomes were evaluated by the peaks and valleys of the curve of the predicted values and distribution gaps. Results: The results show that the correlations between spectral attributes and between spatial attributes were both greater than 0.98, while the correlation between spectral and spatial attributes was 0.43. The most applicable method was PointMLP, highest oAcc was 0.84, highest mIoU was 0.75, peak interval of the prediction curve tended to be consistent with the true values, and maximum difference between the predicted value and the true value of the point cloud spectrum was 0.83. Discussion: Experimental data suggested that combining spatial fusion and semantic segmentation effectively inverts three-dimensional spectral information for forest stands. The model could meet the accuracy requirements of local spectral inversion, and the NIR values of stands in different regions were correlated with the vertical height of the canopy and the distance from the tree apex in the region. These findings improve our understanding of the precise three-dimensional spectral distribution of forests, providing a basis for near-earth remote sensing of forests and the estimation of forest stand health.

Potential Of Using Data Assimilation To Support Forest Planning,"Saad, Rami and Eyvindson, Kyle and Gong, Peichen and Lamas, Tomas and Stahl, Goran",2017,"Uncertainty in forest information typically results in economic and ecological losses as a consequence of suboptimal management decisions. Several techniques have been proposed to handle such uncertainties. However, these techniques are often complex and costly. Data assimilation (DA) has recently been advocated as a tool that may reduce the uncertainty, thereby improving the quality of forest planning results. It offers an opportunity to make use of all new sources of information in a systematic way and thus provides more accurate and up-to-date information to forest planning. In this study, we refer to literature on handling uncertainties in forest planning, as well as related literature from other scientific fields, to assess the potential benefits of using DA in forest planning. We identify five major potential benefits: (i) the accuracy of the information will be improved; (ii) the information will be kept up to date; (iii) the DA process will provide information with estimated accuracy; (iv) stochastic decision making can be applied whereby the accuracy of the information can be utilized in the decision making process; and (v) DA data allows for the analysis of optimal data acquisition decisions.",saad_potentialdataassimilationsupport_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Density-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm For Data Clustering,"Alswaitti, M. and Albughdadi, M. and Isa, N. A. M.",2018,"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely used in cluster analysis. However, it is a stochastic technique that is vulnerable to premature convergence to sub-optimal clustering solutions. PSO-based clustering algorithms also require tuning of the learning coefficient values to find better solutions. The latter drawbacks can be evaded by setting a proper balance between the exploitation and exploration behaviors of particles while searching the feature space. Moreover, particles must take into account the magnitude of movement in each dimension and search for the optimal solution in the most populated regions in the feature space. This study presents a novel approach for data clustering based on particle swarms. In this proposal, the balance between exploitation and exploration processes is considered using a combination of (i) kernel density estimation technique associated with new bandwidth estimation method to address the premature convergence and (ii) estimated multidimensional gravitational learning coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using 11 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in terms of classification accuracy, repeatability represented by the standard deviation of the classification accuracy over different runs, and cluster compactness represented by the average Dunn index values over different runs. The results of Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with Holm's test over the average classification accuracy and Dunn index values indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy and compactness when compared with other algorithms. The significance of the proposed algorithm is represented in addressing the limitations of the PSO-based clustering algorithms to push forward clustering as an important technique in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application, in turn, enhances the classification accuracy and cluster compactness. In this context, the proposed algorithm achieves better results compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms when applied to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., Landsat and Dermatology). This finding confirms the importance of estimating multidimensional learning coefficients that consider particle movements in all the dimensions of the feature space. The proposed algorithm can likewise be applied in repeatability matters for better decision making, as in medical diagnosis, as proved by the low standard deviation obtained using the proposed algorithm in conducted experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",alswaitti_densitybasedparticleswarm_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Z.",2024,"The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is an older-forest associated species that resides at the center of forest management planning in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California, USA, which are experiencing increasingly large and severe wildfires and drought-related tree mortality. We leveraged advances in passive acoustic survey technologies to develop an acoustically assisted survey design that could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of project-level surveys for spotted owls, allowing surveys to be completed in a single year instead of in multiple years. We deployed an array of autonomous recording units (ARUs) across a landscape and identified spotted owl vocalizations in the resulting audio using BirdNET. We then evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in spotted owl vocalizations near occupied territories and the ability of a crew naïve to the location of occupied territories to locate spotted owls based on patterns of acoustic detections. After only 3 weeks of acoustic surveys, ≥1 ARU within 750 m of all 17 occupied territories obtained spotted owl detections across ≥2 nights. When active surveys using broadcast calling were conducted near ARUs with spotted owl detections by surveyors naïve to territory occupancy status and locations, surveyors located owls in 93% to 100% of occupied territories with ≤3 surveys. To further improve the efficiency of spotted owl surveys, we developed a statistical model to identify and prioritize areas across the Sierra Nevada for different survey methods (active only, acoustically assisted, no surveys) based on the expected probability of occupancy predicted from remotely sensed measurements of tree height and historical occupancy. Depending on managers' tolerance for false negatives, this model could help identify large areas that might not benefit from surveys based on low expected occupancy probabilities and areas where acoustically assisted surveys might enhance survey effectiveness and efficiency. Collectively, these findings can help managers streamline the survey process and thus increase the pace of forest restoration while minimizing potential near-term adverse effects on California spotted owls. © 2023 The Authors.

"Modelling And Evaluation Of Land Use Changes Through Satellite Images In A Multifunctional Catchment: Social, Economic And Environmental Implications","Acuna-Alonso, Carolina and Novo, Ana and Luis Rodriguez, Juan and Varandas, Simone and Alvarez, Xana",2022,"Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016-2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. ""S-Upstream"", ""S-Downstream"" and ""S-Total"". Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11\%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3\% for S-Up; 8.6\% for S-Down and 13\% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (euro15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at euro29,580,643 and euro65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.",acunaalonso_modellingevaluationlandsatellite_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Argo provides continuous observations of ocean temperature and salinity versus pressure, from the sea surface to 2000 dbar. The successful installation of the Argo array and its innovative data management system arose opportunistically from the combination of great scientific need and technological innovation. Through the data system, Argo provides fundamental physical observations with broad societally-valuable applications, built on the cost-efficient and robust technologies of autonomous profiling floats. Following recent advances in platform and sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years ago to (i) improve Argo's global coverage and value beyond the original design, (ii) extend Argo to span the full ocean depth, (iii) add biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding of oceanic cycles of carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean mixing. For Core Argo and each of these enhancements, the past, present, and future progression along a path from experimental deployments to regional pilot arrays to global implementation is described. The objective is to create a fully global, top-to-bottom, dynamically complete, and multidisciplinary Argo Program that will integrate seamlessly with satellite and with other in situ elements of the Global Ocean Observing System (Legler et al., 2015).

The goal of this project was to assist the Republic of South Africa Department of Water Affairs & Forestry to identify a cost-effective remote sensing methodology to accurately measure and monitor agricultural land use for National Water Act water management purposes. The most accurate results were obtained using object-oriented image segmentation techniques applied to SPOT multispectral and panchromatic data (overall accuracy = 89.41%). Accurate classifications were also obtained using just the SPOT multispectral data (85.33%). When applied to Landsat ETM+ and TM data in 2003 and 2005, the image segmentation approach out-performed all other algorithms yielding classification accuracies of 85.71% and 84. 30%, respectively. This is important because Landsat TM type data cover more geography (e.g., 185 & 185 km) than SPOT data (e.g., 60 × 60 km) and are more economical per km2.

This paper quantifies the spatial coverage represented by a finite set of monitoring stations by using global data-data that are possibly of lower resolution and quality. For illustration purposes, merged satellite temperature data from Microwave Sounding Units are used to estimate the representativeness of the Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN). While many metrics exist for evaluating the representativeness of a site, the ability to have highly accurate monthly averaged data is essential for both trend detection and climatology evaluation. The calculated correlations of the monthly averaged upper-troposphere satellite-derived temperatures over the GRUAN stations with all other pixels around the globe show that the current 9 certified GRUAN stations have moderate correlations (r >= 0.7) for approximately 10\% of the earth, but an expanded network incorporating another 15 stations would result in moderate correlations for just over 60\% of the earth. This analysis indicates that the value of additional stations can be quantified by using historical, satellite, or model data and can be used to reveal critical gaps in current monitoring capabilities. Evaluating the value of potential additional stations and prioritizing their initiation can optimize networks. The expansion of networks can be evaluated in a manner that allows for optimal benefit on the basis of optimization theory and economic analyses.",weatherhead_spatialcoveragemonitoringnetworks_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Sar And Lidar Temporal Data Fusion Approaches To Boreal Wetland Ecosystem Monitoring,"Montgomery, Joshua and Brisco, Brian and Chasmer, Laura and Devito, Kevin and Cobbaert, Danielle and Hopkinson, Chris",2019,"The objective of this study was to develop a decision-based methodology, focused on data fusion for wetland classification based on surface water hydroperiod and associated riparian (transitional area between aquatic and upland zones) vegetation community attributes. Multi-temporal, multi-mode data were examined from airborne Lidar (Teledyne Optech, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, Titan), synthetic aperture radar (Radarsat-2, single and quad polarization), and optical (SPOT) sensors with near-coincident acquisition dates. Results were compared with 31 field measurement points for six wetlands at riparian transition zones and surface water extents in the Utikuma Regional Study Area (URSA). The methodology was repeated in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) to determine the transferability of the methods to other boreal environments. Water mask frequency analysis showed accuracies of 93\% to 97\%, and kappa values of 0.8-0.9 when compared to optical data. Concordance results comparing the semi-permanent/permanent hydroperiod between 2015 and 2016 were found to be 98\% similar, suggesting little change in wetland surface water extent between these two years. The results illustrate that the decision-based methodology and data fusion could be applied to a wide range of boreal wetland types and, so far, is not geographically limited. This provides a platform for land use permitting, reclamation monitoring, and wetland regulation in a region of rapid development and uncertainty due to climate change.

Mapping For Coral Reef Conservation: Comparing The Value Of Participatory And Remote Sensing Approaches,"Selgrath, Jennifer C. and Roelfsema, Chris and Gergel, Sarah E. and Vincent, Amanda C. J.",2016,"Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66\%; RS: 76\%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.",selgrath_mappingcoralreefconservation_2016,TRUE,class_round1,cool study to compare local ecological knowledge with RS data
Monitoring Canopy Quality And Improving Equitable Outcomes Of Urban Tree Planting Using Lidar And Machine Learning,"Francis, John and Disney, Mathias and Law, Stephen",2023,"Urban tree canopies are fundamental to mitigating the impacts of climate change within cities as well as providing a range of other important ecosystem, health, and amenity benefits. However, urban tree planting initiatives do not typically utilize data about both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the tree canopy, despite height being a critical determinant of the quality and value of urban canopy cover. We present a novel pipeline that uses airborne LiDAR data to train a multi-task machine learning model to generate estimates of both canopy cover and height in urban areas. We apply this to multi-source multi-spectral imagery for the case study of Chicago, USA. Our results indicate that a multi-task UNet convolutional neural network can be used to generate reliable estimates of canopy cover and height from aerial and satellite imagery. We then use these canopy estimates to allocate 75,000 trees from Chicago's recent green initiative under four scenarios, minimizing the urban heat island effect and then optimizing for an equitable canopy distribution, comparing results when only canopy cover is used, and when both canopy cover and height are considered. Through the introduction of this novel pipeline, we show that including canopy height within decision-making processes allows the distribution of new trees to be optimised to further reduce the urban heat island effect in localities where trees have the highest cooling potential and allows trees to be more equitably distributed to communities with lower quality canopies.",francis_monitoringcanopyqualityimproving_2023,TRUE,class_round1,reference is current distribution of tree canopy
Sentinel-1 Snow Depth Retrieval At Sub-Kilometer Resolution Over The European Alps,"Lievens, Hans and Brangers, Isis and Marshall, Hans-Peter and Jonas, Tobias and Olefs, Marc and De Lannoy, Gabrielle",2022,"Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017-2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%-30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.",lievens_sentinel1snowdepth_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Vermont's omission of GHG emissions from land conversions could result in significant costs of inaction (COI), which could hinder the state's mitigation and adaptation plans and result in climate crisis-related risks (e.g., credit downgrade). Science-based spatio-temporal data of GHG emissions from soils because of land conversions can be integrated into the conceptual framework of ""action"" versus ""inaction"" to prevent GHG emissions. The application of soil information data and remote sensing analysis can identify the GHG emissions from land conversions, which can be expressed as ""realized"" social costs of ""inaction"".

A Data-Driven Approach To Hurricane Debris Modeling,"Gonzalez-Duenas, Catalina and Bernier, Carl and Padgett, Jamie E.",2023,"The large amount of debris generated in the aftermath of hurricane and storm events can cause severe financial and logistical burdens to coastal communities. Existing debris estimation models mainly focus on wind-induced debris and produce estimates with errors of nearly 50\%, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive models that can account for other types of debris while improving accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic framework to estimate the presence and amount of waterborne debris following a severe storm using machine learning (ML) techniques as a function of relevant storm and landcover parameters. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to generate debris presence and volume models, employing pre- and post-event aerial and satellite imagery and a debris removal database for Hurricane Ike, respectively. The results show that the ensemble learning algorithms perform the best for both tasks, with a misclassification error of 5.56\% for the debris presence predictive model, and a normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 11.98 for the debris volume model, the lowest RMSE of the tested algorithms. Dual-layer ML models are also investigated, incorporating the debris presence as a predictor in the debris volume model. The results show a percent error of 11.29\% for the dual-layer model and an approximately 5.4\% increase in performance with respect to the model that does not incorporate debris presence. The generated debris volume and presence models will provide useful tools to inform decision-making, evaluate mitigation strategies, facilitate recovery efforts, and improve resource allocation following a storm event.",gonzalezduenas_datadrivenapproachhurricane_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

A New Method For Long-Term River Discharge Estimation Of Small- And Medium-Scale Rivers By Using Multisource Remote Sensing And Rshs: Application And Validation,"Lou, Hezhen and Zhang, Yujia and Yang, Shengtian and Wang, Xuelei and Pan, Zihao and Luo, Ya",2022,"River discharge is an important hydrological parameter of river water resources. Especially in small- and medium-scale rivers, data deficiency is the biggest problem for studies of river discharge. In recent years, remote sensing has become a rapid and convenient method to estimate river discharge. However, remote sensing images still have some difficulty generating continuous long-term river discharge. To address this problem, we developed a new method coupling the remote sensing hydrology station method (RSHS) with statistical regression downscaling, using data from optical satellites (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), radar satellites (Sentinel-1), and un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We applied this method to monitor monthly river discharge for small- and medium-scale rivers from 2016 to 2020 on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and evaluated the accuracy of the results. The results show that (1) by applying the newly constructed method, the water body continuity index obtained by Landsat-8 increased by 7\% and the average river length percentage in the channel reached 90.7\%, a 40\% increase; (2) there were only 10 river flow data points, on average, in the 5-year period obtained before this method was applied; after this method was applied, more than 50 river flow data points could be obtained, on average, extending the quantity of data fivefold; in addition, improper extreme values could also be avoided; (3) with better continuity of water body distribution, the images provided steadier river widths. The relative error of daily flow estimation from Landsat-8 images was reduced by 60\% and the mean percentage error was reduced by one-fourth. The relative error of the multisource remote sensing composited flow was reduced by 37\% with a reduction in the mean percentage error of over a half; (4) in addition, we found that when the threshold difference between water bodies and land in remote sensing images is more than 0.2, the impact of water body recognition error on flow accuracy can be ignored. This method helps to overcome the absence of remote sensing methods for the long-term estimation of flow series in small- and medium-scale rivers, improves the accuracy of remote sensing methods for calculating flow, and provides ideas for regional water resource management and utilization.",lou_methodtermriverdischarge_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA

The lake has significant economic and environmental impacts that should be managed based on management models. The bathymetry of this lake, which is time consuming and laborious to obtain in the field, is one of the key input files for developing hydrological models of the lake. Remote sensing technology is used to determine satellite bathymetric maps with reasonable accuracy. The objective of the present work was to utilize Landsat 8 satellite imagery to determine the bathymetry of Lake Manzala. Generalized linear model (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, bagging (BAG, an ensemble regression algorithm), least-squares boosting fitting ensemble (LSB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were used in this study to process the images and manage the database of each image. The Landsat images were corrected for atmospheric conditions and the sunglint effect. Then values from the logarithms of corrected reflectance bands (coastal, blue, green, and red) and their ratio logarithms at locations corresponding to GPS surveys were extracted. Two assessing metrics, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation (R), were used to calibrate the derived logarithm values for the model using observed data for the lake. The results show that the BAG and decision tree approaches perform well for Lake Manzala. Such methodologies should be applied for bathymetry determination, especially for shallow lakes, to save monitoring effort and costs.

Steep hillsides have widely been levelled by terraces, in order to control surface water flow and facilitate cultivation. However, under unsustainable management and growing rainfall aggressiveness, terraced vineyards have become one of the most erosion-prone agricultural landscapes. The Valcamonica valley in Lombardy (Italy) presents a typical example of an ancient wine production region where rural land abandonment has previously caused widespread degradation of the traditional terracing systems. Recently, a local revival of wine production led to restoration plans of the terraces and their drainage functioning, to safeguard productivity and hydrogeologic safety. In this study, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) survey was carried out to reconstruct an accurate and precise 3D terrain model of a Valcamonica vineyard through photogrammetry. The resulting high-resolution topographic data allowed insights of surface flow-induced soil erosion patterns based on the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII).

In recent years, many humanitarian actors have joined forces to complement traditional, reactive mechanisms with a forward-looking approach that can be activated before a disaster strikes. Anticipatory action (AA) uses forecasts of extreme weather events and combines them with risk information to identify and implement locally-led early actions with the goal of protecting lives and livelihoods more efficiently. AA is still a relatively new approach. Hence, monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning (MEAL) is crucial to measure its effectiveness and adjust where necessary, as well as for (government) donors that want to see the added value of their investment maximized. However, evidence-based studies that investigate potential limitations and the exact impact pathway of AA at household level are time-consuming, costly, and therefore scarce. Satellite earth observation can become a game changer in AA by strengthening the evidence base via rapid, low-cost assessments. Both commercial and freely available satellite-derived data have reached an unprecedented level of quality, spatial, and temporal resolution. Simultaneously, there are major uncertainties regarding where, when, how, and under what conditions satellite data can support MEAL for AA at all. We argue that satellite data for an advanced MEAL framework should be considered already in the design phase of AA projects and that the translation of satellite data into actionable information will require a cross-cutting community of practice.",enenkel_monitoringevaluationaccountabilitylearning_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Mapping A Specific Class For Priority Habitats Monitoring From Satellite Sensor Data,"Boyd, Doreen S. and Sanchez-Hernandez, Carolina and Foody, Giles M.",2006,"The European Union's Habitats Directive aims to protect biodiversity through the conservation of habitats. If a habitat of interest corresponds to spectrally separable land cover class(es), then this activity can benefit from the production of accurate land cover maps from remotely sensed imagery. Traditionally, the image classification techniques used assume that the set of classes has been defined exhaustively, which requires all of the classes in the region to be included explicitly in the analysis. Often, however, interest focuses on just one or a small sub-set of the classes occurring in the region that represent the habitat(s) of particular interest. Moreover, given that the size of a training set required for an image classification is typically taken to be a function of the number of classes and discriminating variables (e. g. wavebands) used in the classification, the satisfaction of the assumption of an exhaustively defined set of classes requires that much effort is directed wastefully on classes of little, if any, direct interest. Savings in training could be achieved by focusing on the class(es) of specific interest. A more appropriate approach for mapping a specific class may be to adopt a binary classification analysis that simply seeks to separate the class of interest from all others. In this way the analysis focuses on the class(es) of interest and a small training set may be used. An attractive means to achieve this is through the adoption of decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches to classification. This paper evaluates the accuracy with which a habitat of interest to the EU Habitats Directive, fen, can be mapped from Landsat ETM+ imagery of the Norfolk Broads using such classifiers as well as, for comparative purposes, a standard maximum likelihood decision rule implemented by a discriminant analysis. All analyses yielded accurate classifications, with a conventional approach based on a maximum likelihood allocation providing an overall classification accuracy of 88.4\%. However, both the decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches provided classifications that were significantly more accurate than conventional maximum likelihood classification (p < 0.05), with overall accuracies of 91.6 and 93.6\%, respectively (table 3). The results highlight the ability to focus the analysis on the class of interest in a manner that is less wasteful of resources and effort and that yields a more accurate classification than the standard approach.",boyd_mappingspecificclasspriority_2006,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Satellite-Based Crop Production Monitoring In Ukraine And Regional Food Security,"Kogan, F. and Adamenko, T. and Kulbida, M.",2011,"Every year weather vagaries have caused shortfalls of agricultural production regionally and every 3-4 years these shortfalls occurred globally. Therefore, early assessment of crop losses in response to weather fluctuations is an important task for the estimation of global, regional and countries food supply/demand, donor's decision to assists the nations in need and to those receiving the assistance. The new satellite-based technology has been recently developed to provide timely and accurate crops' monitoring and assessments. This technology includes the theory, algorithm, data base and operational implementation of vegetation health (VH) assessments from observations provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown on NOAA operational polar-orbiting satellites. Several AVHRR-based VH indices were developed and used to provide weekly cumulative estimation of moisture, thermal and health conditions of vegetation canopy throughout the growing season. The indices were calculated for the entire 1981-2010 period of the AVHRR sensor in space and were compared with regional crop yields in the two dozens of countries. Strong correlation between wheat (both winter and spring), corn, soybeans and sorghum yield and VH indices was found during the critical period of the tested crops. The test results showed that VH indices can be used as proxy for early (2-5 months in advance of harvest) assessment of crop yield with the errors of estimation less than 10%. This paper discusses utility of space observations for early forecasting regional crop yield in Ukraine, with specific emphasis on 2-5 months warning of weather-related losses in agricultural production and their impact on agricultural supply/demand and food security. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",kogan_satellitebasedcropproduction_2011,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Integrating Detailed Timber Assortments Into Airborne Laser Scanning (Als)-Based Assessments Of Logging Recoveries,"Sanz, Blanca and Malinen, Jukka and Sirparanta, Sanna and Peuhkurinen, Jussi and Leppanen, Vesa and Melkas, Timo and Riekki, Kirsi and Kauranne, Tuomo and Vastaranta, Mikko and Tokola, Timo",2021,"The methodology presented here can assist in making timber markets more efficient when assessing the value of harvestable timber stands and the amounts of timber assortments during the planning of harvesting operations. Information on wood quality and timber assortments is essential for wood valuation and procurement planning as varying wood dimensions and qualities may be utilized and refined in different places, including sawmills, plywood mills, pulp mills, heating plants or combined heat and power plants. We investigate here alternative approaches for generating detailed timber assortments for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch (Betula spp.) from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, aerial images, harvester data and field data. For this purpose, we used 665 circular plots, and logging recovery information recorded from 249 clear-cut stands using cut-to-length harvesters. We estimated timber assortment volumes, economic values and wood paying capabilities (WPC) for each stand in different bucking scenarios, and used the resulting timber assortment estimates to assess logging recoveries. The bucking scenarios were (1) bucking-to-value using maximum sawlog and pulpwood volumes excluding quality (theoretical maximum), and (2) bucking-to-value using sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals for Norway spruce and Scots pine and veneer logs of lengths 4.7 m, 5.0 m, 6.0 m and 6.7 m for birch, either excluding quality (the usual business practice) or including quality (a novel business practice). The results showed that our procedure can assist in locating stands that are likely to be more valuable and have the desired timber assortment distributions. We conclude that the method can estimate WPC with root mean square errors of 28.7\%, 66.0\% and 45.7\% in Norway spruce, Scots pine and birch, respectively, for sawlogs and 19.3\%, 63.7\% and 29.5\% for pulpwood.",sanz_integratingdetailedtimberassortments_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
A Hybrid Kernel-Based Change Detection Method For Remotely Sensed Data In A Similarity Space,"Shah-Hosseini, R. and Homayouni, S. and Safari, A.",2015,"Detection of damages caused by natural disasters is a delicate and difficult task due to the time constraints imposed by emergency situations. Therefore, an automatic Change Detection (CD) algorithm, with less user interaction, is always very interesting and helpful. So far, there is no existing CD approach that is optimal and applicable in the case of (a) labeled samples not existing in the study area; (b) multi-temporal images being corrupted by either noise or non-normalized radiometric differences; (c) difference images having overlapped change and no-change classes that are non-linearly separable from each other. Also, a low degree of automation is not optimal for real-time CD applications and also one-dimensional representations of classical CD methods hide the useful information in multi-temporal images. In order to resolve these problems, two automatic kernel-based CD algorithms (KCD) were proposed based on kernel clustering and support vector data description (SVDD) algorithms in high dimensional Hilbert space. In this paper (a) a new similarity space was proposed in order to increase the separation between change and no-change classes, and also to decrease the processing time, (b) three kernel-based approaches were proposed for transferring the multi-temporal images from spectral space into high dimensional Hilbert space, (c) automatic approach was proposed to extract the precise labeled samples; (d) kernel parameter w a s selected automatically by optimizing an improved cost function and (e) initial value of the kernel parameter was estimated by a statistical method based on the L2-norm distance. Two different datasets including Quickbird and Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries were used for the accuracy of analysis of proposed methods. The comparative analysis showed the accuracy improvements of kernel clustering based CD and SVDD based CD methods with respect to the conventional CD techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction, Independent Component Analysis, Spectral Angle Mapper, Simple Image differencing and Image Rationing, and also the computational cost analysis showed that implementation of the proposed CD method in similarity space decreases the processing runtime. © 2015 by the authors.",shahhosseini_hybridkernelbasedchange_2015,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Determining The Optimal Phenological Stage For Predicting Common Dry Bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris) Yield Using Field Spectroscopy,"Rajah, P. and Odindi, J. and Abdel-Rahman, E. and Mutanga, O.",2017,"On-farm crop productivity and yield prediction are valuable for, among others, designing food policies, on-farm and after-farm planning and pricing, and marketing. Whereas existing prediction approaches are generally reliable, these require extensive and tedious field surveys and adequate ancillary agrometeorological data. Remote sensing offers great potential for quick and reliable means of predicting crop yield, but it necessitates establishment of optimal phenological and spectral bands. Given the socio-economic value of common dry bean, we sought to determine the potential of multi-temporal ground-based hyperspectral data to predict yield of three cultivars grown under irrigated and rain-fed regimes. Canopy-level hyperspectral data were collected from the Gadra, Ukulinga and Caledon cultivars at distinct phenological stages and sparse partial least squares regression was used for spectral analysis. Results indicated that variation in yield could be explained at specific growth stages under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. With the exception of the Gadra cultivar under irrigation, models developed with data at the flowering and pod development stage were more accurate. These findings highlight the potential of temporal phenological ground-based hyperspectral data in predicting common dry bean yield under different watering regimes. The findings provide an opportunity for large-scale yield prediction using airborne or space-borne hyperspectral sensors. © 2017 Southern African Plant & Soil Sciences Committee.",rajah_determiningoptimalphenologicalstage_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Avhrr Data For Real-Time Operational Flood Forecasting In Malaysia,"Billa, L. and Mansor, S. and Mahmud, A. R. and Ghazali, A. H.",2005,"Flash floods strike quickly and in most cases without warning. They are usually observed before any warning can be issued and usually persons and property have been affected before the warning reaches them. Such are the conditions prevalent in Malaysia's extreme monsoon weather that occasionally causes floods and results in the extensive damage to property and sometimes loss of lives. Over the years variously hydrological and structural engineering measures have been implemented for flood monitoring and forecasting. These measures have only yielded limited success as may be seen in the recurring flood situation. Yearly financial and property loss estimates have increased and an estimated cost of over 2.5 billion RM is projected for the year 2004 according to sources from the drainage and irrigation department of Malaysia. It has thus become apparent that Malaysia institutes an effective operational flood forecasting to arrest the persisting flood problem. In this paper we will expound on current flood management and forecasting system being implemented in the country, particularly the Klang Valley that includes Kuala Lumpur where there has been tremendous urban growth and development in the last one and half decades. The paper further discusses where current flood management systems have been lacking in the absence of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts. Where as hydrodynamic simulations and structural control measures have been emphasized in many flood management systems in Malaysia, the integration of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts have been conspicuously absent, rendering most in-situ flood forecasts and early warnings ineffective in address the flood problem in the country. Malaysia is a tropical country that lies along the path of the northeast and southwest monsoon. Although satellite image based NWP have proved useful for the tropical and equatorial regions of the world in flood forecasting, they have yet to be applied in Malaysia. Observations have generally shown heavy cumulonimbus clouds formation and thunderstorms precede the usual heavy monsoon rains that cause floods in the region. This makes quantitative precipitation forecast a must be input to any flood early warning design. Numerous empirical studies have determined that cloud top temperatures less that 235k in the tropics are generally expected to produce convective rainfall at the rate of 3mm/hr. In this study we thus investigate monsoon cloud formation that has the propensity to precipitate using NOAA-AVHRR data for real-time operational flood early warning in Malaysia. The AVHRR data has been preferred for its relatively high temporal resolution of at most 6/hours, its easy acquisition and cost effectiveness and its ability for automated geometric rectification when compared to GEOS and GMS data. Cloud cover and types are processed using cloud indexing and pattern recognition techniques on the AVHRR data. The cloud indexing technique was initially developed for NOAA but was later also adapted for Geostationary satellite images. The technique assigns rainfall levels to each cloud type identifies in an image based on the relationship between cold and bright clouds top temperature and the high probability of precipitation. We discuss how visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) techniques are applied to bi-spectral cloud classification and rain areas are determined by classifying pixel clusters in the VIS/IR histogram. Precipitation probability is evaluated based on the relationship between cold and brightness temperature of clouds. The near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) channels 3, 4, and 5 of the data are processed for temperature and brightness. Cold clouds with temperature below 235k threshold value are taken as indication of rain. Rainfall is estimated based on the assumption that every cloud pixel has a constant unit rain-rate of 3mmh-1, which is appropriate for tropical precipitation over 2.5° × 2.5° areas around the equator. The paper finally discusses current developments in nowcasting that utilizes latest satellite observatio s together with numerical weather prediction models and how this system can be adapted to the needs of very short term forecast for flood early warnings in Malaysia. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",billa_avhrrdatarealtime_2005,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Electricity consumption at a local level is crucial for utility planners to manage and invest in the electrical grid. With this study, we propose an electricity consumption estimation model at the district level using machine learning with publicly available statistical data and built-up area (BU), area of lit (AL), and sum of light intensity (SL) data extracted from Landsat 8 and Suomi NPP satellite nighttime light images. The models created from three machine learning algorithms, which included Multiple Linear Regression (MR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were compared. The results show that (1) electricity consumption is highly correlated with SL, AL, and BU; and (2) the DT model demonstrated a better performance in predicting local electricity consumption when compared to MR and SVR with the lowest error rate and highest R-2.

"Catching ""Butterflies"" In The Morning: A New Methodology For Rapid Detection Of Aerially Deployed Plastic Land Mines From Uavs","De Smet, T.

Millions of these are surface plastic land mines with low-pressure detonation regimes, such as the mass-produced Soviet PFM-1. These aerially deployed land mines are concentrated primarily in postconflict developing countries such as Afghanistan and represent a continued humanitarian threat, while also thwarting economic and social development in impacted regions. Identification of this particular type of MEC category poses a significant geophysical challenge, as these mines contain almost no metal (nonferrous aluminum). As a result, standard MEC detection and remediation methodologies based on geophysical principles of magnetometry and electromagnetic induction prove largely ineffective and possibly dangerous. Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles can rapidly collect large remotely sensed data sets with no risk to MEC technicians. We present results of an experiment focused on remotely assessing thermal signatures of plastic land mines relative to background geology to show that this type of analysis permits rapid detection of randomly dispersed plastic MECs with a high degree of accuracy and low associated costs. © 2018 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",desmet_catchingbutterfliesmorningmethodology_2018,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Linking Geomatics And Participatory Social Analysis For Environmental Monitoring: Case Studies From Malawi,"Haan, N. and Gumbo, D. and Eastman, J.

Until recently, these two methods were used as distinct approaches at varying levels of inquiry. Using two case studies from Malawi, inductive and deductive approaches to land-use/landcover monitoring illustrate the utility of linking geomatics and social analysis as complementary tools. While both studies integrate geomatics with community-based social analysis, the starting point for each is different. The first case study begins by identifying where environmental change is occurring without preconceived hypotheses of causes. The use of geomatics in this case guides the researchers in determining where to conduct more in-depth analysis of explanations of change. The second case study begins with an environmental policy question - ""What has been the effect of market liberalization on the environment?"" - and then uses remote sensing to evaluate a set of hypotheses. This is the deductive approach. Regardless of the starting point, integrating geomatics and social analysis can promote a cycle of inductive and deductive research.

Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of ""big unstructured data"" for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on ""big data."" Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritize data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs. standardized data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: (1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardized long-termspecies population studies; (2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and (3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.",bayraktarov_unstructuredbiodiversitydataknowledge_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Index-Based Insurance For Climate Risk Management And Rural Development In Syria,"Bobojonov, Ihtiyor and Aw-Hassan, Aden and Sommer, Rolf",2014,"Improving the adaptive capacity of rural producers to climate and weather risks may become an urgent issue in the early stages of political stabilization in Syria.

Insurance schemes designed according to these indexes performed very well in terms of covering revenue losses in most of the extreme drought years observed in the country.

Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Prediction And Satellite Data For Forecasting Us Maize Yield,"Peng, Bin and Guan, Kaiyu and Pan, Ming and Li, Yan",2018,"Seasonal agricultural production forecasting is essential for agricultural supply chain and economic prediction. However, to what extent seasonal climate prediction and remote sensing observations can improve crop yield forecasting at regional scale remains unknown. Using a statistical seasonal forecasting framework for U.S. county-level maize yield, we demonstrated that (1) incorporating satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly improved the yield forecasting performance, compared with other climate-only models using monthly air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). (2) The bias-corrected climate prediction from the Coupled Forecast System model version 2 (CFSv2) showed better yield forecasting performance than the historical climate ensemble. (3) Using the ""T + P + VPD + EVI"" model with climate prediction from bias-corrected climate prediction from CFSv2 outperformed the yield forecast in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates reports released by the United States Department of Agriculture, with root-mean-square error of 4.37 bushels per acre (2.79\% of multiyear averaged yield) by early August. Plain Language Summary Given the significant advances in both seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing, these data have not been fully used in crop yield forecasting at regional scale, and their benefits are to be quantified compared to survey-based approaches. Here we evaluated the benefits of using seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing data in forecasting U.S. maize yield at both national and county levels. To achieve this goal, we built a seasonal forecasting system for U.S. maize yield by bridging the most advanced seasonal climate prediction products from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) with a statistical crop modeling framework. We found we could not achieve a better forecasting performance than the official survey-based forecast from United States Department of Agriculture until we used both climate and remote sensing observations in our model. Compared with using historical climate information for the unknown future in each growing season, using climate prediction from NCEP gave better forecasting performance once we corrected the bias in the seasonal climate prediction products. Using our climate-remote sensing combined model and bias-corrected climate prediction from NCEP, we achieved a better forecasting performance than the United States Department of Agriculture forecast.

We created land use regression (LUR) models for SO2, NO2 and PM10 for Tianjin, China. Traffic volumes, road networks, land use data, population density, meteorological conditions, physical conditions and satellite-derived greenness, brightness and wetness were used for predicting SO2, NO2 and PM10 concentrations. We incorporated data on industrial point sources to improve LUR model performance. In order to consider the impact of different sources, we calculated the PSIndex, LSIndex and area of different land use types (agricultural land, industrial land, commercial land, residential land, green space and water area) within different buffer radii (1 to 20 km). This method makes up for the lack of consideration of source impact based on the LUR model. Remote sensing-derived variables were significantly correlated with gaseous pollutant concentrations such as SO2 and NO2. R-2 values of the multiple linear regression equations for SO2, NO2 and PM10 were 0.78, 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, and the RMSE values were 0.32, 0.18 and 0.21, respectively. Model predictions at validation monitoring sites went well with predictions generally within 15\% of measured values. Compared to the relationship between dependent variables and simple variables (such as traffic variables or meteorological condition variables), the relationship between dependent variables and integrated variables was more consistent with a linear relationship.

Small Drones For Community-Based Forest Monitoring: An Assessment Of Their Feasibility And Potential In Tropical Areas,"Paneque-Galvez, Jaime and McCall, Michael K. and Napoletano, Brian M. and Wich, Serge A. and Koh, Lian Pin",2014,"Data gathered through community-based forest monitoring (CBFM) programs may be as accurate as those gathered by professional scientists, but acquired at a much lower cost and capable of providing more detailed data about the occurrence, extent and drivers of forest loss, degradation and regrowth at the community scale. In addition, CBFM enables greater survey repeatability. Therefore, CBFM should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to CBFM, in this paper we assess: (1) the feasibility of using small, low-cost drones (i.e., remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in CBFM programs; (2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities, partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization, coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge, would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so, we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance CBFM and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities.

Costs And Benefits Of Satellite-Based Tools For Irrigation Management,"Vuolo, Francesco and Essl, Laura and Atzberger, Clement",2015,"This paper presents the results of a collaborative work with farmers and a cost-benefit analysis of geospatial technologies applied to irrigation water management in a semi-arid agricultural area in Lower Austria. We use Earth observation (Eo) data to estimate crop evapotranspiration (Et) and webGlS technologies to deliver maps and irrigation advice to farmers. The study reports the technical and qualitative evaluation performed during a demonstration phase in 2013 and provides an outlook to future developments. The calculation of the benefits is based on a comparison of the irrigation volumes estimated from satellite vs. the irrigation supplied by the farmers. In most cases, the amount of water supplied was equal to the maximum amount of water required by crops. At the same time high variability was observed for the different irrigation units and crop types. Our data clearly indicates that economic benefits could be achieved by reducing irrigation volumes, especially for water-intensive crops. Regarding the qualitative evaluation, most of the farmers expressed a very positive interest in the provided information. In particular, information related to crop ET was appreciated as this helps to make better informed decisions on irrigation. The majority of farmers (54\%) also expressed a general willingness to pay, either directly or via cost sharing, for such a service. Based on different cost scenarios, we calculated the cost of the service. Considering 20,000 ha regularly irrigated land, the advisory service would cost between 2.5 and 4.3 (sic)/ha per year depending on the type of satellite data used. For comparison, irrigation costs range between 400 and 1000 /ha per year for a typical irrigation volume of 2000 cubic meters per ha.

In addition to traditional archaeological excavation and prospecting techniques, we used UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) to produce NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) orthomosaic plans of ten cultivated areas through which the road is conjectured to pass. NDVI orthomosaics let us see crop marks better than with conventional photography, allowing us to detect the crop marks during times of the year and in places where conventional photography would fail to show them. Thanks to the NDVI orthomosaics, remains of the road were identified not only in places where we knew it existed, but also in previously unknown locations. Furthermore, other archaeological features were identified close to the roadway. This technique heralds a great advance in non-invasive methods of archaeological surveying.

Integrating Field And Satellite Data For Spatially Explicit Inference On The Density Of Threatened Arboreal Primates,"Cavada, Nathalie and Ciolli, Marco and Rocchini, Duccio and Barelli, Claudia and Marshall, Andrew R. and Rovero, Francesco",2017,"Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.",cavada_integratingfieldsatellitedata_2017,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Remote sensing of trees is used in commercial applications but has limited uptake in the fire management community. A two-stage detection and identification convolutional network for high-resolution RGB drone imagery is developed to address this limitation. The detection routine is based on DeepForest, an existing convolutional neural network implementation designed to recognize trees in aerial imagery. Retraining the model and implementing an adaptive window-size workflow improves tree detection, with F-1 scores reaching 85\% and averaging 72\% for k-fold cross-validation in boreal forest. For classification, a VGG19 network with added data augmentation and dropout layers is trained. When this network is implemented, manually annotated trees are recognized as coniferous with an average F-1 of 97\% and deciduous with an 87\% F-1. Overall, the developed image-to-attribute model for trees reaches a maximum F-1 score of 85\% considering classification after identification, with averages of 72\% for coniferous trees and 57\% for deciduous trees over six sites. Tree height, size, and stem density are extracted from the tree location output and geometric data. The calculated density is compared to the density of manual annotations, with an average R-2 of 0.90.

Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Emergent Challenges For Science Suas Data Management: Fairness Through Community Engagement And Best Practices Development,"Wyngaard, Jane and Barbieri, Lindsay and Thomer, Andrea and Adams, Josip and Sullivan, Don and Crosby, Christopher and Parr, Cynthia and Klump, Jens and Raj Shrestha, Sudhir and Bell, Tom",2019,"The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) as platforms for data capture has rapidly increased in recent years. However, while there has been significant investment in improving the aircraft, sensors, operations, and legislation infrastructure for such, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of the complex data capture pipeline sUAS involve. This paper reports on a four-year, community-based investigation into the tools, data practices, and challenges that currently exist for particularly researchers using sUAS as data capture platforms. The key results of this effort are: (1) sUAS captured data-as a set that is rapidly growing to include data in a wide range of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Engineering Disciplines, and many civil and commercial use cases-is characterized as both sharing many traits with traditional remote sensing data and also as exhibiting-as common across the spectrum of disciplines and use cases-novel characteristics that require novel data support infrastructure; and (2), given this characterization of sUAS data and its potential value in the identified wide variety of use case, we outline eight challenges that need to be addressed in order for the full value of sUAS captured data to be realized. We conclude that there would be significant value gained and costs saved across both commercial and academic sectors if the global sUAS user and data management communities were to address these challenges in the immediate to near future, so as to extract the maximal value of sUAS captured data for the lowest long-term effort and monetary cost.",wyngaard_emergentchallengessciencesuas_2019,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Fuel Modelling Characterisation Using Low-Density Lidar In The Mediterranean: An Application To A Natural Protected Area,"Ferrer Palomino, Aurora and Rodriguez Y Silva, Francisco",2021,"Fuel structure and characteristics are important to better understand and predict wildfire behaviour. The aim of the present study was to develop a methodology for characterising fuel models using low-density and free LiDAR data that facilitate the work of managers of protected territories. Field inventories were carried out in order to understand the characteristics of the stand and the variables that fuel models must include. This information, together with the use of the intensity and structure provided by LiDAR, was used to perform statistical analyses. The linear regressions obtained to characterise the stand of the mixed Quercus spp.-Pinus ssp.-dominated stand had an R-2 value ranging from 0.4393 to 0.66. While working with low-density LiDAR data (which has more difficulties crossing the canopy), in addition to the obtained results, we performed the statistical analysis of the dominant stand to obtain models with R-2 values ranging from 0.8201 to 0.8677. The results of this research show that low-density LiDAR data are significant; however, in mixed stands, it is necessary to only use the dominant stratum because other components generate noise, which reduces the predictive capacity of the models. Additionally, by using the decision tree developed in combination, it is possible to update the mapping of fuel models in inaccessible areas, thereby significantly reducing costs.",ferrerpalomino_fuelmodellingcharacterisationlow_2021,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Cloud Cover And Its Impact On Brazil's Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Program: Evidence From The Cerrado Biome Of The Brazilian Legal Amazon,"Sales, Vilane G. and Strobl, Eric and Elliott, Robert J. R.",2022,"The creation of a satellite rapid alert programme (DETER-A) in 2004 was a cornerstone of the Brazilian government's strategy to reduce deforestation. This programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to periods of deforestation. Due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation. This paper investigates to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the DETER-A program to detect deforestation. To test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation. The emphasis is on the state of Maranhao, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (Legal Amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not. The results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7\% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of CO2 with a value of US\$ 366 million. If the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument DETER-C/DETER INTENSO, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection.",sales_cloudcoverimpactbrazil's_2022,TRUE,class_round1,NA
Enabling Efficient Service Function Chains At Terrestrial-Satellite Hybrid Cloud Networks,"Feng, B. and Li, G. and Li, G. and Zhang, Y. and Zhou, H. and Yu, S.",2019,"The great improvements in both satellite and terrestrial networks have motivated the academic and industrial communities to rethink their integration. As a result, there is an increasing interest in new-generation hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks, where sufficient flexibility should be enabled to deploy customized SFCs to satisfy the growing diversity of user needs. However, it is still challenging to achieve such a nice vision, since many key issues remain unaddressed comprehensively such as framework design, communication procedures and resource optimization. Therefore, in this article, we focus on how to efficiently deploy customized SFCs at terrestrial-satellite hybrid cloud networks. In particular, we first propose an elastic framework used for SFC deployment at clouds, and second propose an efficient SFC mapping approach for improvement of system resource utilization. Finally, we verify the proposed framework at a proof-of-concept prototype via a number of use cases, and evaluate the proposed mapping approach through extensive simulations based on a real-world topology.

However, the use of different types of images concerning the same landscape may influence social preferences and thus perceptions of landscape management and planning decisions. We evaluated landscape preferences and perceptions in four landscapes of southern Chile. We specifically: (1) compared people's perceptions related to living in, visiting, the scenic beauty, well-being, risks, and level of landscape disturbance; and (2) evaluated the influence of the type of scene (i.e., eye-level or aerial images) in these preferences and perceptions. Preferences and perceptions resulted to be better when using eye-level (4.0 +/- 1.1) than aerial (3.7 +/- 0.6) images. In general, we observed a negative association between preferences and perceptions and the landscape disturbance; however, it was consistent when using aerial images but was masked when valuing landscape through eye-level images. Implications of these results are relevant because by far, most landscape preference studies use traditional eye-level images.

M.",2023,"In modern agriculture, understanding the spatio-temporal variability in crop fields and the implications of environmental factors in soil management are important for sustainable practices. In this case, the management zones (MZ) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management. Currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing MZs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different. Therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the potential of these datasets to design MZs. The study was conducted at a corn field located in Paraguay. The datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (I) electrical conductivity, (II) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (III) spectral information (optical and thermal) derived from Landsat 8 images. MZs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps. In this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between MZs and yield maps. The best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from Landsat 8. Correlations between vegetation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for NBR2 index, but EVI, SAVI and NDVI also presented good results (r > 0.7). Furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at V8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between MZs and yield.

Satellite Imagery As A Single Source Of Predictor Variables For Habitat Suitability Modelling: How Landsat Can Inform The Conservation Of A Critically Endangered Lemur,"Lahoz-Monfort, J. J. and Guillera-Arroita, G. and Milner-Gulland, E. J. and Young, R. P. and Nicholson, E.",2010,"1. Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species.5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain. © 2010 The Authors.

This natural disaster causes considerable damage to the biodiversity of this region during the dry fire season. The area selected for the present study, Eravikulam National Park, which is predominantly of grassland vegetation, is also prone to forest fires. This study aims to delineate the forest fire risk zones in Eravikulam National Park using remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. In the present study, methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Frequency Ratio (FR) were used to derive the weights, and the results were compared. We have used seven factors, i.e. land cover types, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, slope angle, slope aspect, distance from the settlement, and distance from the road to prepare the fire risk zone map. The area of the prepared risk zone maps is divided into three zones, namely low, moderate, and high. From the study, it was found that the fire occurring in this area is due to natural as well as anthropogenic factors. The prepared forest fire risk zone maps are validated using the fire incidence data for the period from January 2003 to June 2019 collected from the records of the Forest Survey of India. The investigation revealed that 72\% and 24\% of the fire incidences occurred in the high risk zone of the maps prepared using the AHP and FR methods, respectively, which ascertained the superiority of the AHP method over the FR method for forest fire risk zone mapping. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis gives an area under the ROC curve (ALIC) value of 0.767 and 0.567 for the AHP and FR methods, respectively.

S.",2023,"The study of flood risks has a fundamental role in ensuring the safety of cities near rivers and drawing up plans to protect them during future floods. This study aims to manage potential flood risks, and Tikrit city was used as a case study. The daily discharge of the Tigris River in the study area was provided by the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources from 2019 to 2022. The HEC-RAS software was utilized to build a 2-D flood model to simulate potential flood scenarios. First, the model was calibrated by adjusting the value of Manning's coefficient (n), and it was found that n = 0.031 reflects the nature of the region because the Nash-Sutcliff Error (NSE) was 0.93. Then, the efficiency of the 2-D flood model was verified by comparing the model’s results with the study area’s satellite images, and the results showed a great match. Following that, the 2-D model was used under different flooding scenarios. The results showed that the size of areas exposed to flooding increased with the discharges passing through the Tigris River. For instance, increasing the discharge to 800m3/s increased the flooded areas by 13.7%, while increasing the discharge to 1500 m3/s increased the flooded areas by 90.7 % compared to the river’s normal flow. Also, the results showed that the eastern regions of the riverbanks are more vulnerable to flooding than the western side because the ground levels are low on the eastern side compared to the western part of the riverbanks. © 2023 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, TIKRIT UNIVERSITY.",mohammedali_floodriskanalysistigris_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Evaluating Performance Of Community-Based Irrigation Schemes Using Remote-Sensing Technologies To Enhance Sustainable Irrigation Water Management,"Bashe, Tsigemariam and Alamirew, Tena and Dejen, Zeleke Agide",2023,"An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme's performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77\% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50\% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment.",bashe_evaluatingperformancecommunitybased_2023,FALSE,class_round1,NA

Rapid Estimation Of Canopy Nitrogen Of Cereal Crops At Paddock Scale Using A Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index,"Perry, Eileen M. and Fitzgerald, Glenn J. and Nuttall, James G. and O'Leary, Garry J. and Schulthess, Urs and Whitlock, Andrew",2012,"Rising nitrogen (N) fertiliser costs and concerns over environmental impacts have emphasized the need for rapid, non-destructive, paddock-scale tools to support optimal management of N fertiliser in cereal crops. Remote sensing of canopy reflectance is one approach to address the information needed to guide N applications. One remote sensing vegetation index, the Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) was developed to address issues of confounding effects of biomass and chlorophyll concentration, and Fitzgerald et al. (2010) linked the CCCI to the Canopy Nitrogen Index (CNI), a scaled index of the plant N. In the research presented here, we extend the work by Fitzgerald et al. (2010) and Cammarano et al. (2011) to whole paddocks with ground-based, airborne and satellite imagery. The methodology was applied to 11 datasets using multispectral cameras deployed on ground-based and airborne platforms, and to satellite imagery. The previously published relationship between CNI and CCCI was applied to the CCCI and biomass measurements from these new datasets to estimate CNI. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.70. A regression using the means from each dataset produced an r(2) of 0.60, and a standard error of 0.82 (\%N). Exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.87 and reduced the standard error to 0.45 (\%N). A crop model (APSIM v7) was used to simulate above ground dry matter to substitute for measured biomass, and plant N was determined from the measured CCCI and simulated biomass. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.49. The regression using the averages from each dataset was not significant (F-pr >0.10); however, exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.89 and reduced the standard error to 0.42 (\%N). To demonstrate the utility of the methods, simulated biomass values coupled with CNI estimated from RapidEye imagery were used to generate paddock maps of plant N. While the agreement between measured and estimated plant N at the paddock scales is not as close as the previous work done at small plot scales, the method shows promise, particularly if biomass can be estimated through modeling or non-destructive measures.

Landscape Design As A Tool To Reduce Soil Salinization: The Study Case Of Keriya Oasis (Nw China),"Seydehmet, Jumeniyaz and Lv, Guang-Hui and Abliz, Abdugheni",2019,"Irrational use and management of water and land are associated with poor hydro-geological conditions causing water logging and salinization problems, possibly leading to farmland abandonment and economic loss. This poses a great challenge to the sustainability of oasis' and requires desalinization through reasonable landscape design by multiple crossing studies so we collected traditional knowledge by field interviews and literature schemes, except for the modern desalinization approaches by literature, and we found that the salinization problem has been solved by traditional land reclamation, traditional drainage, natural drainage and flood irrigation, locally. It is worth mentioning that the traditional reclamation in salinized areas requires flood water, sand dunes and a salinized pit area; the sand dunes are used to elevate the pit surface, and water is used to leach salt from the soil. Natural drainage (the depth and width are 4-10 m and 50-100 m, respectively) caused by flash flooding has significant benefits to some salinized villages in the range of 3000-5000 m and ancient groundwater drainage systems, such as Karez are supporting the oasis with drainage water for centuries. In addition landscape characteristics, salinization and hydro-geological conditions of the oasis were studied from Landsat image, DEM, literature and field photos. Then based on the gathered information above, a desalinization model was developed to decrease the groundwater table and salt leaching in the water logging landscape. Then according to landscape characteristics, different desalinization approaches were recommended for different landscapes. To address environmental uncertainties, an adaptive landscape management and refinement approach was developed, and acceptance of the model was validated by stakeholder opinion.

Multi-Decadal Assessment Of Soil Loss In A Mediterranean Region Characterized By Contrasting Local Climates,"Samela, Caterina and Imbrenda, Vito and Coluzzi, Rosa and Pace, Letizia and Simoniello, Tiziana and Lanfredi, Maria",2022,"Soil erosion is one of the most widespread soil degradation phenomena worldwide. Mediterranean landscapes, due to some peculiar characteristics, such as fragility of soils, steep slopes, and rainfall distribution during the year, are particularly subject to this phenomenon, with severe and complex issues for agricultural production and biodiversity protection. In this paper, we present a diachronic approach to the analysis of soil loss, which aims to account for climate variability and land cover dynamics by using remote data about rainfall and land cover to guarantee sufficient observational continuity. The study area (Basilicata, Southern Italy) is characterized by different local climates and ecosystems (temperate, Csa and Csb; arid steppic, Bsk; and cold, Dsb and Dsc), and is particularly suited to represent the biogeographical complexity of the Mediterranean Italy. The well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was applied by integrating information from remote sensing to carry out decadal assessments (1994, 2004, 2014, and 2021) of the annual soil loss. Changes in the rainfall regime and vegetation cover activity were derived from CHIRPS and Landsat data, respectively, to obtain updated information useful for dynamical studies. For the analyzed region, soil loss shows a slight reduction (albeit always remarkable) over the whole period, and distinct spatial patterns between lowland Bsk and Mediterranean mountain Dsb and Dsc climate areas. The most alarming fact is that most of the study area showed soil erosion rates in 2021 greater than 11 t/ha{*}y, which is considered by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) the threshold for identifying severe erosion phenomena. A final comparison with local studies shows, on average, differences of about 5 t ha(-1) y(-1) (minimum 2.5 and maximum 7) with respect to the local estimates obtained with the RUSLE model. The assessment at a regional scale provided an average 9.5\% of soil loss difference for the arable lands and about 10\% for all cultivated areas. The spatial-temporal patterns enhance the relevance of using the cover management factor C derived from satellite data rather than land cover maps, as remote observations are able to highlight the heterogeneity in vegetation density within the same vegetation cover class, which is particularly relevant for agricultural areas. For mountain areas, the adoption of a satellite-gridded rainfall dataset allowed the detection of erosion rate fluctuations due to rainfall variability, also in the case of sparse or absent ground pluviometric stations. The use of remote data represents a precious added value to obtain a dynamic picture of the spatial-temporal variability of soil loss and new insights into the sustainability of soil use in a region whose economy is mostly based on agriculture and the exploitation of natural resources.",samela_multidecadalassessmentsoil_2022,FALSE,class_round1,NA
Remotely Sensed Vegetation Productivity Predicts Breeding Activity And Drought Refuges For A Threatened Bird In Semi-Arid Australia,"Young, A. R. and Selwood, K. E. and Benshemesh, J. and Wright, J. and Southwell, D.",2022,"Refuges play a critical role protecting species against the effects of climate change. Managing high priority refuges could improve species resilience and facilitate dispersal during periods of environmental change. In this study, we identified drought refuges in semi-arid Australia for a threatened bird, the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata. Using a Poisson regression model, we quantified the effect of remotely sensed vegetation indices, rainfall, soil moisture and site characteristics on malleefowl breeding activity at 144 sites surveyed from 2000 to 2017 during and after drought. We tested the effect of two vegetation productivity indices on malleefowl breeding activity - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) - averaged across three temporal and three spatial scales during the mound building and incubation stage of the breeding cycle. We found that NDVI and EVI were better predictors of malleefowl breeding activity than soil moisture and winter rainfall. The model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value contained NDVI averaged over 3 months (June-August) and a 1-km radius. Malleefowl breeding activity had a strong positive association with NDVI (0.42 +/- se 0.03) and a negative association with slope (-0.34 +/- se 0.03) and vegetation patch size (-0.23 +/- se 0.02). We found the proportion of refugia (top 20\% of predicted breeding activity) in protected areas was highly variable, decreasing from 42\% in an extreme wet year (2011) to 14\% in an extreme drought year (2007). Expanding the reserve network to include refugia predicted to occur in the south of semi-arid Victoria could improve resilience of malleefowl to climate change. We demonstrate how remotely sensed vegetation indices combined with citizen science data can identify where to protect native vegetation with high, stable productivity.

Neutrosophic Game Pricing Methods With Risk Aversion For Pricing Of Data Products,"Luo, Suizhi and Xing, Lining",2021,"With the progressive development of satellite image data products, their pricing strategies become more and more important for enterprises to earn profits. The objective of this study is to explore several game pricing methods with risk aversion for pricing of data products in neutrosophic environments. First, to reflect the uncertainty of problem parameters, the idea of neutrosophic variables is adopted. With the aid of neutrosophic variables, the truth, indeterminacy and falsity degrees of players can be intuitively and conveniently obtained. Subsequently, considering the risk aversion of decision makers, the optimistic value theory is introduced into neutrosophic variables for calculating the optimistic value of player's profits. Then, different pricing models are constructed under the Bertrand and Stackelberg game scenarios, respectively. After deriving the corresponding equilibrium equations, some numerical instances are provided to testify the feasibility of our methods. Furthermore, the influences of dissimilar market power structures are examined.

We retrospectively compared archived remotely sensed measurements (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity) with previously published data from an environmental study of V. parahaemolyticus in Alabama oysters to assess the utility of the former data for predicting V. parahaemolyticus densities in oysters. Remotely sensed sea surface temperature correlated well with previous in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.86) of bottom water temperature, supporting the notion that remotely sensed sea surface temperature data are a sufficiently accurate substitute for direct measurement. Turbidity and chlorophyll levels were not determined in the previous study, but in comparison with the V. parahaemolyticus data, remotely sensed values for these parameters may explain some of the variation in V. parahaemolyticus levels. More accurate determination of these effects and the temporal and spatial variability of these parameters may further improve the accuracy of prediction models. To illustrate the utility of remotely sensed data as a basis for risk management, predictions based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration V. parahaemolyticus risk assessment model were integrated with remotely sensed sea surface temperature data to display graphically variations in V. parahaemolyticus density in oysters associated with spatial variations in water temperature.

Predicting Breeding Habitat For Amphibians: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Across Yellowstone National Park,"Bartelt, Paul E. and Gallant, Alisa L. and Klaver, Robert W. and Wright, Chris K. and Patla, Debra A. and Peterson, Charles R.",2011,"The ability to predict amphibian breeding across landscapes is important for informing land management decisions and helping biologists better understand and remediate factors contributing to declines in amphibian populations. We built geospatial models of likely breeding habitats for each of four amphibian species that breed in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We used field data collected in 2000-2002 from 497 sites among 16 basins and predictor variables from geospatial models produced from remotely sensed data (e. g., digital elevation model, complex topographic index, landform data, wetland probability, and vegetative cover). Except for 31 sites in one basin that were surveyed in both 2000 and 2002, all sites were surveyed once. We used polytomous regression to build statistical models for each species of amphibian from (1) field survey site data only, (2) field data combined with data from geospatial models, and (3) data from geospatial models only. Based on measures of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scores, models of the second type best explained likely breeding habitat because they contained the most information (ROC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88). However, models of the third type could be applied to the entire YNP landscape and produced maps that could be verified with reserve field data. Accuracy rates for models built for single years were highly variable, ranging from 0.30 to 0.78. Accuracy rates for models built with data combined from multiple years were higher and less variable, ranging from 0.60 to 0.80. Combining results from the geospatial multiyear models yielded maps of ""core"" breeding areas (areas with high probability values for all three years) surrounded by areas that scored high for only one or two years, providing an estimate of variability among years. Such information can highlight landscape options for amphibian conservation. For example, our models identify alternative areas that could be protected for each species, including 6828-10 764 ha for tiger salamanders, 971-3017 ha for western toads, 4732-16 696 ha for boreal chorus frogs, and 4940-19 690 ha for Columbia spotted frogs.",bartelt_predictingbreedinghabitatamphibians_2011,FALSE,class_round1,NA

D.",2014,"This paper describes an approach to accurately separate out and quantify crop dominance areas in the major command area in the Krishna River Basin. Classification was performed using IRS-P6 (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, series P6) and MODIS eight-day time series remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 23.6 m, 250 m for the year 2005. Temporal variations in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) pattern obtained in crop dominance classes enables a demarcation between long duration crops and short duration crops. The NDVI pattern was found to be more consistent in long duration crops than in short duration crops due to the continuity of the water supply. Surface water availability, on the other hand, was dependent on canal water release, which affected the time of crop sowing and growth stages, which was, in turn, reflected in the NDVI pattern. The identified crop-wise classes were tested and verified using ground-truth data and state-level census data. The accuracy assessment was performed based on ground-truth data through the error matrix method, with accuracies from 67\% to 100\% for individual crop dominance classes, with an overall accuracy of 79\% for all classes. The derived major crop land areas were highly correlated with the sub-national statistics with R-2 values of 87\% at the mandal (sub-district) level for 2005-2006. These results suggest that the methods, approaches, algorithms and datasets used in this study are ideal for rapid, accurate and large-scale mapping of paddy rice, as well as for generating their statistics over large areas. This study demonstrates that IRS-P6 23.6-m one-time data fusion with MODIS 250-m time series data is very useful for identifying crop type, the source of irrigation water and, in the case of surface water irrigation, the way in which it is applied.

Where's Woolly?

Early detection of pest and pathogen invasions may allow timely control and prevention methods to be implemented. Species distribution models (SDMs) and remote sensing (RS) methods have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage. However, previous work integrating these two methods has rarely used RS metrics that have biological meaning. We use RS difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, locations using MaxEnt in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DWGNRA). Brightness, greenness, wetness, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for December 1982 and 2010. A difference for each index was created by subtracting the 1982 value from the 2010 value. We compared two models, one using difference indices and the other using 2010 indices along with other ancillary data layers, to determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance. Variables with low importance were removed from both models, leaving NDVI, Wetness, soil, and elevation in the two final models. The difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent, across a number of threshold values. Despite this small difference in accuracy, however, the infected area predicted by the difference model (5.1\% of total area) was approximately 1/2 of that predicted by the single year model (9.6\% of total area). These results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about 50\%, suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach. This method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Malthusian geometric population growth and continuous demands for food, shelter, clothing, energy and even pleasure has led to depletion of natural resources. Land is limited in supply and its finite nature makes it a scarce resource that cannot meet its demand. The use of land is a reflection of our decisions, which will determine how sustainable our future will be. Detecting land use changes requires timely and accurate information which can be assured by using remotely sensed data and GIS. Analyzing the correlation between land use changes and their impacts is essential for spatial planning at various spatial levels (global, national, regional and local levels). A cursory look at the sporadic growth of the Lagos metropolis reveals an unquestionable exert of pressure on the existing rural land, agricultural and forests resources. This paper examines Spatio-temporal trends in land use and land cover changes in the Lagos Metropolitan region, especially the loss of forest resources and agricultural land to urban development. Landsat images were used to produce land use classification maps for a period spanning sixteen years (1990 and 2006).

To address this gap in applied ecology and conservation, we developed a novel approach for quantifying human presence beyond populated areas by combining social media ""big data"" and remote sensing tools. We used data from the Flickr photo-sharing website as a surrogate for identifying spatial variation in visitation globally, and complemented this estimate with spatially explicit information on stable night lights between 2004 and 2012, used as a proxy for identifying urban and industrial centers. Natural and seminatural areas attracting visitors were defined as areas both highly photographed and non-lit.

To demonstrate the strength of this approach, this research explores the dynamics of LULC and conservation policies on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios, Peru. The main objectives of this research are to evaluate the efficacy of designated conservation lands in a rapidly expanding frontier landscape and to assess the effect on ecosystem conversion of granting conflicting land-use designations, such as mining concessions, inside conservation areas. Using statistical matching and a GIS-based analysis of LULC, this research shows that for the period 2006-2011, designated conservation lands on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios significantly reduced ecosystem losses compared to non-conservation lands, but the effect was highly variable across conservation designations. Also, when present, conflicting land-use authorizations inside conservation areas, specifically overlapping mining and agricultural titles, eliminated the policy additionality of designating lands for conservation. This finding demonstrates that authorizing conflicting land-use rights inside conservation areas should be avoided to ensure intended land conservation outcomes.

This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of 'values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27\% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake.

Intensification of agriculture, urban sprawl, and climate change are some of the changes which can lead to favorable conditions for the emergence of waterborne diseases. Earth observation (EO) images have several advantages for the characterization and monitoring of environmental determinants that could be associated with the risk of microbial contamination of recreational waters in vast territories like Canada. There are a large number of EO systems characterized by different spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolutions. Also, they have different levels of accessibility. In this study, we compared several EO systems for the estimation of environmental determinants to assess their usefulness and their added value in monitoring programs of recreational waters. Satellite images from EO systems WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, SPOT-5/HRG, Landsat-5/TM, Envisat/MERIS, Terra/MODIS, NOAA/AVHRR, and Radarsat-2 were acquired in 2010 and 2011 in southern Quebec, Canada. A supervised classification of these images with a maximum likelihood algorithm was used to estimate five key environmental determinants (agricultural land, impervious surfaces, water, forest, and wetlands) within the area of influence of 78 beaches. Logistic regression models were developed to establish the relationship between fecal contamination of beaches and environmental determinants derived from satellite images. The power prediction of these models and criteria such as accuracy of classified images, the ability of the sensor to detect environmental determinants in the area of influence of beaches, the correlation between the estimated environmental determinants in the area of influence by the sensor with those estimated by very high spatial resolution reference sensors (WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1), and general criteria of accessibility (cost of the images, imaging swath, satellite revisit interval, hours of work, and expertise and material required to process the images) were used to evaluate the EO systems. The logistic regression model establishing the relationship between environmental determinants from Landsat-5/TM images and the level of fecal contamination of beaches is the one which performs best. These images are also those that best meet all of the evaluation criteria. This study showed that environmental determinants like agricultural lands and impervious surfaces present in the area of influence of beaches are those which contribute the most to the microbial contamination of beaches.

We, therefore, examined how the recently emerged Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform and the traditional Sentinel-2 differs in indications of habitat condition using NDVI and GNDVI. We assigned 13 survey plots to random locations in the major land cover types: three survey plots in grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands, and two in riverine and mosaics cover types. We used a UAV-mounted, multi-spectral sensor and obtained Sentinel-2 imagery between February and March 2020. We categorized NDVI and GNDVI values into habitat condition classes (very good, good, poor, and very poor). We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and linear regression model in R-software. The results revealed higher sensitivity and ability of UAV to provide the necessary preliminary diagnostic indications of habitat condition. The UAV-based NDVI and GNDVI maps showed more details of all classes of habitat conditions than the Sentinel-2 maps.

Accurate map of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) is demanded to monitor the usage of plastic mulches and to mitigate its environmental damages. However, mapping PMF with remote sensing data over large scale is still technically challenging due to its variable spectral characteristic. This paper proposed a Random Forest (RF) workflow to map PMF by coupling multi-resource satellite observations, including high- and medium- resolution optical imageries and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries. Under the context of two typical PMF regions, Jizhou and Guyuan, China, we test the performance of the proposed method. Results indicated that coupling optical and SAR remote sensing data improved the mapping accuracy significantly. There were different strategies for optimal data coupling. Coupling of three data, which are the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) data, Landsat-8 data and Radarsat-2 data, generated the highest mapping accuracy. Besides, coupling the GF-1 data with SAR data produced better accuracy than coupling the Landsat-8 data with SAR data. Compared with the accuracies derived from the coupling of two data (such as coupling GF-1 data with Radarsat-2 data and coupling Landsat-8 data with Radarsat-2 data), coupling the three data improved the overall accuracies by 0.39 to 4.93%.

Historical Eco-Environmental Quality Mapping In China With Multi-Source Data Fusion,"{""Cao, L."",""Wu, S."",""Xu, D."",""Zhao, C.""}",NA,"Since the initiation of economic reforms and opening up, China has witnessed an unprecedented rate of development across all sectors. However, the country has also experienced severe ecological damage, surpassing that of many other nations. The rapid economic growth has come at the expense of the environment, revealing a significant lack of coordination between urbanization and eco-environmental protection in China. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and continuous historical dataset of China’s eco-environmental quality (EEQ) based on remote sensing, allowing for the analysis of spatial and temporal changes. Such data would provide objective, scientific, and reliable support for China’s eco-environmental protection and pollution prevention policies, while addressing potential ecological risks resulting from urbanization. To achieve this, the entropy value method is employed to integrate multi-source remote sensing data and construct an evaluation system for China’s EEQ. Historical data from 2000 to 2017 is plotted to illustrate China’s EEQ over time. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) The entropy method effectively facilitates the construction of China’s eco-environmental quality assessment system. (2) From 2000 to 2017, approximately 39.7% of China’s regions witnessed a decrease in EEQ, while 60.3% exhibited improvement, indicating an overall enhancement in EEQ over the past eighteen years.

This research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning. While conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present. Their disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, lack of robustness regarding the properties of input soil sample values and requirements for extensive cost-and time-expensive soil sampling were addressed. Specific conventional (ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighted) and modern machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, decision trees) were evaluated according to their popularity in relevant studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection over the past decade. As a shift towards increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, an overview of state-of-the-art remote sensing methods for improving precise fertilization was completed, with the accent on open-data and global satellite missions.

In mountainous landscapes, the regulation of services such as water quality or erosion control has been impacted by land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially the loss and fragmentation of forest patches. In this work, we develop a Remote Sensing (RS)-based modelling approach to identify areas for the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) (i.e., natural forest conservation and restoration) that allow reducing the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to siltation in mountainous regions. We used time series Landsat 5TM, 7ETM+, 8OLI and Sentinel 2A/2B MSI (S2) imagery to map forest dynamics and wetland distribution in Picos de Europa National Park (Cantabrian Mountains, northern Spain). We fed RS-based models with detailed in situ information based on photo-interpretation and fieldwork completed from 2017 to 2021. We estimated a forest cover increase rate of 2 ha/year comparing current and past LULC maps against external validation data. We applied this forest gain to a scenario generator model to derive a 30-year future LULC map that defines the potential forest extent for the study area in 2049. We then modelled the distribution of wetlands to identify the areas with the greatest potential for moisture accumulation. We used an S2 mosaic and topography-derived data such as the slope and topographic wetness index (TWI), which indicate terrain water accumulation. Overall accuracy scores reached values of 86\% for LULC classification and 61\% for wetland mapping. At the same time, we obtained the potential erosion using the NetMap software to identify potential sediment production, transport and deposition areas. Finally, forest dynamics, wetland distribution and potential erosion were combined in a multi-criteria analysis aiming to reduce the amount of sediment reaching selected wetlands. We achieved this by identifying the most suitable locations for the conservation and restoration of natural forests on slopes and in riparian areas, which may reduce the risk of soil erosion and maximise sediment filtering, respectively. The results show a network pattern for forest management that would allow for controlling erosion effects across space and time at three levels: one, by reducing the load that originates upslope in the absence of forest cover; two, by intersecting runoff at watercourses related to sediment transport; and three, by a lack of former barriers, by trapping erosion near to the receiving wetland systems, main river axes and contributing streams.

Multispectral imagery by the Landsat program has been an invaluable resource for forest type characterization for several decades. As an alternative to traditional classification approaches dominating these efforts, we instead employed an ordination-regression approach to mapping forest composition as floristic gradients across a ∼5000-km2 forestland in southeastern Ohio's Central Hardwoods. Plot data (n = 699 plots; 99 species/genera) from a comprehensive sample of both overstory and understory woody plants across structurally- (open to closed canopy) and topographically-variable forest conditions were projected onto a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination solution. Floristic gradients, via their ordination scores, were related to spectral reflectance provided by a multitemporal Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (OLI) image and various terrain variables using Random Forests models. Approximately 61%, 49%, and 25% of the floristic variation among the three axes of the NMDS ordination were related to the remotely-sensed variables during regression modeling. The axes were predicted onto three images and merged to a RGB color composite for the final floristic gradient map, displaying multivariate vegetation variation across the landscape in terms of variation in color. The color values, by referencing ordination space position within the original solution, provide a statistical approximation of the taxonomic composition of individual forest stands in relation to the plot data. We found this approach highly effective and an attractive alternative to traditional classifications. It is time-efficient, more realistic in that compositional turnover is expressed in continuous fields rather than arbitrary breaks, and less subjective, overcoming the generalization problem inherent in categorizing vegetation assemblages a priori.

To bridge this gap, this paper makes two contributions. First, the paper presents a new web application, the Global Flood Mapper (GFM) that allows the user to generate flood maps quickly and without getting into technical intricacies.

For this purpose, a set of remote sensing imagery, meteorological and climatic data recorded in synoptic stations, and soil temperatures measured by data loggers were used. For modeling and normalization of LST, a dual-source energy balance model (dual-EB), taking into account two fractions of vegetation and soil, and a triple-source energy balance model (triple-EB), taking into account three fractions of vegetation, soil and built-up land, were proposed with either regional or local optimization strategies. To evaluate and compare the accuracy of different modeling results, correlation coefficients and root mean square difference (RMSE) were computed between modeled LST and LST obtained from satellite imagery, as well as between modeled LST and soil temperature measured by data loggers. Further, the variance of normalized LST values was calculated and analyzed. The results suggested that the use of local optimization strategy increased the accuracy of the normalization of LST, compared to the regional optimization strategy. In addition, no matter the regional or local optimization strategy was employed, the triple-EB model out-performed consistently the dual-EB model for LST normalization. The results show the efficiency of the local triple-EB model to normalize LST relative to environmental parameters. The correlation coefficients were close to zero between all of the environmental parameters and the normalized LST. In other words, normalized LST was completely independent of the environmental parameters considered by this research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Wetland Landscape Spatio-Temporal Degradation Dynamics Using The New Google Earth Engine Cloud-Based Platform: Opportunities For Non-Specialists In Remote Sensing,"{""Alonso, A."",""Kennedy, R. E."",""Munoz-Carpena, R."",""Murcia, C.""}",NA,"The complex nature of coupled human-natural systems often hinders the identification of forces and mechanisms causing observed environmental changes. The analysis of long-term time series can allow better understanding of those interactions and hence inform more adapted restoration and management programs. However, long-term time series of ground-measured vegetation variables are often not readily available due to the tediousness of the work and the financial and time investment required, especially for large-scale wetland systems. Remote sensing can help overcome this issue by providing more than 40 years of Earth cover images, but until recently the processing and analysis of these images was restricted to experts in remote sensing. The new Google Earth Engine (GEE) opens the remote sensing information mine to engineers or scientists without advanced knowledge in the field, including easy access to petabytes of publicly available remote sensing data and their spatial analysis in the cloud. To illustrate its capabilities, we used GEE to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the human-impacted Tempisque watershed with its severely degraded downstream Palo Verde wetland in northwest Costa Rica. We detail the processing and analysis steps to facilitate replication to any other case study. After defining the boundary of a study area, any user can generate a list and a video of the Landsat and MODIS images available for the area, NDVI maps, and a time series of the NDVI values spatially aggregated over the study area or a set of previously delineated polygons. One of the challenges we address is discriminating between the multitude of image collections available in the GEE catalog for vegetation mapping. We evaluate and compare the results obtained from five selected Landsat and MODIS image collections and identify the collections that give the best quality results for our case study. We conclude that MODIS is more appropriate for this tropical region because of the higher temporal resolution and hence higher probability to record cloud-free images. NDVI time series from Landsat images demonstrate a significant number of missing values. Landsat maps of NDVI suggest that the entire watershed and protected wetland witnessed an overall increase in vegetation greenness and hence cover since 1986, matching the abandonment of cattle ranching and the known degradation of the wetland by cattail invasion. Within-season vegetation variability can be tracked using MODIS images despite their coarser spatial resolution, showing high variability linked to precipitation patterns in this region.

Satellite remote sensing offers a unique potential for mapping and monitoring fires at large spatial scales. Active fire information from satellites is one of the fundamental data in mitigating the smoke haze effect; therefore, active fire monitoring has become an essential tool for daily fires and smoke haze control, management, and mitigation in Thailand. The three critical sources of active fire hotspot information used in Thailand and elsewhere include (a) NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS); (b) the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), Active Fire Alert System; and (c) the Colorado School of Mines VIIRS NightFire Alert System. On their own, satellite-derived active fire information is insufficient, but the combination of satellite-derived data and traditional fire monitoring from ground-based methods can work well. Adding advanced geostationary fire detection is needed as a next step to enable fire suppression teams to reach fires as quickly as possible, resulting in much more efficient and safer fire control. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",tanpipat_activefiremonitoringthailand_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Development Of A Hydrological Telemetry System In Bago River,"{""Acierto, R. A."",""Kawasaki, A."",""Komori, D."",""Oo, A. T."",""Ra, K."",""Zin, W. W.""}",NA,"Hydrological monitoring is one of the key aspects in early warning systems that are vital to flood disaster management in flood-prone areas such as Bago River Basin in Myanmar. Thousands of people are affected due to the perennial flooding. Owing to the increasing pressure of rapid urbanization in the region and future climate change impacts, an early warning system in the basin is urgently required for disaster risk mitigation. This paper introduces the co-establishment of the telemetry system by a group of stakeholders. The co-establishment of the system through intensive consultations, proactive roles in responsibility sharing, and capacity building efforts, is essential in developing a base platform for flood forecasting and an early warning system in the basin. Herein, we identify the key challenges that have been central to the participatory approach in co-establishing the system. We also highlight opportunities as a result of the ongoing process and future impact on the disaster management system in the basin. We also highlight the potential for scientific contributions in understanding the local weather and hydrological characteristics through the establishment of the high-temporal resolution observation network. Using the observation at Zaung Tu Weir, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite estimates were assessed. Near real-time and standard versions of both satellite estimates show potential utility over the basin. Hourly aggregation shows slightly higher than 40% probability of detection (POD), on average, for both satellite estimates regardless of the production type. Thus, the hourly aggregation requires correction before usage. The results show useful skills at 60% POD for standard GSMaP (GSMAP-ST), 55% POD for near real-time GSMaP (GSMAP-NR), and 46% POD for GPM, at 3-hourly aggregations. Six-hourly aggregations show maximum benefit for providing useful skill and good correspondence to gauge the observation with GSMAP-ST showing the best true skill score (TSS) at 0.54 and an equitable threat score (ETS) at 0.37. While, both final run GPM and GSMAP-NR show lower POD, TSS, and ETS scores. Considering the latency of near real-time satellite estimates, the GSMAP-NR shows the best potential with a 4-hour latency period for monitoring and forecasting purposes in the basin. The result of the GSMAP-NR does not vary significantly from the GSMAP-ST and all GPM estimates.

The objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration, which were monitored by two different remote sensors: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A.

We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, near infrared) on UAV and LiDAR data compositions (intensity image, digital surface model, digital terrain model, normalized digital surface model). The monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes: Canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated. An expert system was developed in ArcGIS to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes, and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images. There was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers.

Diagnosing Irrigation Performance And Water Productivity Through Satellite Remote Sensing And Secondary Data In A Large Irrigation System Of Pakistan,"{""Ahmad, M.

In practice it is often difficult to access sufficient water supply and use data to determine crop water consumption and irrigation performance. Energy balance techniques using remote sensing data have been developed by various researchers over the last 20 years, and can be used as a tool to directly estimate actual evapotranspiration, i.e., water consumption. This study demonstrates how remote sensing-based estimates of water consumption and water stress combined with secondary agricultural production data can provide better estimates of irrigation performance, including water productivity, at a variety of scales than alternative options. A principle benefit of the described approach is that it allows identification of areas where agricultural performance is less than potential, thereby providing insights into where and how irrigation systems can be managed to improve overall performance and increase water productivity in a sustainable manner. To demonstrate the advantages, the approach was applied in Rechna Doab irrigation system of Pakistan's Punjab Province.

The Value Of Remotely Sensed Vs. Field-Surveyed Habitat Structure For Predicting Bird Abundance: A Case Study In Traditional Orchards,"{""Chaparro, Laura"",""Schmieder, Klaus"",""Schurr, Frank M.""}",NA,"Understanding environmental effects on the distribution and abundance of species is central to ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology. This led to the development of species distribution models (SDMs) that relate spatial variation in occurrence and abundance to environmental variables. So far, SDMs rarely considered habitat structure, as a major determinant of bird distributions. While remote sensing increasingly provides high-resolution measures of habitat structure, certain structural variables affecting bird abundance still need to be measured with field surveys. In this study, we compare the value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance. Specifically, we analysed abundance data for nine bird species of traditional orchards in South-Western Germany. 'Remote sensing SDMs' related abundance to structural variables obtained by aerial photogrammetry of individual orchard trees. Alternative 'field survey SDMs' related bird abundance to detailed field surveys of the species composition and pruning state of orchard trees. Additionally, both remote sensing and field survey SDMs included climate and land use variables. Accounting for detailed habitat structure improved abundance predictions for seven of nine study species compared to models only incorporating climate and land use. The impact on model performance differed between remotely sensed and field-surveyed variables: the former improved abundance models for most (n = 7) bird species, whereas the latter had more variable impact, decreasing model performance for five species. The remotely sensed variable with strongest effects was overall tree density, which positively affected abundance of seven species. In contrast, multiple field-surveyed variables had similar effect strength, with the overall strongest effect found for pear tree density, to which seven bird species showed a unimodal response. These analyses have conservation implications since they predict expected responses of bird species to ongoing changes in orchard structure. Moreover, they identify structural variables that will be most promising to measure via remote sensing data in the future.",chaparro_remotelysensedfieldsurveyed_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,"validates remote sensing as a way to predict bird abundance vs. field-survey data.  but, leaves ""conservation implications"" in purely conceptual terms.  ro and field survey data adds ""habitat structure"" info to climatic and land use variables."
Spectral Matching Based On Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization: A New Method For Terrestrial Water Body Extraction Using Multi-Temporal Landsat 8 Images,"{""Jia, Kai"",""Jiang, Weiguo"",""Li, Jing"",""Tang, Zhenghong""}",NA,"Terrestrial water, an important indicator of inland hydrological status, is sensitive to land use cover change, natural disaster and climate change. An accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface water distribution. In this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered. These parameters are sufficiently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for different conditions. By contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions. Eight test sites covering various water types in different climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficients (KC), commission error (CE) and omission error (OE). The results show that: (1) SMDPSO achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) SMDPSO has lower OE but higher CE than the supervised method, which means that SMDPSO is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) SMDPSO has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as DEM. In addition, a case of flooding in northeastern China is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of SMDPSO in water inundation mapping.

Dynamic Partitioning Of Tropical Indian Ocean Surface Waters Using Ocean Colour Data - Management And Modelling Applications,"{""Schwarz, Jill N.""}",NA,"Over the past few decades, partitioning of the surface ocean into ecologically-meaningful spatial domains has been approached using a range of data types, with the aim of improving our understanding of open ocean processes, supporting marine management decisions and constraining coupled ocean-biogeochemical models. The simplest partitioning method, which could provide low-latency information for managers at low cost, remains a purely optical classification based on ocean colour remote sensing. The question is whether such a simple approach has value. Here, the efficacy of optical classifications in constraining physical variables that modulate the epipelagic environment is tested for the tropical Indian Ocean, with a focus on the Chagos marine protected area (MPA). Using remote sensing data, it was found that optical classes corresponded to distinctive ranges of wind speed, wind stress curl, sea surface temperature, sea surface slope, sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic currents (Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Tukey honestly significantly different tests, alpha = 0.01). Between-class differences were significant for a set of sub-domains that resolved zonal and meridional gradients across the MPA and Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge, whereas between-domain differences were only significant for the north-south gradient (PERMANOVA, alpha = 0.01). A preliminary test of between-class differences in surface CO2 concentrations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 demonstrated a small decrease in mean pCO(2) with increasing chlorophyll (chl), from 418 to 398 ppm. Simple optical class maps therefore provide an overview of growth conditions, the spatial distribution of resources - from which habitat fragmentation metrics can be calculated, and carbon sequestration potential. Within the 17 year study period, biotic variables were found to have decreased at up to 0.025\%a(-1) for all optical classes, which is slower than reported elsewhere (Mann-Kendall-Sen regression, alpha = 0.01). Within the MPA, positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions and negative Southern Oscillation Indices were weakly associated with decreasing chl, fluorescence line height (FLH), eddy kinetic energy, easterly wind stress and wind stress curl, and with increasing FLH/chl, sea surface temperature, SSH gradients and northerly wind stress, consistent with reduced surface mixing and increased stratification.

Assessing The Role Of Climate And Resource Management On Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem Changes In Arid Environments With The Landsat Archive,"{""Allen, Richard"",""Carroll, Rosemary"",""Erickson, Tyler"",""Huntington, Justin"",""McGwire, Kenneth"",""Morton, Charles"",""Niswonger, Richard"",""Peterson, Sarah"",""Smith, Guy"",""Snyder, Keirith""}",NA,"Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites.

In this article, we review the state-of-the-art on flood monitoring in medium and large ungauged basins where satellite remote sensing can facilitate development of a cost-effective mechanism. We present our review in the context of the current hydro-political situation of flood monitoring in flood-prone developing nations situated in international river basins (IRBs).

Spatially explicit monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery through moderate resolution Landsat imagery is a popular technique but is filled with ambiguous information due to mixed pixel effects. On the other hand, very-high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery accurately measures crown size of tree saplings but has gained little attention and its utility for estimating leaf area index (LAI, m2/m2) and tree sapling abundance (TSA, seedlings/ha) in post-fire landscape remains untested. We compared the explanatory power of 30 m Landsat satellite imagery with 0.5-m WorldView-2 VHR imagery for LAI and TSA based on field sampling data, and subsequently mapped the distribution of LAI and TSA based on the most predictive relationships. A random forest (RF) model was applied to assess the relative importance and causal mechanisms of spatial controls on tree sapling recovery. The results showed that pixel percentage of canopy trees (PPCT) derived from VHR imagery outperform all Landsat-derived spectral indices for explaining variance of LAI (R2VHR = 0.676 vs. R2Landsat = 0.427) and TSA (R2VHR = 0.508 vs. R2Landsat = 0.499). The RF model explained an average of 55.5% (SD = 3.0%, MSE = 0.382, N = 50) of the variation of estimated LAI. Understory vegetation coverage (competition) and post-fire surviving mature trees (seed sources) were the most important spatial controls for LAI recovery, followed by burn severity (legacy effect), topographic factors (environmental filter) and nearest distance to unburned area (edge effect). These analyses allow us to conclude that in our study area, mitigating wildfire severity and size may increase forest resilience to wildfire damage.

In particular, forests have been identified as a significant carbon sink that can mitigate the rate of global climate change. Policy makers are faced with complex and difficult challenges in getting timely and useful information in monitoring global forest resources. Recent advances in the tools and methods of forest carbon accounting have produced new, innovative approaches to forest-based carbon inventories. But it is important as new tools are developed that scientists understand the needs of policy makers and that policy makers understand the capabilities and limitations of forest inventory methods. This paper explores four different policy applications that rely, or could benefit from, national carbon inventories. The goal is to help build a bridge between the communities of climate policy makers and scientists specialized in forest carbon inventories. To this end, we pursue three specific objectives: First we provide an overview for policy makers about approaches to forest carbon inventories, paying particular attention to the contributions of remote sensing technologies. Second, we outline the issues particularly relevant to forest inventory scientists who are interested in responding to public policy needs. We then discuss the tradeoffs between information cost, accuracy, precision, transparency and timeliness that need to be balanced in long-term monitoring of forest carbon. Finally, the article concludes with a series of observations and recommendations for the implementation of forest carbon inventories as increasingly central components of global climate change policy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",andersson_nationalforestcarboninventories_2009,FALSE,sample_1000,"focuses on forest carbon inventories to link policy and scientific communities.  ro is an important component, but not the main focus of the paper; additionally, the societal benefits (other than presumably carbon sequestration) are not a major focus"

Understanding The Spatio-Temporal Behaviour Of The Sunflower Crop For Subfield Areas Delineation Using Sentinel-2 Ndvi Time-Series Images In An Organic Farming System,"{""Marino, Stefano""}",NA,"The study investigates the suitability of time series Sentinel-2 NDVI-derived maps for the subfield detection of a sunflower crop cultivated in an organic farming system. The aim was to understand the spatio-temporal behaviour of subfield areas identified by the K-means algorithm from NDVI maps obtained from satellite images and the ground yield data variability to increase the efficiency of delimiting management zones in an organic farming system. Experiments were conducted on a surface of 29 ha. NDVI time series derived from Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithm for rapidly delineating the sunflower subfield areas were used. The crop achene yields in the whole field ranged from 1.3 to 3.77 t ha-1 with a significant within-field spatial variability. The cluster analysis of hand-sampled data showed three subfields with achene yield mean values of 3.54 t ha-1 (cluster 1), 2.98 t ha-1 (cluster 2), and 2.07 t ha-1 (Cluster 3). In the cluster analysis of NDVI data, the k-means algorithm has early delineated the subfield crop spatial and temporal yield variability. The best period for identifying subfield areas starts from the inflorescences development stage to the development of the fruit stage. Analyzing the NDVI subfield areas and yield data, it was found that cluster 1 covers an area of 42.4\% of the total surface and 50\% of the total achene yield; cluster 2 covers 35\% of both surface and yield. Instead, the surface of cluster 3 covers 22.2\% of the total surface with 15\% of achene yield. K-means algorithm derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI images delineates the sunflower subfield areas.

In this study, data from satellite and acoustic technologies were used to: determine the efficacy of satellite and acoustic telemetry to define dugong movement patterns; compare the benefits and limitations of each approach; examine the costs of each approach in relation to the amount and type of data provided; and relate telemetry data to the boundaries of a Go Slow area designed to protect dugongs and turtles from vessel strike within an urbanised coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). Twenty-one dugongs were captured in seagrass habitats on the Eastern Banks of Moreton Bay in July-September 2012 and July 2013 and fitted with GPS and acoustic transmitters. Both satellite and acoustic telemetry produced reliable presence and movement data for individual dugongs. When the dugongs were within the range of the acoustic array, there was relatively good correspondence between the overall space use measures derived from GPS and acoustic transmitters, demonstrating that acoustic tracking is a potentially valuable and cost-effective tool for monitoring local dugong habitat use in environments equipped with acoustic receiver arrays. Acoustic technology may be particularly useful for species that establish home ranges with stable residency especially near large urban or port environs.

The Role Of Remote Sensing In The Development Of Smart Indicators For Ecosystem Services Assessment,"{""Brown, C."",""Cutler, M. E. J."",""Dawson, T.

However, rapid natural habitat loss, overexploitation and climate change is causing accelerating losses of populations and species, with largely unknown consequences on ecosystem functioning and the sustainable provision of ecosystem services. It is crucial, therefore, to develop a suite of indicators of the health and status of ecosystems, to monitor and quantify services delivery and to facilitate policy responses to stop and reverse negative trends. An effective framework to facilitate the development of suitable indicators is by using the SMART approach, which defines five criteria that could be applied to set monitoring and management goals, which are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-sensitive. Remote sensing provides a useful data source that can monitor ecosystems over multiple spatial and temporal scales.

Using land-surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, along with surface reflectance data describing albedo and vegetation cover fraction, surface energy balance models can generate ET maps down to a 30 m spatial resolution. However, the temporal sampling by such maps can be limited by the relatively infrequent revisit period of Landsat data (8 days for combined Landsats 7 and 8), especially in cloudy areas experiencing rapid changes in moisture status. The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, as a good complement to the Landsat system, provide surface reflectance data at 10-20 m spatial resolution and 5 day revisit period but do not have a thermal sensor. On the other hand, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) provides TIR data on a near-daily basis with 375 m resolution, which can be refined through thermal sharpening using S2 reflectances. This study assesses the utility of augmenting the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset with S2-sharpened VIIRS as a thermal proxy source on S2 overpass days, enabling 30 m ET mapping at a potential combined frequency of 2-3 days (including Landsat). The value added by including VIIRS-S2 is assessed both retrospectively and operationally in comparison with flux tower observations collected from several U.S. agricultural sites covering a range of crop types. In particular, we evaluate the performance of VIIRS-S2 ET estimates as a function of VIIRS view angle and cloud masking approach. VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals (MAE of 0.49 mm d(-1) against observations) generally show comparable accuracy to Landsat ET (0.45 mm d(-1)) on days of commensurate overpass, but with decreasing performance at large VIIRS view angles. Low-quality VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals linked to imperfect VIIRS/S2 cloud masking are also discussed, and caution is required when applying such data for generating ET timeseries.

To monitor spatial and temporal dynamic forest stress conditions, timely, accurate, and cost-effective information is needed that could be provided by remote sensing. Recently, satellite imagery has become available via the RapidEye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in five broad bands, including the red-edge region (690-730. nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We tested the hypothesis that broadband, red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll a. +. b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, blue, and near infrared band reflectance spectra. We analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 RapidEye scenes of a piñon-juniper woodland in central New Mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by girdling.

Possibility Investigation Of Tree Diversity Mapping Using Landsat Etm+ Data In The Hyrcanian Forests Of Iran,"{""Mohammadi, J."",""Shataee, S.""}",NA,"Lack of data often limits understanding and management of biodiversity in forested areas. Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DVI, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2, ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R2 = 0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran.

This study investigated a new solution for urban air-quality monitoring in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. We developed an observation-based method by combining satellite remote-sensing techniques and a newly established low-cost sensor network to estimate long-term PM2.5 concentrations over Krasnoyarsk, a highly industrialized Siberian city. First, a physical model was developed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using satellite remote-sensing with the aid of ground-based meteorological and radiosonde observations. Observations from the ground-based sensor network were then used to calibrate the deviations in the satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations. The results show that the satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations obtained by our physical model were in good agreement with the sensor observations (R = 0.78 on the monthly scale). The deviation in satellite-derived annual PM2.5 concentrations resulted from data restrictions that occurred at noon and data loss in winter were identified as 20% and 30%, respectively. The regional transport of smoke from forest wildfires increased PM2.5 concentration to 150 μg/m3 in the summer 2018. The average PM2.5 concentrations in the urban districts could reach 35 μg/m3, which far exceeded the World Health Organization air quality guideline. These results underscore the good ability of our new method to determine PM2.5 concentrations in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. Use of sensor and meteorological observations greatly improved satellite detection of PM2.5 concentration. In addition, our method has the potential for global application to improve determination of PM2.5 concentrations, especially in sparsely monitored regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",lin_observationpm2.5combinationsatellite_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The future Earth Observation Systems (EOS) will have to take into consideration the aspects relate to the globalisation and standardisation of programmes world-over; data continuity and the need to monitor processes rather than events. Technological changes are also going to re-define many of the concepts of observation from space and issues like spatial resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution may no more be a concern for observation systems.

Drone-imagery methods can observe larger extents to estimate indicators at landscape scales with higher confidence than traditional field sampling. They also have the potential to replace field methods in some instances and enable the development of indicators not measurable from the ground. Much research has already demonstrated that several quantitative rangeland indicators can be estimated from high-resolution imagery. Developing a suite of monitoring methods that are useful for supporting management decisions (e.g., repeatable, cost-effective, and validated against field methods) will require additional exploration to develop best practices for image acquisition and analytical workflows that can efficiently estimate multiple indicators. We embedded with a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field monitoring crew in Northern California, USA to compare field-measured and imagery-derived indicator values and to evaluate the logistics of using small UAS within the framework of an existing monitoring program. The unified workflow we developed to measure fractional cover, canopy gaps, and vegetation height was specific for the sagebrush steppe, an ecosystem that is common in other BLM managed lands. The correspondence between imagery and field methods yielded encouraging agreement while revealing systematic differences between the methods. Workflow best practices for producing repeatable rangeland indicators is likely to vary by vegetation composition and phenology. An online space dedicated to sharing imagery-based workflows could spur collaboration among researchers and quicken the pace of integrating drone-imagery data within adaptive management of rangelands.

Accurate spatial and temporal resolved information of field-scale crop residue cover, which reflects tillage intensity, is highly valuable for evaluating the outcomes of government conservation programs and voluntary ecosystem service markets, as well as facilitating agroecosystem modeling to quantify cropland biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing has the potential to cost-effectively detect crop residue cover, however, existing regional-scale studies were limited by insufficient ground truth data, scale mismatch between coarse satellite pixels and ground data, and the lack of key spectral data for detecting crop residues. Therefore, this study developed an innovative cross-sensing framework to integrate proximal sensing, airborne hyperspectral imaging, and satellite Earth Observation through deep learning to quantify field-level crop residue cover fractions at the regional scale. Specifically, we have collected intensive ground orthographic photos and conducted airborne hyperspectral surveys at corn and soybean fields of Champaign and nearby counties in Illinois, the heartland of the U.S. Corn Belt. Through semi-automatic labeling aided by ResNet-50 and superpixel image segmentation, we obtained 6719 records of ground residue fractions. With these ground data, we developed the 1-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) model using airborne hyperspectral reflectance, which has 0.5 m spatial resolution and 3–5 nm spectral resolution from 400 to 2400 nm, to predict residue fractions. By applying the CNN model to airborne pixels, we augmented “ground truth” data of crop residues and further combined them with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) satellite data to quantify regional residue fractions at 30 m resolution. Results show that airborne hyperspectral imagery with CNN can accurately detect residue fractions (R2 = 0.82, relative RMSE = 11.73%) to effectively generate quasi “ground truth” data to support satellite upscaling to all fields. With independent ground data for testing, we found that the ground-airborne-satellite integrative framework achieved better predictions in estimating crop residue cover (R2 = 0.67, relative RMSE = 17.53%) than the conventional ground-satellite upscaling (R2 = 0.22, relative RMSE = 32.09%). We also found that the shortwave infrared wavelengths, particularly 2100–2300 nm, are vital for predicting crop residue cover. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data have a comparable capability to track residue fractions due to similar shortwave infrared wavelengths. This study highlights the high accuracy of hyperspectral imaging to detect agroecosystem tillage management practices and the advantages of cross-scale sensing to cost-effectively integrate multi-source data to quantify field-level agroecosystem variables across scales. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",wang_crossscalesensingfield_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Satellite Sensors And Retrieval Algorithms Of Atmospheric Methane,"{""Fan Cheng"",""Gu Haoran"",""Han Yinghui"",""He Zhuo"",""Li Zhengqiang"",""Ma Jinji"",""Qin Kai"",""Shi Zheng"",""Xu Wenbin"",""Zhang Hao"",""Zhang Ying"",""Zhang Yuanxun"",""Zheng Yang"",""Zhu Jun"",""Zuo Jinhui""}",NA,"Significance Global climate governance and greenhouse gas emission reduction are of great urgency. The volume fraction of atmospheric methane (CH4) has been rising continuously since the industrial revolution and is now averaging about 1895.7x10(-9) globally. In addition, since the global warming potential of CH4 is about 27-30 times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), the monitoring of atmospheric CH4 becomes the focus and hotspot of carbon emission reduction. Satellite remote sensing features fast detection speed, wide coverage, and rich information. It can conduct continuous and stable observations of atmospheric CH4 with high temporal and spatial resolution and high precision on a global scale and can provide verification and support for the ""bottom-up"" emission inventory. Relying on the rapid development of satellite detection technology and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a large number of satellites with CH4 detection capabilities have emerged in the past two decades. The detection technology has become more mature with increasingly higher detection accuracy. Additionally, corresponding algorithms of various satellite sensors have also made a huge leap forward. Rapid advances in both sensors and algorithms enable us to better monitor the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric CH4 and its impact on climate change. With the purpose to promote the further development of CH4 satellite remote sensing and retrieval research and realize the dual carbon target, it is necessary to summarize and discuss the existing research progress and future development trends, which can provide scientific and technological support for China's low-carbon sustainable development. Progress Firstly, the development of atmospheric CH4 satellites and sensors is reviewed and introduced. Early sensors mainly rely on the thermal infrared band of about 8 mu m for CH4 detection, and typical representatives include IMG, AIRS, and IASI (Table 1). Subsequently, a series of passive short-wave infrared sensors represented by SCIAMACHY, TANSO-FTS, and TROPOMI are developed. They rely on CH4 characteristic bands near 1.6 mu m and 2.3 mu m for detection and are more sensitive to changes in near-surface CH4 concentration. Among them, the high-resolution imaging spectral sensors and platforms represented by GHGSat, AHSI, and MethaneSAT also take advantage of their high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution to monitor the CH4 point source emissions. There is no doubt that new energy is injected into the development of CH4 satellite remote sensing (Table 2). In recent years, active detection represented by the methane remote sensing lidar mission (MERLIN) has also developed rapidly, effectively making up for the shortcomings of passive remote sensing detection with improved detection efficiency. Subsequently, the principles, application conditions, and retrieval accuracy of different sensor algorithms are summarized. From the early DOAS algorithm, proxy algorithm, and PPDF algorithm, to the most commonly employed full-physical algorithm with the highest precision at this stage, the physical algorithms have been continuously improved with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. The full-physical algorithms represented by NIES-FP, UoL-FP, RemoTeC, RemoTAP, IAPCAS, and FOCAL have an accuracy of 6x10(-9). At the same time, with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence, various new algorithms, such as neural network algorithms, are also emerging, which can almost complete the real-time retrieval of CH4. These methods have also brought breakthroughs to CH4 retrieval. Conclusions and Prospects In the future, CH4 detection satellite sensors will continue to develop toward the goal of high temporal and spatial resolution, high precision, high accuracy, and continuous observation. Many high- performance satellites such as MethaneSAT, Sentinel-5, and CO2M are under planning (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the construction of the satellite network should be stepped up to meet the demands of CH4 global high-precision detection. Correspondingly, new requirements are put forward for the accuracy, coverage, and calculation speed of CH4 observation data and retrieval products. For the most accurate full- physical algorithm at present, the adoption of more accurate forward radiative transfer models and prior information, collaborative retrieval and correction of clouds and aerosols, and multi-satellite joint retrieval and verification are all important means for algorithm improvement. With the accelerated global climate governance and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, more and more countries have formulated and implemented a series of CH4 emission reduction measures, and China has also proposed the dual carbon target, which is steadily advancing. However, the issues of climate governance and carbon emissions are very complex, and to some extent have even become the focus of competition among countries. In this context, the development of China's atmospheric CH4 satellite remote sensing cannot be slackened and should be highly valued and vigorously developed to seize opportunities. China has deployed the launch of the next-generation carbon satellite task, which will implement the main passive observation, and significantly broaden the range of detection time and space. Finally, the spatial and temporal resolution is improved to promote an effective amount of data and realize the full range of high-precision detection, thus providing a solid foundation and strong support for realizing a dual carbon target.",hezhuoandlizhengqiangandfanchengandzhangyingandshizhengandzhengyangandguhaoranandmajinjiandzuojinhuiandhanyinghuiandzhangyuanxunandqinkaiandzhanghaoandxuwenbinandzhujun_satellitesensorsretrievalalgorithms_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,how did chatgpt do a summary then??? look at full text extracted

Automatic Parameter Optimization For Support Vector Regression For Land And Sea Surface Temperature Estimation From Remote Sensing Data,"{""Moser, Gabriele"",""Serpico, Sebastiano B.""}",NA,"Land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) are important quantities For many, environmental models. Remote sensing is a source of information for their estimation on both regional and global scales. Many algorithms have been devised to estimate LST and SST from satellite data, most of which require a priori information about the surface and the atmosphere. A recently proposed approach involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Based on satellite data and corresponding in situ measurements, they generate an approximation of the relation between them, which can subsequently he used to estimate unknown surface temperatures from additional satellite data. Such a strategy requires the user to set several internal parameters. In this paper, a method is proposed for automatically setting these parameters to quasi-optimal values in the sense of minimum estimation errors. This is achieved by minimizing a functional correlated to regression errors (i.e., the ""span-bound"" upper bound on the leave-one-out (1,00) error) which can be computed by using only the training set, without need for a further validation set. In order to minimize this functional, Powell's algorithm is adopted, since it is applicable also to nondifferentiable functions. Experimental results yielded by the proposed method are similar in accuracy to those achieved by cross-validation and by a grid search for the parameter configuration which yields the best test-set accuracy.

B.""}",NA,"Nicaragua, home to the largest remaining extent of rainforest in Central America (total surface area) and to a significant indigenous population, has lost approximately half of its forest cover since 1950. This major and rapid loss of forest cover has been explained as the consequence of an eastward moving agricultural frontier that cuts through the region of Jinotega. If the current deforestation rate continues, the country could lose its remaining forest cover over the course of the next two decades; therefore, it is essential that the dynamics and relationships of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) in this region are understood. To examine LUCC in Nicaragua over time, Landsat imagery from the southern portion of the region of Jinotega, taken in 1978, 1987, and 1999 was utilized. A remote-sensing method, supervised classification, which allows for the grouping of spectrally similar values for each year, followed by an image change detection analysis (postclassification comparison) was conducted. Groundtruthing (field validation) was conducted in 2006 to validate the data, which yielded increasing overall accuracy rates of 71.68% for 1978, 82.35% for 1987, and 84.38% for 1999. The classification and change detection results showed that if the agricultural cultivation overtook this region, it happened before 1978. Therefore, the possibility that either deforestation did not actually occur along an agricultural frontier or that it was located further east exists; this would be an interesting subject for future studies.

Six N rates from 34 to 270 kg ha(-1), and different timing of N application were used in a 3-year field experiment to contrast SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter and QuickBird satellite imagery data against the conventional petiole sampling technique for assessing canopy N status. Overall treatment variations in SPAD readings were consistent with those in petiole nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations. However, the ability of the SPAD meter to detect treatment differences varied with growth stage and growing season. Severe N deficiency was detected about I month after emergence with SPAD readings, but as early as 2 weeks after emergence with petiole NO3-N concentrations. Petiole NO3-N concentrations tended to differentiate more treatment variations than SPAD readings at all growth stages except at hilling. N deficiency was detected with QuickBird image-derived vegetation indices (VIs) at the hilling stage in 2002, but not in 2003. At the post-hilling stage, treatment differences in VI values were minimal and insignificant except very late in the growing season. SPAD meters could be used as an indirect method for detecting N deficiency at the hilling stage when making supplemental N applications, but they are not as sensitive as the petiole sampling method. The sensitivity of QuickBird imagery to canopy N variations needs to be further tested with more pixel data. However, cloud interference and high cost of images could limit the use of QuickBird data in making timely management decisions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Observed changes in vegetation structure and composition did not persist after the second year.

Above 28 degrees N, the coastline of the northern Gulf of California is indented Lit frequent intervals by negative or inverse estuaries that are saltier at their backs than at their Mouths due to the lack of freshwater inflow. These 'esteros' total over 215000 ha in area and encompass mangrove marshes below 29 degrees N and saltgrass (Distichlis palmeri) marshes north of 29 degrees N. An additional 6000 ha of freshwater and brackish wetlands are found in the Colorado River delta where fresh water enters the interticial zone. 2. The mangrove marshes in the Gulf of California have been afforded some degree of protected status in Mexico, but the northern saltgrass esteros do not have priority conservation status and are increasingly becoming development targets for resorts, vacation homes and aquaculture sites. 3. We conducted an inventory of the marshes using aerial photography and satellite images, and evaluated the extent and type of development on each marsh. We reviewed the available literature on the marshes to document their vegetation types, and ecological functions in the adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems. 4. Over 95\% of the mangrove marshes have been developed for shrimp fanning. However, the farms are built adjacent to, rather than in, the marshes, and the mangrove stands are still mostly intact. 5. The majority of saltgrass marshes above the mangrove line are still relatively unspoiled. However, resort and Vacation home development is taking place on land Surrounding them. 6. We recommend a system of protected reserves incorporating the pristine wetlands, along with water quality management and buffer zones For the more developed esteros. The saltgrass marshes should be considered for conservation protection, similar to the protection given to the Southern mangrove marshes whose Value has already been recognized.

Due to rapid socio-economic and environmental changes, the role of biodiversity and ecosystems for human health ought to be examined and communicated to decision-makers and the public. We therefore summarized the lessons and recommendations from an interdisciplinary conference convened in Cambodia in 2014 to advise Southeast Asian societies on current research efforts, future research needs, and to provide suggestions for improved education, training and science-policy interactions. First, we reviewed several examples of the important role of ecosystems as 'sentinels' in the sense that potentially harmful developments for human health become first apparent in ecosystem components. Other ecosystem services which also benefit human well-being are briefly summarized. Second, we summarized the recommendations of the conference's roundtable discussions and added recent developments in the science-policy interface. The recommendations were organized along five themes: Ethical and legal considerations; implementation of the One Health approach; education, training, and capacity building; future research priorities; and potential science-policy interactions. While the role of biodiversity for human health needs further research, especially for zoonoses and emerging diseases, many direct and indirect benefits to human health are already apparent, but have yet to filter down to the science-policy interface in order to influence legislation and enforcement. Therefore, efforts to strengthen the interface in Southeast Asia should become a high priority in order to strengthen the health and resilience of Southeast Asian societies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",walther_biodiversityhealthlessonsrecommendations_2016,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Research On Anti-Shadow Tree Detection Method Based On Generative Adversarial Network,"{""Shen, B."",""Shen, Y."",""Ye, Y.""}",NA,"High-scoring remote sensing imaging has widely been applied in most management of agriculture and forestry, especially to monitor and evaluate crops and forest resources on a large scale. Nevertheless, there is a great challenge to the accuracy of single tree identification and detection during the image acquisition, due mainly to the fact that the shadow area is inevitably formed by the light. The shadow areas in the remote sensing images can be assumed as a kind of noise in the image sampling. As such, the degradation of high-resolution parameters can cause image distortion after post-processing. In this study, an anti-shadow tree detection method was proposed to detect the single tree with shadow interference using a generative adversarial network (GA-Faster RCNN). This framework consisted of a Faster RCNN network and a tree generator. The Faster RCNN network was mainly used for the tasks of feature extraction and detection. The tree generator was utilized to process the shadows in tree detection. The adversarial generation strategy was adopted by the tree generator to learn generating the minimum feature information characterizing trees. The generator was first trained separately and then put into the Faster RCNN network to finally lock its parameters. Two parts were then trained end-to-end to further improve the tree recognition ability of the network. The GA-Faster RCNN was also compared with 3 state-of-the-art methods, including region-growing, progressive cascaded convolutional neural network, and Faster RCNN on three test areas with shadows. Test area 1 presented a lot of shadows of trees, where the canopy density of trees was very high. Test area 2 showed fewer tree shadows and lower canopy closure, compared with test area 1. The shades of trees and the canopy density of trees in test area 3 were between those in test area 1 and 2. Results demonstrated that the GA-Faster RCNN achieved the highest harmonic average of precision and recall (F1) on the test area 1, 2, and 3, which were 78.4%, 91.6%, and 81.7%, respectively. The average F1 of three test areas was 84.7% for the GA-Faster RCNN, 6.2 percentage point higher than that of Faster RCNN. The user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) of GA-Faster RCNN were also the highest among four methods, where UA was 79.8%, 95.0%, 85.3%, and PA was 77.0%, 88.5%, and 78.4% on test area 1, 2, 3, respectively. Moreover, a significance analysis, McNemar, was performed to eliminate the interference of experimental errors and other factors. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference between the three comparison methods and GA-Faster RCNN. The shadow misrecognition rate SR (proportion of the count of shadows misrecognized as trees to the count of total recognized trees) of GA-Faster RCNN was compared with that of Faster RCNN on test area 1, in order to clarify the effect of the mask on tree identification. Although the SR of GA-Faster RCNN was 13.8%, higher than that of Faster RCNN (8.6%), the UA and the number of missed tree identification were both better than those of Faster RCNN. Therefore, the GA-Faster RCNN behaved significant advantages over the other identification. In addition, the GA-Faster RCNN can still maintain the detection stability, when using different feature extraction networks, including ResNet101, ResNet50, and DenseNet. Consequently, the adversarial generative training strategy is highly suitable for learning the minimum feature information characterizing trees, while effectively reducing the interference of shadows, indicating the promising practical value for higher accuracy of tree detection. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Evaluating The Eco-Environment Benefit Of Land Reclamation In The Dump Of An Opencast Coal Mine,"{""Wang, Jing"",""Wang, Qiubing"",""Wei, Zhongyi""}",NA,"Land reclamation significantly affects the ecological and environmental conditions of mining areas. However, quantifying the exact effects is difficult because of the lack of reliable data. The estimation of eco-environment benefit contributes to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by land reclamation and to provide useful information for policy-makers concerned with sustainable development. The aim of this study is to investigate variations in eco-environment benefit in response to land use changes during land reclamation. The West dump, one of the earliest regions to implement ecological restoration in Liaoning Province, is selected as the study area. The widely used methods for eco-environment benefits based on the land use change were proposed and applied to the West dump in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The total eco-environment benefits in study areas were 0.98 million dollars in 2004, 1.39 million dollars in 2009, and 1.43 million dollars in 2014, with an increase of 0.41 million dollars from 2004 to 2009 mainly because of the increasing areas of artificial woodland and reclaimed cropland. The combined eco-environment benefits of artificial woodland, improved grassland, and reclaimed cropland were over 90\% of the total benefits. Soil formation and protection, biodiversity protection, and gas regulation were the top three functions with high eco-environment benefits, contributing about half of the total eco-environment benefits. The results suggest that future studies estimating eco-environment benefits should pay more attention to ecosystems in fragile ecological regions where various human interferences happen frequently. All of the abovementioned results made the techniques of estimation of the eco-environment benefit of land reclamation are more meaningful in guiding the future exploitation and reclamation of mining areas.",wang_evaluatingecoenvironmentbenefit_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Contribution Of Remote Sensing To Wildfire Trend And Dynamic Analysis In Two Of Ghana's Ecological Zones: Guinea-Savanna And Forest-Savanna Mosaic,"{""Dahan, K. S."",""Husseini, R."",""Kasei, R. A.""}",NA,"Background: Two of Ghana’s ecological zones—Guinea-savanna zone (GSZ) and Forest-savanna mosaic zone (FSZ)—are practically homologous in terms of structure and floristic composition, with some differences. The various sub-ecosystems that make up these areas are being depleted and losing their natural values due to various threats. There is little understanding about the fire trends in these areas due to a lack of data and poor accessibility to existing fire statistics. This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the trends of area burned and active fire in the Guinea-savanna and Forest-savanna mosaic zones in order to inform policy-makers about sustainable management options. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire (MDC14ML) and burned-area (MCD64A1) products to characterize the fire regime in terms of seasonality, intensity, density, burned area, frequency, and trends during the study period of 2001 to 2021. Results: This study indicated that fire activity started in October and peaked in December (GSZ) and January (FSZ). The mean proportion burned was approximately 39.95% (burned area of 2659.31 km2; FSZ) and 60.05% (burned area of 3996.63 km2: GSZ), while the frequency was approximately 42.87% (1759.95 of active fires; FSZ) and 57.13% (2345.26 of active fires: GSZ). In 2018, GSZ recorded the largest burned area (19 811.2 km2, which represents an average of 825.5 km2 of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 4719 active points detected. FSZ recorded its greatest burned area in 2015 (8727.4 km2; which represents an average of 363.6 km2 of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 5587 active points recorded. In addition, it was found that specific times of the day (1000 h to 1420 h) recorded the majority of burned areas. In overview, between 2001 and 2021, burned areas increased by an average of 1.4 km2 (FSZ) and 4.6 km2 (GSZ), and the number of active fires increased by an average of 4.7 (FSZ) and 4.4 (GSZ) active fires per km2. Conclusions: In conclusion, burned areas and active fires are increasing in both ecological zones. This study demonstrated the relevance of remote sensing to describe spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence in Ghana and highlighted the need for fire control and fuel management by the policies and institutions (e.g., Ghana National Fire and Rescue Service) in these important and vulnerable zones (GSZ and FSZ). This is especially true in the Forest-savanna mosaic zone, which is increasingly affected by the disasters of wildfires and records more active fires than GSZ, indicating that this zone is becoming more and more vulnerable. Therefore, rigorous continuous monitoring is essential, and collaboration between organizations fighting for the conservation of natural resources in the field is strongly recommended. © 2023, The Author(s).",dahan_contributionremotesensingwildfire_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The monitoring and mapping of winter wheat in an efficient and accurate manner is of great significance for effective policy management on both agriculture and water resources in the North China Plain. Remote sensing technology has been proved to be a practical and feasible method for agricultural crop area extraction in previous researches. In this study, a multi-source remote sensing monitoring system was built, in order to quickly and accurately extract the spatial and temporal information of winter wheat in the North China Plain. Specifically, a spectral curve library for winter wheat was constructed, using MODIS EVI time-series data and two TM images in 2011; and the uniform rules were formulated for the identification of winter wheat, with the combination of phenology calendar in each province in the North China Plain. The spatial and temporal changes of areas planting with winter wheat in 2001-2011 in the North China Plain were extracted using the above uniform rules, and its patterns were analyzed at the grid level, the county level and the province level, respectively.

Landscape And Local Site Variables Differentially Influence Pollinators And Pollination Services In Urban Agricultural Sites,"{""Bennett, Ashley B."",""Lovell, Sarah""}",NA,"Urbanization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as agricultural and semi-natural habitats are converted into landscapes dominated by built features. Urban agricultural sites are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for smaller bee species. Local site design coupled with regional urban planning can advance the success of urban agriculture, while benefiting biodiversity by creating opportunities for pollinator conservation in urban landscapes.",bennett_landscapelocalsitevariables_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Development Of Methodology To Prioritise Wildlife Pathogens For Surveillance,"{""Langstaff, I."",""McKenzie, J."",""Simpson, H.""}",NA,"We developed and evaluated a methodology to prioritise pathogens for a wildlife disease surveillance strategy in New Zealand. The methodology, termed 'rapid risk analysis' was based on the import risk analysis framework recommended by the Office Internationale des Epizooties (OIE), and involved: hazard identification, risk estimation, and ranking of 48 exotic and 34 endemic wildlife pathogens. The risk assessment was more rapid than a full quantitative assessment through the use of a semi-quantitative approach to score pathogens for probability of entry to NZ (release assessment), likelihood of spread (exposure assessment) and consequences in free-living wildlife, captive wildlife, humans, livestock and companion animals. Risk was estimated by multiplying the scores for the probability of entry to New Zealand by the likelihood of spread by the consequences for free-living wildlife, humans and livestock. The rapid risk analysis methodology produced scores that were sufficiently differentiated between pathogens to be useful for ranking them on the basis of risk. Ranking pathogens on the basis of the risk estimate for each population sector provided an opportunity to identify the priorities within each sector alone thus avoiding value-laden comparisons between sectors. Ranking pathogens across all three population sectors by summing the risk estimate for each sector provided a comparison of total risk which may be useful for resource allocation decisions at national level. Ranking pathogens within each wildlife taxonomic group using the total risk estimate was most useful for developing specific surveillance strategies for each group. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Topographic, management, soil and landuse factors were among the most important drivers influencing the soil erosion. Keeping above in account, present study emphasizes the applicability of geospatial technology coupled with field data to estimate soil erosion rate which could be helpful in developing suitable management plan. Numerous empirical models are available for estimating soil erosion; however, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system framework was applied in the current study due to its robustness and simplicity. RUSLE factors such as erosivity of rainfall (RE), erodibility of soil (ES), slope length (LS), crop management (CM) and conservation practice (CP) were calculated using available data. Rainfall erosivity factor was 323.8 MJ mm/ha/h/year. ES factor ranged from 0.16 to 0.28 Mg h/MJ/mm and LS factor ranges between 0 and 44.62. NDVI derived crop management factor ranges between 0 and 1.7. Conservation practice factor values ranged from 0.004 to 1.

Performance Of Fire Danger Indices And Their Utility In Predicting Future Wildfire Danger Over The Conterminous United States,"{""Feng, Yan"",""Wang, Jiali"",""Wright, Daniel B."",""Yu, Guo""}",NA,"Predicting current and future wildfire frequency and size is central to wildfire control and management. Multiple fire danger indices (FDIs) that incorporate weather and fuel conditions have been developed and utilized to support wildfire predictions and risk assessment. However, the scale-dependent performance of individual FDIs remains poorly understood, which leads to large uncertainty in the estimated fire sizes under climate change. Here, we calculate four commonly used FDIs over the conterminous United States using high-resolution (4 km) climate and fuel data sets for the 1984-2019 period. The relationships of these four FDIs to the observed wildfire sizes show that higher values of FDIs correlate to larger total fire sizes; this correlation is more robust at larger spatial scales. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the daily minimum relative humidity and precipitation are the most important drivers of the annual mean fire danger. In the instances of extreme fire danger, wind speed becomes a critical factor and should be considered in the calculation of the FDI. To assess the impact of climate change on future fire size, we calculate the present-day and end-of-century FDIs using the 12 km regional climate model simulations. The four FDIs generally predict consistent changes in future fire potential, suggesting an overall higher fire potential in conjunction with a prolonged wildfire season in future climate. Regionally, the four FDIs also reveal similar seasonal patterns as the enhancement arises mostly in spring and summer over the southwest US while in summer and fall over the northern and eastern US.",yu_performancefiredangerindices_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Time Ring Data: Definition And Application In Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Urban Expansion And Forest Loss,"{""Bao, Haijun"",""Li, Xinhu"",""Liu, Xin""}",NA,"Remote sensing can provide spatio-temporal continuous Earth observation data and is becoming the main data source for spatial and temporal analysis. Remote sensing data have been widely used in applications such as meteorological monitoring, forest investigation, environmental health, urban planning, and water conservancy. While long-time-series remote sensing data are used for spatio-temporal analysis, this analysis is usually limited because of the large data volumes and complex models used. This study intends to develop an innovative and simple approach to reveal the spatio-temporal characteristics of geographic features from the perspective of remote sensing data themselves. We defined an efficient remote sensing data structure, namely time ring (TR) data, to depict the spatio-temporal dynamics of two common geographic features. One is spatially expansive features. Taking nighttime light (NTL) as an example, we generated a NTL TR map to exhibit urban expansion with spatial and temporal information. The speed and acceleration maps of NTL TR data indicated extraordinary expansion in the last 10 years, especially in coastal cities and provincial capitals. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province, Shandong Province, and Jiangsu Province exhibited fast acceleration of urbanization. The other is spatially contractive features. We took forest loss in the Amazon basin as an example and produced a forest cover TR map. The speed and acceleration were mapped in two 10-year periods (2000-2010 and 2010-2020) in order to observe the changes in Amazon forest cover. Then, combining cropland TR data, we determined the consistency of the spatio-temporal variations and used a linear regression model to detect the association between the acceleration of cropland and forest. The forest TR map showed that, spatially, there was an apparent phenomenon of forest loss occurring in the southern and eastern Amazon basin. Temporally, the speed of forest loss was more drastic between 2000 and 2010 than that in 2010-2020. In addition, the acceleration of forest loss showed a dispersed distribution, except for in Bolivia, which demonstrated a concentrated regional acceleration. The R-squared value of the linear regression between forest and cropland acceleration reached 0.75, indicating that forest loss was closely linked to the expansion of cropland. The TR data defined in this study not only optimized the use of remote sensing data, but also facilitated their application in spatio-temporal integrative analysis. More importantly, multi-field TR data could be jointly applied to explore the driving force at spatial and temporal scales.",liu_timeringdatadefinition_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Current Barriers And Factors Of Success In The Diffusion Of Satellite Services In Europe,"{""Bruston, J."",""Secara, T.""}",NA,"Satellite services benefit civil society by helping tackle challenges such as climate change, the digital divide, etc. They have the potential to deliver concrete benefits to European society through innovative services supporting economic, societal and environmental policies. Such benefits can trigger increased public support for space in Europe. However, this potential has yet to be achieved. This paper argues that technological bias, the diversity of interests and initiatives among stakeholders and their individual actions do not always serve their collective objective to ensure wide diffusion of satellite services. It draws on theories of diffusion of innovation and on its authors' participatory work with the space and the user communities and at their interface in an effort to help diffuse satellite services within civil society. One of the major causes of insufficient service diffusion is the weakness of the interface between the space and user communities; some of factors that currently contribute to this state of affairs are the space community's over-reliance on publicly financed, technical demonstration projects as solutions to service diffusion; insufficient coordination by public authorities of innovation policies and programmes with other public policies and objectives; and an insufficient integration of satellite services within users' culture, traditional tools and services. The discussion allows for conclusions to be drawn on how the system of stakeholders could function better in order for satellite services to be successfully diffused in Europe.

With landuse structures being of major influence on the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems, and being also a highly suitable object of Earth observation, it is still an open question, however, in which way Earth observation data can be processed and integrated to provide an approximate indicator of sustainability. Based on an ecological sustainability model developed by Ripl and his co-workers at Berlin Technical University, this question was investigated in the framework of the joint project ""Development of a Land-Water-Management Concept to Decrease Matter Losses to Open Waters"" (Stor project), which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology. Present results may be summarized as follows: 1. Apart from hydrological point measurements, there are several spatial parameters which are of indicative value as to sustainability, especially the spatio-temporal distribution of biomass, surface temperature, and precipitation. 2. To provide the spatial information basis for enhanced efficiency of immediate measures such as reforestation, agricultural extension etc., a global information system (GIS) concept was developed and demonstrated which is based on a landuse/vegetation classification derived from Landsat TM data, a digital evaluation mode (DEM) and a relief dependent water distribution model (WDM).

In recent years, a combination of satellite-ground data on precipitation has led to a more accurate insight into precipitation and improved hydrological model performance. In this study, the Kosar Dam Basin in the Khuzestan province of Iran is selected as the research zone. The TRMM satellite data is used on 50 events to analyze the satellite precipitation data. Copula theory is then employed to check the uncertainties of precipitation estimation, and new precipitations are generated through original data and bias errors. A comparison of the results of the improved TRMM, which was bias-corrected by Gaussian copula, and ground-based rainfall demonstrated the efficacy of this method, with nearly 104\% and 51\% improvement in the CC and RMSE performance indicators, respectively.

Above about 30 km altitude, however, statistical optimization is a critical process for initializing the RO bending angles in order to optimize the climate monitoring utility of the retrieved atmospheric profiles. Here we introduce an advanced dynamic statistical optimization algorithm, which uses bending angles from multiple days of European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) short-range forecast and analysis fields, together with averaged-observed bending angles, to obtain background profiles and associated error covariance matrices with geographically varying background uncertainty estimates on a daily updated basis. The new algorithm is evaluated against the existing Wegener Center Occultation Processing System version 5.4 (OPSv5.4) algorithm, using several days of simulated MetOp and observed CHAMP and COSMIC data, for January and July conditions. We find the following for the new method's performance compared to OPSv5.4: 1.) it significantly reduces random errors (standard deviations), down to about half their size, and leaves less or about equal residual systematic errors (biases) in the optimized bending angles; 2.) the dynamic (daily) estimate of the background error correlation matrix alone already improves the optimized bending angles; 3.) the subsequently retrieved refractivity profiles and atmospheric (temperature) profiles benefit by improved error characteristics, especially above about 30 km.

Domain Recognition For Land Use Spatial Fractal Feature Based On Genetic Algorithm,"{""Chen, X. L."",""Fu, D. J."",""Li, Y."",""Shi, W. Z."",""Wu, H.""}",NA,"The spatial pattern of land use is one of the most profound human-induced alterations to the Earth's surface. Its change can lead to severe problems in urban ecological environments, such as heavy traffic, the heat island effect, and the spread of epidemics. An accurate examination of urban land use characteristics is helpful both in understanding quantitatively and comprehensively urban land use spatial patterns, and in discovering the potential rules of urban land use change. Because of its advantages in describing randomness and self-similarity, the fractal dimension has been used widely to analyze spatial patterns, and great achievements have been made in recent decades. However, the scale domain is largely ignored when the value of the fractal dimension is used to explain spatial patterns. To some extent, this leads inevitably to analysis uncertainty, because the spatial self-similarity characteristics of land use exist within a specific scale range rather than across a geographic scale range. Hence, the identification of the scale domain related to the fractal dimension is more important than the computation itself. In addressing this problem, this paper presents a model for scale domain recognition, based on a genetic algorithm, to provide a meaningful range of fractal features existing in nature. Its objective function is to minimize the average from the sum of squared residuals that is derived from the result of the fitting of a scale-free region using discrete points. It can improve the computation accuracy of the fractal dimension significantly. Because of its abundant water resources, this study took the scale domain of the water fractal feature in Wuchang district as an example. A cloud-free image obtained by the Quickbird satellite, was classified and used to extract land use information by using a combination of the decision tree method and supervised classification. A general framework and three genetic operators for the scale domain recognition of the land use spatial fractal feature were designed to identify the scale domain of the radius of the fractal dimension for water. To validate our model, its results were compared with three other methods used commonly for scale domain recognition: the artificial judgment method, the correlation coefficient method, and the strengthening coefficient method. The results indicate that different scale-less bands are derived by the four methods of scale domain identification. The scale-less band of the correlation coefficient method is significantly wider than that obtained by using the other three models. This results in a relatively small determination coefficient, indicating low accuracy. The genetic algorithm has the narrowest scale-less band and the best degree of statistical fitness of the four methods. Based on standard deviation, the four models can be ranked in the following descending order: the artificial judgment method (0.22), the correlation coefficient method (0.16), the strengthening coefficient method (0.13), and the genetic algorithm (0.08). Accordingly, the radius of the fractal dimension of water changes with the different scale-less bands derived from these four methods. The radius dimension derived from the genetic algorithm is 1.285, which suggests that the trend of the spatial distribution characteristics becomes gradually weaker moving from the center to the surroundings. This agrees with the spatial distribution of water information derived from the satellite image of Wuchang district. It reveals that it is critically important and imperative to promote the genetic algorithm for accurate identification of the scale domain of the fractal dimension. These findings are helpful for urban management departments in determining land use change, but also they provide a scientific reference for urban land use planning to ensure that land resources are used effectively.",wu_domainrecognitionlandspatial_2014,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

In this study, we assessed the change of health benefits generated by urban green spaces in 28 megacities worldwide between 2005 and 2015 by using availability and accessibility as proxy indicators. We first mapped land covers of 28 megacities using 10,823 scenes of Landsat images and a random forest classifier running on Google Earth Engine. We then calculated the availability and accessibility of urban green spaces using the land cover maps and gridded population data. The results showed that the mean availability of urban green spaces in these megacities increased from 27.63% in 2005 to 31.74% in 2015. The mean accessibility of urban green spaces increased from 65.76% in 2005 to 72.86% in 2015. The increased availability and accessibility of urban green spaces in megacities have brought more health benefits to their residents. © 2017 by the author.",huang_greenspacesindicatorurban_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Cropwatch Agroclimatic Indicators (Cwais) For Weather Impact Assessment On Global Agriculture,"{""Chen, Bo"",""Feng, Xueliang"",""Gommes, Rene"",""Li, Zhongyuan"",""Wu, Bingfang"",""Zeng, Hongwei"",""Zhang, Ning""}",NA,"CropWatch agroclimatic indicators (CWAIs) are a monitoring tool developed by the CropWatch global crop monitoring system in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; www.cropwatch.com.cn, Wu et al Int J Digital Earth 7(2):113-137, 2014, Wu et al Remote Sens 7:3907-3933, 2015). Contrary to most other environmental and agroclimatic indicators, they are ""agronomic value-added"", i.e. they are spatial values averaged over agricultural areas only and they include a weighting that enhances the contribution of the areas with the largest production potential. CWAIs can be computed for any time interval (starting from dekads) and yield one synthetic value per variable over a specific area and time interval, for instance a national annual value. Therefore, they are very compatible with socio-economic and other variables that are usually reported at regular time intervals over administrative units, such as national environmental or agricultural statistics. Two of the CWAIs are satellite-based (RAIN and Photosynthetically Active radiation, PAR) while the third is ground based (TEMP, air temperature); capitals are used when specifically referring to CWAIs rather than the climate variables in general. The paper first provides an overview of some common agroclimatic indicators, describing their procedural, systemic and normative features in subsequent sections, following the terminology of Binder et al Environ Impact Assess Rev 30:71-81 (2010). The discussion focuses on the systemic and normative aspects: the CWAIs are assessed in terms of their coherent description of the agroclimatic crop environment, at different spatial scales (systemic). The final section shows that the CWAIs retain key statistical properties of the underlying climate variables and that they can be compared to a reference value and used as monitoring and early warning variables (normative).",gommes_cropwatchagroclimaticindicatorscwais_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Ningbo Atmospheric Environment Analysis And Regulating Countermeasure Based On Urban Climatic Map,"{""Deng, J."",""Liu, L."",""Zhao, X."",""Zhao, Y.""}",NA,"Rapid urbanization has changed the urban climate and environment. As a result, many climatic and environmental problems have emerged. Valid urban climatic environment analysis and regulating countermeasures are required in order to cope with and mitigate these issues. An urban climatic map provides important guidance for the planning and regulation of the urban climatic environment. Based on a traditional urban climatic map, this research proposes a new method of building an urban climatic map that considers all seasons and multiple environmental elements. The urban area in Ningbo City, with its complicated underlying surfaces and obvious seasonal climate characteristics, was used as a case study. The technical means, including remote-sensing inversion, spatial analysis of geographical information system (GIS), and mesoscale numerical model simulation, were comprehensively applied to conduct a multi-season analysis and evaluation of the urban thermal load, air pollution, ventilation potential, wind field, and overall urban climatic environment. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the urban thermal load and air pollutants is characterized by significant seasonal and spatial differences in the principal elements of the formation of an urban climatic environment. Ningbo City is affected by both thermal load and air pollution in spring and summer, affected only by air pollution in the winter, and only slightly affected by both thermal load and air pollution in the autumn. The spatial patterns of ventilation potential are similar in all seasons. Remarkable seasonal and spatial differences are presented, as the wind environment is complex and subject to change. By conducting an overall analysis on urban climatic environments, we found that areas with high and middle values of urban climatic environment are mainly distributed in forests, croplands, and water bodies. Areas with a high risk of urban climatic environment are located in the heavy chemical industrial zones along the coast of Beilun District, Zhenhai District, as well as the southern part of Hangzhou Bay. Areas with an intermediate risk of urban climatic environments are found in the regions where large amounts of industrial factories are clustered, such as the eastern Jiangbei District, eastern and western sides of Yinzhou District, Cixi urban area, and northeast part of the Fenghua urban area. Based on the above analysis, the planning schemes of urban ventilation channels and the regulating countermeasures of climatic environments are further proposed. These include two first-class ventilation channels, five second-class ventilation channels, three third-class bidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by land-sea breezes, twelve third-class unidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by land-sea breezes, thirteen third-class unidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by mountain-valley breezes, and seven types of countermeasures for urban climatic environment regulation. The method of building an urban climatic map considering all seasons and multiple environmental factors raised by this research is applicable to the analysis and evaluation research of the monsoon climate zones with complicated climatic environments. It may also improve urban thermal load and atmospheric environmental quality and ease the problems of urban climatic environments in all seasons. It may do so through ventilation channel planning and formulating and implementing relevant regulatory countermeasures so as to provide support for urban environmental protection, meteorological and planning departments, and promote sustainable urban development and the construction of an ecological city. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

A Survey Of Natural Aggregate Properties And Characteristics Important In Remote Sensing And Airborne Geophysics,"{""Knepper Jr, D. H."",""Langer, W. H."",""Miller, S.""}",NA,"Natural aggregate is vital to the construction industry. Although natural aggregate is a high volume/low value commodity that is abundant, new sources are becoming increasingly difficult to find and develop because of rigid industry specifications, political considerations, development and transportation costs, and environmental concerns. There are two primary sources of natural aggregate: (1) exposed or near-surface bedrock that can be crushed, and (2) deposits of sand and gravel. Remote sensing and airborne geophysics detect surface and near-surface phenomena, and may be useful for detecting and mapping potential aggregate sources; however, before a methodology for applying these techniques can be developed, it is necessary to understand the type, distribution, physical properties, and characteristics of natural aggregate deposits. The distribution of potential aggregate sources is closely tied to local geologic history. Conventional exploration for natural aggregate deposits has been largely a ground-based operation, although aerial photographs and topographic maps have been extensively used to target possible deposits. Today, the exploration process also considers factors such as the availability of the land, space and water supply for processing, political and environmental factors, and distance from the market; exploration and planning cannot be separated. There are many physical properties and characteristics by which to judge aggregate material for specific applications; most of these properties and characteristics pertain only to individual aggregate particles. The application of remote sensing and airborne geophysical measurements to detecting and mapping potential aggregate sources, however, is based on intrinsic bulk physical properties and extrinsic characteristics of the deposits that can be directly measured, mathematically derived from measurement, or interpreted with remote sensing and geophysical data. © 1995 Oxford UniversityPress.",knepperjr_surveynaturalaggregateproperties_1995,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

A broader understanding of urban livability is that it concerns the quality of life in any human living environment. The World Health Organization, among many others, suggests a four-dimension assessment system based on the concepts of convenience, amenity, health and safety that can be used to evaluate any cities' potential livability. Following this proposal, the current study taps into the power of GIS and Remote Sensing technologies to generate a set of urban livability evaluating indicators via extracted land use information. Using the city proper of Changchun, Jilin Province of China as an example, the study extracts fifteen individual land use indicators from topographic maps and a remote sensing imagery. A principal component analysis-based approach was used to build an urban livability index with the fifteen indicators. Furthermore, with detailed examination of relevant studies, national documents and local fieldwork, this research also establishes potential benchmark values for all fifteen livability evaluating indicators for comparison purposes. Results suggest that slightly more than half of Changchun's city proper is above the livability benchmark in the framework of the current study. Residents' access to parks and open spaces is a major lagging factor for the city proper's livability.

Classification Of Hurricane Hazards: The Importance Of Rainfall,"{""Baldock, T.

The new rainfall subindex adopts rainfall intensity, stormrainfall area, and the forward speed of the system to estimate the rainfall hazard. The new hazard index, applied to recent U.S. hurricanes (2003-12), has better skill than existing scales in terms of ranking the severity of the events by both damage and death toll. Further, the index can provide good quantitative estimates of dollar values for damage and death toll, whereas previous models provide only a scale or ranking.

To this end, we used LiDAR-derived DEM to detect and map forest roads and skid trails, and to estimate road density, in 60 forest divisions sampled at random from among the 2639 km2 of forest managed in the above region by the State Forests National Forest Holding. The determined road network was then validated by GPS ground control. Supplementary, detailed LiDAR data were used to detect features of the past cultural landscape, and to determine the interference in that due to contemporary logging roads. Overall skidder traffic was estimated on the basis of a thorough analysis of State Forests documents, including legal acts, guidelines, management plans, detailed databases and maps of planned cuts. LiDAR data proved to be an adequate tool in the mapping of the network of logging roads present under the tree canopy, although it slightly underestimates road density in a densely vegetated, post-landslide topography. Our LiDAR-assessed density of Carpathian logging roads (at 108.5–140.7 m ha−1, including skid trails) is nevertheless among the highest reported in the literature, and one that far exceeds recommended values. Spatial pattern analysis further revealed the unfavourable phenomenon of multiple parallel roads forming contiguous areas of disturbed soil and constituting dispersal paths for invasive plants. Many examples of cultural remains being run over and destroyed by skidders could also be reported. The observed process of log extraction is one of the least sustainable aspects to forest management in the Carpathians, and our results emphasise very clearly the need for rules to support the preservation of cultural heritage in forested areas, as well as improved tools by which skidding practices can be monitored. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",affek_impactsmodernmechanisedskidding_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Monitoring Of Nitrogen Concentration In Soybean Leaves At Multiple Spatial Vertical Scales Based On Spectral Parameters,"{""Chen, Guofu"",""Cui, Shihao"",""Li, Zhijun"",""Limami, Anis"",""Liu, Yuchen"",""Sun, Tao"",""Wang, Zhangkai"",""Xie, Weihao"",""Yang, Wanli"",""Zhang, Fucang"",""Zhang, Zhitao"",""Zhao, Yizheng"",""Zhu, Zhiheng""}",NA,"Nitrogen is a fundamental component for building amino acids and proteins, playing a crucial role in the growth and development of plants. Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) serves as a key indicator for assessing plant growth and development. Monitoring LNC provides insights into the absorption and utilization of nitrogen from the soil, offering valuable information for rational nutrient management. This, in turn, contributes to optimizing nutrient supply, enhancing crop yields, and minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Efficient and non-destructive estimation of crop LNC is of paramount importance for on-field crop management. Spectral technology, with its advantages of repeatability and high-throughput observations, provides a feasible method for obtaining LNC data. This study explores the responsiveness of spectral parameters to soybean LNC at different vertical scales, aiming to refine nitrogen management in soybeans. This research collected hyperspectral reflectance data and LNC data from different leaf layers of soybeans. Three types of spectral parameters, nitrogen-sensitive empirical spectral indices, randomly combined dual-band spectral indices, and ""three-edge"" parameters, were calculated. Four optimal spectral index selection strategies were constructed based on the correlation coefficients between the spectral parameters and LNC for each leaf layer. These strategies included empirical spectral index combinations (Combination 1), randomly combined dual-band spectral index combinations (Combination 2), ""three-edge"" parameter combinations (Combination 3), and a mixed combination (Combination 4). Subsequently, these four combinations were used as input variables to build LNC estimation models for soybeans at different vertical scales using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The results demonstrated that the correlation coefficients between the LNC and spectral parameters reached the highest values in the upper soybean leaves, with most parameters showing significant correlations with the LNC (p < 0.05). Notably, the reciprocal difference index (VI6) exhibited the highest correlation with the upper-layer LNC at 0.732, with a wavelength combination of 841 nm and 842 nm. In constructing the LNC estimation models for soybeans at different leaf layers, the accuracy of the models gradually improved with the increasing height of the soybean plants. The upper layer exhibited the best estimation performance, with a validation set coefficient of determination (R-2) that was higher by 9.9\% to 16.0\% compared to other layers. RF demonstrated the highest accuracy in estimating the upper-layer LNC, with a validation set R2 higher by 6.2\% to 8.8\% compared to other models. The RMSE was lower by 2.1\% to 7.0\%, and the MRE was lower by 4.7\% to 5.6\% compared to other models. Among different input combinations, Combination 4 achieved the highest accuracy, with a validation set R-2 higher by 2.3\% to 13.7\%. In conclusion, by employing Combination 4 as the input, the RF model achieved the optimal estimation results for the upper-layer LNC, with a validation set R-2 of 0.856, RMSE of 0.551, and MRE of 10.405\%.

Changemask: Deep Multi-Task Encoder-Transformer-Decoder Architecture For Semantic Change Detection,"{""Ma, A."",""Tian, S."",""Zhang, L."",""Zheng, Z."",""Zhong, Y.""}",NA,"Multi-temporal high spatial resolution earth observation makes it possible to detect complex urban land surface changes, which is a significant and challenging task in remote sensing communities. Previous works mainly focus on binary change detection (BCD) based on modern technologies, e.g., deep fully convolutional network (FCN), whereas the deep network architecture for semantic change detection (SCD) is insufficiently explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task encoder-transformer-decoder architecture (ChangeMask) designed by exploring two important inductive biases: sematic-change causal relationship and temporal symmetry. ChangeMask decouples the SCD into a temporal-wise semantic segmentation and a BCD, and then integrates these two tasks into a general encoder-transformer-decoder framework. In the encoder part, we design a semantic-aware encoder to model the semantic-change causal relationship. This encoder is only used to learn semantic representation and then learn change representation from semantic representation via a later transformer module. In this way, change representation can constrain semantic representation during training, which introduces a regularization to reduce the risk of overfitting. To learn a robust change representation from semantic representation, we propose a temporal-symmetric transformer (TST) to guarantee temporal symmetry for change representation and keep it discriminative. Based on the above semantic representation and change representation, we adopt simple multi-task decoders to output semantic change map. Benefiting from the differentiable building blocks, ChangeMask can be trained by a multi-task loss function, which significantly simplifies the whole pipeline of applying ChangeMask. The comprehensive experimental results on two large-scale SCD datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of ChangeMask in SCD. Besides, to demonstrate the potential value in real-world applications, e.g., automatic urban analysis and decision-making, we deploy the ChangeMask to map a large geographic area covering 30 km2 with 300 million pixels.

Effective control of post-operative pain after ambulatory surgery is challenging to all health professionals. Computerised systems are being implemented more frequently for remote patient monitoring, including during the at-home post-operative period. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of delivering a computerised system, developed in-house, for remote pain monitoring. It evaluates the user-friendliness of the system and the extent of patient compliance. Finally, a comparative assessment of the system is made with respect to the quality of pain treatment in ambulatory surgery. METHODS: The participants included 32 adults, aged 18-75, randomly assigned to a control group or to a computerised treatment group. The primary treatment outcome was measured by pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) reported several times per day during a five-day monitoring period, using an electronic pain diary combined with a web-based personal health record. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated the feasibility and suitability of the proposed system for pain management. Its handling was user-friendly, without requiring advanced skill or prior experience. In addition, the results showed that the guidance of health care professionals is essential to patients' satisfaction and positive experience with the system. There were no significant group differences with respect to improvements in the quality of pain treatment; however, this can be explained by the low pain scores registered in both groups, related to the type of surgical interventions recruited and the degrees of pain that are easily treated. To evaluate the benefits from a patient-centred perspective, studies of major ambulatory surgeries or of patients in chronic pain, including oncologic and non-oncologic pain resistant to treatment, are necessary. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.",pombo_evaluationubiquitousinteroperablecomputerised_2014,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Forest Fire Monitoring Using Airborne Optical Full Spectrum Remote Sensing Data,"{""Jia, W."",""Li, Z."",""Liang, X."",""Lin, X."",""Pang, Y."",""Qin, X."",""Si, L.""}",NA,"Forest fire is one of the major forest disturbances, which directly affects forest ecosystem structure, carbon cycle, even global climate change. In recent years, the technical progresses of aerial platforms and onboard sensors have effectively improved the capability of airborne remote sensing to detect and monitor forest fires. As a result, many forest fire applications have been carried out with airborne data, including the forest fuel assessment, evaluation of forest fire potential and prevention, forest fire monitoring and situation evaluation during firefighting, post-fire damage assessment, ecosystem management and restoration. This paper introduces an integrated airborne remote sensing system, i.e., Chinese Academy of Forestry's LiDAR, Thermal, CCD and Hyperspectral (CAF-LiTCHy) airborne observation system. The CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system is equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner, thermal infrared camera, CCD camera and hyperspectral scanner and can obtain the corresponding data, simultaneously. The parameters of these sensors and the data processing scheme were described to show the advanced and scientific nature of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system. Moreover, the detailed ""image - spectral - temperature - height"" information of forest benefits the aforementioned applications. Here, the Xichang '3.30 Forest Fire' in Sichuan Province was selected as a case study to test the capability of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system in post-fire survey and disaster assessment. The burn severity levels can be interpreted from the high spatial resolution CCD image directly. Meanwhile, the LiDAR-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM) shows the different burn severities of the canopy in spatial and vertical structural level. The vegetation indices calculated from hyperspectral image indicate that the pigment content and water content of canopy decrease simultaneously. The thermal information shows a higher temperature in high burn severity areas than other areas due to lots of charcoals from fire. Finally, with the combination of the CCD, CHM, spectral and thermal temperature information, the distribution of burn severity levels of the study area was mapped. The CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system can obtain forest fire information and offer fire-related parameters effectively. The design of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system is advanced and scientific, and the acquired data are in high resolution, multiple dimensions and good geo-location consistency. The efficiency and stability for airborne data collection provide rapid response for fire events. Furthermore, the CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system has the potential to provide support for fire prevention, fire risk forecast and early warning, firefighting decision-making, post-fire damage assessment and ecological restoration. © 2020, Science Press.

Results showed that coffee foliar N is related to Sentinel-2 MSI B4 (R-2 = 0.32), B6 (R-2 = 0.49), B7 (R-2 = 0.42), B8 (R-2 = 0.57) and B12 (R-2 = 0.24) bands.

These variables were also identified by the random forest variable optimisation as the most valuable in coffee foliar N prediction. Modelling coffee foliar N using vegetation indices produced better accuracy (R-2 = 0.71 with RMSE = 0.27 for all and R-2 = 0.73 with RMSE = 0.25 for optimized variables), compared to using spectral bands (R-2 = 0.57 with RMSE = 0.32 for all and R-2 = 0.58 with RMSE = 0.32 for optimized variables). Combining optimized bands and vegetation indices produced the best results in coffee foliar N modelling (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.23).

Accuracy Evaluation Of Et And Its Components From Three Remote Sensing Et Models And One Process Based Hydrological Model Using Ground Measured Eddy Covariance And Sap Flow,"{""Han, Shumin"",""Hao, Xiaohua"",""Li, Huilong"",""Li, Xiaojin"",""Yang, Yanmin"",""Yang, Yonghui"",""Zhou, Xinyao""}",NA,"Evapotranspiration (ET) and its components, transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (Es) are crucial to understand hydrological cycle and effective water loss in water resource management. Remote sensing models and process based hydrological models are two kinds of effective methods for evaluating ET and its partitions. Although the ability of remote sensing models to simulate ET has been widely verified, there is limited verification of ET components, especially T, which is the major component of ET. This research used ET obtained from eddy covariance system and T obtained from sap flow observation in an apricot orchard of north China to evaluate the accuracy of ET and its components from three remote sensing models (PT-JPL, PML, and SWH) and a processbased hydrological model (SHAW). The results showed that after calibrations, all the four models satisfactorily simulated total ET particularly at annual level. Among them, the PML model had the best fit efficiency, with the most satisfied R2 and NSE values. The PT-JPL estimated average ET was the most accurate, with the slope nearest to 1.0. While for the simulation of T, SHAW model had a better performance owing to the fact that SHAW model simulate plant transpiration using changes in soil water content. The average T/ET of the models for the growing season was close to the observed value of 0.70, except that the T/ET of SWH is high due to the lack of Ei calculation. Furthermore, nearly all the three remote sensing models underestimated ET in the dry spring and overestimated ET in the rainy summer. In comparison with the process-based SHAW model, it is suggested that remote sensing ET relies more heavily on the seasonal change of meteorological factors such as precipitation but less capable in reflecting the gradually delaying process of soil moisture in the dry season. Therefore, it is indicated that for future improvement of remote sensing ET models, adjustment of soil water availability in a much longer term is suggested at least for semi-humid and semi-arid ecosystems.",li_accuracyevaluationcomponentsremote_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Humans Alter Habitat Selection Of Birds On Ocean-Exposed Sandy Beaches,"{""Meager, Justin J."",""Nielsen, Tara"",""Schlacher, Thomas A.""}",NA,"Aim Resource-selection functions (RSFs) can quantify and predict the density of animal populations across heterogeneous landscapes and are important conservation tools in areas subject to human disturbance. Sandy beach ecosystems have comparatively low habitat heterogeneity and structural relief in the intertidal zone, but intense human use. We aimed to develop predictive RSFs for birds on ocean-exposed sandy beaches at two spatial scales, 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale), and to test whether habitat selection of birds that commonly use the surfbeachdune interface is influenced by the rates of human activities. Location Moreton and North Stradbroke Island, eastern Australia. Methods Avifauna and human activities were mapped on three sandy beaches covering 79 km of coastline for 15 months. Habitat characteristics of the surfbeach-dune interface were derived from remote sensing and ground surveys. RSFs were developed for 12 species of birds at two spatial scales: 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale). Results At local (25 ha) and landscape scales (250 ha), dune dimensions and the extent and type of vegetation structure were important predictors of bird density. Adding the frequency of human activities improved the predictive power of RSFs, suggesting that habitat selection of birds on beaches is modified by human use of these environments. Human activities occurred mostly in the mid-to lower intertidal zone of the beach, overlapping closely with the preferred habitats of Silver Gulls (Larus novaehollandiae), Pied Oystercatchers (Haematopus longirostris), Red-capped Plovers (Charadrius ruficapillus) and endangered Little Terns (Sternula albifrons). Main conclusions In addition to demonstrating the appropriateness of RSFs to the surf-beach-dune interface, our results stress the need for systematic conservation planning for these ecosystems, where ecological values have traditionally been subsidiary to the maintenance of sand budgets and erosion control.",meager_humansalterhabitatselection_2012,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Economic Evaluations Of Remote Patient Monitoring For Chronic Disease: A Systematic Review,"{""Caffery, L. J."",""De Guzman, K. R."",""Gray, L. C."",""Snoswell, C. L."",""Taylor, M. L.""}",NA,"Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review and summarize economic evaluations of noninvasive remote patient monitoring (RPM) for chronic diseases compared with usual care. Methods: A systematic literature search identified economic evaluations of RPM for chronic diseases, compared with usual care. Searches of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and EconLit using keyword synonyms for RPM and economics identified articles published from up until September 2021. Title, abstract, and full-text reviews were conducted. Data extraction of study characteristics and health economic findings was performed. Article reporting quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. Results: This review demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of RPM was dependent on clinical context, capital investment, organizational processes, and willingness to pay in each specific setting. RPM was found to be highly cost-effective for hypertension and may be cost-effective for heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There were few studies that investigated RPM for diabetes or other chronic diseases. Studies were of high reporting quality, with an average Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards score of 81%. Of the final 34 included studies, most were conducted from the healthcare system perspective. Eighteen studies used cost-utility analysis, 4 used cost-effectiveness analysis, 2 combined cost-utility analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis, 1 used cost-consequence analysis, 1 used cost-benefit analysis, and 8 used cost-minimization analysis. Conclusions: RPM was highly cost-effective for hypertension and may achieve greater long-term cost savings from the prevention of high-cost health events. For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, cost-effectiveness findings differed according to disease severity and there was limited economic evidence for diabetes interventions. © 2021 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc.",deguzman_economicevaluationsremotepatient_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Changes In Rice Cultivation Affect Population Trends Of Herons And Egrets In Italy,"{""Boncompagni, Eleonora"",""Cardarelli, Elisa"",""Delle Monache, Daniele"",""Fasola, Mauro"",""Morganti, Michelangelo"",""Pellitteri-Rosa, Daniele"",""Ranghetti, Luigi""}",NA,"The breeding populations of colonial herons, egrets and allied waterbirds in Northwestern Italy increased since 1972, when a long-term monitoring was initiated, up to the end of the 20 degrees century. Populations of continental importance for some heron species were concentrated mostly in the district of intensive rice cultivation, where the paddies offered wide foraging opportunities. After 2000, new cultivation techniques caused a progressive reduction in paddy flooding. We found a significant relationship between the post-2000 decrease in the number of nests of the three most abundant species of waterbirds, Grey Heron, Little Egret and Black-crowned Nightheron, and the diminishing extent of paddy flooding estimated on satellite-derived images. On the other hand, outside the paddies district the same three species continued to increase or remained mostly stable. The recent agronomic changes in the paddies of Northwestern Italy compromise their role as surrogates of natural wetlands and their importance for environmental conservation. The spread of dry rice fields, and the consequent loss of their value for conservation of aquatic biodiversity, call for a revision of the regulations and incentives to farmers under the Common Agriculture Policy by the European Union and by local authorities.

Land Use Classification From Social Media Data And Satellite Imagery,"{""An, Ying"",""Chen, Bo"",""Wang, JunJue"",""Ye, Yaqin"",""Zhong, Yingqiang""}",NA,"Detailed urban land use classification plays a highly important role in the development and management of cities and in the identification of human activities. The complexity of the urban system makes its functional zoning a challenge, which makes such maps underutilized. A detailed land use classification encompasses both the natural land features and the classification of structures closely related to human activities. The use of satellite imagery to classify land use can effectively benefit the recognition of natural objects, but its performance demands significant improvement in the recognition of social functions due to the lack of information regarding human activities. To identify such activities in an urban area, we added Point of Interests (POI) data. This dataset contains both geographical tags and attributes that describe human activities. However, it has an uneven spatial distribution, with gaps in coverage being readily apparent. This paper proposes a land use classification framework using satellite imagery and data from social media. The proposed method employs a kernel density estimation to handle the spatial unevenness of POI data. The solution of mixed programming of MPI and OpenMP was adopted to parallel the algorithm. The results are compared to data compiled manually by means of human interpretation. Considering the example of Wuhan city, results show that the overall accuracy of land use type classification is 86.2\%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.860. It is demonstrated that using both POI and satellite images, a detailed land use map can be created automatically with satisfactory robustness.",ye_landclassificationsocialmedia_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Retrieving Crop Albedo Based On Radar Sentinel-1 And Random Forest Approach,"{""Amazirh, A."",""Bouras, E. H."",""Chehbouni, A."",""Er-Raki, S."",""Olivera-Guerra, L. E.""}",NA,"Monitoring agricultural crops is of paramount importance for preserving water resources and increasing water efficiency over semi-arid areas. This can be achieved by modelling the water resources all along the growing season through the coupled water–surface energy balance. Surface albedo is a key land surface variable to constrain the surface radiation budget and hence the coupled water–surface energy balance. In order to capture the hydric status changes over the growing season, optical remote sensing becomes impractical due to cloud cover in some periods, especially over irrigated winter crops in semi-arid regions. To fill the gap, this paper aims to generate cloudless surface albedo product from Sentinel-1 data that offers a source of high spatio-temporal resolution images. This can help to better capture the vegetation development along the growth season through the surface radiation budget. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was implemented using Sentinel-1 backscatters as input. The approach was tested over an irrigated semi-arid zone in Morocco, which is known by its heterogeneity in term of soil conditions and crop types. The obtained results are evaluated against Landsat-derived albedo with quasi-concurrent Landsat/Sentinel-1 overpasses (up to one day offset), while a further validation was investigated using in situ field scale albedo data. The best model-hyperparameters selection was dependent on two validation approaches (K-fold cross-validation ‘k = 10’, and holdout). The more robust and accurate model parameters are those that represent the best statistical metrics (root mean square error ‘RMSE’, bias and correlation coefficient ‘R’). Coefficient values ranging from 0.70 to 0.79 and a RMSE value between 0.0002 and 0.00048 were obtained comparing Landsat and predicted albedo by RF method. The relative error ratio equals 4.5, which is acceptable to predict surface albedo. © 2021 by the authors.",amazirh_retrievingcropalbedobased_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Spectral Diversity Metrics For Detecting Oil Pollution Effect On Biodiversity In The Niger Delta,"{""Balzter, H."",""Berrio, J. C."",""Onyia, N. N.""}",NA,"Biodiversity monitoring in the Niger delta has become pertinent in view of the incessant spillages from oil production activities and the socio-economic impact of these spillages on the inhabitants who depend on the resources for their livelihood. Conventional methods of post-impact assessments are expensive, time consuming, and cause damage to the environment, as they often require the removal of affected samples/specimens for laboratory analysis. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space while using the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). The SVH proposes that the species diversity of a sampled area is linearly correlated with the variability of spectral reflectance of the area. Several authors have tested the SVH on various land cover types and spatial scales; however, the present study evaluated the validity of the SVH against the backdrop of oil pollution impact on biodiversity while using vascular plant species as surrogates. Species richness and diversity indices were computed from vegetation data collected from polluted and non-polluted transects. Spectral metrics that were derived from Sentinel 2 bands and broadband vegetation indices (BVIs) using various algorithms, including averages, spread, dimension reduction, and so on, were assessed for their ability to estimate vascular plants species richness and diversity. The results showed significant differences in vegetation characteristics of polluted and control transects (H = 76.05, p-value = < 0.05 for abundance and H = 170.03, p-value < 0.05 for richness). Spectral diversity metrics correlated negatively with species data on polluted transects and positively on control transects. The metrics computed using Sentinel 2A bands and vegetation indices proved to be sensitive to changes in vegetation characteristics following oil pollution. The most robust relationship was observed between the metrics and indices on control transects, whereas the weakest relationships were observed on polluted transects. Index-wise, the Simpson's diversity index regressed better with spectral metrics (R2 > 0.5), whereas the Chao-1 richness index regressed the least (R2 < 0.5). The strength of the relationship resulted in successfully estimating species richness and diversity values of investigated transects, thereby enhancing biodiversity monitoring over time and space. © 2019 by the authors.",onyia_spectraldiversitymetricsdetecting_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Estimating Impacts Of Plantation Forestry On Plant Biodiversity In Southern Chile-A Spatially Explicit Modelling Approach,"{""Braun, Andreas Christian"",""Koch, Barbara""}",NA,"Monitoring the impacts of land-use practices is of particular importance with regard to biodiversity hotspots in developing countries. Here, conserving the high level of unique biodiversity is challenged by limited possibilities for data collection on site. Especially for such scenarios, assisting biodiversity assessments by remote sensing has proven useful. Remote sensing techniques can be applied to interpolate between biodiversity assessments taken in situ. Through this approach, estimates of biodiversity for entire landscapes can be produced, relating land-use intensity to biodiversity conditions. Such maps are a valuable basis for developing biodiversity conservation plans. Several approaches have been published so far to interpolate local biodiversity assessments in remote sensing data. In the following, a new approach is proposed. Instead of inferring biodiversity using environmental variables or the variability of spectral values, a hypothesis-based approach is applied. Empirical knowledge about biodiversity in relation to land-use is formalized and applied as ascription rules for image data. The method is exemplified for a large study site (over 67,000 km(2)) in central Chile, where forest industry heavily impacts plant diversity. The proposed approach yields a coefficient of correlation of 0.73 and produces a convincing estimate of regional biodiversity.

The aim of the study was to determine the perceived drivers of land use and land cover change in of Nakasongola district in the Central Uganda district to support decision making for present and future rangeland management. Satellite imagery for 1985, 1995, 2005, 2015 and 2021 were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and analyzed to determine the LULC dynamics. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to obtain perceived drivers of LULC. Results showed that by 1985 grassland covered 31.7\%, wetlands 26.4\%, woodland 11.5\% and farmland 7.2\% of the total land area. However, by 2021, farmland covered 35.8\% of the total land area, wetland 21.6\% and had reduced to grassland 18.5 percent. Future LULC projections using a Markov chain model showed that farmland cover will increase by 13.85\% while grassland cover will further decline by 9.89\% in 2040. Wood fuel extraction, subsistence farming, population growth and overgrazing were perceived as key drivers of LULC change. Both remote sensing techniques and local perceptions were in agreement with the identification of patterns and perceived drivers revealing the inherent value of tacit knowledge resident within the community.

Therefore, an environment-friendly land use combination model is proposed. The results were as follows: (1) from 2005 to 2017, the overall landscape pattern of trough valley area presented fragmentation, the number of landscape patches increased, the landscape pattern changed from single regularization and simplification to complex and mixed type, the diversity increased and the spatial heterogeneity enhanced. With the variation of time, the overall landscape ecological security in karst trough valley showed an upward trend,the Ecological Security Index (ESI) of the western and eastern trough valleys increased from the trough basin to the two sides of the hillside, while the middle trough valley increased from the hillside to the trough basin. (2) At a research scale of 200 m,the global positive correlation of ESI in the western trough valleys is the most significant, and its Moran's I value showed a trend of first increased and then decreased,but the middle and eastern troughs were the opposite.The spatial agglomeration pattern of ESI in karst trough valley area was mainly manifested as high-high and low-low value agglomeration areas, and the spatial agglomeration degree was higher, while the distribution of high-low and low-high agglomeration areas was less and its change was not obvious.(3) The landscape agglomeration distribution pattern is influenced by low topographic relief and low slope that presents similar trend of inverted ""U"" shape, while the elevation is opposite. (4) The landscape pattern of karst trough valley area can increase the landscape ecological security by expanding the land use combination pattern of “woodland-shrub woodland-grassland”.

Soil resources are an integral part of the land cover/land use. They can be a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of the conversion of ""low disturbance"" land covers (e.g., evergreen forest, hay/pasture) to ""high disturbance"" land covers (e.g., low-, medium-, and high-intensity developed land). These often ""invisible"" GHG emissions can be considered as ""negative externalities"" and ""external costs"" because of the difficulty in assigning ownership to the emissions. The combination of remote sensing and soil information data analysis can identify the ownership associated with GHG emissions and therefore expand the range of policy tools for addressing these emissions.

The experiment collected multispectral image data from summer maize at the jointing stage and selected eight vegetation indices. By using the sparrow search optimized kernel limit learning machine (SSA-KELM), the prediction models for canopy leaf (CL) SPAD(CL) and ear leaf (EL) SPAD(EL) were established, and a linear fitting analysis was conducted combining the measured SPAD(CL) values and SPAD(EL) values on the ground.

In Amazonia, soil conditions are highly heterogeneous, which has important implications for the distribution and dynamics of the area's exceptional biodiversity. Unfortunately, available soil maps for this region suffer from inaccuracies and lack of ecologically relevant variables. Here, we develop a map of the sum of exchangeable base cation concentration (SB) in the surface soil by applying machine learning to a comprehensive set of over 10,000 field data points of SB values directly measured from soil samples or inferred using indicator plant species occurrences. As predictors, we used rasters of soil type probabilities, elevation, biomass and reflectance values from Landsat satellite images. Random Forest (RF) models were trained and tested using two different cross-validation strategies. We also assessed in which areas the map was more reliable using the area of applicability approach and compared the results with two other soil layers. The best predictors of SB variation were Landsat bands 7, 4 and 3, elevation, and proba-bility of Histosols. The regional patterns observed across Amazonia were consistent with current geological understanding; lower SB values tended to occur in central Amazonian soils and higher values in western Amazonian soils, with considerable variation within each region. The model was found applicable over most of the Amazonian biome, especially in non-inundated (terra-firme) forest, but not over coastal areas, floodplains of major rivers and wetlands, which were poorly represented in the training data. Our new SB map over performed previous SB map and represent an accurate and ecologically meaningful variable.

A method to predict stream water temperature was developed and tested using an interactive table for visualisation of complex data. The dashboard was used to provide information and alerting to water users in an agricultural catchment, through the Ringarooma Water Users Group (RWUG) in NE Tasmania, Australia. The dashboard was updated several times per day using telemetry and data platform services, and accessed by RWUG members mainly during periods of low flow when water extraction restrictions can be applied. Irrigators gained an improved understanding of streamflow behaviour in response to weather variability, and water extractions and releases, and developed abilities to voluntarily manage the water resource as three sub-groups. The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) collaborated with the RWUG in this adaptive management approach, as enabled by the Ringarooma River Catchment Water Management Plan, and later informed a new Ministerial Policy for ‘Water Resource Management During Extreme Dry Conditions’.

In this study, an attempt has been made to prioritize subwatershed based on morphometric parameters using remote-sensing and GIS techniques to understand the role of channel network on the geo-hydrological behavior of Amaravathi watershed. This study also describes geology, geomorphology, and soil characteristics of the watershed.

The drainage morphometric analysis was performed through linear, aerial, and relief aspects. The predominantly dendritic drainage pattern is noticed and Amaravathi watershed, which has been divided into 31 subwatersheds. Prioritization of subwatershed was carried out based on compound parameter analysis by adding the values of linear and shape parameters of each subwatershed. In this study, it is observed that out of 31 subwatersheds, 10 fall in high priority (SWS-1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 21, 23), 10 fall in medium priority (SWS-2, 3, 12, 13, 17, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31), and the remaining 11 fall in low priority (SWS-7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 24, 26, 28, 30).

Procedures Of Soil Farming Allowing Reduction Of Compaction,"{""Hula, J."",""Kroulik, M."",""Kumhala, F."",""Kviz, Z."",""Loch, T.""}",NA,"Evaluation of new technologies using guidance systems is very important and can help producers with choosing the right equipment for their applications. Without using satellite navigation during field operations, there is a tendency for passes to overlap. That results in waste of fuel and pesticides, longer working times and also environmental damage. When utilising satellite guidance for field operations, there is a close connection with controlled traffic farming (CTF) as well. CTF is currently a quite quickly developing farming system based on fixed layout of machinery passes across a field. Tracks precisely set out for a machine's tyres in the field could be a tool for minimising soil compaction risk which is another threat to the environment. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy of currently available guidance systems for agricultural machines. Real pass-to-pass errors (omissions and overlaps) in a field were measured. Consequently, comparison between observed guidance systems was made regarding final working accuracy. Further, intensity of machinery passes, percentage of wheeled area and repeated passes in fields were monitored. These measurements were made in fields under real operating conditions using a conventional tillage system with ploughing and also a conservation tillage system, both systems with randomly organized traffic. Finally, the same parameters were monitored in fields where fixed machinery tracks were used for all operations and passes but only under a conservation tillage system. Pass-to-pass accuracy was measured for the evaluation of different guidance systems. Size of missed areas or overlaps was evaluated statistically. Concerning intensity of machinery passes and total field area affected by machinery passes, the following facts were found out. The experiments with randomized traffic showed a significant difference of the parameters mentioned above between a conventional tillage system with ploughing and a conservation tillage system. Wheeled area was 86 and 64\%, respectively which proves benefits of conservation tillage. The experiments with a fixed track system showed that the total run-over area by machinery tyres decreased even more (up to 31\%) in comparison to randomized traffic in a field (only fields under conservation tillage system were monitored and evaluated). The following statements based on our results can be made. The navigation and therefore possibility for better accuracy of machinery passes in fields together with permanent machinery tracks utilization could help with soil condition improvement and also energy savings which would result from that. The CTF system will help with further development of a system for soil compaction protection which is currently a real necessity.",kroulik_proceduressoilfarmingallowing_2011,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Besides the vegetation index and water index extracted from Landsat-8 OLI image, the seasonal difference value of vegetation index based on plant phenology characteristics was proposed in this paper as the optimization of feature variables to analyze the spatial characteristics of vegetation distribution in the coastal wetland of the Yangtze River Estuary. Bassd on the vegetation classifications, the multiple linear regression model combined with the field data was used to estimate the vegetation density of the Spartina alterniflora, which was an invasive species occupying the largest area. It is indicated that the proposed multi-temporal data combined with the optimization of feature variable of random forest model can be used to conveniently analyze the spatially vegetation distributions in wetland.

"Linking Landscape Pattern, Ecosystem Service Value, And Human Well-Being In Xishuangbanna, Southwest China: Insights From A Coupling Coordination Model","{""Hu, Zheneng"",""Yang, Junjie"",""Yang, Xin"",""Yuan, Jie"",""Zhang, Zhuoya""}",NA,"Landscape pattern, ecosystem service value (ESV), and human well-being are closely related. Determining the link between the three is significant to the realization of regional sustainable development. However, the relationship is complex and vulnerable to multiple factors, many of which remain unknown. This study used remote sensing imagery of Xishuangbanna to map land-use in 1996, 2003, 2010, and 2016 and used landscape metrics to quantify landscape pattern changes. This research evaluated changes to ESV using the benefit transfer method and evaluated changes in human well-being using the evaluation index system and the entropy weight method. A coupling coordination model was used to analyze the coupling coordination state of the three, and the grey correlation method was used to determine key factors involved in the coupling mechanism. The results show that: (1) Forest, rubber, and tea are the main land-use types, with the area of forest decreasing, the area of rubber presenting an inverted V-shape change trend, the area of tea presenting an N-shape change trend, and the transformation of a large quantity of forest land into rubber and tea plantations. (2) The landscape pattern has become more fragmented, and connectivity and stability are in decline. (3) Climate regulation, water regulation, and erosion prevention are the main ecosystem services and, from 1996 to 2016, total ESV decreased by 3.53 billion yuan, mainly due to the decrease in forest ESV. Meanwhile, across the region, the area of high value decreased, and the area of median value increased, with a distribution trend of high value in the north and low value in the south. (4) The level of human well-being continues to rise. (5) The link between landscape pattern, ESV, and human well-being was relatively strong, and the coupling coordination degree first increased and then decreased, changing from grudging coordination to primary coordination and then dropping to a state of near maladjustment. Patch density and food production are the key coupling effect factors of landscape pattern and ESV on human well-being, respectively.

Spatiotemporal Variation Of Ndvi In Anhui Province From 2001 To 2019 And Its Response To Climatic Factors,"{""Chang, Zhu"",""Chen, Donghua"",""Chen, Jian"",""Han, Weijie"",""Li, Hu"",""Liu, Saisai"",""Wang, Zuo"",""Ye, Lizao""}",NA,"This paper intends to clarify that the spatial and temporal evolutionary patterns of regional vegetation and their relationship with climate form a premise of ecological conservation and environmental governance, and play an important role in maintaining regional ecosystem balance and promoting sustainable development. Based on measured data collected from NDVI remote sensing products and meteorological stations, NDVI variation in Anhui Province from 2001 to 2019 was determined through trend analysis and measurement methods involving coefficient of variation and Hurst index; in addition, the response to climatic factors was also explored. It was concluded that, firstly, in terms of spatiotemporal analysis, the interannual variation of NDVI in Anhui Province showed an increasing trend with a rate of 0.024/10 a, while the monthly variation showed a weak bimodal pattern, with the highest value in August and the lowest value in January. Furthermore, NDVI in Anhui Province showed significant spatial heterogeneity, with high values concentrated in mountainous regions in southern Anhui and Dabie Mountain region, and low values concentrated in the hilly areas of Jianghuai and areas along the Yangtze River. At the same time, the overall spatial variation of NDVI showed an increasing trend, and the areas with extremely significant and significant improvement in vegetation coverage accounted for 54.69\% of the total area of Anhui Province. Secondly, in terms of the analysis on variation characteristics, the variation of NDVI in Anhui Province was generally stable, with an average CV coefficient of variation of 0.089, which, however, was quite different in different regions; meanwhile, the future trend of NDVI variation in the study areas was mostly in a random manner. Thirdly, the response of NDVI in Anhui Province to climatic factors showed significant spatial heterogeneity. NDVI was found to be positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature; in general, the impact of precipitation on NDVI was greater than that of temperature. In the 19 years studied, NDVI in Anhui Province showed an increasing trend; and climate, topography and human activities led to heterogeneous spatial distribution of vegetation. Therefore, in the future, the evolutionary trend of vegetation will be relatively random, and NDVI will be more greatly affected by temperature, than by precipitation.",han_spatiotemporalvariationndvianhui_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Methods: Doctors and nurses who had regular contacts with HIV patients and the satellite pharmacy were interviewed. The interviews were semi-structured, using open questions and was analysed according to the phenomenographic approach. Results: The respondents perceived the existing co-work between conventional pharmacies and other health care professionals as limited. The availability of the satellite pharmacy enabled the health care professionals to understand the pharmacys' way of working, and to increase trust in the pharmacy staff. Collaboration was hence developed between the professions, leading to a consistent way of informing the patients about their HIV drugs, thereby avoiding contradictory information. The pharmacist also became involved in adherence promoting activities at the clinic. The perceived benefits for the patients were considered to be convenience and preservation of privacy as well as a better basis for safe and appropriate drug utilisation. Conclusion: Conventional pharmacies were shown to have several disadvantages in serving the HIV infected population.

Modeling And Analyzing Supply-Demand Relationships Of Water Resources In Xinjiang From A Perspective Of Ecosystem Services,"{""Li Feng"",""Li Yaoming"",""Liu Tie"",""Xin Qinchuan"",""Yin Zun"",""Zhou Xuewen""}",NA,"Water shortage is one bottleneck that limits economic and social developments in arid and semi-arid areas. As the impacts of climate change and human disturbance intensify across time, uncertainties in both water resource supplies and demands increase in arid and semi-arid areas. Taking a typical arid region in China, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, as an example, water yield depth (WYD) and water utilization depth (WUD) from 2002 to 2018 were simulated using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and socioeconomic data. The supply-demand relationships of water resources were analyzed using the ecosystem service indices including water supply-demand difference (WSDD) and water supply rate (WSR). The internal factors in changes of WYD and WUD were explored using the controlled variable method. The results show that the supply-demand relationships of water resources in Xinjiang were in a slight deficit, but the deficit was alleviated due to increased precipitation and decreased WUD of irrigation. WYD generally experienced an increasing trend, and significant increase mainly occurred in the oasis areas surrounding both the Junggar Basin and Tarim Basin. WUD had a downward trend with a decline of 20.70\%, especially in oasis areas. Water resources in most areas of Xinjiang were fully utilized and the utilization efficiency of water resources increased. The water yield module in the InVEST model was calibrated and validated using gauging station data in Xinjiang, and the result shows that the use of satellite-based water storage data helped to decrease the bias error of the InVEST model by 0.69x10(8) m(3). This study analyzed water resource supplies and demands from a perspective of ecosystem services, which expanded the scope of the application of ecosystem services and increased the research perspective of water resource evaluation.

Our aim was to evaluate the capacity of existing data for seven small mammal species to provide useful inferences for management planning. Location Bathurst and Melville (collectively the Tiwi) Islands, Northern Territory, Australia. Methods We developed species distribution models (SDMs) with generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs) using survey data (351 sites) of small mammals, with two sets of environmental predictors: (a) field-study measurements and (b) available remotely sensed rasters. Predictive capacity of models was evaluated using percentage of deviance explained (\%DE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We used Marxan to evaluate the influence of different model and data types as input for identifying spatial priorities. Results Field-informed SDMs performed well across both modelling methods, with relatively high test AUC values (mean = 0.82, range = 0.64-0.97) and test \%DE (mean = 22.5\%, range = 3.5\%-65.8\%). Remotely sensed models performed relatively poorly, with lower test AUC values (mean = 0.7, range = 0.56-0.86) and lower test \%DE (mean = 8.9\%, range = 0.03\%-24.9\%).

Controlling Established Invaders: Integrating Economics And Spread Dynamics To Determine Optimal Management,"{""Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca S."",""Hastings, Alan""}",NA,"P>We review studies that address economically optimal control of established invasive species. We describe three important components for determining optimal invasion management: invasion dynamics, costs of control efforts and a monetary measure of invasion damages. We find that a management objective that explicitly considers both costs and damages is most appropriate for determining economically optimal strategies, but also leads to large challenges due to uncertainty in components of the management problem. To address uncertainty, some studies have included stochasticity in their models; others have quantified the value of information or focused on decision-making with limited information. Our synthesis shows how invasion characteristics, such as costs, damages, pattern of spread and invasion and landscape size, affect optimal control strategies and goals in systematic ways. We find that even for simple questions, such as whether control should be applied at the centre of an invasion or to satellite patches, the answer depends on the details of a particular invasion.

Yet, in spite of its importance, the Floodplain has been vulnerable to land use change threatening wetland degradation albeit it being a Ramsar Cultural Heritage Site. This study aimed at determining the extent of land use change in the wetland of BFP in the selected years between 1980 and 2020 using Landsat data, then identifying and assessing drivers of land use change using survey data sets. In this study we hypothesized to determine the past and present status and change drivers of unprotected wetlands using a hybrid approach to help guide environment managers on the conservation of wetlands in a holistic manner. It also measured the relationship between drivers of land use change and observed land use changes pattern in the wetland of BFP. The study used an integrated research approach that involved utilizing combined methods of data collection and analysis. Both secondary and primary data sources were used. Primary data was collected using interview schedule, key informants' interviews, Participatory Rural Appraisal and field observations. The Raosoft random sample calculator was used to determine the sample size of heads of households from 9 districts within the margins of Barotse Floodplain. Then, a proportional sample size per district of 270 was calculated. The study found that there was an average land use change of 24.3\% and 0.78 annual change rate in the wetland of BFP in the years of 1984, 1996, 2004 and 2015. The land use classes annual change rates between 1984 and 2015 were: forest/woody vegetation (0.32), grassland (0.07), water (0.02), annually flooded land (0.11) and bare land (0.26). The delineated land cover area classes (forest/woody vegetation, grassland, water, annually flooded land and bare land) have been reducing except for bare land that was increasing in areal coverage. Water class had the greatest negative percentage change (decrease) of 0.04 between 1984 and 2015. While the class of bare land class had greatest positive change (increase) of 8.3 percent in the period of 1984 and 2015.

Therefore, in some years there was excessive rainfall and scant rainfall in other years, which affected hydrology in the wetland and consequently affecting its ecosystem functions. The study found that land use change was driven by climate variability (48.5\%), infrastructure development (20.7\%), technology (7.8\%), demography (18.5\%), and agriculture (4.4\%) using an integrated approach. Other land use changes such as the construction of a road bridge across the floodplain have contributed to wetland deterioration. The study further found that there was a relationship of 0.266 between driving forces of land use change and observed land use changes pattern. Therefore, the study demonstrated and provided new data that indicated the extent of land use change and its drivers using integrated research approach.

A geomorphometric analysis is an important method for the investigation and management of natural resources of watershed. The geomorphometric analysis of Asna river basin classifies three sub-basins that have been delineated using GIS and remote sensing through measurements of linear, aerial, and relief aspects. The Asna river basin comprises an area of 1187km(2) with seventh-order drainage pattern. As per Strahler classification, the upper part of the basin shows dendritic to sub-dendritic and the lower part exhibits parallel to sub-parallel drainage pattern. The total numbers of stream segments are 2422 and length of streams is 2187.92km. The bifurcation value ranges from 1.26 to 5.58 indicating that there are no structural disturbances. The form factor value (0.49) indicates that the shape of the basin is moderately circular. The high values of drainage density, stream frequency, and low infiltration number indicate the high runoff due to impermeable lithology. The slope of the basin varies from 1 to 32.2\%, terrain elevation ranges from 333 to 551m, and overall relief of the basin is 218m amsl. River sub-basin prioritization has an immense importance in natural resource management, especially in semi-arid regions.

Canopy Adjustment And Improved Cloud Detection For Remotely Sensed Snow Cover Mapping,"{""Dozier, Jeff"",""Hill, Alice F."",""Lutz, James A."",""Painter, Thomas H."",""Raleigh, Mark S."",""Rittger, Karl""}",NA,"Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30-40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas. Plain Language Summary Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow-covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can ""see,"" especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite-based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30-40\% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow-mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non-snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow-melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live.",rittger_canopyadjustmentimprovedcloud_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

This study, therefore, aims to propose and evaluate the performance of a new explanatory variable for regionalization, which represents the streamflow formation process and considers the actual evapotranspiration (ETR) obtained from remote sensing products. For this purpose, the regional regression method was used to estimate long-term mean streamflow and minimum flow with 90\% of permanence in time. The explanatory variables were the precipitated volume (Peq), precipitated volume minus the empirical value of 750 mm (Peq(750)), water balance for each segment of the water course (WBeq), and water balance for each hydrologically homogenous region (WBeqM). These variables were obtained using a combination of drainage area, precipitation, and ETR. The ETR was estimated using two remote sensing products: MOD16 and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model. The models of streamflow regionalization were evaluated by statistical, physical, and risk analyses. The study was applied for Grande River basin. All the variables, with the exception of Peq, presented good statistical performance, good representativeness of regionalized streamflows, and safe estimates for the planning and management of water resources. The WBeq(G) was the most recommended variable for streamflow regionalization in Grande River basin, because it considers variations in edaphoclimatic and vegetative conditions along the basin.

Monitoring Needs To Transform Amazonian Forest Maintenance Into A Global Warming-Mitigation Option,"{""Fearnside, P. M.""}",NA,"Two approaches are frequently mentioned in proposals to use tropical forest maintenance as a carbon offset. One is to set up specific reserves, funding the establishment, demarcation, and guarding of these units. Monitoring, in this case, consists of the relatively straightforward process of confirming that the forest stands in question continue to exist. In Amazonia, where large expanses of tropical forest still exist, the reserve approach has the logical weakness of being completely open to ""leakage"": with the implantation of any given reserve, the people who would have been deforesting in the reserve area will probably continue to clear the same amount of forest somewhere else in the region. The second approach is through policy changes aimed at reducing the rate of clearing, but not limited to specific reserves or areas of forest. This second approach addresses more fundamental aspects of the tropical deforestation problem, but has the disadvantages of not assuring the permanence of forest and of not resulting in a visible product that can be convincingly credited to the existence of the project. In order for credit to be assigned to policy change projects, functioning models of the deforestation process must be developed that arc capable of producing scenarios with and without different policy changes. This requires understanding the process of deforestation, which depends on monitoring in order to have information as a time series. Information is needed both from satellite imagery and from on-thc-ground observations on who occupies the land and why the observed changes occur. Monitoring must be done by individual property if causal factors are to be identified reliably; this is best achieved using a database in a Geographical Information System (GIS) that includes property boundaries. Once policy changes arc made in practice, not only deforestation but also the policies themselves must be monitored. Decrees and laws are not the same as changes in practice; the initiation and continued application of changes must therefore be confirmed regularly. The value of carbon benefits from Amazonia depends directly on the credibility and transparency of monitoring. The great potential value of carbon maintenance in Amazonia should provide ample reason for Amazonian countries to strengthen and increase the transparency of their monitoring efforts. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",fearnside_monitoringtransformamazonianforest_1997,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

This study assessed ecohydrological resilience to ecosystem shifts at contrast water-limited and well-watered regions at multiple scales (i.e., country scale, basin scale, climate type scale, and land cover scale) over Africa during the period 1992-2015, based on Standard Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) and water use efficiency (WUE) at ecosystem scales, which was obtained from satellite-derived evapotranspiration (ET) and simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) using the Carnegie-ames-stanford approaches (CASA) model. SEDI values indicated that 11 years were characterized by dry conditions, while 13 were wetter years during 1992-2015. WUE, ET, and GPP values indicated increased tendencies mostly in central to central west of African continent. The ecohydrological resilience exhibited that about 68.78\% of African terrestrial ecosystems were highly, moderately, or slightly resilient, and about 31.22\% were not resilient to ecosystem shifts with 11.28\% vulnerably exposed to high risk of ecosystem shift and severely nonresilient. The extent areas exposed to severe ecohydrological nonresilience are distributed in Savannas and barelands land cover types, temperate-dry summer-hot summer (Csa), climate type, Mediterranean South Coast (B14), African-North interior (B3), and Red Sea-Golf of Aden Coast (b5) basins; and the four countries, namely, Egypt, Mauritania, Niger, and Tunisia. These findings may provide insightful scientific information about vulnerable regions for policy making and ecosystem management and increase the necessary awareness for taking reasonable adaptation mechanisms, such as afforesting open lands to increase the area of vegetation cover (i.e., choosing the drought or wet-tolerant plant species) and water conservation and management measures to ensure the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems under ecosystem shifts over the African continent.",kayiranga_waterefficiencybasedmultiscale_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Spatial Flood Forecasting Modeling Under Lack Of Data Using Rs And Optimized Support Vector Machine: A Case Study Of The Zahedan Watershed,"{""Irandoost, M."",""Jalalkamali, N."",""Mirkazemi, S.

To determine the factors to be included in the model, factors identified in previous studies were prepared using remote sensing and were evaluated by the information gain ratio (IGR) method and the multicollinearity diagnostic test, and ultimately 10 factors with the highest IGR values were chosen as the most effective factors in the region. The flood inventory map was produced by processing the Sentinel-1 satellite data. The gathered data were used to map flood susceptibility maps with the SVM model optimized with IWO and ACO. The prediction accuracy of the models was evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). While both optimization algorithms are effective in improving the performance of SVM, the hybrid of SVM with IWO shows the best performance in terms of statistical measures and Friedman test results.

Estimating The Conservation Value Of Protected Areas In Maritime Canada For Two Species At Risk: The Olive-Sided Flycatcher (Contopus Cooperi) And Canada Warbler (Cardellina Canadensis),"{""Bayne, Erin M."",""Fontaine, Trish"",""Hache, Samuel"",""Mazerolle, Dan"",""Solymos, Peter"",""Staicer, Cindy"",""Westwood, Alana R.""}",NA,"The Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi) and Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) are threatened landbirds in Canada and parts of the U.S. Both species are subjects of recent conservation and management interest. Protected areas are a key tool for managing populations of species at risk, and Canadian national parks may serve as important refuges in an increasingly fragmented landscape. However, the potential role that Canadian national parks may play in the recovery of these species is unclear. We used the Boreal Avian Modelling Project point count database to build Poisson log-linear models using forward stepwise variable selection to predict population density and distribution of these two threatened species in four national parks in Maritime Canada. We also predicted population density in areas of equivalent size in the same ecoregions outside the parks for comparison. Because forested wetlands, a key habitat for these species in this region, are difficult to represent with available spatial data, we tested the effectiveness of different remote sensing products. We tested GIS layers based on aerial photography wetlands (WETLANDS), depth to water table (WETNESS), and WETNESS as interacted with forest cover from aerial photography (WETxFOR). The best-performing models for the Olive-sided Flycatcher used WETxFOR, whereas WETNESS performed best for the Canada Warbler. Anthropogenic disturbance and proximity to roads had a negative effect on predicted density for both species. Protected areas showed slightly higher Olive-sided Flycatcher population densities than nearby areas, but not so for the Canada Warbler. Our results provide the first population density and population size estimates for these species in these parks, and novel information on the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on predicted population density.

To combat the situation, in the past few decades geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing have been widely used by the researchers in the field of wildlife and habitat suitability modeling. The main objective of this study is to map and predict the current and future habitat suitability potential of Rucervus eldii eldii in Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP) using MaxEnt. Presence location data of the species, topographic factors, and bio-climatic variables were used as input in the MaxEnt software to map current habitat suitability potential. To map the habitat suitability potential for future, two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for the years 2050 and 2070 were used. The model returned an average AUC value of 0.944 which indicates the model to be sensitive and descriptive. Isothermality and precipitation in the wettest quarter were found to be two most significant variables. The suitable range of precipitation in the wettest quarter for Rucervus eldii eldii varies from 1365 to 1410 mm with an optimal value of 1405 mm and isothermality from 46.43 to 46.6% with an optimal value of 46.5%. Current habitat suitability results of the model show 0.45 km2 of the area under no potential, 29.25 km2 of the area under least potential, 8.29 km2 of the area under moderate potential, 9.21 km2 of the area under good potential, and 8.82 km2 of the area under high potential.

Uav-Based Partially Sampling System For Rapid Ndvi Mapping In The Evaluation Of Rice Nitrogen Use Efficiency,"{""Chen, Xin"",""Jiang, Rui"",""Laakso, Kati"",""Lan, Yubin"",""Luo, Xiwen"",""Sanchez-Azofeifa, Arturo"",""Wang, Pei"",""Xu, Yan"",""Zhao, Genping"",""Zhou, Zhiyan""}",NA,"Rapid acquisition and mapping of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values is essential for a timely evaluation of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in sustainable agriculture. The zonal nutrient management techniques for sustainable agriculture require timely and efficient NDVI data collection and analysis capabilities, - a need that is still rarely addressed. However, as with the use of manned aircraft, the primary limitation of established unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging technologies is the limited time window for large-area data collection. Furthermore, as the spatial resolution increases, the post-processing time generally becomes longer. To overcome problems associated with the need for rapid data acquisition and post-processing, we have developed a UAV-based sensor system called the Accurate and Speed Scanner (AS-Scanner). The data acquisition accuracy and NDVI mapping speed of the system were assessed. According to the results of a ground-level experiment, the mean absolute error (MAE) between the reflectance data of the AS-Scanner and the corresponding data of the ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer is less than 1.11\%. Furthermore, results of a plot-level experiment suggest that the NDVI values of a raw point cloud from AS-Scanner-based UAV platform (AS-NDVI) and UAV-mounted Mica-Sense RedEdge camera (REG-NDVI) are highly correlated (0.54 < R-2 < 0.57, p < 0.01). In a map-level experiment, the interpolated, 15 m x 15 m pixel size AS-NDVI values were in good agreement with the REG-NDVIs over a 4.01 ha (40100 m(2)) rice field (0.55 < R-2 < 0.65, p < 0.01). The average processing times of the inverse distance weighted (IDW, 0.45 s), kriging linear (KL, 0.73 s), and nearest neighbor (NN, 1.05 s) interpolations of the AS-Scanner data prove that it is possible to efficiently create NDVI maps using data from the sensor. Besides, the effect of the varying solar irradiance values on the AS-NDVIs was analyzed under varied illumination conditions. Moreover, the AS-NDVIs were also used to assess the NUE in a paddy rice field at the panicle stage. The results show that nutrients can be effectively assessed using AS-Scanner data. Despite some disadvantages such as the potential of NDVI value saturation over dense canopies, the AS-Scanner provides a method for quickly obtaining reasonable spatial resolution crop information for agricultural nutrient monitoring and management. This also offers the potential to reduce environmental pressure which may be caused by untimely estimation of NUE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Gis-Based Environmental Database For Assessing The Mine Pollution: A Case Study Of An Abandoned Mine Site In Morocco,"{""Hakkou, R."",""Hanich, L."",""Khalil, A."",""Lepage, M.""}",NA,"Morocco with important mining activities is increasingly concerned about impacts of mining on the environment. In Morocco, there are approximately 200 abandoned mine sites which vary from small scale underground mines to large scale open-pit mines. Some of these mines, with reactive tailings and waste rocks, are problematic. Indeed, Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) pollution from abandoned mines is responsible for soil and water contamination, land resources degradation, changes in landscapes, habitat destruction and human health hazards. In the current case study about the abandoned Kettara mine site, the impact of the old mining activity is assessed by the design and elaboration of an environmental database which will be supported by Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. This database includes multidisciplinary data related to geochemistry, hydrochemistry, hydrology, land cover, geology and climates. The current research demonstrated the efficiency of integrating multidisciplinary data and using GIS technologies when assessing the environmental impact of abandoned mines and forecasting how the pollution is occurred. The obtained results show that in addition to the soil, the surface water and groundwater of the Kettara mine are also contaminated by pollutants which were previously released from mine wastes by AMD action. The sulphate content and the Electrical Conductivity (EC) of the surface water and groundwater are high. The average values for surface water are: sulphate approximate to 7920 mg/L and EC approximate to 256851 mu S/cm. However, in groundwater they are: sulphate approximate to 2088 mg/L and EC approximate to 631 mu S/cm. These values exceed the guidelines for drinking water quality prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) 600 mg/L and 1500 mu S/cm for sulphate and EC respectively. The developed GIS based environmental database will serve as a reference study for other abandoned mine sites. Finally, it will be employed for the establishment of a web-based GIS Decision Support System which will assist decision makers in assessing and monitoring the occurred mine pollution.

Appropriate knowledge of dynamic factors affecting soil erosion is crucial for effective decision-making in watershed management and soil conservation practice. The present study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of annual soil loss (SL) and sediment yield (SY) in the Navroud watershed from the years 2000 to 2018 using remotely-sensed data, GIS-integrated RUSLE Model, and the GIS-based SATEEEC model. For this purpose, models' factors including rainfall erosivity factor (R), crop management factor (C), soil erodibility factor (K), and topographic factor (LS) were prepared. In addition, to boost the performance of the models, the R factor was modified by applying the effect of the snowmelt-runoff erosivity factor (SR). Long-term suspended sediment load records were used to validate the models' results at the outlet of the watershed. RUSLE model showed that mean annual SL rates in the Navroud basin ranged from 0 to over 100 ton ha(-1) year(-1) with average values of 5.39 and 14.95 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and total rainfall-runoff erosivity (TR) factor as the sum of R and SR factors, respectively. However, for the SATEEC model, SL ranged from 0 to 144 and 0 to 461 with slightly higher average values of 6.2, and 16.76 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and TR factor, respectively. In general, the performance of the RUSLE and SATEEC models was low (R-2 = 0.39-0.44, NSE = - 0.05, 0.15) when the R factor was used as the only erosive factor in simulating SL. However, a notably better estimation of SL and SY was observed when the TR factor was used instead of the R factor (R-2 = 0.77-0.75, NSE = 0.33-0.36). It can be concluded that RUSLE showed slightly better results than SATEEC in the Navroud watershed, and also the use of the SR factor in calculating the erosive factor has led to a notable improvement in the models' simulation. In conclusion, these findings highlight not only the need to consider the SR factor in the models' simulation, especially in mountainous regions but these results can also assist in the implementation of effective conservation practices to reduce soil erosion risk in the Navroud watershed.",fallah_assessmentsoilerosionrisk_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The interplay of ecological processes in grasslands secures important ecosystem functions and, thus, ultimately contributes to essential ecosystem services. To sustain, e.g., the provision of fodder or the filter function of soils, agricultural management needs to adapt to site-specific grassland characteristics. Spatially explicit information derived from remote sensing data has been proven instrumental for achieving this. In this study, we analyze the potential of Sentinel-2 data for deriving grassland-relevant parameters. We compare two well-established methods to calculate the aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI), first using a random forest regression and second using the soil–leaf-canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model. Field data were recorded on a grassland area in Brandenburg in August 2019, and were used to train the empirical model and to validate both models. Results confirm that both methods are suitable for mapping the spatial distribution of LAI and for quantifying aboveground biomass. Uncertainties generally increased with higher biomass and LAI values in the empirical model and varied on average by a relative RMSE of 11% for modeling of dry biomass and a relative RMSE of 23% for LAI. Similar estimates were achieved using SLC with a relative RMSE of 30% for LAI retrieval, and a relative RMSE of 47% for the estimation of dry biomass. Resulting maps from both approaches showed comprehensible spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass distributions. Despite variations in the value ranges of both maps, the average estimates and spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass were very similar. Based on the results of the two compared modeling approaches and the comparison to the validation data, we conclude that the relationship between Sentinel-2 spectra and grassland-relevant variables can be quantified to map their spatial distributions from space.

This study quantitatively characterized and estimated field-scale soil salinity using an electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment and a hyperspectral camera installed on a UAV platform. In addition, 30 soil samples (0 similar to 20 cm) were collected in each field for the lab measurements of electrical conductivity. First, the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values measured by EMI were calibrated using the lab measured electrical conductivity derived from soil samples based on empirical line method. Second, the soil salinity was quantitatively estimated using the random forest (RF) regression method based on the reflectance factors of UAV hyperspectral images and satellite multispectral data. The performance of models was assessed by Lin's concordance coefficient (CC), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE).

Synthetic Aperture Radar Image And Its Despeckling Using Variational Methods: A Review Of Recent Trends,"{""Baraha, Satyakam"",""Sahoo, Ajit Kumar""}",NA,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has drawn significant interest from the remote sensing community due to its ability to provide high-resolution images irrespective of weather and illumination conditions. It has numerous applications in a variety of fields, including military surveillance, geological exploration, disaster management, and mapping of natural phenomena like climate change, forest management, and volcanic eruptions. The image acquired by coherent sensors such as SAR is corrupted by granular multiplicative noise, also known as speckle. It has an adverse influence on the visual interpretation of SAR images and prevents the use of various post-processing tasks. Despeckling addresses the removal of such noise from SAR images while preserving the image details. This work provides a brief summary of the theory, applications, speckle statistics, performance measures, and recent developments in despeckling filters using variational methods for SAR images. The primary focus is given to recently proposed despeckling filters, discussing their typical usage, benefits, and drawbacks.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Land Use Changes From Unconventional Gas Development In Public Lands Of The Fayetteville Shale,"{""Cox, A.

Using satellite images and GIS techniques, we measured public land use changes in the Fayetteville Shale, a region in north-central Arkansas that has undergone rapid natural gas development in the last 10 years. These public lands showed less development of gas infrastructure compared to the larger gas field, which is mostly privately owned. Gas activities led to less natural forest loss and edge habitat creation in public lands compared to private lands. However, one large public land property (Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area) showed much more development compared to the overall gas field (about 20\% higher). This disparity was most likely due to differences in regulation and controversial leases that were allowed for this wildlife management area early in the Fayetteville Shale development. These results show that natural gas development can occur around public lands of high conservation value without large land use and habitat impacts, but we suggest such an outcome relies upon effective management practices and wise decision-making by public officials. In the case of Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area, strategic well-pad and pipeline placement could have substantially reduced impact to natural areas.",cox_landunconventionalgasdevelopment_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Quantifying The Sensitivity Of Ephemeral Streams To Land Disturbance Activities In Arid Ecosystems At The Watershed Scale,"{""Bowen, E. E."",""Carr, A. E."",""Grippo, M.

A.""}",NA,"Large areas of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and located in arid regions of the southwestern United States are being considered for the development of utility-scale solar energy facilities. Land-disturbing activities in these desert, alluvium-filled valleys have the potential to adversely affect the hydrologic and ecologic functions of ephemeral streams. Regulation and management of ephemeral streams typically falls under a spectrum of federal, state, and local programs, but scientifically based guidelines for protecting ephemeral streams with respect to land-development activities are largely nonexistent. This study developed an assessment approach for quantifying the sensitivity to land disturbance of ephemeral stream reaches located in proposed solar energy zones (SEZs). The ephemeral stream assessment approach used publicly-available geospatial data on hydrology, topography, surficial geology, and soil characteristics, as well as high-resolution aerial imagery. These datasets were used to inform a professional judgment-based score index of potential land disturbance impacts on selected critical functions of ephemeral streams, including flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitat value, and groundwater recharge. The total sensitivity scores (sum of scores for the critical stream functions of flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitats, and groundwater recharge) were used to identify highly sensitive stream reaches to inform decisions on developable areas in SEZs. Total sensitivity scores typically reflected the scores of the individual stream functions; some exceptions pertain to groundwater recharge and ecological habitats. The primary limitations of this assessment approach were the lack of high-resolution identification of ephemeral stream channels in the existing National Hydrography Dataset, and the lack of mechanistic processes describing potential impacts on ephemeral stream functions at the watershed scale. The primary strength of this assessment approach is that it allows watershed-scale planning for low-impact development in arid ecosystems; the qualitative scoring of potential impacts can also be adjusted to accommodate new geospatial data, and to allow for expert and stakeholder input into decisions regarding the identification and potential avoidance of highly sensitive stream reaches. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",oconnor_quantifyingsensitivityephemeralstreams_2014,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Accuracy Assessment Of National Land Cover Database Shrubland Products On The Sagebrush Steppe Fringe,"{""Gregory, A. J."",""Jenks, J. A."",""Parsons, L.

However, if such geospatial tools and data layers are to be used in management, their accuracy and appropriateness for such use needs to be vetted and validated. We assessed accuracy of two National Land Cover Database (NLCD) shrubland products for use in western South Dakota—percent sagebrush and sagebrush height—by comparing them to ground-truthed data. Western South Dakota sagebrush communities are an ecotone between sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and grassland. This ecotone is typified by shorter- and lower-density sagebrush than interior sagebrush steppe ecosystem. This distinction could make it difficult to remotely detect and map sagebrush in this area. We determined NLCD correlations with ground estimates of sagebrush canopy cover (r = 0.17) and sagebrush height (r = 0.40). The NLCD percent sagebrush accurately predicted sagebrush presence ∼73‒76% of the time once resampled to 100-m pixels and 50-m mean values, respectively. Cohen's kappa values were estimated to determine if the ground-truthed and remoted-sensed data were in agreement when determining sagebrush presence. Kappa values were 0.26 ± 0.06 and 0.28 ± 0.06 for mean values within 50-m and resampled 100-m pixels, respectively, indicating a “fair” level of agreement between the ground-truthed and remote-sensed data types when determining presence of sagebrush. The NLCD data sufficiently described the presence of sagebrush in South Dakota, which is useful for estimating geographic distributions of sagebrush obligate species, species distribution models in which presence or absence of sagebrush is of interest, or mapping the occurrence of sagebrush in South Dakota. Inaccuracies of the NLCD shrubland products in predicting sagebrush height and sagebrush canopy cover may limit their utility as continuous variables in species distribution models, habitat selection, and suitability models or when assessing rangeland quality in South Dakota. © 2019 The Society for Range Management",parsons_accuracyassessmentnationalland_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Such advances have extended the range of possibilities for hydrologists, who are trying to exploit these potentials the most, updating and re-inventing the way hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are carried out. A variety of research fields have progressed significantly, ranging from the evaluation of water features, to the classification of land-cover, the identification of river morphology, and the monitoring of extreme flood events. The description of flood processes may particularly benefit from the integrated use of recent algorithms and monitoring techniques. In fact, flood exposure and risk over large areas and in scarce data environments have always been challenging topics due to the limited information available on river basin hydrology, basin morphology, land cover, and the resulting model uncertainty.

Multi-Structure Joint Decision-Making Approach For Land Use Classification Of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Cnns,"{""Chen, Y."",""Gao, A."",""Pan, J."",""Xu, L.""}",NA,"Land use classification of high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images is a challenging and prominent problem in which pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made amazing achievements. However, single-structured pretrained CNNs have limitations to obtain high classification accuracy. Besides, each pretrained CNNs has different classification ability to classify land use. Therefore, taking advantages of different pretrained CNNs is essential for land use classification. In this study, we propose a novel classification approach based on multi-structure joint decision-making strategy and pretrained CNNs. The basic idea is to apply three CNNs to classify land use separately with the final classification results achieved by joint decision-making strategy. The proposed approach comprises of three steps. First, we create a new fully connected layer and Softmax classification layer. We combine them with the convolutional layers of AlexNet, Inception-v3, and ResNet18. AlexNet also includes the first two layers of fully connected layers. Secondly, we train these designed CNNs to converge by momentum-driven stochastic gradient descent. Thirdly, we utilize joint decision-making strategy to obtain the final prediction results by combining the prediction results of these designed CNNs. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the UC Merced land use, AID, NWPU-45, OPTIMAL-31 datasets and further compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. The benefits of the proposed approach are threefold. First, the multi-structure network maximizes different pretrained CNN structures to extract rich convolution features. Secondly, it could remarkably improve the classification accuracy of indistinguishable land use types of the HRRS images. Thirdly, it has great potential on small dataset with more land use types. The proposed CNN based on multi-structure joint decision approach achieves accurate and reliable land use classification with these benefits. © 2013 IEEE.",xu_multistructurejointdecision_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
A Novel Haze Removal Computing Architecture For Remote Sensing Images Using Multi-Scale Retinex Technique,"{""Pazhani, A. Azhagu Jaisudhan"",""Periyanayagi, S.""}",NA,"One of the major degradation arise in the satellite images is poor weather conditions (i.e., haze). Haze is an environmental distortion which significantly affect and minimize the efficiency of remote sensing image interpretation. To tackle this complication, this research work introduced a new approach named as multi-scale retinex histogram equalization with U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal (MSRHE with U-Net DOPT) scheme. In this scheme, multi-scale retinex technique is applied to eliminate ambient atmospheric light value of inhomogeneous information and retain only object surface reflection but they suffer from dark tone. So, of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization is employed to brighten the image tone with limited contrast level. Then the enhanced image is restored using U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal technique which deeply extract the feature information with dragonfly optimized ReLU activation unit to enhance the system efficiency. This resolved criteria can greatly improve the image efficiency to generate haze-free image. At the same time, the techniques such as dark channel prior (DCP) method, urban remote sensing haze removal (URSHR) method were employed to comparatively analysed with MSRHE with U-Net DOPT. Three parameters such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), feature similarity (FSIM) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed to quantitatively estimate the test (query) result.

An Iot System And Modis Images Enable Smart Environmental Management For Mekong Delta,"{""Pham, Danh Phan Hong"",""Pham, Tran Vu"",""Pham-Quoc, Cuong"",""Phan, Vu Hien"",""Qureshi, Kashif Naseer""}",NA,"The smart environmental management system proposed in this work offers a new approach to environmental monitoring by utilizing data from IoT stations and MODIS satellite imagery. The system is designed to be deployed in vast regions, such as the Mekong Delta, with low building and operating costs, making it a cost-effective solution for environmental monitoring. The system leverages telemetry data collected by IoT stations in combination with MODIS MOD09GA, MOD11A1, and MCD19A2 daily image products to develop computational models that calculate the values land surface temperature (LST), 2.5 and 10 (mu m) particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10) in areas without IoT stations. The MOD09GA product provides land surface spectral reflectance from visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths to determine land cover types. The MOD11A1 product provides thermal infrared emission from the land surface to compute LST. The MCD19A2 product provides aerosol optical depth values to detect the presence of atmospheric aerosols, e.g., PM2.5 and PM10. The collected data, including remote sensing images and telemetry sensor data, are preprocessed to eliminate redundancy and stored in cloud storage services for further processing. This allows for automatic retrieval and computation of the data by the smart data processing engine, which is designed to process various data types including images and videos from cameras and drones. The calculated values are then made available through a graphic user interface (GUI) that can be accessed through both desktop and mobile devices. The GUI provides real-time visualization of the monitoring values, as well as alerts to administrators based on predetermined rules and values of the data. This allows administrators to easily monitor the system, configure the system by setting alerting rules or calibrating the ground stations, and take appropriate action in response to alerts. Experimental results from the implementation of the system in Dong Thap Province in the Mekong Delta show that the linear regression models for PM2.5 and PM10 estimations from MCD19A2 AOD values have correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.68, and RMSEs of 4.11 and 5.74 mu g/m(3), respectively. Computed LST values from MOD09GA and MOD11A1 reflectance and emission data have a correlation coefficient of 0.82 with ground measurements of air temperature.

Identifying Trends In Land Degradation In Non-Equilibrium Rangelands,"{""Bastin, GN"",""Chewings, VH"",""Pickup, G""}",NA,"1. Change in environmental conditions in the complex non-equilibrium rangelands of arid Australia is difficult to monitor. We show how trends in rangeland condition can be identified from changes over time in the pattern of vegetation growth across gradients of differing grazing intensity. 2. Grazing intensity was measured indirectly using distance from water. Vegetation growth was derived from remotely sensed vegetation index values before and after large rainfalls, The amount of growth was adjusted for initial vegetation cover to give a standard measure of vegetation response. 3. A vegetation response ratio was derived by comparing areas less than 4 km from water with benchmark areas further away. Systematic changes in this ratio over time indicate a trend. 4. Ratio values from test areas suggested decline, improvement and no change, consistent with recent management history. 5. The method can be applied where the whole area is affected by grazing and relatively pristine benchmarks are unavailable. It could therefore be useful in the semi-arid rangelands where paddocks are smaller than in the arid part of Australia. It also has possible uses in the rangelands of Africa and the Americas. There is potential for applying the method to traditional grazing systems as well as to commercial pastoralism. 6.

Siamixformer: A Fully-Transformer Siamese Network With Temporal Fusion For Accurate Building Detection And Change Detection In Bi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images,"{""Ghaderi, Foad"",""Mohammadian, Amir""}",NA,"Building detection and change detection using remote sensing images can help urban and rescue planning. Moreover, they can be used for building damage assessment after natural disasters. Currently, most of the existing models for building detection use only one image (pre-disaster image) to detect buildings. This is based on the idea that post-disaster images reduce the model's performance because of the presence of destroyed buildings. In this paper, we propose a siamese model, called SiamixFormer, which uses pre- and post-disaster images as input. Our model has two encoders and has a hierarchical transformer architecture. The output of each stage in both encoders is given to a temporal transformer for feature fusion in a way that query is generated from pre-disaster images and (key, value) is generated from post-disaster images. To this end, temporal features are also considered in feature fusion. Another advantage of using temporal transformers in feature fusion is that they can better maintain large receptive fields generated by transformer encoders compared with CNNs. Finally, the output of the temporal transformer is given to a simple MLP decoder at each stage.

Understanding the proximate and ultimate causes of migration timing, energy allocation and optimization, migration success, and fitness is important to aid the conservation and management of wildlife populations by establishing appropriate protections or managing environmental conditions that influence migration. With recent technological advances and miniaturization of animal-borne electronic tracking devices, as well as ground-, water-, and space-based telemetry infrastructure, researchers have the tools necessary to experimentally test hypotheses central to the mechanics of migrations and individual variation therein. By pairing physiological measurements, molecular analyses, and other approaches within an experimental framework, there is the potential to understand not only how animal migrations function but also what differentiates successful migrations from failed migrations and the associated fitness implications.

Ten landscape indices and nine ecosystem service types were selected to analyze the correlation and construct multiple linear regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate the problem of multi-collinearity in the process of model construction. Results indicate that the highest landscape fragmentation was mainly distributed in the urban-rural fringe, 20-35 km from the urban center, and patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and landscape shape index (LSI) recorded the highest values.

Assessing The Impact Of Dams On Riparian And Deltaic Vegetation Using Remotely-Sensed Vegetation Indices And Random Forests Modelling,"{""Gounaridis, D."",""Symeonakis, E."",""Zaimes, G.

Dams, for example, alter the hydrologic and sediment regimes of rivers and can negatively affect riparian areas and deltas. In order to sustainably manage these ecosystems, it is, therefore, essential to assess and monitor the impacts of dams. To this end, site-assessments and in-situ measurements have commonly been used in the past, but these can be laborious, resource demanding and time consuming. Here, we investigated the impact of three dams on the riparian forest of the Nestos River Delta in Greece by employing multi-temporal satellite data. We assessed the evolution in the values of eight vegetation indices over 27 years, derived from 14 dates of Landsat data. We also employed a modelling approach, using a machine learning Random Forests model, to investigate potential linkages between the observed changes in the indices and a host of climatic and terrestrial predictor variables. Our results show that low density vegetation (0–25%) is more affected by the construction of the dams due to its proximity to anthropogenic influences and the effects of hydrologic regime alteration. In contrast, higher density vegetation cover (50–75%) appears to be largely unaffected, or even improving, due to its proximity to the river, while vegetation with intermediate coverage (25–49%) exhibits no clear trend in the Landsat-derived indices. The Random Forests model found that the most important parameters for the riparian vegetation (based on the Mean Decrease Gini and the Mean Decrease Accuracy) were the distance to the dams, the sea and the river. Our results suggest that management plans of riparian and deltaic areas need to incorporate and take into consideration new innovative management practices and monitoring studies that employ multi-temporal satellite data archives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",zaimes_assessingimpactdamsriparian_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

This study aims to integrate historical biological data collected during ""red tide"" events along the Ecuadorian coast between 1997 and 2017 in relation to five ocean variables derived from satellite remote sensing data to explain the seasonal drivers of coastal processes associated with HABs dynamics. Seasonality of the occurrence of HABs was assessed in relation to oceanographic variables by applying multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to the Ecuadorian central coast (Zone 1) and at the outer and inner Gulf of Guayaquil (Zone 2). Sixty-seven HABs events were registered between 1997 and 2017. From a total of 40 species of phytoplankton identified, 28 were identified as non-toxic and the remaining 12 are well known to produce toxins. Dinoflagellates were the taxonomic group most highly associated with potential HABs events along the entire Ecuadorian coast. HABs appear to be constrained by the Humboldt coastal upwelling, high precipitation, and associated coastal runoff, with higher biomass abundance in the Gulf of Guayaquil than in the central coast. Results from the MCA reveal that in the central Ecuadorian coast (oligotrophic system), toxic HABs occurred with low abundance of dinoflagellates, while in the Gulf of Guayaquil (eutrophic system), toxic HABs corresponded to a high abundance of dinoflagellates. In both cases, high values were found for sea surface temperature, precipitation, and irradiance-characteristic of wet seasons or El Niño years. Non-toxic HABs occurred with a high abundance of dinoflagellates, ciliates, and centric diatoms, corresponding to colder waters and low levels of precipitation and irradiance. These findings confirm that dinoflagellates display several strategies that enhance their productive capacity when ocean conditions are warmer, allowing them to produce toxins at high or at low concentrations. Considering that the Gulf of Guayaquil is essential to tourism, the shrimp industry, fisheries, and international shipping, these findings strongly suggest the need to establish an ecosystem health research program to monitor HABs and the development of a preventive policy for tourism and public health in Ecuador. © 2019 Borbor-Cordova, Torres, Mantilla-Saltos, Casierra-Tomala, Bermúdez, Renteria and Bayot.",borborcordova_oceanographyharmfulalgalblooms_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Soil-Related Predictors For Distribution Modelling Of Four European Crayfish Species,"{""Chețan, M. A."",""Dornik, A."",""Ion, M. C."",""Pârvulescu, L.""}",NA,"One of the most critical challenges in species distribution modelling is testing and validating various digitally derived environmental predictors (e.g., remote-sensing variables, topographic variables) by field data. Therefore, here we aimed to explore the value of soil properties in the spatial distribution of four European indigenous crayfish species. A database with 473 presence and absence locations in Romania for Austropotamobius bihariensis, A. torrentium, Astacus astacus and Pontastacus leptodactylus was used in relation to eight digitalised soil properties. Using random forest modelling, we found a preference for dense soils with lower coarse fragments content together with deeper sediment cover and higher clay values for A. astacus and P. leptodactylus. These descriptors trigger the need for cohesive soil river banks as the microenvironment for building their burrows. Conversely, species that can use banks with higher coarse fragments content, the highland species A. bihariensis and A. torrentium, prefer soils with slightly thinner sediment cover and lower density while not influenced by clay/sand content. Of all species, A. astacus was found related with higher erosive soils. The value of these soil-related digital descriptors may reside in the improvement of approaches in crayfish species distribution modelling to gain adequate conservation measures. © 2021 by the authors.

Development Of A Spectral-Pattern-Analysis-Based Method For Automated Water Body Extraction Using Landsat Image Data: A Case Study In Central Vietnam And Southern Laos,"{""Duong, N. D."",""Hang, L. M."",""Ouyang, Z."",""Tuan, T. A.""}",NA,"Water body mapping is an important application of optical remote sensing. Methods for classifying water bodies using multispectral image data have been successfully developed for water resource monitoring and management. However, in most cases, these traditional methods provide only partial automation capabilities. In this study, we propose a new spectral-pattern-analysis-based (SPAB) method for water body extraction using simplified spectral patterns (SSPs). Simplified spectral patterns are a generalized transformation of spectral patterns from analogue to digital format, realized by nonrepetitive pairwise comparison of reflectance values between two bands. Simplified spectral patterns allow for the direct incorporation of spectral patterns into the recognition process. The advantage of this method compared to traditional methods is that the SPAB method allows automation of water body classification using an SSP database. In this study, we selected a mountainous region in central Vietnam and southern Laos as a study site. Four Landsat 8 OLI scenes from 2015 and four Landsat 7 ETM+ scenes from 2001 and 2002 were used. The results of our proposed method were compared with visual interpretation, normalized differential water index (NDWI) thresholding, and the Global Inland Water (GIW) dataset provided by the Global Land Cover Facility of the University of Maryland. It is concluded that the classification results of the SPAB method agree by more than 98.0% with NDWI results for Landsat 8 OLI images, and by more than 95.0% with the GIW dataset for Landsat 7 ETM+ images. © 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",duong_developmentspectralpatternanalysis_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The movement pattern of the tracked Mongolian gazelles was not regular migration between specific seasonal ranges. The locations of the summer ranges in 2003 and 2004 were similar for all gazelles, but in 2005, when the NDVI values were lower, the animals ranged about 30-70 km farther north, suggesting that the gazelles used areas of similar vegetation availability with former 2 years. The winter ranges were widely separated among years; the longest distance between winter ranges of the same individual in different years was about 340 km. During winter, the NDVI values of the winter ranges of tracked gazelles were almost always higher than or not significantly different from the mean of the 3-year range.

Coffee Certification And Forest Quality: Evidence From A Wild Coffee Forest In Ethiopia,"{""Takahashi, Ryo"",""Todo, Yasuyuki""}",NA,"Shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Assessing The Provisioning Potential Of Ecosystem Services In A Scandinavian Boreal Forest: Suitability And Tradeoff Analyses On Grid-Based Wall-To-Wall Forest Inventory Data,"{""Ruotsalainen, Roope"",""Vauhkonen, Jari""}",NA,"Determining optimal forest management to provide multiple goods and services, also referred to as Ecosystem Services (ESs), requires operational-scale information on the suitability of the forest for the provisioning of various ESs. Remote sensing allows wall-to-wall assessments and provides pixel data for a flexible composition of the management units. The purpose of this study was to incorporate models of ES provisioning potential in a spatial prioritization framework and to assess the pixel-level allocation of the land use. We tessellated the forested area in a landscape of altogether 7500 ha to 27,595 pixels of 48 x 48 m(2) and modeled the potential of each pixel to provide biodiversity, timber, carbon storage, and recreational amenities as indicators of supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ESs, respectively. We analyzed spatial overlaps between the individual ESs, the potential to provide multiple ESs, and tradeoffs due to production constraints in a fraction of the landscape. The pixels considered most important for the individual ESs overlapped as much as 78\% between carbon storage and timber production and up to 52.5\% between the other ESs. The potential for multiple ESs could be largely explained in terms of forest structure as being emphasized to sparsely populated, spruce-dominated old forests with large average tree size. Constraining the production of the ESs in the landscape based on the priority maps, however, resulted in sub-optimal choices compared to an optimized production. Even though the land-use planning cannot be completed without involving the stakeholders' preferences, we conclude that the workflow described in this paper produced valuable information on the overlaps and tradeoffs of the ESs for the related decision support.

European Union's Last Intact Forest Landscapes Are At A Value Chain Crossroad Between Multiple Use And Intensified Wood Production,"{""Angelstam, Per"",""Jonsson, Bengt Gunnar"",""Manton, Michael"",""Mikusinski, Grzegorz"",""Svensson, Johan""}",NA,"Research Highlights: The European Union's last large intact forest landscapes along the Scandinavian Mountain range in Sweden o ff er unique opportunities for conservation of biodiversity, ecological integrity and resilience. However, these forests are at a crossroad between intensified wood production aimed at bio-economy, and rural development based on multi-functional forest landscapes for future-oriented forest value chains. Background and Objectives: We (1) estimate the area of near-natural forests potentially remaining for forest harvesting and wood production, or as green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation and human well-being in rural areas, (2) review how forest and conservation policies have so far succeeded to reduce the loss of mountain forests, and (3) discuss what economic, socio-cultural and ecological values that are at stake, as well as different governance and management solutions. Materials andMethods: First, we estimated the remaining amount of intact mountain forests using (1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory, (2) protected area statistics, (3) forest harvest permit applications and actually harvested forests, (4) remote sensing wall-to-wall data on forests not subject to clear-felling since the mid-1950s, (5) mapping of productive and non-productive forestland, and (6) estimates of mean annual final felling rate. Second, we review policy documents related to the emergence of land use regulation in north Sweden, including the mountain forest border, and illustrate this with an actual case that has had significant policy implementation importance. Results: There is a clear difference between the proportions of formally protected productive forestland above the mountain forest border (52.5\%) and north Sweden in general (6.3\%). A total of 300,000 ha of previously not clear-felled mountain forest outside protected areas remain, which can support novel value chains that are not achievable elsewhere. Conclusions: The mountain forests in Sweden provide unique conservation values in the European Union. Since the beginning of the 1990s, policy regulations have been successful in limiting forest harvesting. Currently, however, mountain forests are a battle ground regarding intensification of forest use, including logging of forests that have never been subject to clear-felling systems vs. nature conservation and wilderness as a base for rural development. The ability of mountain municipalities to encourage sustainable rural forest landscapes must be strengthened.",jonsson_europeanunion'sintactforest_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The potential of such contrasting restorative practices to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision vary over space and time, making the monitoring of FLR programs an emerging challenge. Remote sensing techniques, together with innovative technologies for data acquisition, treatment, and analysis have proven to be strategic for planning and monitoring FLR, yet there are still important un-resolved questions. Here, we evaluated the potential of multispectral orbital images of the high spatial (5 m) and spectral (12 bands) resolution VEN mu S microsatellite, joint project of the Israeli Space Agency and CNES, to classify the spectral behavior and diversity of six tree cover classes (savanna woodlands, old-and second-growth semi-deciduous forests, young restoration plant-ings, and eucalyptus and pine tree monocultures) commonly found in FLR programs in tropical regions. We assessed how these tree cover classes located in a study landscape in southeastern Brazil differ according to their spectral response (winter and summer bands, and vegetation indices), canopy variability (textural features), seasonal behavior (delta layers -difference be-tween summer and winter vegetation indexes), and spectral diversity, and used these attributes as variables to the model. We used the Random Forest algorithm to generate the models and evaluate how the tree cover classes differ in the classification and how the variables supported the model. We achieved high values of global accuracy (91.9\%) and ""F1 score"" (above 0.8) for all tree cover classes, in which second-growth forest presented the lowest accuracy. The textural layers, delta layers, and the spectral diversity layers were the most important attributes to discriminate among tree cover classes. We demonstrate here the potential of using VEN mu S or similar sensor images together with different image processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor FLR programs, allowing further remote sensing approaches and in-deep field assessments to advance evaluation of FLR benefits for nature and people. We demonstrated how the fusion of all these types of data and innovative approaches to data processing, can result in novel ways to assess restoration performance and open new avenues to upscale monitoring, bridging the gap between FLR expectations and achieved goals.",haneda_forestlandscaperestorationspectral_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Although climate change mitigation is expected to decrease AAP, climate policies could increase the cost of clean cooking fuels. Here, we develop a static microsimulation model to project the air pollution-related burden of child stunting in India up to 2050 under four scenarios combining climate change mitigation (2 °C target) with national policies for AAP control and subsidised access to clean cooking. We link data from a nationally representative household survey, satellite-based estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a multi-dimensional demographic projection and PM2.5 and clean cooking access projections from an integrated assessment model. We find that the positive effects on child linear growth from reductions in AAP under the 2 °C Paris Agreement target could be fully offset by the negative effects of climate change mitigation through reduced clean cooking access. Targeted AAP control or subsidised access to clean cooking could shift this trade-off to result in net benefits of 2.8 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.4, 4.2) or 6.5 (UI: 6.3, 6.9) million cumulative prevented cases of child stunting between 2020-50 compared to business-as-usual.

A Market-Based Mechanism For Long-Term Groundwater Management Using Remotely Sensed Data,"{""Kerachian, Reza"",""Noory, Hamideh"",""Safari, Safoura"",""Sharghi, Soroush""}",NA,"Groundwater markets improve the agricultural economy by transferring water entitlements from low-efficient users to high-efficient ones to maximize productivity. Aiming at developing an efficient groundwater market, the environmental effects of the market mechanism should be assessed, and a reliable method for monitoring water consumption needs to be employed. Toward this end, this paper proposes three annual smart groundwater market mechanisms to maximize water net benefits, minimize groundwater withdrawal, and precisely measure water consumption in agricultural fields. To guarantee the aquifer's safe yield in each mechanism, a groundwater simulation model (i.e., Groundwater Modeling System (GMS)) is used to control groundwater table drawdown at the end of the planning horizon. In addition, the fields' evapotranspiration (ET) is estimated using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) algorithm to measure the net groundwater consumption during the market. In this regard, we evaluated the algorithms' performances using observed data from a local lysimeter. They are applied to the Nough plain in Iran to assess the effectiveness of the proposed market framework. The findings illustrate their efficiency in recovering approximately 80\% (23.33 million cubic meters (MCM)) of groundwater loss due to overexploitation in the study area and increasing the users' annual benefits by 10.6\% compared to the non -market condition. In addition, results imply that the METRIC model approximates daily crop ET with a higher accuracy level than the SEBAL model with RMSE, MAE, and Percentage Error of 0.37 mm/day, 0.32 mm/day, and 14.92\%, respectively.

This study aims to develop a cloud software as a service (SaaS) that yields reflectance products in high-resolution Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT)-3/3A satellite images. The SaaS model was designed as three subsystems: a Calibration Processing System (CPS), a Request System for CPS supporting RESTful application programming interface (API), and a Web Interface Application System. Open-source components, libraries, and frameworks were used in this study’s SaaS, including an OpenStack for infrastructure as a service. An absolute atmospheric correction scheme based on a Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer code with atmospheric variable inputs was used to generate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance products. The SaaS implemented in this study provides users with the absolute atmospheric calibration functionality to apply their KOMPSAT-3/3A satellite image set through a web browser and obtain output directly from this service. According to experiments to check the total performance time for images, bundled with four bands of red, green, blue, and near-infrared, it took approximately 4.88 min on average for the execution time to obtain all reflectance results since satellite images were registered into the SaaS.

We sampled epiphytes over 240 trees in 24 sites located in the localities of Horco Molle, El Corte, Yerba Buena and San Miguel de Tucumán. We recorded characteristics of trees (i.e., diameter at breast height [DBH], bark type and number of pruned branches) and sites (distance from the nearest source of epiphyte propagules such as sierra San Javier and urban green spaces, temperature and humidity using satellite images). Significant increases of species richness and cover of epiphytes were recorded with tree DBH and rough barks. Both features are important for vascular epiphyte establishment because they allow more surface and time available for colonization and a rough bark accumulates water and organic matter. In addition, epiphyte richness increased in trees closer to Sierra de San Javier, and in sites with lower temperature and higher humidity. The locality of Horco Molle, closer to sierra de San Javier, had a different composition of epiphytes compared to the other localities. Interactions between host trees and vascular epiphytes were similar to those observed in pristine forests of sierra de San Javier.

Landsat images are currently one of the most important image data sources for remote sensing inversion. As a result of changes in time and weather conditions in single-view images, varying image radiances are acquired; hence, using a monthly or annual time scale to mosaic multi-view images results in strip color variation. In this study, the NDWI and MNDWI within 50 km of the coastline of the Yucatán Peninsula from 1993 to 2021 are used as the object of study on GEE platform, and mosaic areas with chromatic aberrations are reconstructed using Landsat TOA (top of atmosphere reflectance) and SR (surface reflectance) images as the study data. The DN (digital number) values and probability distributions of the reference image and the image to be restored are classified and counted independently using the random forest algorithm, and the classification results of the reference image are mapped to the area of the image to be restored in a histogram-matching manner. MODIS and Sentinel-2 NDWI products are used for comparison and validation. The results demonstrate that the restored Landsat NDWI and MNDWI images do not exhibit obvious band chromatic aberration, and the image stacking is smoother; the Landsat TOA images provide improved results for the study of water bodies, and the correlation between the restored Landsat SR and TOA images with the Sentinel-2 data is as high as 0.5358 and 0.5269, respectively.

We used a novel integrated framework to separate the impacts of natural factors (e.g. drought, precipitation and temperature) from those of anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity) on vegetation cover change at the watershed scale. We also integrated several datasets including satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements for a twenty-year time period (2000–2019). Our results show that despite no significant trend being observed in temperature and precipitation, vegetation indices expressed an increasing trend at both the control and treated watersheds. The vegetation cover was not significantly affected by the natural factors whereas the watershed management practice (as a human activity) had significant impacts on vegetation change in the long-term. Further, the vegetation cover long-term response to watershed management practice was mainly linear. We also found that the vegetation indices values in the 2011–2019 period (as the treated period in treated watershed) were significantly higher than those in the 2000–2010 period. In the short-term, however, the drought condition and decreased precipitation (as natural factors) explained the majority of the change in vegetation cover. For example, the majority of the breakpoints occurred in 2008, and it was related to a widespread extreme drought in the area.

Although the latter method along with the use of GIS/Remote Sensing has become very popular, its main limitations are the lack of model validation and lack of comparison of modeled rates with acceptable soil loss tolerance values. In this study, soil erosion rates of six sub-catchments were calculated with the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) following five different methods in GIS/RS environment and then compared with field-based measurements for verification. The mean modeled soil erosion rates of the six sub-catchments were within 0.12 and 7.70 t ha(-1) y(-1), whereas the field-based rates range from 1.14 to 15.83 t ha(-1) y(-1). Moreover, modeled erosion classes within the sub-catchments were similar to field-based localized erosion rates over different land use types quantified from plot experiments. Hence, we recommend the integration of RUSLE with GIS/RS as an effective tool for soil erosion hazard mapping at the catchment scale. We propose a typical rate of 1 t ha(-1) y(-1) and an upper limit of 2 t ha(-1) y(-1) as the soil loss tolerance level for the study area based on experimentally derived soil production rates. Finally, a soil erosion map of the entire Upper Mahaweli River Catchment was developed using the best method, and then its sub-catchments were ranked according to severity of soil erosion. The methodology adapted here can be used as a guide in land management and soil conservation programs.",somasiri_adaptationreviseduniversalsoil_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Evaluating The Ability To Use Contextual Features Derived From Multi-Scale Satellite Imagery To Map Spatial Patterns Of Urban Attributes And Population Distributions,"{""Bedada, Adane"",""Chao, Steven"",""Engstrom, Ryan"",""Mann, Michael""}",NA,"With an increasing global population, accurate and timely population counts are essential for urban planning and disaster management. Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (<2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral signatures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R-2 values up to 93\%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84\% of the out-of-sample variation for population density.",chao_evaluatingabilitycontextualfeatures_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

S."",""Sales Lima, P. V. P."",""de Carvalho Oliveira, A.""}",NA,"Purpose: Social policies for accessing water during droughts have contributed to coexisting with dry periods. One of these policies involves the construction of cisterns through the “Um Milhão de Cisternas” Program (P1MC) and the “Uma Terra e Duas Águas” Program (P1+2). To comprehend the effects of P1+2, this study aims to assess its impacts on the quality of life and environmental sustainability of beneficiaries compared to non-beneficiaries. Method/design/approach: The research was conducted in the municipalities of Canindé and Itapiúna, Ceará, and data were collected through questionnaires administered to P1+2 beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. From the data, the Quality of Life Index (QLI) and the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) were calculated for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Results and conclusion: The QLI of beneficiaries was lower than that of non-beneficiaries, suggesting a need for greater monitoring of beneficiaries and potential adaptations. The ESI was higher for beneficiaries, indicating some effect of the program on environmental sustainability. The low ESI for beneficiaries highlights weaknesses in the context of water security in the semiarid region.

The research reported here is a feasibility study designed to explore the method. In this proof-of-concept study, we illustrate the approach using specific observational datasets from the U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's Southern Great Plains site in the central United States, but the method is quite general and is readily applicable to other datasets. The total sky image (TSI) camera observations are used to determine the prior distribution. A regression model and the active remote sensing of clouds (ARSCL) radar/lidar observations are used to determine the likelihood function. The posterior estimate is a probability density function (pdf) of the CF whose mean is taken to be the optimal blend of the two observations. The data at hourly, daily, 5-day, monthly, and annual time scales are considered. Some physical and probabilistic properties of the CFs are explored from radar/lidar, camera, and satellite observations and from simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5). Our results imply that (a) the Beta distribution is a reasonable model for CF for both short- and long-time means, the 5-day data are skewed right, and the annual data are almost normally distributed, and (b) the Bayesian method developed successfully yields a pdf of CF, rather than a deterministic CF value, and it is feasible to blend the TSI and ARSCL data with a capability for bias correction.

Cooling Effect Of Urban Green And Blue Infrastructure: A Systematic Review Of Empirical Evidence,"{""Chang, Q."",""Liu, X."",""Su, W."",""Zhang, L.""}",NA,"Urban green and blue infrastructure (GBI) plays an extremely important role in regulating urban climate and assisting cities to cope with future climate change and enhance urban resilience. This paper presents a comprehensive review of urban green and blue infrastructure researches on cooling effect trends and hotspots, and the distribution of cooling effect studies in different climatic zones. Most studies focused on surface types and configurations, urban parks and water bodies, roof greening (building energy conservation), ecological benefits, thermal comfort, plant communities, etc. through remote sensing imagery, ground measurement, and comprehensive simulation. Most studies were influenced by the research field (perspective) and the research scale dependence of urban green and blue infrastructure cooling effect was extremely obvious. Based on the Koppen climate classification, the research methods, indicators and key issues are different at scale level. Through the analysis of cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure and its influencing factors from the landscape, patch (corridor) and community scale, we found that the cooling effect was mainly affected by the proportion of ecological land, landscape pattern (landscape scale); patch area, underlying surface type (patch scale); and plant configuration, single plant (community scale), etc. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and the results showed that, on average, a park was 1.39 °C cooler in temperate climate zone and 3.12 °C cooler in continental climate zone. On this basis, this paper summarizes three challenges in the future research on the cooling effect of urban green and blue infrastructure based on the practical needs of urban planning and design: (1) The cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure on city and block scale should be connected to determine key heat mitigation parameters of GBI planning and design, and furthermore provide quantitative indicators for urban green space system planning; (2) The multi-dimensional of the horizontal distribution and vertical transmission spaces on the cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure studies should be integrated, and the characteristics of blocks should be combined to determine the cooling threshold for guiding and optimizing the distribution of GBI in regulatory detailed planning; (3) The pivotal indicators and thresholds of each plant or plant community configurations in heat mitigation should be determined for guiding the plant cooling design on site scale. Further multi-scale and multi-dimensional research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the planning and design of urban green and blue infrastructure in urban growth strategies, and warrants greater consideration in urban planning policy to mitigate the adverse effects of the urban heat islands and enhance climate resilience. © 2021 Science Press.

In this study, we propose a river segmentation model in remote sensing images based on composite attention network to solve the problems of abundant river details in images and the interference of non-river information including bridges, shadows, and roads. To improve the segmentation efficiency, a composite attention mechanism is firstly introduced in the central region of the network to obtain the global feature dependence of river information. Next, in this study, we dynamically combine binary cross-entropy loss that is designed for pixel-wise segmentation and the Dice coefficient loss that measures the similarity of two segmentation objects into a weighted one to optimize the training process of the proposed segmentation network.

The National Wetlands Inventory is the most commonly used data source for this information. However, its accuracy is limited in some contexts, such as agricultural and forested wetlands. An large number of studies have mapped wetlands worldwide from the perspective of land use and land cover change. However, information on the actual wetland planting areas annually is limited, which greatly impacts ongoing research. In this case study of the West Songnen Plain, we developed a simple algorithm for the quick mapping of wetlands by utilizing their unique physical features, such as annual display of phenological land-cover change of exposed soils, shallow flooding water, and plants from multi-temporal Landsat images. Temporal variations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) derived from Landsat images in 2010 for wetlands at different growth stages were analyzed. Results show that during the ante-tillering phase, the NDVI value (above zero) is lower than the LSWI value of paddies because of flooding of shallow water; during the reproductive and ripening phases, the NDVI value is higher than the LSWI value (above zero); and during the post-harvest wetland planting phase, the NDVI value is still higher than the LSWI value, but the LSWI value is negative. Wetland areas can be detected using one or two images in the optimum time window. The algorithm based on the difference of NDVI and LSWI values derived from Landsat images was used to extract the actual wetland planting area. Validated alongside statistical data, the algorithm showed high accuracy. Therefore, this algorithm highlights the unique features of wetlands and can help in mapping the actual wetland area annually on a regional scale. Results further indicate that the new method has a classification accuracy of 92 \%.

Special emphasis on the use of scientifically derived marine fishery advisories (MFAs) can have multiple co-benefits with the utilization of nature-based solutions (NbS) for monitoring and management of coastal and marine resource bases. Such co-management options can be effective to realize the targets for Sustainable Development Goals 14 (SDG 14) for 2030. At present, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) provides the MFAs on a daily basis by using a combination of data from satellite imageries and ground-based datasets. However, sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems services needs to be informed by appropriate technological models of resources usage, including the incorporation of coastal zone management plans as per NbS frameworks for achieving long-term successes.

How Safe Is The Safety Paradigm?,"{""Arah, O. A."",""Klazinga, N. S.""}",NA,"This paper reviews safety initiatives in the health systems of the UK, Canada, Australia, and the US. Initiatives to tackle safety shortcomings involve public-private collaborations. Patient safety agencies (to institute learning, action and safety culture), adverse event reporting and, to a lesser extent, safety related performance indicators are currently used to design safer health systems. Their benefits are mixed, but there is little debate as to their possible side effects. Foreseeable adverse effects of multiple safety organisations stem from them being too many, too vague, too narrowly focused, threatened by the medical practice environment, and too optimistic. Safety related performance indicators are most developed in the US but suffer from inadequacies of administrative data, underreporting, variable indicator definitions, ""extended"" use, and low sensitivity of the diagnosis coding system, and arguable preventability of the prescribed conditions. A critical appraisal of the implications of these deficiencies is important to assure the safety of current health system safety initiatives and to establish evidence based safety. It is necessary to embed health system safety (as well as patient safety) in the societal culture, structures, and policies which promote effective, user centred, high performance care while allowing for healthy innovation.",arah_safesafetyparadigm_2004,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Extracting Tea Plantations Based On Zy-3 Satellite Data,"{""Jin, Z."",""Sun, R."",""Xu, W.""}",NA,"Tea is the most consumed natural plant drink in the world, and it plays an important role in human's daily life. The spatial distribution information of tea plantation is helpful for the government management and decision-making. Songyang county is located in southwest part of Zhejiang province, China, and the topography is characterized by basin in the central and surrounded by hills and mountains. The humid and cloudy climate is very suitable for tea planting, which accounts for the large proportion of tea plantation area, 68.5% of county's whole cultivated land. In this paper, ZhangXi Town, ZhaiTan Town, YeCun Town and ZhuYuan Town of SongYang County in Zhejiang Province were chosen as study area, and ZY-3 satellite images acquired on December 25, 2012 and June 9, 2013 were used to study the method of tea plantations extraction. Eight categories including roads, water, buildings, shadows, bare soil, forest, other crops and tea plantation were identified after conducting visual interpretation and field surveys. The decision tree method was adopted to extract the tea plantations. Due to the fact that tea plants in plain areas and mountains areas show different characteristics in their planting patterns, planting area and growth status,, the decision trees were built separately for these two different areas. The threshold values in the decision tree were determined by gradually changing their values in a certain range. Spectral curve analysis shows the range of the difference between band4 (0.77-0.89 μm) and band3 (0.63-0.69 μm) on December 25, 2012 is 20-30. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is almost unchanged or decreased from summer to winter for forest lands as they are covered mainly by evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, bamboo forest and mixed forest. As for tea plant, due to its seasonal harvest and pruning in summer, NDVI in summer is a little lower than that in winter and the threshold value of NDVI difference between summer (June 9, 2013) and winter (December 25, 2012) was 0~0.1.As tea plants are terraced planted along the contour in mountain area, texture features characterized with nearly parallel line trend for tea plantations are presented in the image. The panchromatic data on December 25, 2012 was used to derive texture features. Anisotropic strength with a range of 0 to 1 was obtained after conducting the anisotropic strength algorithm. The classification results with different threshold values were compared with region-of-interest data and threshold values with the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were selected as final threshold. For plain areas, the difference between band4 and band3 was used to roughly exclude roads, water, buildings, bare soil, other crops and part of the forest from tea plantations with the value above 26.Then the threshold value of 0 for NDVI difference between summer and winter was adopted to exclude the remaining forest. Spectral feature and textural feature were both used to extract tea plantations in mountainous areas. The threshold value of 20 for band4 and band3 difference and 0 for NDVI difference between summer and winter were firstly adopted to exclude water, buildings, crops, roads, bare soil and part of forest. And the threshold of 0.35 for anisotropic strength was then adopted to exclude the remaining forest. The classification maps were validated with ground verification data and compared with results derived from neural network (NN) classification. The results show that decision tree method combining with spectral and textural information can significantly improve the classification accuracy. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient in the plain area were 95.00% and 0.85, respectively, increased by 5.46% and 0.19 when compared with NN classification. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient in the mountain area were 92.97% and 0.69, respectively, increased by 7.57% and 0.61 when compared with NN classification.

However, accelerating human-pressures on mangrove forests are resulting in the loss of key mangrove ecosystem services. In this paper, we assessed spatial-temporal changes in the extent and width of fringe mangroves, and changes in adjacent land use. The study focused on the Kien Giang Province, Vietnam, for the period 1989-2009. The total mangrove extent was estimated at seven points in tithe using four Landsat TM images (1989, 1992, 2003, and 2006) and three SPOT images (1995, 2003 and 2009). Supervised classification was conducted for image classification and mapping changes using a Maximum Livelihood Classifier approach. Changes in mangrove width were calculated for 2003 and 2009 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis Application. An assessment of the four Landsat TM images showed a significant decrease in mangrove extent for the periods 1989-1992 (-2.7\% yr(-1)) and 2003-2006 (-2.1\% yr(-1)), while a significant increase in mangrove extent was observed during 1992-2003 (0.7\% yr(-1)). SPOT images were used to classify shoreline land cover into four types, namely mangroves; shrimp farms; built-up areas; and bare and wet ground areas. The total loss of fringe mangrove extent was significantly correlated with the increase in extent of other land covers, especially shrimp farms and bare and wet ground, during the period of 2003-2009. The overall accuracy assessment of the classification using 2003 and 2009 SPOT 5 images was 90.1\% and 90.5\% respectively. The overall accuracy assessment of the 2003 Landsat image was 92.1\%. This accuracy in classification of mangroves and non-mangroves showed that use of Landsat images was adequate for assessing spatial-temporal mangrove dynamics when higher spatial resolution satellite images were limited. The results highlight the dynamic nature of fringe mangrove communities in the region, and provide data useful for informing shoreline mangrove rehabilitation, conservation efforts, and national monitoring programs for estimating mangrove values of carbon sequestration and shoreline protection functions in Vietnam.

In this framework, this study examines the effects of peri-urban forest fires on atmospheric chemical composition, and aerosol physical-optical properties in Athens, Greece, during August 2021. Satellite imagery and air mass trajectories showed advection of intense smoke plumes over Athens from three forest fires persisting for 10 days in the greater Athens area and in Central Greece (Euboea). During August 1–20, 2021, daily PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 8.9 to 78.7 μg m−3, and were associated with high OC levels (2.3–27.8 μg m−3), while BC and BCbb concentrations on smoke-impacted days were 2.6 μg m−3 and 1.0 μg m−3, respectively (2–3 times higher than August mean levels). During the peak of biomass burning (BB) smoke transport over Athens, daily-average scattering and absorption coefficients at short wavelengths maximized at 313 Mm−1 and 171 Mm−1, respectively. There was also a large impact of ambient BrC (brown carbon) absorption (60 Mm−1), while the OC/EC ratio exhibited characteristically low values (3–4), linked to flaming combustion (modified combustion efficiency of 0.97–0.99). The absorption Ångström exponent (1.38) and single scattering albedo (0.74) indicated highly absorbing BB aerosol, deviating from the normal summer patterns. BB-tracers like nss–K+ displayed strong correlations with OC, EC and BC concentrations, as well as with scattering and absorption coefficients. However, forest fires drastically modified the levels of additional chemical species, with enhancements observed for Ca2+, NO3−, Cl−, and for organic aerosol (OA) components such as BBOA and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA).

We contrast these scenarios with the more pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario. Ensemble simulations for the year 2000 are consistent among models and show a reasonable agreement with surface ozone, wet deposition, and NO2 satellite observations. Large parts of the world are currently exposed to high ozone concentrations and high deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems.

Only the progressive MFR scenario will reduce ozone, by -2.3 +/- 1.1 ppb. Climate change is expected to modify surface ozone by -0.8 +/- 0.6 ppb, with larger decreases over sea than over land. Radiative forcing by ozone increases by 63 +/- 15 and 155 +/- 37 mW m(-2) for CLE and A2, respectively, and decreases by -45 +/- 15 mW m(-2) for MFR.

We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) shifts toward earlier sowing of wheat throughout much of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, with insignificant changes in Punjab. A production-weighted average of the entire region indicates that, on average, wheat was sown 1 week earlier by 2010 than it was at the beginning of the decade. Using previously published experimental estimates of yield gains from earlier sowing, we estimate that an overall yield gain of at least 5\% averaged across India can be explained by the sow date trend. Given that national yield changes since 2000 have been less than 5\%, our results indicate that the sow date shift has been a major factor in yield changes over the past decade, and that the net yield effect of all factors other than sow date has been close to zero, perhaps even negative. The results also indicate that sow dates in much of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are nearing or already at the optimum window for yields, so that yield benefits from sow date shifts will likely diminish in the next decade.

Biodiversity Mapping,"{""Hazen, H.""}",NA,"The term 'biodiversity mapping' encompasses a variety of techniques and methodological approaches in identifying and analyzing patterns in plant and animal distributions. Biodiversity mapping is usually a precursor to attempts to protect biodiversity, and is often undertaken in efforts to assess the conservation value of different areas. Usually this work is done to provide a means of prioritizing one area over another for protection. Methods of assessing conservation value are highly contested and have led to several distinct approaches to biodiversity mapping. Traditionally, conservation approaches have typically been focused at the species level. In light of the complex interconnections within and between ecosystems, however, many conservation practitioners are turning toward habitat- or landscape-level approaches, and making increasing use of cartographic techniques to assist with data representation and decision - making - biodiversity mapping. Recent developments in geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing have assisted this shift by facilitating the compilation and analysis of large amounts of complex spatial data. Despite these advances, a lack of sound baseline data remains one of the major challenges in biodiversity mapping. Most biodiversity maps must, therefore, rely on proxy measures of biodiversity to cover these data gaps. Considerable controversy exists over how best to select such proxies and how to deal with error and uncertainty more broadly in biodiversity mapping projects. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Burned Area Mapping For Heilongjiang Basin Based On Modis Time Series Data,"{""Jiang, X."",""Yang, W."",""Zhang, S.""}",NA,"Fire is an important natural disturbance that affects several ecosystems and is also one of the main factors of the terrestrial carbon cycle. As fire modifies the structure and composition of vegetation, it is considered to be an important land management tool. Burned area mapping is an essential step in forest fire research to investigate the relationship between forest fire and climate change and the effect of forest fire on carbon budgets. Traditional data collection of forest fires in field-which are statistically recorded are difficult to manipulate over a large area. The development of the remote sensing technique provides a labor-efficient method for research of land surface processes. At the regional or global scale, in order to obtain a long-time series of burned area maps, a moderate spatial resolution with high temporal resolution remote sensing data is considered as the best alternative. Currently, the most widely used remote sensing data are Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Although the AVHRR provides continuous observations for burned area analyses, some studies have identified several sources of potential errors in burned area discrimination from this sensor, mainly due to its radiometric instability, cloud obscuration, and transmission problems. Most of these problems have been notably reduced in the MODIS sensor, which offers greater spectral, spatial, and radiometric resolution than the AVHRR. This study proposes an algorithm to map areas burned by forest fire using MODIS time series data in Heilongjiang Valley, China. The algorithm is divided into two steps: First, the “core冶pixels were extracted to represent the most possible burned pixels based on a comparison of the temporal change of the Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), the Burned Area Index (BAI), and the MODIS active fire products between pre-and post-fire spatial patterns. Second, a 15-km distance was set to extract the entire burned area near the “core"" pixels. These more relaxed conditions were used to identify the fire pixels for reducing the omission error as much as possible. The algorithm comprehensively considered the thermal characteristics and the spectral change between pre-and post-fire spatial patterns, which were represented by the MODIS fire products and the spectral index, respectively. Heilongjiang province in China was selected as the typical study area to validate the accuracy of the algorithm. The results showed that with the use of the MODIS fire products, the accuracy of the algorithm was improved, with an overall accuracy of 71% and a highest accuracy of 84%. Consequently, the algorithm used in this study produced a long-time series of burned area maps of the study area from 2000 to 2011 with a relatively high accuracy. According to the burned area maps, the study area has been seriously affected by fire disasters on average of 0.53 million ha of burned land each year. The most affected years were 2003 and 2008 with burned areas exceeding 1 million ha. The least affected year was 2010 with a burned area of just 0.18 million ha. The relatively large disparity between the maximum and minimum values of the areas burned by forest fire indicates that there is a fluctuation in the severity of disaster during the studied period. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

Sustainability Of Groundwater,"{""Castilla-Rho, J."",""El-Kadi, A. I."",""Elshall, A. S."",""Holley, C."",""Mutongwizo, T."",""Sinclair, D."",""Ye, M.""}",NA,"Groundwater fills and flows in the pore-space, fractures, and conduits of geological formations beneath the Earth’s surface, called aquifers. Groundwater is the Earth’s largest non-frozen freshwater reservoir, accounting for more than 97% of the liquid freshwater stock. Groundwater is the world’s most extracted natural resource with withdrawal rates in the range of 1000km3/year, and about 70% of the pumped groundwater is used for agriculture worldwide. Groundwater is a reliable freshwater resource that moves slowly in the aquifer, providing vital benefits for billions of people worldwide. Groundwater supplies more than half of the drinking water; helps to grow food by supplying approximately 40% of irrigation water; accounts for about one third of freshwater supply for industrial activities; and supports groundwater dependent ecosystems in aquifers, soil, rivers, lakes, wetlands, coastal zones, and marine environments, providing numerous ecosystem services. In addition, groundwater is a geothermal energy resource, which can be used for heating and cooling in urban heat islands as an example. Moreover, groundwater can generally serve as a manageable buffer to droughts, surface water seasonal variations, and floods. However, there are growing concerns over unsustainable groundwater pumping exceeding natural and induced recharge along with groundwater contamination and salinization, and degradation of groundwater dependent ecosystems. For example, more than half of the largest aquifers on Earth are being depleted, given estimates derived from the GRACE satellite mission (Richey et al., 2015). In addition, sustainable management of groundwater resources is critical for climate adaptation strategies, as climate change and variability drive the aquifer recharge, and can change groundwater use. As the world population is nearing 8 billion, these essential benefits and growing concerns call for an action to ensure groundwater sustainability (Gleeson et al., 2019). This article shows that understanding the coupled water-ecology-human system in a participatory water governance framework is critical for sustainable groundwater management.

This land-based remote sensing technology can provide, in near-real time, fine-resolution maps of the surface circulation over broad coastal areas, along with reliable directional wave and wind information. The main goal of this work is to showcase the current status of the Mediterranean HFR network and the future roadmap for orchestrated actions. Ongoing collaborative efforts and recent progress of this regional alliance are not only described but also connected with other European initiatives and global frameworks, highlighting the advantages of this cost-effective instrument for the multi-parameter monitoring of the sea state. Coordinated endeavors between HFR operators from different multi-disciplinary institutions are mandatory to reach a mature stage at both national and regional levels, striving to do the following: (i) harmonize deployment and maintenance practices; (ii) standardize data, metadata, and quality control procedures; (iii) centralize data management, visualization, and access platforms; and (iv) develop practical applications of societal benefit that can be used for strategic planning and informed decision-making in the Mediterranean marine environment. Such fit-for-purpose applications can serve for search and rescue operations, safe vessel navigation, tracking of marine pollutants, the monitoring of extreme events, the investigation of transport processes, and the connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems.

Multi-Algorithm Comparison For Predicting Soil Salinity,"{""Biswas, Asim"",""Ding, Jianli"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wang, Fei"",""Yang, Shengtian""}",NA,"Soil salinization is one of the most predominant processes responsible for land degradation globally. However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30\% overall samples) at three depths, 010 cm, 1030 cm, 3050 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lins concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 010 cm and 1030 cm depths, whereas for the 3050 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m-1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m-1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m-1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.",wang_multialgorithmcomparisonpredicting_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Using emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance from England and France, we describe changes in human health indicators during periods of particularly poor AQ in London and Paris during 2014. Methods Using daily AQ data for 2014, we identified three periods of poor AQ affecting both London and Paris. Anonymised near real-time ED attendance syndromic surveillance data from EDs across England and France were used to monitor the health impact of poor AQ. Using the routine English syndromic surveillance detection methods, increases in selected ED syndromic indicators (asthma, difficulty breathing and myocardial ischaemia), in total and by age, were identified and compared with periods of poor AQ in each city. Retrospective Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to identify significant increases in ED attendance data on days with (and up to 3 days following) poor AQ. Results Almost 1.5 million ED attendances were recorded during the study period (27 February 2014 to 1 October 2014). Significant increases in ED attendances for asthma were identified around periods of poor AQ in both cities, especially in children (aged 0-14 years). Some variation was seen in Paris with a rapid increase during the first AQ period in asthma attendances among children (aged 0-14 years), whereas during the second period the increase was greater in adults. Discussion This work demonstrates the public health value of syndromic surveillance during air pollution incidents. There is potential for further cross-border harmonisation to provide Europe-wide early alerting to health impacts and improve future public health messaging to healthcare services to provide warning of increases in demand. © Crown copyright 2018.

Quantitative analysis of LULC change is important for studying the corresponding impact on the ecosystem service value (ESV) that helps in decision-making and ecosystem conservation. Based on LULC data retrieved from remote-sensing interpretation, we computed the changes of ESV associated with the LULC dynamics using the benefits transfer method and geographic information system (GIS) technologies during the period of 1992-2018 following self-modified coefficients which were corrected by net primary productivity (NPP). This improved approach aimed to establish a regional value coefficients table for facilitating the reliable evaluation of ESV. The main objective of this research was to clarify the trend and spatial patterns of LULC changes and their influence on ecosystem service values and functions. Our results show a continuous reduction in total ESV from United States (US) \$1476.25 million in 1992, to US \$1410.17, \$1335.10, and \$1190.56 million in 2001, 2009, and 2018, respectively; such changes are attributed to a notable loss of farmland and forest land from 1992-2018. The elasticity of ESV in response to changes in LULC shows that 1\% of land transition may have caused average changes of 0.28\%, 0.34\%, and 0.50\% during the periods of 1992-2001, 2001-2009, and 2009-2018, respectively.

Remotely sensed data offer a viable opportunity for detecting and mapping AIPs spatial extents. Hence, this study sought to compare the value of algorithms (i.e. maximum likelihood and random forest) in detecting and mapping C.odorata's spatial distribution in relation to other land use land cover classes (LULC) using the freely available Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. The findings of the study revealed that the vegetation red edge and near-infrared spectral bands of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI) sensor were the most important spectral variables for discriminating C.odorata from other land cover classes. The random forest algorithm yielded the highest overall classification accuracy of 83\%, outperforming the traditional maximum likelihood classifier (75\%) in classifying C.odorata's spatial distribution.

A neural network classification was used to achieve sufficient land cover accuracy. The land cover change analysis revealed an expansion of forestland at the expense of pastureland and abandoned rainfed cropland. These changes were associated with demographic and economic shifts that resulted from a continuous process of rural abandonment. Population reduction has been the natural trend for a century, characterized by massive internal migrations to nearby cities. The dynamic displacement of the population centroid was used to identify the migratory processes in the last century.

Quantifying Aboveground Biomass Dynamics From Charcoal Degradation In Mozambique Using Gedi Lidar And Landsat,"{""Duncanson, L."",""Liang, M."",""Sedano, F."",""Silva, J. A.""}",NA,"Understanding changes to aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests undergoing degradation is crucial for accurately and completely quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and for environmental monitoring in the context of climate change. Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA's GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendr-stabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 ± 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 ± 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events. © 2022",liang_quantifyingabovegroundbiomassdynamics_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

This study aims to analyze the short- and long-term shoreline changes in South Andaman, focusing on 2004-2005 (pre- and post-tsunami) and 1990-2023 (to assess periodic changes). Using remote sensing techniques and geospatial tools such as the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), shoreline change rates were calculated in four zones, revealing the extent of the tsunami's impact. During the pre- and post-tsunami periods, the maximum coastal erosion rate was -410.55 m/year, while the maximum accretion was 359.07 m/year in zone A, the island's east side. For the 1990-2023 period, the most significant coastal shoreline erosion rate was also recorded in zone A, which was recorded at -2.3 m/year. After analyzing the result, it can be seen that the tsunami severely affected the island's east side.

In this study, remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) have been used to evaluate forest fire susceptibility at Sungai Karang and Raja Muda Musa Forest Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia. Frequency ratio model has been applied for the delineation of forest fire mapping for the study area. Design/methodology/approach - Forest fire locations were identified in the study area from historical hotspots data from year 2000 to 2005 using AVHRR NOAA 12 and NOAA 16 satellite images. Various other supported data such as soil map, topographic data, and agro climate were collected and created using GIS. These data were constructed into a spatial database using GIS. The factors that influence fire occurrence, such as fuel type and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), were extracted from classified Landsat-7 ETM imagery. Slope and aspect of topography were calculated from topographic database. Soil type was extracted from soil database and dry month code from agroclimate data. Forest fire susceptibility was analyzed using the forest fire occurrence factors by likelihood ratio method. Findings - A new statistical method has been applied for the forest fire susceptibility mapping. The results of the analysis were verified using forest fire location data with the help of a newly written programming code. The validation results show satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on forest fire location. The GIS was used to analyze the vast amount efficiently, and statistical programs were used to maintain the specificity and accuracy. The result can be used for early warning, fire suppression resources planning and allocation. Originality/value - All data used in this study are original.

Method: An ongoing risk factor surveillance system involving telephone interviews with approximately n = 600 randomly selected South Australians each month. Trend analysis on physical activity (PA) levels and daily consumption of fruit and vegetables was undertaken. Results: An apparent seasonal trend for fruit consumption and PA was found, with less activity and fruit consumption undertaken in winter months. Overweight/obese adults exercised less than those with normal BMI, and females less than males, although PA rates for both females and overweight/obese adults are rising. There was an increase in vegetable consumption following a major media campaign. Although reported prevalence of the consumption of five or more serves of vegetables daily and the mean number of serves consumed daily has decreased, it is still above pre-campaign rates. Conclusion: Additional information obtained from a risk factor surveillance system, when compared to an annual or point-in-time survey, provides valuable evidence for health professionals interested in measuring and assessing the effectiveness of health promotion interventions. © 2009 Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland.",taylor_chronicdiseaseriskfactor_2010,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Wildland Fire Management And Air Quality In The Southern Sierra Nevada: Using The Lion Fire As A Case Study With A Multi-Year Perspective On Pm2.5 Impacts And Fire Policy,"{""Cisneros, R."",""Schweizer, D.""}",NA,"Management of fire is an important and controversial policy issue. Active fire suppression has led to a backlog of fuels, limited the ecological benefits of fire, and reduced short-term smoke impacts likely delaying these emissions to future generations over a larger spatial extent. Smoke impacts can be expected to increase as fire size and intensity increase and the fuel backlog is consumed; whether through reintroduction of fire under desirable conditions or through stand replacing fire. Land Management Agencies would like to increase the use of naturally ignited fires to burn during favorable conditions as a way to reduce catastrophic fires. This study provides information about the levels of air quality impacts expected from these types of fires and discusses some of the policy controversies of managed fire that propagate inconsistencies between agencies and enter the public discourse. The Lion Fire, a primarily low intensity 8,370ha fire that was extensively monitored for Particulate Matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), is used to quantify impacts to air quality. PM2.5 monitoring sites are used to assess exposure, public health impacts, and subsequently quantify annual air quality during a year with a fire that is within the historic normal fire size and intensity for this area. Ground level PM2.5 impacts were found to be localized with 99% of the hourly Air Quality Index readings in the moderate or good category for the sites impacted by the fire. PM2.5 concentrations at sites nearest the fire were below annual federal air quality standards for PM2.5 with annual 98th percentile at the most impacted sites (Johnsondale, Kernville, and Camp Nelson) of 35.0, 34.0, and 28.0μgm-3 respectively. Smoke impacts to PM2.5 concentrations were not found to reach the populated Central Valley. The findings suggest that this type of fire can be implemented with minimal public health impacts thus allowing an opportunity for air and fire managers to alter policy to allow additional burning in an area with severe anthropogenic air pollution and where frequent widespread fire is both beneficial and inevitable. The more extensive air quality impacts documented with large high intensity fire may be averted by embracing the use of fire to prevent unwanted high intensity burns. A widespread increase in the use of fire for ecological benefit may provide the resiliency needed in Sierra Nevada forests as well as be the most beneficial to public health through the reduction of single dose exposure to smoke and limiting impacts spatially. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",schweizer_wildlandfiremanagementair_2014,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Improvements In High-Speed Rail Network Environmental Evaluation And Planning: An Assessment Of Accessibility Gains And Landscape Connectivity Costs In Spain,"{""Iglesias-Merchan, C."",""Martín, B."",""Ortega, E."",""de Isidro, Á""}",NA,"High Speed Rail (HSR) in Spain began in 1992 and curently has a network of about 3400 km. In this 25-year period, accessibility has progressively increased, and its spatial distribution has changed throughout the territory. This has had important implications for territorial cohesion, which is a strategic planning objective of transport infrastructures in the European Union. However, this increase in HSR has environmental impacts; among other effects, new transport infrastructures imply a loss of landscape structural connectivity. This paper has two objectives: to study the distribution and development of the changes across the territory produced by the arrival of HSR in Spain between 1990 and 2025, by looking at changes in potential accessibility and structural habitat connectivity at the national scale; and to study – at the same scale – the relationship between both variables through the cost of accessibility improvements (socioeconomic variable) in terms of the loss of structural connectivity (environmental variable). All the analyses were done using GIS-based indicators, reported in the literature to be useful at the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) scale. The methodology is applied in different horizon years, namely 1990, 2007, 2016, and new proposed HSR lines to 2025 in Spain. The results show that throughout the whole period (1990−2025), accessibility improved by 74.7 % due to the extension of HSR. The most important period was 1990−2007, when the main socio-economic centres were connected by HSR, while connectivity, the environmental variable, declined by −3.4 %. The greatest connectivity loss was concentrated in 2007−2016, when the areas with the highest connectivity values in 1990 were the most affected. Our results show that a 1 % increase in accessibility implied a loss of connectivity of 0.03 % in the interval 1990−2007, while in the second period, the same 1 % increase entailed a 0.17 % loss; in the 2016−2025 scenario the value is intermediate (0.08). Our work contributes to adapting connectivity studies to the environmental assessment tiers in the transportation sector (i.e. plans, programmes and projects). Each stage has its limitations due to the lack of specific data or problems of spatial scale which must be publicly reported during environmental assessment processes. We also highlight the need for new research to establish a reliable spatial scale to assess the different effects of HSR corridors at the strategic level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",martin_improvementsspeedrailnetwork_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

In this study 58 rain-induced landslide locations were identified and assessed the spatial distribution. Earthquake triggered landslides were assessed based on the interpretation of pre and post satellite images on 2011 Sikkim earthquake. Therefore, the study attempts to (i) show the inventory map of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides (ii) evaluate the spatial distribution pattern of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides basis of their event controlling parameters (iii) Finally, to show the characteristics of spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides in the study area. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Ground Control Points (GCP) were used for verification of rainfall induced landslide locations and the improvement of the planimetric accuracy of the Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images from the Google Earth. For the spatial distribution analysis, all raster maps were prepared using GIS techniques. After that, location wise spatial values were extracted both rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides using multi-data extraction technique in GIS environment. From the present study, it has been observed that the co-seismic landslides initiating under dry conditions could account for steeper slope angles than the rain-induced landslides. It has been also observed that rain-induced landslides on southerly slope facing is maximum, and it decreases with the angle orientation on the northerly slope facing is relatively low. The study also reveals that rain induced and earthquake triggered landslides could be found in the sparsely vegetated areas.

In order to check the changes in the regularization process, a case study was analyzed: the one of Vila Terra Santa in Curitiba / PR. Primary and secondary data were collected in two different periods of land regularization, the first set in the period between the years of 2000-2007, before the process, and the second one in the period between the years of 2008-2013, after the process. The methodology of Urban Environmental Quality was adapted for this study and consisted of eight categories of analysis with 34 variables and 43 indicators, focused on social and environmental aspects and infrastructure. It was also developed an Urban Environmental Quality Index System - UEQI by category of analysis. For a better evaluation, the values assigned to each variable for each category and, finally, to the final UEQI, were indicated in a system of quality grades from A to E, with A being a extremely satisfactory quality level, and E a very unsatisfactory level, with other 3 classes in between. From the results we observed that there was an improvement in 6 categories of analysis after the regularization process, which were evidenced in 65\% of the 34 variables evaluated by the comparison between the two periods. The final UEQI pointed out an index of 40.15in the previous regularization period, which was framed in class D, therefore in an unsatisfactory quality level. In the second period, the rate was 72.98, classifying the environmental quality of Vila Terra Santa in F, which is very satisfactory.

Blue Carbon Ecosystem Monitoring Using Remote Sensing Reveals Wetland Restoration Pathways,"{""Drummond, Christopher"",""Gaston, Troy"",""Glamore, William"",""Lanceman, Dana"",""Sadat-Noori, Mahmood""}",NA,"In an era of climate and biodiversity crises, ecosystem rehabilitation is critical to the ongoing wellbeing of humans and the environment. Coastal ecosystem rehabilitation is particularly important, as these ecosystems sequester large quantities of carbon (known in marine ecosystems as ""blue carbon "") thereby mitigating climate change effects while also providing ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits. The recent formal accreditation of blue carbon services is producing a proliferation of rehabilitation projects, which must be monitored and quantified over time and space to assess on-ground outcomes. Consequently, remote sensing techniques such as drone surveys, and machine learning techniques such as image classification, are increasingly being employed to monitor wetlands. However, few projects, if any, have tracked blue carbon restoration across temporal and spatial scales at an accuracy that could be used to adequately map species establishment with low-cost methods. This study presents an open-source, user-friendly workflow, using object-based image classification and a random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine, to accurately classify 4 years of multispectral and photogrammetrically derived digital elevation model drone data at a saltmarsh rehabilitation site on the east coast of Australia (Hunter River estuary, NSW). High classification accuracies were achieved, with > 90\% accuracy at 0.1 m resolution. At the study site, saltmarsh colonised most suitable areas, increasing by 142\% and resulting in 56 tonnes of carbon sequestered, within a 4-year period, providing insight into blue carbon regeneration trajectories. Saltmarsh growth patterns were species-specific, influenced by species' reproductive and dispersal strategies. Our findings suggested that biotic factors and interactions were important in influencing species' distributions and succession trajectories. This work can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration planning and monitoring at coastal wetlands and similar ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to apply this approach to other types of remote sensing imagery and to calculate other rehabilitation co-benefits. Importantly, the method can be used to calculate blue carbon habitat creation following tidal restoration of coastal wetlands.",lanceman_bluecarbonecosystemmonitoring_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

This study has focused on a period of unusual population growth, 2000–2010, in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. It was found that socioeconomic factors, vegetation indexes, and land use land cover types are all strong predictors of AOD, and the negative coefficients of socioeconomic values reveal insight into the social inequality of air pollution exposure.

Local people and governments have been struggling for the control of the soil l decades. This study used remote sensing technology to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of the bare soil cover in the Hetian basinal area since 1976. The bare soil features were extracted from the Landsat images of 1976, 1988, 1999, 2004 and 2010 using two thematic indices-normalized difference soil index (NDSI) and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI). After converting the original digital number values of the images to at-satellite reflectance, the soil and impervious surface features were enhanced using the two indices, respectively. The soil features were then extracted from the soil-enhanced images. However, the extracted soil information was found to have been mixed with built-up land information due to the spectral confusion between the two categories. Therefore, the NDISI was further used to filter out the unwanted built-up land information from the soil images using a logical tree algorithm, as the NDISI is the index specially designed for highlight impervious surface features represented mainly by built-up lands. Results showed that the nearly thirty-five years of fight for controlling soil loss have greatly reduced bare soil covers in the basinal area. The area of the bare soil cover has been greatly reduced from 159. 17 km2 in 1976 to 51. 98 km2 in 2010. In the three observed periods, 1976-1988, 1988-1999, and 1999-2010, the decrease in bare soil cover was in an accelerate speed, which was km2 per year, -2. 75 km2 per year, and -4. 33 km2 per year for the three periods, respectively. This corresponds major policies issued by the government for the soil loss treatment of the area.

Currently, MZs in sugarcane production areas are classified based on conventional soil sampling, which demands a lot of time, labor and financial resources. Remote sensing (RS) combined with vegetation indices (VIs) is a promising alternative to support the traditional classification method, especially because it does not require physical access to the areas of interest, is cost-effective and less labor-intensive, and allows fast and easy coverage of large areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) to classify sugarcane MZs, compared with the conventional method, in the Brazilian Cerrado biome (savannah), where about half of Brazil ' s sugarcane production takes place. This study used historical crop production data from 5,500 production fields in three agricultural years (2015 to 2018) and NDVI and EVI2 values of 14 images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite from 2015 to 2018 in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Although improvements are still necessary and encouraged, a new methodology of classifying MZs according to VIs was proposed in this study. The NDVI was not correlated with MZs classified using the conventional method, whereas EVI2 was more sensitive to biomass variations between MZs and, therefore, could better discriminate between MZs. The EVI2 values measured in crops aged 180 to 240 days in the rainy season proved to be the best strategy for classifying MZs by RS, where MZ A, for example, had EVI2 of 0.37, compared to MZ E, which had an EVI2 of 0.32.",deoliveiramaia_vegetationindicestoolmapping_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Examination Of The Relationships Between Urban Form And Urban Public Services Expenditure In China,"{""Bo, Chunming"",""Liu, Yong"",""Xu, Hengzhou""}",NA,"This econometric study contributes to the ongoing debate about the costs and benefits of urban form by employing interdisciplinary means-urban planning, econometrics and public administration-to explore the relationship between urban form and urban public services expenditure. In China, particularly, rapid urbanization is accompanied by an increase of urban public services expenditure and a difference in efficiency, which undermines the promotion of urban public service development. The Chinese government has paid great attention to urban sustainable development and promoting urban public services performance; however, until recently there has been a lack of empirical studies exploring the relationship between urban public services expenditure and urban form. Thus, the present research aims to analyze this issue by using relevant indicators based on an econometric model. The results provide a promising basis for improving urban public services expenditure efficiency. Based on the urban area interpreted by remote sensing data and geographic information system, two urban form metrics, the compactness ratio and the elongation ratio, are selected and quantified to describe urban compactness and urban sprawl accurately. Panel data analyses are performed using a cross-sectional dataset of the 30 cities for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 to assess the likelihood of association between indicators of urban form and urban public services expenditure, while controlling for other determinants, such as educational level, income per capita, degree of industrialization, and unemployment rate. The results indicate that urban elongation is positively correlated to per capita urban public services expenditure and urban compactness is insignificantly correlated to it. Thus, it is recommended that policymakers consider the relationship between urban form and public services expenditure as part of urban planning and on-going strategies to promote public service efficiency.",bo_examinationrelationshipsurbanform_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The CPR has been superseded in several respects by other technologies, such as acoustics and remote sensing, but it continues to provide unrivalled seasonal and geographic information about a wide range of zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa. The value of this coverage increases with time and provides the basis for placing recent observations into the context of long-term, large-scale variability and thus suggesting what the causes are likely to be. Information from the CPR is used extensively in judging environmental impacts and producing quality status reports (QSR); it has shown the distributions of fish stocks, which had not previously been exploited; it has pointed to the extent of ungrazed phytoplankton production in the North Atlantic, which was a vital element in establishing the importance of carbon sequestration by phytoplankton. The CPR continues to be the principal source of large-scale, long-term information about the plankton ecosystem of the North Atlantic.

Focusing on major land management practices implemented through free community labor mobilization, the assessment combined remote sensing techniques, field observation, and expert as well as local knowledge. The results show an average net decrement of 39\% ( +/- 19\%) in the P factor value and 8.9\% ( +/- 21\%) in the C factor value after implementation of land management practices. P factor value reduction is linked to a high area coverage of level structures, while increases in the P factor value are associated with poor quality of structures, inappropriate practices, and wide spacing between structures on steep slopes. C factor value reduction is observed in non-arable shrub- and bushland with enriched area closure, whereas increased C factor values are associated with open access grasslands and untreated croplands. The overall change in P and C factor values resulted in a 42\% ( +/- 28\%) relative soil loss reduction. The demonstrated approach makes it possible to assess spatial and temporal dynamics in the P and C erosion factors and to estimate spatially disaggregated changes in the P and C factor values. This can help to improve parameterization of inputs for erosion modelling and to assess their relative soil loss effect.

The performances of the services a navigation system provides are the concern of the builders and users.

The waveforms of signals in satellite navigation chips are an important aspect of the signal's structure, which impact the characteristics of the autocorrelation function and power spectrum in the time domain and frequency domain. The range accuracy of a navigation system is usually described by its Gabor Bandwidth. The Gabor Bandwidth of the Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation in next-generation GNSS signal systems is not optimal. This paper presents a signal expression based on Multilevel Coded Symbol (MCS) signals, which can describe the fine structure of navigation signals.

Visible And Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Diurnal Variation Calibration For Corn Phenotyping Using Remote Sensing,"{""Jin, J."",""Ma, D."",""Wei, X."",""Zhang, J.""}",NA,"Remote sensing coupled with hyperspectral technology has become increasingly popular to investigate plant traits, showcasing its advantages in studying plant growth, health, and productivity. The quality of the collected hyperspectral images is crucial for subsequent data analysis and plant phenotyping studies. However, diurnal variations in spectral characteristics introduce more data variance in canopy reflectance spectra, raising the cost of subsequent analyses and compromising the performance of trait estimation models. In this study, a fixed gantry platform in a cornfield was used to capture visible and near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral images of corn canopies at consecutive time intervals. By applying reference board calibration and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to minimize the effects of ambient light and daily growth, diurnal spectral changes across all involved VNIR wavelengths were investigated. Several distinct diurnal patterns were observed to have close connections with the plants’ physiological effects. Diurnal calibration models were established at every wavelength by employing the least squares polynomial algorithm, with the highest coefficient of determination reaching 0.84. Moreover, by employing diurnal calibration in canopy spectra processing, the reduction in spectral variance brought about by varying imaging time was evidently exhibited. This study not only reveals the diurnal spectral variation pattern at VNIR bands but also offers a reliable, straightforward, and low-cost approach to improve the quality of remote sensing data and reduce the inherent variance brought about via the different imaging times ensuring that comparable spectral analysis can be performed under relatively fair conditions. © 2023 by the authors.",zhang_visibleinfraredhyperspectraldiurnal_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
House Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Ieu-Net,"{""Wang, F."",""Wang, S."",""Wang, Z."",""Xu, Z."",""Zhou, Y.""}",NA,"House buildings, as the main place for human activities, can be rapidly and accurately extracted from high-resolution remote sensing images, which is of great significance for promoting remote sensing information in disaster prevention and mitigation and town management. On the basis of deep learning, this paper proposes a pixel-level accurate extraction method for house buildings by using high-resolution remote sensing images.First, in consideration of the lack of pixel features at the edge of a sample image, an IEU-Net model is proposed on the basis of the U-Net model. A new ignore-edges categorical cross entropy function, IELoss, is designed as a loss function. Dropout and BN layers are added to help improve the speed and robustness of model training while fitting. Second, to solve the problem of limited feature richness of the model, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) is introduced into the classification process of the model, together with the remote sensing image RGB band. Lastly, when ignoring the edge prediction method, the best building extraction results can be obtained in the model prediction that corresponds to the IEU-Net model. The remote sensing image data used in this study are 0.8 m true color and infrared band data obtained by multispectral and panchromatic fusion from the GF-2 satellite of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province. A label image is obtained by visually interpreting the images by using ArcGIS software and performing a feature-to-raster transformation on the obtained vector file. Then, a ground truth image of the location of houses and buildings in the remote sensing image is recorded. The MBI and RGB bands are fused, and the corresponding label images are randomly cropped to obtain 500 pieces of 256×256 training data and 100 pieces of 256×256 verification data. Regarding the IEU-Net model r value of 0.5 and the training data as the model input and using the Adam optimization algorithm for back propagation iteration for 100 times help achieve the optimal parameter results.The Overall Accuracy (OA) is 91.86%, and the kappa value is 0.802. To verify the effectiveness of IELoss in the IEU-Net model and the ignore-edges prediction method relative to CELoss and the ordinary prediction method in solving the problem of insufficient edge pixel features, this study continues the comparison by using the values of r of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 (when r is 1.0, IELoss is equivalent to CELoss, and the ignore-edges prediction method is equivalent to the ordinary prediction method). The results show that the OA of the model using IELoss and the ignore-edges prediction method is 5.03% higher than that of the model using CELoss and the ordinary prediction method, and the kappa value is 0.165 higher. To verify the effectiveness of adding MBI to the training data of the model, a comparative experiment is performed by using RGB three-band data as the training set. The prediction result obtained using the MBI-added data set is 1.55% higher than the OA of the RGB band data set. The kappa value is increased by 0.009.The experimental results show that the IEU-Net model effectively solves the problem of insufficient edge pixel features and achieves house and building extraction accuracy with high OA and kappa values. The addition of MBI data can overcome the influence of roads and house building shadows to a certain extent and accurately extract the edge information of house buildings. Therefore, if significant vegetation exists near the houses and buildings in our area of interest, we can consider adding the normalized difference vegetation index to the training set to reduce the impact of the vegetation. © 2021, Science Press.

Combining Optical And Acoustic Data To Enhance The Detection Of Caribbean Forereef Habitats,"{""Bejarano, Sonia"",""Hedley, John D."",""Mumby, Peter. J."",""Sotheran, Ian""}",NA,"Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50\%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

A Method To Construct An Environmental Vulnerability Model Based On Multi-Source Data To Evaluate The Hazard Of Short-Term Precipitation-Induced Flooding,"{""Cui, Chengling"",""Meng, Jian"",""Wang, Mengyao"",""Yang, Runlu"",""Yao, Jiaqi"",""Zhu, Hong""}",NA,"Flood hazards resulting from short-term severe precipitation have caused serious social and economic losses and have posed extraordinary threats to the safety of lives and property. Vulnerability, which reflects the degree of the adverse impact of flooding on a city, the sensitivity of the environment, and the extent to which rescues are possible during flooding, is one of the significant factors of the disaster risk assessment. Because of this, this paper proposes an Environmental Vulnerability Analysis Model (EVAM), based on comprehensively evaluating multi-source remote sensing data. The EVAM includes a two-stage, short-term flood vulnerability assessment. In the first stage, the flood's areal extension and land-use classification are extracted, based on the U-NET++ network, using multi-source satellite remote sensing images. The results from the first stage are used in the second stage of vulnerability assessment. In the second stage, combining multi-source data with associated feature extraction results establishes the Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptive capacity framework. The short-term flood vulnerability index is leveraged through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the entropy method is calculated for an environmental vulnerability evaluation. This novel proposed framework for short-term flood vulnerability evaluation is demonstrated for the Henan Province. The experimental results show that the proportion of vulnerable cities in the Henan Province ranging from high to low is 22.22\%, 22.22\%, 38.89\%, and 16.67\%, respectively. The relevant conclusions can provide a scientific basis for regional flood control and risk management as well as corresponding data support for post-disaster reconstruction in disaster regions.",zhu_methodconstructenvironmentalvulnerability_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Cost-Effectiveness Of Strategies For Preventing Paediatric Lower Respiratory Infections Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus In Eight Chinese Cities,"{""Jit, M."",""Leung, K."",""Liu, D."",""Wu, J. T.""}",NA,"Background: New monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against RSV with promising efficacy and protection duration are expected to be available in the near future. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities. Methods: We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective. Results: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US$19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts. Conclusions: Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart.

"Impact Of Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Landscape Structure In The Dry Lands Of Southern Africa: A Case Of The Zambezi Region, Namibia","{""Kamwi, J. M."",""Mbidzo, M.""}",NA,"The study evaluated patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) change in the Zambezi Region, Namibia between 1984 and 2010 using geospatial tools. Spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes were quantified using the post classification change detection method. The images were classified into five land use and land cover classes: forest land, shrub land, bare land, crop/grass land and other land. Landscape metrics were calculated using Fragstats to understand the landscape patterns and structural integrity of the landscape. The results showed that political transition (before and after independence) has resulted in dramatic decreases in patch density and increases in the interspersion and juxtaposition index values. The general pattern of LULC showed that the communal area compared to protected area became structurally diverse and ecologically more fragmented from 1984 to 2010. This study provides a foundation and baseline data demonstrating LULC alteration and landscape context suitable for monitoring future changes of protected and communal areas. Our approach is a novel way to assess the drivers and patterns of LULC under different land tenure types for natural resources conservation and sustainable land management in the dry lands of Southern Africa.",kamwi_impactlandlandcover_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Long-Term Change Of Total Suspended Matter In A Deep-Valley Reservoir With Hj-1a/B: Implications For Reservoir Management,"{""Moreno-Madrinan, Max J."",""Shi, Kun"",""Yao, Xiaolong"",""Zhang, Yibo"",""Zhang, Yunlin"",""Zhou, Yongqiang"",""Zhu, Guangwei""}",NA,"The valley reservoirs service as a critical resource for society by providing drinking water, power generation, recreation, and maintaining biodiversity. Management and assessment of the water environment in valley reservoirs are urgent due to the recent eutrophication and water quality deterioration. As an essential component of the water body, total suspended matter (TSM) hinder the light availability to underwater and then affect the photosynthesis of aquatic ecosystem. We used long-term HJ-1A/B dataset to track TSM variation and elucidating the driving mechanism of valley reservoirs. Taking a typical deep-valley reservoir (Xin'anjing Reservoir) as our case study, we constructed a TSM model with satisfactory performance (R-2, NRMSE, and MRE values are 0.85, 18.57\%, and 20\%) and further derived the spatial-temporal variation from 2009 to 2017. On an intra-annual scale, the TSM concentration exhibited a significant increase from 2.13 +/- 1.10mgL(-1) in 2009 to 3.94 +/- 0.82mgL(-1) in 2017. On a seasonal scale, the TSM concentration in the entire reservoir was higher in the summer (3.36 +/- 1.54mgL(-1)) and autumn (2.74 +/- 0.82mgL(-1)) than in the spring (1.84 +/- 1.27mgL(-1)) and winter (1.44 +/- 2.12mgL(-1)). On a monthly scale, the highest and lowest mean TSM value occurred in June (4.66 +/- 0.45mgL(-1)) and January (0.67 +/- 1.50mgL(-1)), and the monthly mean TSM value increased from January to June, then dropped from June to December. Combing HJ-1A/B-derived TSM, climatological data, basin dynamic, and morphology of the reservoir, we elucidated the driving mechanism of TSM variation. The annual increase of TSM from long-term HJ-1A/B data indicated that the water quality of Xin'anjiang Reservoir was decreasing. The annual increase of phytoplankton jointed with an increase of built-up land and decrease of forest land in the basin may partially be responsible for the increasing trend in TSM. This study suggested that combining the long-term remote sensing data and in situ data could provide insight into the driving mechanism of water quality dynamic and improve current management efforts for local environmental management.",zhang_termchangetotalsuspended_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Renewable Energy: The Potential Opportunities And Obligations Of Plantation Forestry,"{""Ackerman, P. A."",""Talbot, B.""}",NA,"Global demand for woody biomass in substituting fossil fuels does, and will increasingly, place significant pressure on timber plantations and question conventional management practices. Plantations are rationally laid out, located in areas of high productivity, typically have good infrastructure, and are serviced by technologically efficient harvesting systems. Thus they have an inherent capacity to contribute more to bioenergy feedstocks than other, more natural, forms of forest or forest management. Sustainability goals are defined not only in terms of their in situ effect, but also in how they conform and contribute broadly to sustainable development at the local, regional and global levels. Renewable energy is generally recognised as a positive step on the pathway to sustainable development, but biomass-based renewable energy is becoming a controversial issue. In agriculture, the lure of first-generation biofuels is already distorting world food markets, energy crops such as sugar cane and oil palm continue to encroach on natural ecosystems, while in plantation forestry, everything from stumps and roots to branches and needles has taken on a new value. Not only does this threaten the ecological viability of the site, but it poses a challenge to forest management in suggesting a future and more direct competition for raw materials and the livelihoods of other users and satellite industries. Some level of trade-off between the long-term goals of plantation forestry, ecologically sound harvesting practices, and the benefits of renewable energy need to be arrived at. The challenge lies in ensuring an equitable incurrence of liabilities and distribution of benefits for all, while guaranteeing a feasible supply to a long-term investment in an energy conversion plant. Many argue that the free market should play itself out, oblivious to the fact that renewable energy plants are often subsidised. In this paper, we provide a general overview of some of the issues facing plantation forestry and the bioenergy harvest.

Can Suspended Sediment Concentrations Be Estimated From Multispectral Imagery Using Only Image-Derived Information?,"{""Onderka, M."",""Rodný, M.""}",NA,"Sampling for suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in inland waters is traditionally based on collecting samples at sparse locations and in limited intervals. A number of investigators explored the utility of earth-observing satellites and air-borne sensors for monitoring of SSC over vast areas. Two approaches are commonly deployed: (1) empirical relationships between a chosen remotely sensed quantity and the actual in-situ SSC; and (2) bio-optical models founded on radiative transfer modeling. Unfortunately, in-situ measurements are often unavailable for direct image calibration, and inherent optical properties of optically active constituents (specific scattering and absorption coefficients) are usually unknown. This paper examines the possibility to retrieve SSC from multispectral satellite imagery without any in-situ data, i.e. using only image-derived information. The fundamental principle of image selfcalibration relies on the fact that in the visual domain of wavelengths (~400-700 nm) the at-sensor reflectance becomes ""saturated"" at high SSC, whereas the near-infrared domain (~700-900 nm) remains almost perfectly linearly related to sediment concentrations. The core idea of the self-calibrating procedure is rather simple and is based on fitting an exponential function between reflectance and SSC, with SSC replaced by a linear relationship between SSC and reflectance in the near-infrared domain. As a first approximation of the non-linearity between reflectance and SSC levels in the 400-700 nm range, we used the equation proposed by Schiebe et al. (1992), although other equations, especially those arising from optical theory could be used as well. The technique is illustrated on a moderately sediment-laden reservoir and two scenes acquired from Landsat ETM+. The standard error of the estimated SSC was below 15 mg/L (i.e.~25 % relative error for the observed range of SSC). Although the proposed algorithm does not yield better results than other models mentioned in the literature, the primary advantage of the outlined methodology is that no in-situ measurements (water sampling nor spectral profiling) are needed - i.e. only image-derived information is used. © 2010 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",onderka_suspendedsedimentconcentrationsestimated_2010,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

This is especially the case for ungagged, large areas of multi-lake systems. Integrated use of remote sensing and geostatistical analysis can be a useful approach for developing metrics that can be used to identify the hydrological connectivity and their changes. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis of 18 wet and dry binary state rasters derived from Landsat images over a large ungauged multi-lake system, the Momoge National Nature Reserve in Northeast China. Our goal was to investigate applicability and dynamics of three surface hydrological connectivity metrics, namely, geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), and surface water extent (SWE) of the top 10 largest connectomes (i.e., seasonally connected water bodies). We found that, during a dry year, the reduction rate of the GCF curve was slower along the west-east (W-E) direction than along the north-south (N-S) direction, which was contrary to the patterns exhibited in a normal or wet year. The minimum values of the MDC in W-E and N-S directions in the dry year were 22.4 km and 6.3 km, respectively, while the maximum values of the MDC along the above two directions in the wet year were 50.7 km and 65.1 km, respectively. The components and spatial distribution of the top 10 largest connectomes changed dramatically in different months of each hydrological year, resulting in a huge change in the monthly SWE of the top 10 largest connectomes.

Mapping Daily Evapotranspiration At Landsat Spatial Scales During The Bearex'08 Field Campaign,"{""Alfieri, Joseph G."",""Anderson, Martha C."",""Chavez, Jose L."",""Colaizzi, Paul"",""Evett, Steven"",""Gao, Feng"",""Hain, Christopher"",""Howell, Terry"",""Kustas, William P."",""Prueger, John H.""}",NA,"Robust spatial information about environmental water use at field scales and daily to seasonal timesteps will benefit many applications in agriculture and water resource management. This information is particularly critical in arid climates where freshwater resources are limited or expensive, and groundwater supplies are being depleted at unsustainable rates to support irrigated agriculture as well as municipal and industrial uses. Gridded evapotranspiration (ET) information at field scales can be obtained periodically using land-surface temperature-based surface energy balance algorithms applied to moderate resolution satellite data from systems like Landsat, which collects thermal-band imagery every 16 days at a resolution of approximately 100 m. The challenge is in finding methods for interpolating between ET snapshots developed at the time of a clear-sky Landsat overpass to provide complete daily time-series over a growing season. This study examines the efficacy of a simple gap-filling algorithm designed for applications in data-sparse regions, which does not require local ground measurements of weather or rainfall, or estimates of soil texture. The algorithm relies on general conservation of the ratio between actual ET and a reference ET, generated from satellite insolation data and standard meteorological fields from a mesoscale model. The algorithm was tested with ET retrievals from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance model and associated DisALEXI flux disaggregation technique, which uses Landsat-scale thermal imagery to reduce regional ALEXI maps to a finer spatial resolution. Daily ET at the Landsat scale was compared with lysimeter and eddy covariance flux measurements collected during the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote sensing EXperiment of 2008 (BEAREX08), conducted in an irrigated agricultural area in the Texas Panhandle under highly advective conditions.

We found significant ecological and environmental effects of land use changes under rapid urbanization. The value of ecosystem services in Hangzhou decreased from 546.7 million USD in 1995 to 448.97 million USD in 2014, and the ratio of ESV to GDP decreased from 5.8% to 0.6%. The net carbon emissions associated with land use changes increased from 4.26 million tons in 1995 to 15.10 million tons in 2014, mainly due to the increase of built-up land carbon emissions and the decrease of forest land carbon sink.

Based on geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery, Pohnpei and surrounding atolls have 184.2 km2 of coral reef habitat with a sustainable finfish yield of 573-1118 t yr-1, however total harvest was estimated at 4068 t yr-1, exceeding biocapacity by 360-710%. The MEF was supported by observed impacts to coral reef resources, including (1) long-term declines in fish spawning aggregation density, (2) reductions in mean size, age and fecundity of key commercial species, (3) reliance on undersized fish, and (4) decadal declines in mean size and abundance of fishes of iconic value and critical to ecosystem maintenance. The commercial fishery was responsible for 68% of finfish catch volume, while reef fish consumption, at 93 kg person-1 yr-1, was among the highest in the region.

This study, thus, aimed at digital modeling and mapping the spatial distribution of topsoil total nitrogen (TN) in Qorveh-Dehgolan plain with an area of 150,000 ha using random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and cubist (CB) algorithms. A total of 130 observation points were collected from a depth of 0 to 30 cm from topsoil surfaces based on a random sampling pattern. Then, soil physicochemical properties, calcium carbonate equivalent, organic carbon, and topsoil total nitrogen were measured. A number of 51 environmental variables including 31 geomorphometric attributes derived from a digital elevation model with 12.5-m spatial resolution, 13 spectral indices and reflectance from SENTINEL-2 satellite (MSIsensor), and five soil properties and two spatial variables of latitude and longitude were used as covariates for digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen. The most appropriate covariates were then selected by the Boruta algorithm in the R software environment. A standard deviation map was produced to show model uncertainty. The covariate selection resulted in the separation of 14 effective covariates in the spatial prediction of topsoil total nitrogen by using the data mining algorithms. The validation of digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen by RF, DT, and CB models using 20% of independent data showed root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.032, 0.035, and 0.043%; mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0008, 0.001, and 0.002%; and based on the coefficients of determination of 0.42, 0.38, 0.35, respectively. Relative importance (RI) of environmental covariates using the %IncMSE index indicated the importance of two geomorphometric variables of midslope position and normalized height along with SAVI and NDVI remote sensing variables in the spatial modeling and distribution of total nitrogen in the studied lands. The RF prediction and associated uncertainty maps, with show high accuracy and low standard deviation in the most part of study area, reveled low overfitting and overtraining in soil-landscape modeling; so, this model can lead to the development of a digital map of soil surface properties with acceptable accuracy for sustainable land utilization. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.",parsaie_scaledigitalmappingtopsoil_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Hence, the objectives of this study are: 1) to determine changes in chemical concentrations of soils that are amended with treated sewage sludge; and 2) to determine if LANDSAT TM data can be used to map surface chemical characteristics of such amended soils. For this study, we selected two fields in NW Ohio, designated as F34 and F11, that had been applied with 34 and 11 ton acre- 1 of biosolids, respectively. Soil samples from a total of 70 sampling locations across the two fields were collected one day prior to LANDSAT 5 overpass and were analyzed for several elemental concentrations. The accumulation of Ba, Cd, Cu, S and P were found to be significantly higher in the surface soils of field F34, compared to field F11. Regression equations were established to search for algorithms that could map these five elemental concentrations in the surface soils using six, dark-object-subtracted (DOS) LANDSAT TM bands and the 15 non-reciprocal spectral ratios derived from these six bands for the May 20, 2005, LANDSAT 5 TM image. Phosphorus (P) had the highest R2 adjusted value (67.9%) among all five elements considered, and the resulting algorithm employed only spectral ratios. This model was successfully tested for robustness by applying it to another LANDSAT TM image obtained on June 5, 2005. Our results enabled us to conclude that LANDSAT TM imagery of bare-soil fields can be used to quantify and map the spatial variation of total phosphorous concentration in surface soils.

However, the policy effectiveness of ACP and co-benefits of carbon mitigation measures to environment and health are still largely unknown. Using satellite-based PM2.5 products produced in our previous study, concentration-response functions, and the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of premature deaths attributable to PM(2.5 )exposure, and quantitatively estimated the policy benefits of ACP and carbon mitigation measures. We found the annual PM2.5 concentrations in China decreased by 33.65 \% (13.41 lig m(-3)) from 2014 to 2020, accompanied by a decrease in PM2.5-attributable premature deaths of 0.23 million (95 \% confidence interval (CI): 0.22-0.27), indicating the huge benefits of China ACP for human health and environment. However, there were still 1.12 million (95 \% CI: 0.79-1.56) premature deaths caused by the exposure of PM2.5 in mainland China in 2020. Among all ACP measures, clean production (contributed 55.98 \% and 51.14 \% to decrease in PM(2.5 )and pre-mature deaths attributable to PM2.5) and energy consumption control (contributed 32.58 \% and 29.54 \% to decrease in PM2.5 and premature deaths attributable to PM2.5) made the largest contribution during the past seven years. Nevertheless, the environmental and health benefits of ACP are not fully synergistic in different regions, and the effectiveness of ACP measures reduced from 2018 to 2020. The co-effects of CO2 and PM2.5 has become one of the major drivers for PM(2.5 )and premature deaths reduction since 2018, confirming the clear environment and health co-benefits of carbon mitigation measures.

In this paper, we scrutinize the spatial grain effects of urban green space (UGS) cover maps (derived from remote sensing imagery and survey data) with respect to evaluating habitat fragmentation and connectivity, comparing among different urban gradient scenarios (downtown, urban periphery, and suburban area) in Hangzhou, a megacity in China. The fragmentation was detected from three indices, including Entropy, Contagion, and Hypsometry. Then morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was applied for the landscape element identification. The possibility of connectivity (PC) and patch importance (dPC) were proposed for measuring the landscape connectivity based on Cores and Bridges from MSPA results. The results indicate that the farther the location is from downtown, the less sensitive the landscape element proportion to the spatial resolution. Among the three fragmentation indices, the overall hypsometry index has the lowest sensitivity to the spatial resolution, which implies this index's broader application value. Considering connectivity, high spatial resolution maps are appropriate for analyzing highly heterogeneous urban areas, while medium spatial resolution maps are more applicable to urban periphery and suburban area with larger UGS patches and less fragmentation.

In this study we used remote sensing techniques to model the degree of spatial overlapping between the Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and Argentine fisheries, assuming this as a proxy of risk for albatrosses. Eleven tags were deployed on albatrosses during the non-breeding seasons 2011 and 2012 in the Patagonian Shelf. Their distribution overlapped to different extents with the two coastal trawl, three offshore trawl and one demersal long-line fisheries. The overlap index showed highest values with both coastal fleets, followed by the ice-chilling trawl fleet. These intersections were located in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, in coastal areas of the SE of Buenos Aires province, El Rincon estuary and over the shelf break. The analysis of intersections of focal areas from albatrosses and all fisheries allowed the identification of thirty-four fishing management units (1 degrees by 1 degrees grid within the Argentine EEZ) classified as of medium, high or very high conservation priority. Very high priority units were placed between 35 and 38 degrees S in the external mouth of Rio de la Plata, and between 45 and 47 degrees s in neighboring waters East to the hake fishing closure. Although there were possible biases due to the limited number of tracked birds and the locations where albatrosses were captured and instrumented, the information presented in this study provides a comprehensive picture of important areas of overlapping during winter that could be used by the fishery administration to prioritize conservation actions under limited resource scenarios.

Large number of spectral bands and high spatial resolution allows for identification of particular species. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data provide information about areas such as vegetation structure. Because the species differ in terms of features during the growing season, it is important to know when their spectral responses are unique in the background of the surrounding vegetation. The aim of the study was to identify two expansive grass species: Molinia caerulea and Calamagrostis epigejos in the Natura 2000 area in Poland depending on the period and dataset used. Field work was carried out during late spring, summer and early autumn, in parallel with remote sensing data acquisition. Airborne 1-m resolution HySpex images and LiDAR data were used. HySpex images were corrected geometrically and atmospherically before Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation and vegetation indices calculation. Based on a LiDAR point cloud generated Canopy Height Model, vegetation structure from discrete and full-waveform data and topographic indexes were generated. Classifications were performed using a Random Forest algorithm. The results show post-classification maps and their accuracies: Kappa value and F1 score being the harmonic mean of producer (PA) and user (UA) accuracy, calculated iteratively. Based on these accuracies and botanical knowledge, it was possible to assess the best identification date and dataset used for analysing both species.

Methods: First, environmental factors are selected based on mutual information method.Then,the selected environmental factors are taken as the input varia‑bles of long short‑term memory(LSTM) model,and the accumulated displacement data of landslide are taken as the expected output data,and the parameters of the model are optimized through improved particle swarm optimization method, so as to further improve the prediction accuracy of the fusion model.The global navigation satellite system(GNSS) data of Fa'er landslide in Shuicheng County, Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province are analyzed. Results: Experimental results show that the improved particle swarm optimization(IPSO)‑LSTM neural network data fusion algorithm, based on mutual information is suitable for landslide deformation prediction with multi‑source heterogeneous monitoring data.The environmental factor variable selection method based on mutual information is better than Pearson correlation coefficient selection method. After optimizing the parameters of the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, the prediction accuracy of the fusion model is higher.

We present a new operational framework, Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground based measurements-AgricuLtural EaRly warning sysTem (TAMSAT-ALERT), which aims to provide early warning for meteorological risk to agriculture. TAMSAT-ALERT combines information on land-surface properties, seasonal forecasts and historical weather to quantitatively assess the likelihood of adverse weather-related outcomes, such as low yield. This article describes the modular TAMSAT-ALERT framework and demonstrates its application to risk assessment for low maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale). The modular design of TAMSAT-ALERT enables it to accommodate any impact or land-surface model driven with meteorological data. The implementation described here uses the well-established General Large Area Model (GLAM) for annual crops to provide probabilistic assessments of the meteorological hazard for maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale) throughout the growing season. The results show that climatic risk to yield is poorly constrained in the beginning of the season, but as the season progresses, the uncertainty is rapidly reduced. Based on the assessment for the period 2002-2011, we show that TAMSAT-ALERT can estimate the meteorological risk on maize yield 6 to 8 weeks in advance of harvest. The TAMSAT-ALERT methodology implicitly weights forecast and observational inputs according to their relevance to the metric being assessed. A secondary application of TAMSAT-ALERT is thus an evaluation of the usefulness of meteorological forecast products for impact assessment.

Subpixel Land-Cover Classification For Improved Urban Area Estimates Using Landsat,"{""Biggs, Eloise"",""Boruff, Bryan"",""MacLachlan, Andrew"",""Roberts, Gareth""}",NA,"Urban areas are Earth's fastest growing land use that impact hydrological and ecological systems and the surface energy balance. The identification and extraction of accurate spatial information relating to urban areas is essential for future sustainable city planning owing to its importance within global environmental change and human-environment interactions. However, monitoring urban expansion using medium resolution (30-250 m) imagery remains challenging due to the variety of surface materials that contribute to measured reflectance resulting in spectrally mixed pixels. This research integrates high spatial resolution orthophotos and Landsat imagery to identify differences across a range of diverse urban subsets within the rapidly expanding Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR), Western Australia. Results indicate that calibrating Landsat-derived subpixel land-cover estimates with correction values (calculated from spatially explicit comparisons of subpixel Landsat values to classified high-resolution data which accounts for over {[}under] estimations of Landsat) reduces moderate resolution urban area over (under) estimates by on an average 55.08\% for thePMR. This approach can be applied to other urban areas globally through use of frequently available and/ or low-cost high spatial resolution imagery (e. g. using Google Earth). This will improve urban growth estimations to help monitor and measure change whilst providing metrics to facilitate sustainable urban development targets within cities around the world.",maclachlan_subpixellandcoverclassification_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The study builds a new integrated approach founded on ecocultural values and local knowledge as resources for an effective territorial planning and sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach The proposed framework was developed through: (1) analysing coastal planning needs and problems in European coastal areas; (2) identifying ecocultural values, including local knowledge, in such areas; (3) selecting best approaches and tools in spatial planning; (4) applying the selected planning approaches to use ecocultural values as resources for spatial planning and sustainable development; and (5) validating the final methodology. Findings A dynamic approach for maritime-land planning was developed projecting coastal waters and river basins as strategic drivers for sustainable development, based on the natural capacity of water to shape and integrate the ecological and cultural territory. A participatory governance planning methodology supports the new articulations of space based on ecocultural value chains and networks as synergistic vectors, focusing on local knowledge as psychosocial capital for a collective mapping of cultural, historical, social, economic and ecological values into ecocultural littoral plans.

Mapping An Alien Invasive Shrub Within Conservation Corridors Using Super-Resolution Satellite Imagery,"{""Latte, Nicolas"",""Pryke, James S."",""Samways, Michael J."",""Theron, Jurie""}",NA,"Alien invasive plant species are one of the main drivers of global biodiversity loss. Methods for monitoring the spread of alien invasive plants are needed to improve management and mitigate impact on local biodiversity. Recent advances in deep learning and image fusion holds great potential for mapping and managing alien invasive plants. One such method is super-resolution image reconstruction, where a neural network learns to downscale images from coarse to fine resolution. Within the commercial timber production landscape of KwaZulu-Natal, endangered grassland corridors are threatened by American bramble invasion, impacting plants, birds, arthropods, and soil restoration. Here we aim to improve our understanding of bramble invasion dynamics through using super-resolved satellite mosaics. Bramble was classified with very high accuracies (85\%) from the super-resolved satellite mosaic, compared to other conventional satellite imagery with different spectral and spatial resolutions. Using landscape analyses, we identified plantation tree harvesting and prescribed burning to be major drivers increasing bramble cover within the landscape. Bramble cover was highest one year following plantation tree harvesting. Continuous prescribed burning positively influenced bramble. Bramble cover was also high close to streams, and under future invasion projections, bramble will severely impact Ensifera species alongside low priority grasshopper species habitat. Results also indicate that bramble has a significant negative impact on intermediate priority grasshoppers and plant species richness. For controlling bramble invasion within commercial timber production landscapes, we recommend the adoption rotational harvesting, as harvesting entire plantation blocks throughout the landscape will dramatically increase invasion potential of bramble. Current bramble removal programmes should prioritize riparian areas. Special attention is needed to control bramble one year after timber harvesting, as this is when bramble cover is highest. We show the benefits of using super-resolved mosaics to gain new insights into alien invasive species dynamics, while further development of this technique will aid in managing invasive alien plant species at local scales.",theron_mappingalieninvasiveshrub_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Integrating Soil Moisture Retrieved From L-Band Microwave Radiation Into An Energy Balance Model To Improve Evapotranspiration Estimation On The Irrigated Oases Of Arid Regions In Northwest China,"{""Jin, Rui"",""Li, Dazhi"",""Li, Yan"",""Wang, Haijing"",""Zhou, Jian"",""Zhou, Qingguo"",""Zhou, Yanzhao""}",NA,"Irrigated oases are the main water consumers in arid and semi-arid regions. As plant evapotranspiration (ET) in these regions mainly depends on irrigated water, accurate quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) on the irrigated oases is crucial for allocation and management of irrigation water resources. In this study, we integrated the soil moisture retrieved from Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometer (PLMR) into the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model for improving ET estimates under water stress conditions. The study area is the irrigated oasis in the middle reaches of the Heihe River where airborne and satellite-borne remotely sensed data as well as in situ observations are available through the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (Hi WATER). The main goal of this experiment is to monitor the energy-water exchange between near-surface atmosphere and land surface, and to assess its influencing factors within the oasis-desert ecosystem. The soil moisture data were retrieved using the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model fed with the airborne dual-polarized and multi-angular viewing of PLMR. The comparison of soil moisture retrieval from PLMR data with the soil moisture measured by a wireless sensor network (WSN) showed good consistency, with an absolute mean error (ME) <0.004 cm(3) cm(-3) and a root mean square error (RMSE) value <0.05 cm(3) cm(-3). Further, the actual daily evapotranspiration was estimated using the soil moisture integrated (SM-integrated) SEBS algorithm fed with the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images and soil moisture data retrieved from PLMR data. The sensible heat fluxes and daily evapotranspiration-(ETdatiy) obtained by the SM-integrated SEBS and the original SEBS were compared with the eddy correlation (EC) measurements collected from HiWATER experiment. The results indicate an obvious improvement when soil moisture information is integrated into the SEBS. This method overcomes the weakness of remote sensing based (RS-based) surface energy balance models of overestimating evapotranspiration particularly in semi-arid and arid regions. It shows a prospect that the combination of optical and microwave remote sensing can further improve the RS-based ET estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An Assessment Of The Accuracy Of Modis Land Surface Temperature Over Egypt Using Ground-Based Measurements,"{""El Kenawy, Ahmed M."",""Hereher, Mohamed E."",""Robaa, Sayed M.""}",NA,"Space-based data have provided important advances in understanding climate systems and processes in arid and semi-arid regions, which are hot-spot regions in terms of climate change and variability. This study assessed the performance of land surface temperatures (LSTs), retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua platform, over Egypt. Eight-day composites of daytime and nighttime LST data were aggregated and validated against near-surface seasonal and annual observational maximum and minimum air temperatures using data from 34 meteorological stations spanning the period from July 2002 to June 2015. A variety of accuracy metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of LST, including the bias, normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE), Yule-Kendall (YK) skewness measure, and Spearman's rho coefficient. The ability of LST to reproduce the seasonal cycle, anomalies, temporal variability, and the distribution of warm and cold tails of observational temperatures was also evaluated. Overall, the results indicate better performance of the nighttime LSTs compared to the daytime LSTs. Specifically, while nighttime LST tended to underestimate the minimum air temperature during winter, spring, and autumn on the order of -1.3, -1.2, and -1.4 degrees C, respectively, daytime LST markedly overestimated the maximum air temperature in all seasons, with values mostly above 5 degrees C. Importantly, the results indicate that the performance of LST over Egypt varies considerably as a function of season, lithology, and land use. LST performs better during transitional seasons (i.e., spring and autumn) compared to solstices (i.e., winter and summer). The varying interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially the differences between sensible and latent heat fluxes, contribute largely to these seasonal variations. Spatially, LST performs better in areas with sandstone formations and quaternary sediments and, conversely, shows lower accuracy in regions with limestone, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. This behavior can be expected in hybrid arid and semi-arid regions like Egypt, where bare rocks contribute to the majority of the Egyptian territory, with a lack of vegetation cover. The low surface albedo of igneous and limestone rocks may explain the remarkable overestimation of daytime temperature in these regions, compared to the bright formations of higher surface albedo (i.e., sandy deserts and quaternary rocks). Overall, recalling the limited coverage of meteorological stations in Egypt, this study demonstrates that LST obtained from the MODIS product can be trustworthily employed as a surrogate for or a supplementary source to near-surface measurements, particularly for minimum air temperature. On the other hand, some bias correction techniques should be applied to daytime LSTs. In general, the fine space-based climatic information provided by MODIS LST can be used for a detailed spatial assessment of climate variability in Egypt, with important applications in several disciplines such as water resource management, hydrological modeling, agricultural management and planning, urban climate, biodiversity, and energy consumption, amongst others. Also, this study can contribute to a better understanding of the applications of remote sensing technology in assessing climatic feedbacks and interactions in arid and semi-arid regions, opening new avenues for developing innovative algorithms and applications specifically addressing issues related to these regions.",elkenawy_assessmentaccuracymodisland_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Detecting Montane Flowering Phenology With Cubesat Imagery,"{""HilleRisLambers, J."",""John, A."",""Olden, J. D."",""Ong, J."",""Tan, A."",""Theobald, E. J.""}",NA,"Shifts in wildflower phenology in response to climate change are well documented in the scientific literature. The majority of studies have revealed phenological shifts using in-situ observations, some aided by citizen science efforts (e.g., National Phenology Network). Such investigations have been instrumental in quantifying phenological shifts but are challenged by the fact that limited resources often make it difficult to gather observations over large spatial scales and long-time frames. However, recent advances in finer scale satellite imagery may provide new opportunities to detect changes in phenology. These approaches have documented plot level changes in vegetation characteristics and leafing phenology, but it remains unclear whether they can also detect flowering in natural environments. Here, we test whether fine-resolution imagery (<10 m) can detect flowering and whether combining multiple sources of imagery improves the detection process. Examining alpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park (MORA), we found that high-resolution Random Forest (RF) classification from 3-m resolution PlanetScope (from Planet Labs) imagery was able to delineate the flowering season captured by ground-based phenological surveys with an accuracy of 70% (Cohen's kappa = 0.25). We then combined PlanetScope data with coarser resolution but higher quality imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10-m Sentinel and 30-m Landsat), resulting in higher accuracy predictions (accuracy = 77%, Cohen's kappa = 0.39). The model was also able to identify the timing of peak flowering in a particularly warm year (2015), despite being calibrated on normal climate years. Our results suggest PlanetScope imagery holds utility in global change ecology where temporal frequency is important. Additionally, we suggest that combining imagery may provide a new approach to cross-calibrate sensors to account for radiometric irregularity inherent in fine resolution PlanetScope imagery. The development of this approach for wildflower phenology predictions provides new possibilities to monitor climate change effects on flowering communities at broader spatiotemporal scales. In protected and tourist areas where the flowering season draws large numbers of visitors, such as Mt.

They are the proverbial wave of creative disruption in the space industry and are poised to disrupt the communication market in significant ways. The objective of this work is to develop a decision-analytic framework for assessing the value of High-Throughput Satellites and to provide meaningful results of the value of such systems under realistic design, operational, and market conditions. We develop the cost and revenue models of HTS. To build the revenue model, we develop a hybrid data-driven and scenario-based load factor model that combines historical data based on financial records from current HTS operators with extrapolations based on best-, nominal-, and worst-case scenarios. We then integrate the cost and revenue models within a stochastic simulation environment and perform Monte-Carlo analysis of the net present value (NPV) of HTS. One important result is that a medium-sized HTS significantly outperforms a roughly equivalent traditional wide-beam satellite, even under the worst-case loading scenario. Another important result, here identified and quantified, is the tradeoff between the average revenue per user (ARPU) and average loading of the satellite and how it is mediated by the downlink speed provided to consumers. This result can be used in different ways, for example, by helping define the boundaries of what is competitively achievable in terms of ARPU and downlink speed offerings. The implications of these results are that they delineate the pathways to financial failure and the boundaries beyond which an HTS will be value-negative, or alternatively, the asymptotic minimum values for an HTS to be value-positive.",geng_montecarloanalysisthroughput_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
The Use Of Multi-Temporal Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi) Data For Assessing Forest Cover Change Of Lawarchara National Park,"{""Alam, M. S."",""Islam, M. A."",""Jimmy, A.

The study's purpose was to assess the long-term change of forest cover using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) technique and evaluate the impact of co-management. Landsat images acquired from the USGS glovis website were used to assess forest cover change using NDVI, a popular technique for identification and estimation of forest areas. NDVI value ranges from (− 1) to (+ 1); a negative value indicates non-vegetated areas including water bodies, road surfaces, settlements, etc., whereas a positive value near (+ 1) indicates the highest density vegetation. NDVI value (0) indicates bare land without vegetation. Based on NDVI values, the forest areas have been divided into four categories, namely: (1) very low or no vegetation area, (2) low-density vegetation area, (3) moderate-density vegetation area, and (4) dense vegetation area. A household survey was carried out among the people living in the adjacent villages to LNP. The study of assessing the forest cover change of LNP using remotely sensed data revealed that, after the initiation of co-management, the dense vegetation area increased by 8.62% in 2006 compared to 2001, but it decreased by 0.77% in 2014. In 2018, dense vegetation decreased by 3.86% relative to the dense vegetation area of 2014. If it is compared as a whole, it can be said that the forest cover has improved under co-management, and the household survey revealed that forest dependence has been reduced which might be considered as one of the reasons for forest cover improvement. However, more improvement can be achieved by focusing on the villages where forest dependence is still high. Betel leaf cultivation inside the forest area is creating a problem for wildlife and also hampering the natural composition of flora. Therefore, it is recommended to rehabilitate betel leaf cultivators outside the forest area with proper compensation. This will harness the full potentiality of the co-management practice, it needs complete monitoring and goodwill from every stakeholder, and hence it will bring good for the whole country. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",islam_multitemporallandsatnormalized_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
A Nonparametric Approach To Filling Gaps In Satellite-Retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth For Estimating Ambient Pm2.5 Levels,"{""Deng, Xunfei"",""Di, Baofeng"",""Grieneisen, Michael L."",""Luo, Yuzhou"",""Wang, Zhigao"",""Yao, Gang"",""Zhan, Yu"",""Zhang, Ruixin""}",NA,"Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) is commonly used to estimate ambient levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), though it is important to mitigate the estimation bias of PM2.5 due to gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. A nonparametric approach with two random-forest submodels is proposed to estimate PM2.5 levels by filling gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. This novel approach was employed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 levels during 2013-2015 in the Sichuan Basin of Southwest China, where the coverage rate of composite AOD retrieved by the Terra and Aqua satellites was only 11.7\%. Based on the retrieved AOD and various covariates (including meteorological conditions and land use types), the first random-forest submodel (named AOD-submodel) was trained to fill the gaps in the AOD dataset, giving a cross-validation R-2 of 0.95. Subsequently, the second random-forest submodel (named PM2.5-submodel) was trained to estimate the PM2.5 levels for unmonitored areas/days based on the gap-filled AOD, ground-monitored PM2.5 levels, and the covariates, and achieved a cross-validation R-2 of 0.86. By comparing the complete and incomplete (i.e., without the days when AOD data were missing) estimates, we found that the monthly PM2.5 levels could be overestimated by 34.6\% if the PM2.5 values coincident with AOD gaps were not considered. The newly developed approach is valuable for deriving the complete spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 from incomplete remote sensing data, which is essential for air quality management and human exposure assessment.

Given the generally narrow width of rivers and current high spatial resolution satellites, which are limited by band settings, bandwidth, and the signal-to-noise ratio, UAVs with their exceptional spatiotemporal resolution can be used as a useful tool for river environmental monitoring and inversion uncertainty assessment. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral (X20P) and multispectral (P4M) images, along with Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat-9 OLI2 data, were used to assess the uncertainty in retrieving chlorophyll-a (Chla) and suspended sediment (SS) concentrations in rivers. Chla and SS models based on UAV and satellite data were constructed using stepwise multiple regression and typical Chla and SS retrieval algorithms, respectively, and the performance of the models was the focus of our research. The results demonstrated that in the Chla concentration inversion, each sensor performed as follows: X20P > P4M > Landsat9 OLI2 > Sentinel-2 MSI > Landsat8 OLI, and the performance in the SS concentration inversion was as follows: X20P > Sentinel-2 MSI > P4M > Landsat9 OLI2 > Landsat8 OLI. In addition, the uncertainty of high spatial resolution satellite retrievals was analyzed with the assistance of the UAV-based model. Results showed that narrow bandwidths and finely tuned band settings are more essential for the Chla inversion. The typical Chla retrieval algorithm, NDCI, is only effective in certain bands (band 1 from 684 to 724 nm and band 2 from 660 to 680 nm). It is also noted that Landsat8 and Landsat9 lack some key band settings (e.g., the red-edge band of 700-710 nm), severely limiting practical application in relation to Chla. However, specific variances in different sensor bands have a relatively small impact on SS inversion, for example, the correlation between SS and the R/B (a typical SS retrieval algorithm) constructed by each sensor ranged from 0.68 to 0.77. Chla monitoring, on the other hand, necessitates a higher spatial resolution than SS monitoring. The accuracy decreased markedly when UAV images were resampled to 10 m and 30 m spatial resolution. However, it is not as crucial for the SS inversion, images with the original spatial resolution (RMSE<30cm = 6.28 mg/L) were resampled to 10 m resolution (RMSE10m = 5.85 mg/L) and 30 m resolution (RMSE30m = 4.08 mg/L) while using P4M for SS inversion, and the accuracy increased.

Passive Monitoring Of Mental Health Status In The Criminal Forensic Population,"{""Appelbaum, P. S."",""Resnick, K.

The limitations inherent in these methodologies have implications for the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. Certain populations are particularly affected by these limitations because of their unique situations, including criminal forensic patients, who have a history of both criminal behavior and mental disorder, and experience increased stigma and restrictions in their access to mental health care. This population may benefit particularly from recent developments in technology and the growing use of mobile devices and sensors to collect behavioral information via passive monitoring.

The Responses Of Ecosystem Services To Land-Use Change In Dianshan Lake Area From 1984 To 2014,"{""Chen, X."",""Ding, L."",""Tang, J."",""Wang, Q.""}",NA,"Water resources are an important guarantee for the development of regions and eities. Understanding the ehanges in ecosystem services and their driving forces, therefore, is of great significance in the management of water resources across regions. By utilizing remote sensing images of Dianshan Like area in 1984, 1993, 2(X)6 and 2014, land-use change and ecosystem service value ( ESV) were analyzed by revising the ESV coefficient of different types of land use. The results showed that the areas of woodland and construction land tended to increase, while those of arable land and water bodies tended to decrease between 1984 and 2014. Results from the ESV analysis showed that the ESV of water bodies and arable land decreased by 215 and 24! million yuan, respectively, while the ESV of woodland increased by 250 million yuan. The ESV sensitivity index of each land-use type was less than 1 , indicating that the ESV of the study area was inelastic. On the township scale, the ESV analysis showed a net increase only in Zhujiajiao and Jinxi Towns. At the provincial and municipal scales, the total ESV perunitarea of Jiangsu Province decreased, while the total ESV per unit area of Shanghai increased. The driving force analysis showed that both natural and socio-economic factors had an impact on the ESV. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between population density and ESV and between total regional economic output and ESV. Our results suggest that changes in land use have an important impart on the ESV. An optimal land-use pattern would help to increase the total ESV across regions. © 2019 Science Press.

Impact Of The Transport Of Aerosols From The Free Troposphere Towards The Boundary Layer On The Air Quality In The Paris Area,"{""Colette, A."",""Haeffelin, M."",""Menut, L."",""Morille, Y.""}",NA,"We propose a quantification of the downward transport of aerosols from the free troposphere (FT) to the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Aerosols are originally released at the surface as a consequence of anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, soil mobilization, etc. After being vertically transported into the FT, they are exposed to the long-range transport (LRT) and may subside to impact, in turn, surface air pollution in remote places. Using 5400 h of routine Lidar observations conducted at the SIRTA observatory in the Paris area (France), we identified 154 free tropospheric aerosol layers continuously monitored during their downward transport into the local PBL. One of these events-associated to a Saharan dust outbreak-is thoroughly documented in a case study. And a climatological analysis of surface PM10 levels recorded at air quality monitoring stations allows the impact of FT to PBL transport of aerosols to be quantified. This source is found to be significant for 15 out of the 16 stations, with average PM10 concentrations 2.14 μg m-3 (i.e. 12%) above climatological values after the injection of free tropospheric aerosols into the PBL. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Forest assessments on national level are of particular interest because countries that wish to engage in the REDD+ initiative and to benefit from results-based payments, need to give quantitative evidence of their progresses in enhancing their forest resources. This contribution analyzes the capacity building needs for national forest assessments with a focus on the situation in developing countries, identifies key areas in which national capacity may be developed and makes suggestions for implementation. India's forest assessment systems are used as an example. The National Forest Inventory (NFI) system needs to be institutionalized to ensure a practical way for proficient monitoring and analysis of forest ecosystems.

However, training and deploying ML requires significant computation and storage capabilities. This challenge will become even greater as global-scale data from the forthcoming Surface Biology \& Geology satellite becomes available.

This study aims to quantify the land cover change and to identify its major determinants by using the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses (DPSIR) framework in the Ethiopian Gozamin District over a period of 32 years (1986 to 2018). Satellite images of Landsat 5 (1986), Landsat 7 (2003), and Sentinel-2 (2018) and a supervised image classification methodology were used to assess the dynamics of land cover change. Land cover maps of the three dates, focus group discussions (FGDs), interviews, and farmers' lived experiences through a household survey were applied to identify the factors for changes based on the DPSIR framework. Results of the investigations revealed that during the last three decades the study area has undergone an extensive land cover change, primarily a shift from cropland and grassland into forests and built-up areas. Thus, quantitative land cover change detection between 1986 and 2018 revealed that cropland, grassland, and bare areas declined by 10.53\%, 5.7\%, and 2.49\%. Forest, built-up, shrub/scattered vegetation, and water bodies expanded by 13.47\%, 4.02\%, 0.98\%, and 0.25\%. Household surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) identified the population growth, the rural land tenure system, the overuse of land, the climate change, and the scarcity of grazing land as drivers of these land cover changes. Major impacts were rural to urban migration, population size change, scarcity of land, and decline in land productivity.

Managing Marine Protected Areas In Remote Areas: The Case Of The Subantarctic Heard And Mcdonald Islands,"{""Ban, Natalie C."",""Brooks, Cassandra M."",""Epstein, Graham""}",NA,"Large marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established to contribute to global conservation targets but present an immense challenge for managers as they seek to govern human interactions with the environment over a vast geographical expanse. These challenges are further compounded by the remote location of some MPAs, which magnify the costs of management activities. However, large size and remoteness alone may be insufficient to achieve conservation outcomes in the absence of critical management functions such as environmental monitoring and enforcement. The Australian subantarctic Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI) Marine Reserve is among the world's most remote MPAs with notoriously harsh oceanographic conditions, and yet the region's rich mammal and fish resources have been exploited intermittently since the mid-1800s. More recently, the development of lucrative international markets for Patagonian toothfish, sold as Chilean seabass, led to the growth in both legal and illegal fishing. In 2002, to conserve the unique ecology and biodiversity in the area, Australia declared a 65,000 km2 MPA around HIMI. Worldwide, government agencies have, however, struggled to develop cost-effective institutional arrangements for conservation. This paper therefore draws upon the social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) to characterize the structure of conservation governance and outcomes in the HIMI Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve has generally been successful in supporting a sustainable fishery while addressing threats to biodiversity. The remote and isolated nature of the Marine Reserve was critical to its success, but also benefited greatly from collaborations between managers and the fishing industry. Commercial fishers keep watch over the Reserve while fishing, report any observations of illegal fishing (none since 2006/07), and have at times been asked to verify remote observation of potential illegal fishing vessels. The industry also undertakes annual ecological surveys in the MPA, allowing managers to track environmental trends. The fishing industry itself highlights the importance of industry participation in conservation planning, strengthened by secure access to resources via statutory fishing rights, which provide critical incentives to invest in conservation. We therefore reflect on the potential application of this case to other remote large MPAs, highlighting potential directions for future research.",brooks_managingmarineprotectedremote_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Many studies have investigated the past changes in land use, but efforts exploring the potential changes in land use and implications under future scenarios are still lacking. Here we simulate the future land use changes and their impacts on ecosystem services in Northeast China (NEC) over the period of 2000-2050 using the CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) model under the scenarios of ecological security (ESS), food security (FSS) and comprehensive development (CDS). The model was validated against remote sensing data in 2005. Overall, the accuracy of the CLUE-S model was evaluated at 82.5\%. Obtained results show that future cropland changes mainly occur in the Songnen Plain and the Liaohe Plain, forest and grassland changes are concentrated in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains and the western Changbai Mountains, while the Sanjiang Plain will witness major changes of the wetlands. Our results also show that even though CDS is defined based on the goals of the regional development plan, the ecological service value (ESV) under CDS is RMB 2656.18 billion in 2050. The ESV of CDS is lower compared with the other scenarios. Thus, CDS is not an optimum scenario for eco-environmental protection, especially for the wetlands, which should be given higher priority for future development.

Yet, effectively using satellite data in this context requires blending technical knowledge about their capabilities and limitations with an understanding of their influence on the value of risk-reduction programmes. In this Review, we discuss how approaches to estimate agricultural losses for index insurance have evolved from costly field-sampling-based campaigns towards lower-cost techniques using weather and satellite data. We identify advances in remote sensing and crop modelling for assessing agricultural conditions, but reliably and cheaply assessing production losses remains challenging in complex landscapes. We illustrate how an economic framework can be used to gauge and enhance the value of insurance based on earth-observation data, emphasizing that even as yield-estimation techniques improve, the value of an index insurance contract for the insured depends largely on how well it captures the losses when people suffer most. Strategically improving the collection and accessibility of reliable ground-reference data on crop types and production would facilitate this task. Audits to account for inevitable misestimation complement efforts to detect and protect against large losses. Improvements in earth observation are enabling new approaches to assess agricultural losses, such as those resulting from adverse weather. This Review examines advances in the application of remotely sensed data and crop modelling in index-based insurance as well as opportunities to enhance the quality of index insurance programmes. Key pointsIn many developing regions, adverse weather can lead to food insecurity, reduced investments or distressed asset sales that ensnare people in a cycle of poverty.Tools to manage risk - such as well-designed insurance - can help people avoid the most severe possible consequences of bad weather and build confidence to invest in additional income-generating opportunities.In recent decades, governments and researchers across the globe have trialled approaches to inexpensively assess agricultural losses. Index-based insurance offers promise, but detecting losses cheaply and accurately remains challenging.Recent advances in crop modelling and remote sensing can improve index-based approaches by strengthening the link between indices and actual losses, as well as reducing programme costs.We provide an economic framework to evaluate indices, suggesting how the remote sensing and modelling communities can contribute to enhancing index insurance quality through better detection of adverse conditions.Promising opportunities to enhance index insurance programmes include inexpensively addressing heterogeneous conditions on the ground, such as employing audits, optimizing insurance zones, using new sensors or increasing contract flexibility.",benami_unitingremotesensingcrop_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Uncertainties in straw purchased price, government incentives, and technological improvements were considered. The results showed that it was not optimal for immediate investment in biomass power production in China. Given full government subsidy, the thresholds of straw purchased price for scenarios 1 and 2 are 213.55 and 218.87 RMB/ton, respectively, while the current straw purchased price in Chinese market is 220 RMB/ton. The investment of biomass power production would be executed at 2022 and 2028 with/without the consideration of revenue from CER in the current situation in China if there are no government incentive to encourage motivation, respectively.

Understanding the combined impacts of land use and soil property changes on soil erosion, especially in the area under long-term agricultural cultivations, is vital to watershed agricultural and soil management. This study investigated the temporal-spatial patterns of the soil erosion based on a modified version of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and conducted a soil erosion contribution analysis. The land use data were interpreted from Landsat series images, and soil properties were obtained from field sampling, laboratory tests and SPAW (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Water) model calculations. Over a long period of agricultural development, the average erosion modulus decreased from 187.7 t km− 2 a− 1 in 1979 to 158.4 t km− 2 a− 1 in 2014. The land use types were transformed mainly in the reclamation of paddy fields and the shrinking of wetlands on a large scale. Most of the soils were converted to loam from silty or clay loam and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of most soil types decreased by 1.11% to 43.6%. The rapidly increasing area of 49.8 km2 of paddy fields together with the moderate decrease of 14.0 km2 of forests, as well as Ks values explained 87.4% of the total variance in soil erosion. Although changes in soil physical and water characteristics indicated that soil erosion loads should have become higher, the upsurge in paddy fields played an important role in mitigating soil erosion in this study area. These results demonstrated that land use changes had more significant impacts than soil property changes on soil erosion.

Remotely Sensed Forest Structural Complexity Predicts Multi Species Occurrence At The Landscape Scale,"{""Baltensweiler, Andri"",""Bollmann, Kurt"",""Braunisch, Veronika"",""Zellweger, Florian""}",NA,"Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained (D-2) and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5\% to 63.1\% and 0.77\% to 0.97\% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry.

Parrotfish Soundscapes: Implications For Coral Reef Management,"{""Boyle, K. S."",""Tricas, T. C.""}",NA,"Parrotfishes are prominent members of the herbivore/detritivore feeding guild on coral reefs. Their feeding activity is important for the removal of algae and detritus, the clearing of new settlement sites for coral and other larvae, and the bioerosion and redistribution of sand across the reef. Estimates of parrotfish feeding activity are normally obtained by divers that may influence or overlook fish behaviors, and are of short duration, limited to shallow habitats, and have limited temporal resolution to associate feeding activity with ecological processes. Excavator and scraper parrotfishes have a robust beak-like jaw morphology that produces a unique sound as the teeth scrape the surface of hard coral rock. We tested the hypothesis that ambient parrotfish bite sounds can be used to estimate their temporal patterns of feeding and associations with environmental variates in the area of an acoustic recorder. Acoustic recorders were deployed on 2 Hawaiian reefs to collect ambient fish sounds for a period of 3 yr. Parrotfish bite sounds showed distinct and repetitive variations in daily, seasonal, and annual feeding patterns, and were statistically correlated with factors of day length and tide range. This study demonstrates the utility of using parrotfish bite sounds to estimate patterns of feeding at coral reef sites.

With the aeolian sandy fluvial land and loess hills in Yuyang District cited as subject, this study tried to predict soil organic content and distribution in the topsoil layer of the region of a varying resolution (30 m, 56 m and 250 m), using random forest (RF) algorithm and relevant thematic mapper (TM), advanced wide field sensor (AWIFS), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (M0DIS) and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) data, separately, and in addition, other various factors affecting distribution of soil organic matter, and to validate the predictions with soil samples collected from 324 sampling sites. Variables in the prediction were screened in the light of out-of-bag (OOB) errors the RF algorithm may yield. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the differences between predicted and observed values of soil organic matter relative to resolution. Entropies of the prediction, using the RF model, of distribution of soil organic matter in regions different in topography were compared. Besides, explanation of spatial variability of soil organic matter with the RF model was compared relative to resolution, and at the same time, various environmental variables in the aeolian sandy fluvial land area and loess hilly area were ranked in importance relative to resolution of the TM, AWIFS and MODIS data used, so as to identify the most important environmental variables affecting distribution of soil organic matter; and based on the partial dependence map of soil organic matter on the variables, specific range of the impacts of the main variables were delineated. Results showed that:1) in the aeolian sand fluvial land area, the prediction using the RF model and the AWIFS data is the highest in accuracy, with OOB error being 3.52 and correlation coefficient between predicted and measured values reaching 0.67, regardless of percentage of the samples taken for validation, while in the loess hilly area, the prediction based on the TM data is the highest, with OOB error being is 3.31 and correlation coefficient reaching 0.71. The prediction is better in the loess hilly area than in the aeolian sand fluvial land area, with MAE being in the range of 1.27 ∼ 1.57 g kg-1 in the former and in the range of 1.46 ∼ 2.08 g kg-1 in the latter. 2) ln the aeolian sand fluvial land area, vegetation is the most important factor affecting distribution of soil organic matter, and mostly in positive relationship with soil organic matter. Among the TM data, reduced simple ratio (RSR) is the highest in effect on soil organic matter, or > 7.5 g kg-1, among the AWIFS data, normalized difference vegetation green index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) are, or > 8.5 g kg-1, and among the MODIS data, NDVI is or > 8 g kg-1. Elevation is the second one and its impact varies the most sharply when it ranges between 1 200 and 1 260 m and peaks at 1 220 m. Distance from water source is the third one. As water sources in the aeolian sandy fluvial land area are quite scattered and small in area, their impacts on soil organic matter seldom exceed 500 m. 3) ln the loess hilly area, elevation is the most important factor affecting soil organic matter and negatively related to soil organic matter. Geographic location is the second one, soil organic matter declines in content from southwest to northeast in the area. Vegetation is the third one, in positive relationship with soil organic matter, but in all t e three types of datasets, the impacts of vegetation indices on soil organic matter never go beyond 8 g kg-1. So, it is quite obvious that in areas relatively simple in topography, it is advisable to use data relatively low in resolution instead of data high in resolution in predicting soil organic matter and the RF model is more effective in predicting in areas complex in topography.

Distinct Microalgae Species For Food-Part 1: A Methodological (Top-Down) Approach For The Life Cycle Assessment Of Microalgae Cultivation In Tubular Photobioreactors,"{""Meier, T."",""Schade, S.""}",NA,"Specific microalgae species are an adequate source of EPA and DHA and are able to provide a complete protein, which makes them highly interesting for human nutrition. However, microalgae cultivation has also been described to be energy intensive and environmentally unfavorable in pilot-scale reactors. Moreover, production in cold temperature zones has not been sufficiently investigated. In particular, the effects of tube materials and cultivation season length have rarely been previously investigated in the context of a comparative LCA of microalgae cultivation. A computational ""top-down"" model was conducted to calculate input flows forNannochloropsissp.andPhaeodactylum tricornutumcultivation in a hypothetical tubular photobioreactor. Cultivation processes were calculated according to detailed satellite climatic data for the chosen location in Central Germany. This model was applied to a set of different scenarios, including variations in photobioreactor material, tube diameter, microalgae species, and cultivation season length. Based on these data, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed following ISO standard 14040/44. The impact assessment comprised the global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, cumulative energy demand, and water scarcity. The results showed that a long cultivation season in spring and fall was always preferable in terms of environmental impacts, although productivity decreased significantly due to the climatic preconditions. Acrylic glass as a tube material had higher environmental impacts than all other scenarios. The cultivation of an alternative microalgae species showed only marginal differences in the environmental impacts compared with the baseline scenario. Critical processes in all scenarios included the usage of hydrogen peroxide for the cleaning of the tubes, nitrogen fertilizer, and electricity for mixing, centrifugation, and drying. Microalgae cultivation in a tubular photobioreactor in a ""cold-weather"" climate for food is sustainable and could possibly be a complement to nutrients from other food groups. The added value of this study lies in the detailed description of a complex and flexible microalgae cultivation model. The new model introduced in this study can be applied to numerous other scenarios to evaluate photoautotrophic microalgae cultivation in tubular photobioreactors. Thus, it is possible to vary the facility location, seasons, scale, tube dimensions and material, microalgae species, nutrient inputs, and flow velocity. Moreover, single processes can easily be complemented or exchanged to further adjust the model individually, if, for instance, another downstream pathway is required.",schade_distinctmicroalgaespeciesfood_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Hydrological Modeling To Identify And Manage Critical Erosion-Prone Areas For Improving Reservoir Life: Case Study Of Barakar Basin,"{""Chatterjee, Chandranath"",""Raghuwanshi, Narendra S."",""Sardar, Bidhan"",""Singh, Amit Kumar""}",NA,"In this investigation, an effort was made to model the hydrology and to identify critical erosion-prone areas of the Barakar Basin (6,293km2) in Jharkhand state, India using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). This effort is helpful to select and adopt suitable soil conservation measures to reduce soil erosion. Input data include daily rainfall, and air temperature; and monthly runoff, sediment yield and reservoir inflow data of 5years. Additional data were the topographical map, soil map, land resource data, and satellite imageries of the study area. The model was calibrated and validated for monthly inflow to the Maithon and Tilaiya Reservoirs for the periods of 1997-1999 and 2000-2001, respectively. In addition, it was also calibrated and validated for monthly runoff and sediment yield from two subwatersheds (Banha and Karso), located within Barakar Basin for the monsoon season of the same period. The calibration and validation results established good agreement (less than 10\% deviation) between the observed- and model-predicted values in all cases. The identified critical areas using model-predicted sediment yield were compared with results of a report obtained from the Soil Conservation Department of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Hazaribagh. The erosion class map developed using simulation results matched spatially well with the DVC-prepared map based on sediment yield index. A management plan was developed to treat the subwatersheds with conservation practices. Subwatersheds were divided into seven priority classes for treating them sequentially to reduce reservoir sedimentation rate. In the model, conservation practices were accounted for through curve number, universal soil loss equation (USLE) cover factor, USLE support factor, and farm pond. Adaptation of the management plan resulted in decreased sedimentation rate. The sedimentation rate decreased from the current rate of 0.76 and 4.59mm3/year to 0.56 and 1.41mm3/year for Tilaiya and Maithon Reservoirs, respectively. Furthermore, the life of Tilaiya and Maithon Reservoirs increased by 29 and 166years, respectively. These results suggest that SWAT can be used to identify critical subwatersheds and to develop management plans to control erosion from critical areas by reducing the reservoir sedimentation rate.",sardar_hydrologicalmodelingidentifymanage_2014,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Here we report on recent work to address some of these challenges for the Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) fishery in the Parnaiba Delta Protected Area. These include meetings to create inter-sector communication, citizen science and ethnobiology to support data collection and biological sampling, satellite tagging to discern tarpon movements, and the first data-limited stock assessment. The research occurred between September 2018 and April 2020 in the Parnaiba Delta and adjacent marine area, specifically in the Canarias Islands (MA), Pedra do Sal (PI), and Bitupita (CE). Gonadosomatic indices (GSI > 5\%) of female tarpon suggested that tarpon migrate to the Parnaiba Delta to spawn in the dry season (July-December). These GSI findings corresponded with the ethnobiology results in which the fishers confirmed more intense fishing effort in the dry periods due in part to the added value of the gonads. Satellite-tagged tarpon remained close to the Buraco and Boca da Barra fishery areas, thus, close to the Parnaiba Delta region.

Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed and reviewed the 374 articles on weather index insurance (WII) based on a systematic literature search on Web of Science and Scopus databases by using the systematic literature review method. Findings WII studies shifted their focus on growing and emerging areas of climate change impact risk. The finding shows that the impact of climate change risk significantly influenced the viability of WII in terms of pricing and design of WII. Therefore, the cost of WII premium increases due to the uncertainty of climate change impact that enhances the probability of losses related to insured weather risks. However, WII has emerged as a risk management tool of climate insurance for vulnerable agrarian communities. The efficacy of WII has been significantly influenced by repetitive environmental disasters and climate change phenomena. Research limitations/implications This study will be valuable for scholars to recognize the missing and emerging themes in WII.

As a result, ecosystems are damaged to varying degrees, and regional ecological environments tend to be weaker. The socio-ecological system in Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau, China, the researched area, also faces increasingly serious problems. To advance ecological civilization development in a coordinated way across the country, the national government and the competent authorities have launched a series of new strategies. Research on socio-ecological vulnerability, a major part of the ecosystem protection and restoration program, is provided with powerful spatial data observation and analysis tools thanks to the invention and development of remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. This study was based on the vulnerability scoping diagram (VSD) framework. Multi-source data such as digital elevation model (DEM), geographical data such as land use types, soil and geological disasters, remote sensing image data, meteorological data and social statistics data from 2005 to 2019 were used to construct the temporal social-ecosystem vulnerability evaluation index database of Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau. The spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) is applied to evaluating the socio-ecological vulnerability and analyzing its spatial-temporal variation in Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau. To probe into the driving effects of various impact factors on the socio-ecological vulnerability, the Geodetector is used to analyze the driving factors. The ordered weighted average (OWA) method is applied to the multi-scenario analysis of socio-ecological vulnerability in the researched area. The conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) from 2005 to 2019, the spatial distribution characteristics of exposure and sensitivity in Aba Prefecture were higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest, and the overall spatial distribution characteristics of socio-ecological system vulnerability showed that the degree of vulnerability increased from the north to the southeast. (2) Extreme natural climate conditions play a leading role in the driving of socio-ecosystem vulnerability, followed by human production activities and geological hazards. (3) The degree of social-ecosystem vulnerability in Aba Prefecture will increase with the increase of decision risk coefficient. The results of social-ecosystem vulnerability under the status quo scenario are similar to those in 2010 and 2019, indicating that the selected evaluation factors can reflect the actual social-ecosystem vulnerability. In the sustainable guided scenario and the unsustainable guided scenario, the proportion of the area of the social-ecosystem severe vulnerability level was at the minimum value and the maximum value, respectively.",yang_socioecologicalvulnerabilityaba_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The GIS-based RUSLE model used variables like soil erodibility (K), soil coverage (C), topographic effect (LS), rainfall runoff (R), and erosion control practices (P) to estimate the amount of soil that had been washed away in the study area. The study provided valuable information that can be used to plan and administer soil protection in the Shaqlawa district. The average yearly soil loss in the study region is estimated to be 65.66 t ha-1 year-1. The district is experiencing significant soil erosion rates, which may have detrimental effects on agricultural productivity, water quality, and environmental health. The analysis revealed that Balisan, Hiran, Shaqlawa center, and part of the Salahaddin subdistrict are the most affected areas, with high values of LS and R factors contributing to significant soil erosion rates.

In agricultural landscape, the increase of water area in non-karst area is more than twice that of karst area, but the dominant landscape types of karst and non-karst areas have not changed. In both regions, the agricultural landscape has undergone significant changes, but the rate of change in karst area is greater, indicating that the change in karst area is stronger and more significant than that in non-karst areas. 2) In the past 10 years, the area of agricultural landscape in Karst was reduced by 472.23 hm2, and the non Karst area decreased by 476.28 hm2, but the reduction rate of Karst area was higher than that of non Karst region. Compared with the non Karst area, the landscape in Karst area is more fragmented, the patch shape is more dispersed and complex, and the landscape heterogeneity is even higher. On the one hand, the change of landscape pattern in karst and non-karst areas is due to the requirements of urban construction, industry and traffic layout. On the other hand is affected by the policy, making agricultural landscape internal change. 3) In the past 10 years, the total value of ecosystem services in prefectures and counties increased continuously, but the increase was small. In addition, the value of ecosystem services was reduced by RMB 1 million in karst areas. On the contrary, District ecosystem service value it increased by RMB 4 million in the non-karst areas. It can be seen that human activities have affected both karst and non-karst areas, but the influence of karst area is larger, leads to a decrease in karst area ecosystem service value. Among them, the largest contribution rate to the decrease of service value of the two regional ecosystems is the decrease of forested land, which reaches 78% in karst area and 83% in non-karst area. During the study period, although the value of ecosystem services provided by woodland decreased, the value of ecosystem services provided by water landscape increased. The increased value of ecosystem services in the two regions is due to the increase in water landscape. Since the forestry has a decisive role in the value of the ecosystem services of the two regions, it would be helpful to improve the ecosystem services of the study area, and improve the overall value of ecosystem services in the study area. © Tropical Geography 2018.",shi_changecomparisonagriculturallandscape_2018,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Landsat Imagery Spectral Trajectories-Important Variables For Spatially Predicting The Risks Of Bark Beetle Disturbance,"{""Berec, Ludek"",""Braaten, Justin"",""Broz, Zdenek"",""Bruna, Josef"",""Hais, Martin"",""Kennedy, Robert"",""Wild, Jan""}",NA,"Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests. Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come from forests in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power, even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors, and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model. Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions. The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.",hais_landsatimageryspectraltrajectories_2016,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

This study seeks to understand how syndromic data informed specific public health actions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Methods. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with participants from Ontario's public health departments, the provincial ministry of health and federal public health agency to gather information about syndromic surveillance systems used and the role of syndromic data in informing specific public health actions taken during the pandemic. Responses were compared with how the same decisions were made by non-syndromic surveillance users. Results: Findings from 56 interviews (82% response) show that syndromic data were most used for monitoring virus activity, measuring impact on the health care system and informing the opening of influenza assessment centres in several jurisdictions, and supporting communications and messaging, rather than its intended purpose of early outbreak detection. Syndromic data had limited impact on decisions that involved the operation of immunization clinics, school closures, sending information letters home with school children or providing recommendations to health care providers. Both syndromic surveillance users and non-users reported that guidance from the provincial ministry of health, communications with stakeholders and vaccine availability were driving factors in these public health decisions. Conclusions: Syndromic surveillance had limited use in decision-making during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Ontario. This study provides insights into the reasons why this occurred. Despite this, syndromic data were valued for providing situational awareness and confidence to support public communications and recommendations. Developing an understanding of how syndromic data are utilized during public health events provides valuable evidence to support future investments in public health surveillance. © 2012 Chu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",chu_syndromicsurveillancedecisionh1n1_2012,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

To this end, CAMS global and regional forecast data are analysed and compared against observations from passive (MODIS: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard Terra and Aqua) and active (CALIOP/CALIPSO: Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite sensors and ground-based measurements (EMEP: European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme). The analysis of the CAMS global forecast indicates that dust and smoke aerosols, discretely located on the warm and cold fronts of Ophelia, respectively, were affecting the aerosol atmospheric composition over Europe during the passage of the Storm. The observed MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are satisfactorily reproduced by the CAMS global forecast system, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and a fractional gross error (FGE) of 0.4. The comparison with a CAMS global control simulation not including data assimilation indicates a significant improvement in the bias due to data assimilation implementation, as the FGE decreases by 32 \%. The qualitative evaluation of the IFS (Integrated Forecast System) dominant-aerosol type and location against the CALIPSO observations overall reveals a good agreement. Regarding the footprint on air quality, both CAMS global and regional forecast systems are generally able to reproduce the observed signal of increase in surface particulate matter concentrations. The regional component performs better in terms of bias and temporal variability, with the correlation deteriorating over forecast time. Yet, both products exhibit inconsistencies on the quantitative and temporal representation of the observed surface particulate matter enhancements, stressing the need for further development of the air quality forecast systems for even more accurate and timely support of citizens and policy-makers.",akritidis_complexaerosoltransportevent_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Where The Wild Things Are: Using Remotely Sensed Forest Productivity To Assess Arboreal Marsupial Species Richness And Abundance,"{""Held, A. A."",""Lindenmayer, D. B."",""Stein, J."",""Yoon, H. J."",""Youngentob, K. N.""}",NA,"Aim: Highly productive areas have long been hypothesized to support a greater abundance and diversity of animals than less productive areas. However, evidence for this is equivocal and, until recently, has been difficult to test at a landscape level. For the first time, we use imaging spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between plant productivity and arboreal mammal species richness and abundance at a landscape scale. Location: A eucalypt forest in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Using a common index of plant productivity - normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) - as a proxy for available energy, we test the ability of species-energy theory and optimal foraging theory to explain variations in arboreal marsupial species richness and abundance. We obtained NDVI data from an airborne imaging spectrophotometer. Results: Species richness increased in relation to NDVI among 53 eucalypt forest sites, based on five arboreal marsupial species. The presence and abundance of a eucalypt folivore specialist, Petauroides volans, increased in relation to NDVI. The relative abundance of all arboreal marsupials collectively also increased in relation to NDVI among sites, even with P. volans data excluded. In support of optimal foraging theory, the observed locations of P. volans had a higher NDVI value than the average for sampling transects. In addition, the average NDVI of eucalypt forest remnants was positively related to the overall abundance of P. volans. An important caveat is that NDVI did not explain all the variation in arboreal marsupial populations. Main conclusions: Assuming that NDVI is an appropriate proxy for available energy in a eucalypt forest, our results are consistent with predictions from species-energy and optimal foraging theories. Remotely sensed measures of productivity and forage quality, used in conjunction with other important landscape characteristics, provide a potentially powerful tool to evaluate habitat and biodiversity hotspots at scales relevant to wildlife management and conservation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",youngentob_wildremotelysensedforest_2015,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Most of the previous studies have focused on the outcomes of implementing IP without addressing the underlying factors. The success or failure factors of these new approaches remain unclear. The present study seeks to compare the factors of the institutional environment that influence the results of implementation of traditional leafy vegetable (LFT) platforms to SDM results. Four case studies including two IPs and two SDMs were chosen in a reasoned way in terms of the importance or not of the market dynamics (whether or not there are any inputs market, LFT sales markets, establishment of formal or informal sales links, etc.) and the diversity of organizations (the existence of OP, importance of NGOs and support project, intervention of local structures, gender, etc.). These cases are presented following an analytical framework combining innovation systems and functionnal analysis. Data is collected through structured, semi-structured interviews, direct observations, testimonials, etc. The data collected relates to each stage of the implementation process and concerns the actors (types of actors, profile of the actors, relationships developed, roles, attitudes, practices, perceptions, etc.), the different activities carried out (entrepreneurial, learning, dissemination of innovations, investment in developed markets, mobilization of human resources, material financial resources, lobbying of interest groups), difficulties encountered and approaches to solutions. The method of analysis is essentially qualitative. The results showed that IPs as well as SDM are influenced by the previous existence of market in the implementation context. IP cannot work when traders do not show interest in the product including TLV on which study focused. We recommend for scaling up innovations that IP initiatives take this factor into account to ensure the effectiveness of its implementation. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Response To Resources And Parasites Depends On Health Status In Extensively Grazed Sheep,"{""Bull, K."",""Ioannou, C. C."",""Liddell, C."",""Morgan, E. R.""}",NA,"A fundamental question in animal ecology is how an individual's internal state and the external environment together shape species distributions across habitats. The increasing availability of biologgers is driving a revolution in answering this question in a wide range of species. In this study, the position of sheep (Ovis aries) from Global Positioning System collars was integrated with remote sensing data, field sampling of parasite distributions, and parasite load and health measures for each tagged individual. This allowed inter-individual variation in habitat use to be examined. Once controlling for a positive relationship between vegetation productivity and tick abundance, healthier individuals spent more of their time at sites with higher vegetation productivity, while less healthy individuals showed a stronger (negative) response to tick abundance. These trends are likely to represent a trade-off in foraging decisions that vary between individuals based on their health status. Given the rarity of studies that explore how animal distributions are affected by health and external factors, we demonstrate the value of integrating biologging technology with remote sensing data, traditional ecological sampling and individual measures of animal health.

Cognitive Satellite Spectrum Management Scheme Based On The Cooperative Solidarity Values,"{""Kim, S.""}",NA,"With the rapid development of satellite services, the requirement for improving satellite spectrum efficiency has become significant, and attracted great attention from researchers and industry practitioners. Recently, cognitive satellite communication mechanism dynamically accesses idle bands of licensed spectrum while enabling spectrum sharing among satellite and terrestrial agents. In this paper, we propose a new spectrum management scheme for cognitive satellite communications. To effectively improve spectrum efficiency, the concepts of cooperative Solidarity values are adopted by compromising between productivity and solidarity principles. Based on two Solidarity values - Solidarity and Solidarity with size p values, our two-step interactive game approach can leverage the full synergy that gives mutual advantage. The main novelty of our proposed scheme is to ensure the trade-off between marginalism and egalitarianism. Therefore, we can take various benefits in a rational way to reach a fair-efficient agreement under the dynamic changing satellite network environments.

Vegetation-Based Ecosystem Service Delivery In Urban Landscapes: A Systematic Review,"{""Hassall, Christopher"",""Peacock, Julie"",""Stroud, Sebastian""}",NA,"The use of plants in cities and the ecosystem services they provide has attracted increased attention both publicly and within the research literature. Increasingly, the value of urban green and blue space is being recognised for its multiple benefits to human wellness and ecological integrity.\& nbsp;A quantitative assessment of studies considering nature-based solutions and ecosystem services can identify the current evidence -base for improving the provisioning of plant ecosystem services management and understanding barriers to adoption of nature-based solutions. Here, we provide a systematic review of the literature to characterise the current state of research on ecosystem service provision by urban blue and green space.\& nbsp;We identified 684 relevant studies on urban plant literature and extracted key research themes. Studies were generally focused on terrestrial systems (89\%) compared to aquatic systems such as blue space (11\%). Geographically most studies were focused on Europe (39\%), Asia (23\%), and N. America (22\%). Trees were the most frequently reported vegetation type studies (29\%) followed by generic vegetation (20\%), grassland (11\%), forest (7\%), and aquatic vegetation (5\%). Many studies were short (41\%), collecting data only over a single year or single field season. Many of the long-term studies are concerning land use/land cover change. Most studies (64\%) were conducted for less than five years. The most-reported methodology was remote sensing technology (15\%), followed by field surveys (8\%), stakeholder surveys (6\%), and ecosystem service models (5\%). The most-reported ecosystem service types were regulation and maintenance (54\%), cultural (28\%), and provisioning (16\%). Only a small number of studies looked solely at disservice (1\%) or discussed ecosystem services in generic terms. Disservices were reported in only 16\% of studies with the greatest single category of a disservice being biogenic volatile organic compounds and allergenic potential. Few studies (13\%) reported on the use of nature-based solutions and these 80\% only focused on a single nature-based solution. There was a lack of detail on plant species, 68\% (n = 468) did not list the species studied.\& nbsp;We conclude that there is a broad spectrum of research on urban vegetation services, overall, the focus of the literature is uneven. Research should seek to examine the species-specific responses to urbanisation and counter geographic disparities. There is also a need for longitudinal experimental data to identify the functioning and ecosystem service provision of green infrastructure in both urban green and blue space and factors that influence performance over policy-and management-relevant timescales.

In this study, the seasonal pigment dynamics of two Tecticornia species (samphires; halophytic shrubs) from north-western Australia were correlated with spectral indices that best document the pigment changes over time. Pigment dynamics were assessed by analysing betacyanin, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations at plant level and by measuring reflectance at contrasting seasonal dates. Plant reflectance was used to define a new reflectance index that was most sensitive to the seasonal shifts in Tecticornia pigment concentrations. The two Tecticornia species turned from green to red-pinkish for the period March–August 2012 when betacyanins increased almost nine times in both species. Chlorophyll levels showed the opposite pattern to that of betacyanins, whereas carotenoid levels were relatively stable. Normalised difference indices correlated well with betacyanin (r = 0.805, using bands at 600 and 620 nm) and chlorophyll (r = 0.809, using bands at 737 and 726 nm). Using knowledge of chlorophyll concentrations slightly improved the ability of the spectral index to predict betacyanin concentration (r = 0.822 at bands 606 and 620 nm, in the case of chemically determined chlorophyll, r = 0.809 when using remotely sensed chlorophyll). Our results suggest that this new spectral index can reliably detect changes in betacyanin concentrations in vegetation, with potential applications in ecological studies and environmental impact monitoring. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",marchesini_spectraldetectionstressrelated_2016,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Consequently, the scientific community faces uncertainty on key climate issues, such as the nature of temperature trends in the troposphere and stratosphere; the climatology, radiative effects, and hydrological role of water vapor in the upper troposphere and stratosphere; and the vertical profile of changes in atmospheric ozone, aerosols, and other trace constituents. Radiosonde data provide adequate vertical resolution to address these issues, but they have questionable accuracy and time-varying biases due to changing instrumentation and techniques. Although satellite systems provide global coverage, their vertical resolution is sometimes inadequate and they require independent reference observations for sensor and data product validation, and for merging observations from different platforms into homogeneous climate records. To address these shortcomings, and to ensure that future climate records will be more useful than the records to date, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) program is initiating a GCOS Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) to provide high-quality observations using specialized radiosondes and complementary remote sensing profiling instrumentation that can be used for validation. This paper outlines the scientific rationale for GRUAN, its role in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, network requirements and likely instrumentation, management structure, current status, and future plans.

Improving The Efficiency Of Conservation Policies With The Use Of Surrogates Derived From Remotely Sensed And Ancillary Data,"{""Chen, X."",""Li, Y."",""Liu, J."",""Liu, W."",""Ouyang, Z."",""Viña, A."",""Yang, W.""}",NA,"Conservation policies are emerging in many places around the world, many of which involve payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes. PES schemes provide economic incentives for forgoing land uses that reduce the provision of ecosystem services. The efficiency of such schemes depends not only on the ecosystem services provided by an area but also on the willingness of local people to forgo their land use activities. Targeting land for enrollment in PES schemes on the basis of the potential provision of ecosystem services and on the willingness to forgo certain economic activities, may therefore improve the efficiency of these schemes. The objective of this study was to develop a targeting approach, based on three surrogates derived from remotely sensed and ancillary data, for identifying land to be enrolled in one of the largest PES schemes in the world: China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP). The GTGP encourages farmers to return steep hillside cropland to forest by providing cash, grain and tree seedlings. The three surrogates used in the targeting approach were slope index, cropland probability, and GTGP enrollment probability. Combining these surrogates through Bernoulli trials allows targeting areas under cropland, with low opportunity costs for farmers and with potentially high soil erosion and landslide susceptibility. Results of applying the targeting approach in a case study area (Baoxing County, Sichuan Province, China) show that around half of the land currently enrolled is placed in areas with gentle slopes and tend to be located distant from forest areas. This reduces the potential benefits obtained from the GTGP. Targeting land using the proposed approach may double the benefits obtained from the program under the same budget, thus improving its efficiency. The approach may be applied to the entire GTGP implementation area in China and with proper modifications it may also be applicable to similar PES programs around the world. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Study focus: Through a semi-systematic literature review, this study evaluates the existing literature in the Andes on the topic, assesses how, where, and the extent to which remote sensing is being deployed in drought studies in the region, and points to key gaps in our regional understanding of this topic of high societal and environmental concern. New hydrological insight for the region: Remote sensing applications in drought studies remain limited in the Andes but have grown substantially since 2020. The reviewed studies concentrate on Chile and offer new insight into the impact of drought on vegetation, water bodies, the cryosphere, and wildfire incidence. Human activity, through agricultural decision-making and other socioeconomic dimensions, plays a role in propagating or deepening drought in the region.

Assessment Of The Value Of Remotely Sensed Surface Water Extent Data For The Calibration Of A Lumped Hydrological Model,"{""Meyer Oliveira, A."",""Seibert, J."",""Vis, M."",""van Meerveld, H. J.""}",NA,"For many catchments, there is insufficient field data to calibrate the hydrological models that are needed to answer water resources management questions. One way to overcome this lack of data is to use remotely sensed data. In this study, we assess whether Landsat-based surface water extent observations can inform the calibration of a lumped bucket-type model for Brazilian catchments. We first performed synthetic experiments with daily, monthly, and limited monthly data (April–October), assuming a perfect monotonic relation between streamflow and stream width. The median relative performance was 0.35 for daily data and 0.17 for monthly data, where values above 0 imply an improvement in model performance compared to the lower benchmark. This indicates that the limited temporal resolution of remotely sensed data is not an impediment for model calibration. In a second step, we used real remotely sensed water extent data for calibration. For only 76 of the 671 sites the remotely sensed water extent was large and variable enough to be used for model calibration. For 30% of these sites, calibration with the actual remotely sensed water extent data led to a model fit that was better than the lower benchmark (i.e., relative performance >0). Model performance increased with river width and variation therein. This indicates that the coarse spatial resolution of the freely-available, long time series of water extent used in this study hampered model calibration. We, therefore, expect that newer higher-resolution imagery will be helpful for model calibration for more sites, especially when time series length increases. © 2023.

Effects Of Vegetation Restoration On Soil Conservation And Sediment Loads In China: A Critical Review,"{""Lu, X."",""Ran, L."",""Xu, J.""}",NA,"China has been one of the countries suffering from the most serious soil erosion, which has severely degraded soil productivity and water quality, thus affecting agricultural activities and hindering economic and social development. During the past few decades, a large amount of effort has been made to combat soil erosion. Vegetation restoration as a major strategy is given equal importance compared to engineering measures. Although a measure of success has been achieved, many uncertainties remain unanswered such as to what extent the vegetation restoration has reduced soil erosion and sediment loads especially in large river systems. This paper first analyzes the impacts of vegetation restoration on soil erosion and sediment loads in terms of vegetation cover and vegetation species. Then, the spatial scale effect of soil erosion reduction benefit resulting from vegetation restoration is elaborated. Soil erosion reduction benefit decreases with increased vegetation planting area. In addition, a comprehensive discussion about the disputes between vegetation restoration and engineering measures is made by integrating published studies spanning large spatial and temporal scales. Finally, future research needs regarding vegetation restoration efforts are given. In order to evaluate the effects of vegetation restoration programs on soil erosion, assessments in shorter time interval and larger spatial scale should be undertaken. Further, the present assessment system mainly based on simple statistical methods has to be improved.

"An Integrated Approach To Trophic Assessment Of Coastal Waters Incorporating Measurement, Modelling And Water Quality Classification","{""Hartnett, M."",""Nash, S."",""Olbert, I.""}",NA,"Various protocols have been developed for trophic assessment of coastal waters but most incorporate single value compliance criteria for water quality parameters which, in reality, exhibit significant spatial variation.

The present approach to trophic assessment integrates measurement, remote sensing, flushing analysis and water quality modelling with the aim of identifying sub-regions in coastal waterbodies that demonstrate homogeneity. Averaged water quality data for these homogenous sub-regions should be more representative of the water quality in the sub-region as a whole making the assessment process more accurate. The integrated approach incorporates water quality classification criteria developed by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency but it can incorporate any suitable classification criteria. The approach was validated for a sub-region of Cork Harbour, Ireland and the trophic assessments agreed with previous assessments by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Methods: Bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N = 86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation. Results: A total of 0%, 17.9% and 34.7% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area. Main conclusions: Expansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts.

In this study we assess the benefit of using global precipitation datasets to improve surface water availability estimates. A reference area that can be irrigated is established using a complete record of 30 years of observed river discharge data. Areas are then determined using simulated river discharges from six local hydrological models forced with in situ and global precipitation datasets (CHIRPS and MSWEP), each calibrated independently with a sample of 5 years extracted from the full 30-year record. The utility of establishing the irrigated area based on simulated river discharge simulations is compared against the reference area through a pooled relative utility value (PRUV). Results show that for all river discharge simulations the benefit of choosing the irrigated area based on the 30 years of simulated data is higher compared to using only 5 years of observed discharge data, as the statistical spread of PRUV using 30 years is smaller. Hence, it is more beneficial to calibrate a hydrological model using 5 years of observed river discharge and then to extend it with global precipitation data of 30 years as this weighs up against the model uncertainty of the model calibration.",kaune_globalprecipitationdatasetsbenefit_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
From Bamako To Kolda: A Case Study Of Medicines And The Financing Of District Health Services,"{""Diao, M."",""Mbaye, A."",""Unger, J.

Although the $US 180 million requested from donors by UNICEF has not been forthcoming, nevertheless about 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are at present implementing Bamako-type projects. The management of these projects may perhaps benefit from experience in the district of Kolda in Senegal, a country in which the principle of the self-management of receipts by health service structures has been established since 1981.In 1985, in the rural district (departement) of Kolda, Senegal, situated 450 km from Dakar, the health service was not being used by the population. The district management team attempted to change the pattern of under-utilization by rationalizing the mechanisms for financing services and supplies of pharmaceuticals. After the introduction of new forms of management and control, the hospital issue of prescriptions for the purchase of drugs at private pharmacies was stopped. The result was an increase in the utilization of services and in receipts, which made it possible to increase the stocks held by the pharmacy. It is planned to make the services of the pharmacy available to satellite dispensaries, giving priority to those which under take to rationalize their prescribing of medicines and to alter their methods of financing. © 1990 Oxford University Press.",unger_bamakokoldastudymedicines_1990,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
An Integrated Method To Create Habitat Suitability Models For Fragmented Landscapes,"{""Amici, Valerio"",""Battisti, Corrado"",""Geri, Francesco""}",NA,"Given the pervasive influence of human induced habitat fragmentation in ecological processes, landscape models are a welcome advance. The development of GIS software has allowed a greater use of these models and of analyses of the relationship between species and habitat variables. Habitat suitability models are thus theoretical concepts that can be used for planning in fragmented landscapes and habitat conservation. The most commonly used models are based on single species and on the assignment of suitability values for some environmental variables. Generally the cartographic basis for modeling suitability are thematic maps produced by a Boolean logic. In this paper we propose a model based on a set of focal species and on maps produced by a fuzzy classification method. Focal species, selected by an expert-based approach, provide a practical way of extending the scope of habitat suitability models to the conservation of biodiversity at landscape scale. The utilisation of a classification method that applies a continuity criterion may allow more consideration of the connectivity of an area because it allows a better detection of ecological gradients within a landscape. We applied this methodology to the Tuscany region focusing on terrestrial mammals. Performing a fuzzy classification we produced five land cover maps and through image processing operations we obtained a suitability model which applies a continuity criterion. The resulting suitability fuzzy model seems better for the study of connectivity and fragmentation, especially in areas with high spatial complexity. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Brazil's Amazon Soy Moratorium Reduced Deforestation,"{""Gibbs, Holly K."",""Heilmayr, Robert"",""Munger, Jacob"",""Rausch, Lisa L.""}",NA,"Between 2004 and 2012, multiple policies contributed to one of the great conservation successes of the twenty-first century-an 84\% decrease in the rate of Brazilian Amazon deforestation. Among the most prominent of these policies is the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an agreement by grain traders not to purchase soy grown on recently deforested land. The ASM inspired widespread adoption of similar zero-deforestation commitments, but its impact is poorly understood due to its overlap with other conservation policies. Here, we apply an econometric triple-differences model to remotely sensed deforestation data to isolate the ASM's impact within Brazil's Arc of Deforestation. We show that the ASM reduced deforestation in soy-suitable locations in the Amazon by 0.66 +/- 0.32 percentage points relative to a counterfactual control, preventing 18,000 +/- 9,000 km(2) of deforestation over its first decade (2006-2016). Although these results highlight potential benefits of private conservation policies, the ASM's success was dependent on complementarities with public property registries and deforestation monitoring. Disentangling the impacts of anti-deforestation interventions from other conservation efforts remains a challenge. An econometric analysis of remotely sensed data reveals the efficacy of the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation and the extent to which its success relies on complementary policies.",heilmayr_brazil'samazonsoymoratorium_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Landsat-Based Monitoring Of Southern Pine Beetle Infestation Severity And Severity Change In A Temperate Mixed Forest,"{""Gao, Renjie"",""Huang, Chengquan"",""Huang, Zehua"",""Lv, Zhengang"",""Meng, Ran"",""Sun, Rui"",""Zhao, Feng""}",NA,"The recent northward expansion of Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) outbreaks associated with warming winters has caused extensive tree mortality in temperate pine forests, significantly affecting forest dynamics, structure, and functioning. Spatially-explicit early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality is critical for timely and sustainable forest management practices. The unique contributions of remote sensing technologies to mapping the location, extent, and severity of beetle outbreaks, as well as assisting in analyzing the potential drivers for outbreak predictions, have been well recognized. However, little is known about the performance of moderate resolution satellite multispectral imagery for early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality. Thus, we conducted this study, as the first attempt, to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of SPB infestation severity at the regional scale and to understand the underlying environmental drivers in a spatially-explicit manner. First, we explored the spectral signatures of SPB-killed trees based on 30-m plot measurements and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, to improve detection accuracy for areas with low-moderate SPB infestation severity, we added spectraltemporal anomaly information in the form of a linear trend of the spectral index trajectory to a previously developed approach. The best overall accuracy increased from 84.7\% to 90.1\% and the best Macro F1 value increased from 0.832 to 0.900. Next, we compared the performances of spectral indices in mapping SPB infestation severity (i.e., \% red stage within the 30-m grid cell). The results showed that the combination of Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness had the best performance for mapping SPB infestation severity (2016: R2 = 0.754; RSME = 15.7; 2017: R2 = 0.787; RSME = 12.4). Finally, we found that climatic and landscape variables can explain the detected patterns of SPB infestation from 2014 to 2017 in our study area (R2 = 0.751; RSME = 9.67), providing valuable insights on possible predictors for early warning of SPB infestation. Specifically, in our study area, winter dew point temperature was found to be one of the most important predictors, followed by SPB infestation locations in the previous year, canopy cover of host species, elevation, and slope. In the context of continued global warming, our study not only provides a novel framework for efficient, spatially-explicit, and quantitative measurements of forest damage induced by SPB infestation over large scales, but also uncovers opportunities to predict future SPB outbreaks and take precautions against it.",meng_landsatbasedmonitoringsouthern_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Conservation And Development: Evidence From Thai Protected Areas,"{""Sims, Katharine R.

This paper presents new evidence about the local effects of strictly protected areas in Thailand, combining data on socioeconomic outcomes from a poverty mapping study with satellite-based estimates of forest cover. The selective placement of protected areas is addressed by controlling for characteristics which drove both protection and development and by instrumenting for protection with priority watershed status. The estimates indicate that protected areas increased average consumption and lowered poverty rates, despite imposing binding constraints on agricultural land availability. Socioeconomic gains are likely explained by increased tourism in and around protected areas. However, net impacts are largest at intermediate distances from major cities, highlighting that the spatial patterns of both costs and benefits are important for efforts to minimize conservation-development tradeoffs.

UAV systems can generate high-resolution images that provide accurate information on forest ecosystems to aid decision-making in restoration projects. However, UAV technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining UAV-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar data—canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and understory LAI—and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral data—15 vegetation indices (VIs), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that VIs were positively correlated with LAI for low LAI values, but stabilized for LAI greater than 2 m2/m2. LAI and structural VIs increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted AGB than hyperspectral-derived VIs, it was the fusion of UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration.

Here, the vertical distribution of aerosols and how it has changed from 2006 to 2017 is studied using time series data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite. Aerosol centroid altitude, a variable representing the aerosol vertical extent, is estimated using the aerosol flags of the Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) product of CALIOP. The case study includes four overpasses, with various aerosol types and densities, covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and India regions characterized by frequent dust storms and smoke emissions, respectively, and Europe, a pioneer in establishing air quality policies. The values of aerosol centroid altitude are examined to determine the effects of climate (space) and season (time) on aerosol vertical distribution. For this purpose, 10-year mean values of aerosol centroid altitude were calculated over climate regions extracted from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) climate map as well as over each season, and the resultant values were then statistically analyzed. The results indicate that environmental heat, steam from climate or season, leads to aerosols increasing in altitude. The time series was imported in a version of the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, so-called BFAST01, allowing the magnitude of gradual changes along with the time and type of the major abrupt change to be determined. The strongest positive trends in aerosol centroid altitude were recorded in the desert regions. Positive trends were also observed in the mid-latitudes steppes and the North Sea. India was another region with a relatively positive trend which could be mainly caused by the increasing anthropogenic activities and smoke emission. The strongest negative trend detected in Europe is a result of strict environmental regulation policies and efforts for air quality improvement. The results show that a small fraction of granules (12 out of 4036) mainly in the northern part of overpass A, over Europe, the mid part of overpasses B and C, over the Middle East, and southern part of overpass D, over India, experienced structural changes. The reversal changes type 8 (50% of the abrupt changes) and interruption type 6 (33%) are the dominant types, mostly occurred around 2014 and 2012, respectively. Changing environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, and anthropogenic activities are the main drivers of these changes.

In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise.Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs.

Three years of aerial photo and satellite imagery studies (2000, 2010 and 2020) are used to determine urbanization which was input into the study of land-use changes to demonstrate the situation of urban sprawl. The changes in land use pattern of Bangkok and its vicinities during 2000–2020 demonstrates the consequences of urban migration based on Urban Index (UI) which presents urban sprawling of Bangkok to its vicinities.

The coastal forests of Tanzania have increasingly been recognized as being of global biodiversity importance, due to high rates of species endemism. Rates of forest loss are similar to those of other tropical regions, resulting in increasing levels of threat for the biological values within the remaining forest and potentially significant source of CO 2 emissions. This study estimated the remaining cover and carbon stock of Tanzania's coastal forests and the CO 2 emissions due to forest loss between c. 1990 and c. 2007. Coastal Tanzania contained over 273 700 ha of forest in 2007. Deforestation rates in the area have slowed from 1.0% yr 1, or > 3735 ha yr 1 during the 1990s, to 0.4% yr 1, or > 1233 ha yr 1 during 2000-2007. Despite lower deforestation rates in 2000-2007, the percentage forest lost from within reserved areas has remained steady at 0.2% yr 1 for both time periods.

"Prescribed Burning Protects Endangered Tropical Heathlands Of The Arnhem Plateau, Northern Australia","{""Cochrane, M. A."",""Murphy, B. P."",""Russell-Smith, J.""}",NA,"Summary: There are concerns that frequent intense fires are reducing biodiversity on the Arnhem Plateau within Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. Since the 1980s, prescribed burning in the early dry season has aimed to reduce the extent of late dry season wildfires. A programme of more strategic prescribed burning has been undertaken since 2007, aiming to increase intervals between fires affecting heathland and rain forest communities. We assess the effectiveness of prescribed burning in Kakadu's Stone Country using a Landsat satellite-derived fire history (1980-2011), in terms of achieving 'tolerable fire intervals' for dominant plant communities. Our analysis indicates that fire regimes have become substantially more favourable for biodiversity since the early 1980s. Although annual extent of burning has remained unchanged, two significant changes in fire regimes have occurred over the long term: (i) a switch from late dry season dominance to early dry season dominance and (ii) an increase in the abundance of long-unburnt vegetation, both of which are likely to benefit biodiversity. Demonstrating the statistical significance of changes associated with recent, more strategic fire management (2007-2011) is limited by the short duration of this management approach, although there is evidence of increasing abundance of long-unburnt vegetation during this time. The view that the Arnhem Plateau's fire regimes are increasingly driving biodiversity loss (due to frequent late dry season wildfires) is erroneous; they are in a more benign state now than at any time over the last three decades, most likely due to extensive use of prescribed burning. Synthesis and applications. In highly fire-prone landscapes, such as savannas, prescribed burning can be an effective means of: (i) bringing forward peak fire activity to the time of year when fire conditions are relatively mild and (ii) increasing abundance of long-unburnt vegetation. These changes are likely to favour persistence of a range of fire-sensitive communities. Our case study supports the strategic use of prescribed burning to protect fire-sensitive biota within highly fire-prone landscapes throughout the world.

Crowdsourced Data For Bicycling Research And Practice,"{""Ferster, C."",""Fuller, D."",""Laberee, K."",""Nelson, T."",""Winters, M.""}",NA,"Cities are promoting bicycling for transportation as an antidote to increased traffic congestion, obesity and related health issues, and air pollution. However, both research and practice have been stalled by lack of data on bicycling volumes, safety, infrastructure, and public attitudes. New technologies such as GPS-enabled smartphones, crowdsourcing tools, and social media are changing the potential sources for bicycling data. However, many of the developments are coming from data science and it can be difficult evaluate the strengths and limitations of crowdsourced data. In this narrative review we provide an overview and critique of crowdsourced data that are being used to fill gaps and advance bicycling behaviour and safety knowledge. We assess crowdsourced data used to map ridership (fitness, bike share, and GPS/accelerometer data), assess safety (web-map tools), map infrastructure (OpenStreetMap), and track attitudes (social media). For each category of data, we discuss the challenges and opportunities they offer for researchers and practitioners. Fitness app data can be used to model spatial variation in bicycling ridership volumes, and GPS/accelerometer data offer new potential to characterise route choice and origin-destination of bicycling trips; however, working with these data requires a high level of training in data science. New sources of safety and near miss data can be used to address underreporting and increase predictive capacity but require grassroots promotion and are often best used when combined with official reports. Crowdsourced bicycling infrastructure data can be timely and facilitate comparisons across multiple cities; however, such data must be assessed for consistency in route type labels. Using social media, it is possible to track reactions to bicycle policy and infrastructure changes, yet linking attitudes expressed on social media platforms with broader populations is a challenge. New data present opportunities for improving our understanding of bicycling and supporting decision making towards transportation options that are healthy and safe for all. However, there are challenges, such as who has data access and how data crowdsourced tools are funded, protection of individual privacy, representativeness of data and impact of biased data on equity in decision making, and stakeholder capacity to use data given the requirement for advanced data science skills. If cities are to benefit from these new data, methodological developments and tools and training for end-users will need to track with the momentum of crowdsourced data. © 2020 The Author(s).

Location Amazonia. Taxon Ground truth data on ferns and lycophytes; remote sensing results reflect forest canopy properties. Methods We used field plot data to assess main ecological gradients across Amazonia and to relate floristic ordination axes to soil base cation concentration, Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) climatic variables and reflectance values from a basin-wide Landsat image composite with generalized linear models. Ordination axes were then predicted across all Amazonia using Landsat and CHELSA, and a regional subdivision was obtained using k-medoid classification. Results The primary floristic gradient was strongly related to base cation concentration in the soil, and the secondary gradient to climatic variables. The Landsat image composite revealed a tapestry of broad-scale variation in canopy reflectance characteristics across Amazonia. Ordination axis scores predicted using Landsat and CHELSA variables produced spatial patterns consistent with existing knowledge on soils, geology and vegetation, but also suggested new floristic patterns. The clearest dichotomy was between central Amazonia and the peripheral areas, and the available data supported a classification into at least eight subregions. Main conclusions Landsat data are capable of predicting soil-related species compositional patterns of understorey ferns and lycophytes across the Amazon basin with surprisingly high accuracy. Although the exact floristic relationships may differ among plant groups, the observed ecological gradients must be relevant for other plants as well, since surface reflectance recorded by satellites is mostly influenced by the tree canopy. This opens exciting prospects for species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and biogeographical and ecological studies on Amazonian biota.

The transformation of forests in the Moscow region was evaluated by the criteria of changing the quality, quantity and spatial configuration of forests, in accordance with the model SLOSS (Single Large or Several Small). The conceptual model ""Pressure-State-Response"" (hereinafter PRS) was used to develop appropriate tools for sustainable environmental management in the region. The use of this model made it possible not only to assess the state of forests but also to determine the main impacts affecting them, as well as the effectiveness of measures aimed at optimizing environmental management regimes in order to maintain forest biodiversity. Complex assessment of sets of indicators for each group of PRS criteria is performed for the integrated multicriteria assessment of sustainable forest management within the boundaries of urban districts. The average normalized score was calculated for each group of criteria. Correlation between the scores of the groups of criteria evaluated and classification of administrative units according to the ratio of groups of the K-means method criteria performed. As a result of component-by-component evaluation, the values of indicators are presented in form of tables and map сharts. Benchmarking of Specially Protected Natural Area (SPNA) system and reforestation activities is performed regarding to the forest biodiversity conservation in the urban districts. It is shown that single integrated assessment of the ecological value of the territory (the ""State"" criterion), an integrated assessment of impact factors (the ""Load"") and appropriate actions to maintain forest biodiversity (the ""Response"" criterion) can be considered as an expression of generalized information directly used in decision-making and assessment of current trends for a particular region. © 2019, Lomonosov Moscow State University.

A Decision Analysis Approach For Risk Management Of Near-Earth Objects,"{""Chapman, Clark R."",""Jones, Thomas D."",""Lee, Robert C.""}",NA,"Risk management of near-Earth objects (NEOs; e.g., asteroids and comets) that can potentially impact Earth is an important issue that took on added urgency with the Chelyabinsk event of February 2013. Thousands of NEOs large enough to cause substantial damage are known to exist, although only a small fraction of these have the potential to impact Earth in the next few centuries. The probability and location of a NEO impact are subject to complex physics and great uncertainty, and consequences can range from minimal to devastating, depending upon the size of the NEO and location of impact. Deflecting a potential NEO impactor would be complex and expensive, and inter-agency and international cooperation would be necessary. Such deflection campaigns may be risky in themselves, and mission failure may result in unintended consequences. The benefits, risks, and costs of different potential NEO risk management strategies have not been compared in a systematic fashion. We present a decision analysis framework addressing this hazard. Decision analysis is the science of informing difficult decisions. It is inherently multi-disciplinary, especially with regard to managing catastrophic risks. Note that risk analysis clarifies the nature and magnitude of risks, whereas decision analysis guides rational risk management. Decision analysis can be used to inform strategic, policy, or resource allocation decisions. First, a problem is defined, including the decision situation and context. Second, objectives are defined, based upon what the different decision-makers and stakeholders (i.e., participants in the decision) value as important. Third, quantitative measures or scales for the objectives are determined. Fourth, alternative choices or strategies are defined. Fifth, the problem is then quantitatively modeled, including probabilistic risk analysis, and the alternatives are ranked in terms of how well they satisfy the objectives. Sixth, sensitivity analyses are performed in order to examine the impact of uncertainties. Finally, the need for further analysis, data collection, or refinement is determined. The first steps of defining the problem and the objectives are critical to constructing an informative decision analysis. Such steps must be undertaken with participation from experts, decision-makers, and stakeholders (defined here as ""derision participants""). The basic problem here can be framed as: ""What is the best strategy to manage risk associated with NEOs?"" Some high-level objectives might be to minimize: mortality and injuries, damage to critical infrastructure (e.g., power, communications and food distribution), ecosystem damage, property damage, ungrounded media and public speculation, resources expended, and overall cost. Another valuable objective would be to maximize inter-agency/government coordination. Some of these objectives (e.g., ""minimize mortality"") are readily quantified (e.g., deaths and injuries averted). Others are less so (e.g., ""maximize inter-agency/government coordination""), but these can be scaled. Objectives may be inversely related: e.g., a strategy that minimizes mortality may cost more. They are also unlikely to be weighted equally. Defining objectives and assessing their relative weight and interactions requires early engagement with decision participants. High-level decisions include whether to deflect a NEO, when to deflect, what is the best alternative for deflection/destruction, and disaster management strategies if an impact occurs. Important influences include, for example: NEO characteristics (orbital characteristics, diameter, mass, spin and composition), impact probability and location, interval between discovery and projected impact date, interval between discovery and deflection target date, costs of information collection, costs and technological feasibility of deflection alternatives, risks of deflection campaigns, requirements for inter-agency and international cooperation, and timing of informing the public. The analytical aspects of decision analysis center on estimation of the expected value (i.e. utility) of different alternatives. The expected value of an alternative is a function of the probability-weighted consequences, estimated using Bayesian calculations in a decision tree or influence diagram model. The result is a set of expected-value estimates for all alternatives evaluated that enables a ranking; the higher the expected value, the more preferred the alternative. A common way to include resource limitations is by framing the decision analysis in the context of economics (e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis). An important aspect of decision analysis in the NEO risk management case is the ability, known as sensitivity analysis, to examine the effect of parameter uncertainty upon decisions. The simplest way to evaluate uncertainty associated with the information used in a decision analysis is to adjust the input values one at a time (or simultaneously) to examine how the results change. Monte Carlo simulations can be used to adjust the inputs over ranges or distributions of values; statistical means then are used to determine the most influential variables. These techniques yield a measure known as the expected value of imperfect information. This value is highly informative, because it allows the decision-maker with imperfect information to evaluate the impact of using experiments, tests, or data collection (e.g. Earth-based observations, space-based remote sensing, etc.) to refine judgments; and indeed to estimate how much should be spent to reduce uncertainty.

Spatial Modeling Of Susceptibility To Subsidence Using Machine Learning Techniques,"{""Amiri, Mojtaba"",""Mohammady, Majid"",""Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza"",""Tiefenbacher, John P.""}",NA,"Land subsidence is a hazard that results from conditioning factors that cause environmental change and generate social and economic impacts. Some of these factors may increase dissolution of calcareous stones, change groundwater storage, or stem from mining, faulting, and seismic activity. Semnan Plain, Iran is experiencing land subsidence that, along with secondary impacts like surface fissures, is becoming increasingly troublesome. This study modeled land subsidence and created a susceptibility map using multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), and boosted regression tree (BRT) machine-learning methods. Analysis of satellite imagery, documents reporting past subsidence, and a contemporary field survey identified 65 sinkholes on Semnan Plain. Twelve conditioning factors were selected for analysis from a review of the scholarly literature, field investigation, and data availability. The three methods were used to model subsidence from a training subset of the known sites. The models were validated with the remaining subset of subsidence locations. Finally, susceptibility maps were used to predict other sites that are highly likely to see subsidence. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curves (AUC) were applied to assess the accuracies of the maps. AUC values (0.637, 0.783, and 0.712 for the BRT, MARS, and MDA models respectively) showed that MARS generated the most accurate model, MDA generated the second most accurate, and BRT's was the least accurate model. Subsidence susceptibility maps as produced here can be useful, meaningful, and functional tools for local and regional planners and policy makers involved in land use planning, resource management, and hazard mitigation.",mohammady_spatialmodelingsusceptibilitysubsidence_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Advances In Representing Interactive Methane In Modele2-Yibs (Version 1.1),"{""Harper, Kandice L."",""Unger, Nadine"",""Zheng, Yiqi""}",NA,"Methane (CH4) is both a greenhouse gas and a precursor of tropospheric ozone, making it an important focus of chemistry-climate interactions. Methane has both anthropogenic and natural emission sources, and reaction with the atmosphere's principal oxidizing agent, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is the dominant tropospheric loss process of methane. The tight coupling between methane and OH abundances drives indirect linkages between methane and other short-lived air pollutants and prompts the use of interactive methane chemistry in global chemistry-climate modeling. In this study, an updated contemporary inventory of natural methane emissions and the soil sink is developed using an optimization procedure that applies published emissions data to the NASA GISS ModelE2-Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (ModelE2-YIBs) global chemistry-climate model. Methane observations from the global surface air-sampling network of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are used to guide refinement of the natural methane inventory. The wetland methane flux is calculated as a best fit; thus, the accuracy of this derived flux assumes accurate simulation of methane chemical loss in the atmosphere and accurate prescription of the other methane fluxes (anthropogenic and natural). The optimization process indicates global annual wetland methane emissions of 140 Tg CH4 yr(-1). The updated inventory includes total global annual methane emissions from natural sources of 181 Tg CH4 yr(-1) and a global annual methane soil sink of 60 Tg CH4 yr(-1). An interactive methane simulation is run using ModelE2-YIBs, applying dynamic methane emissions and the updated natural methane emissions inventory that results from the optimization process. The simulated methane chemical lifetime of 10.4 +/- 0.1 years corresponds well to observed lifetimes. The simulated year 2005 global-mean surface methane concentration is 1.1\% higher than the observed value from the NOAA ESRL measurements. Comparison of the simulated atmospheric methane distribution with the NOAA ESRL surface observations at 50 measurement locations finds that the simulated annual methane mixing ratio is within 1\% (i.e., +1 \% to -1 \%) of the observed value at 76\% of locations. Considering the 50 stations, the mean relative difference between the simulated and observed annual methane mixing ratio is a model overestimate of only 0.5 \%. Comparison of simulated annual column-averaged methane concentrations with SCIAMACHY satellite retrievals provides an independent post-optimization evaluation of modeled methane. The comparison finds a slight model underestimate in 95\% of grid cells, suggesting that the applied methane source in the model is slightly underestimated or the model's methane sink strength is slightly too strong outside of the surface layer. Overall, the strong agreement between simulated and observed methane lifetimes and concentrations indicates that the ModelE2-YIBs chemistry-climate model is able to capture the principal processes that control atmospheric methane.",harper_advancesrepresentinginteractivemethane_2018,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
A Pilot Asthma Incidence Surveillance System And Case Definition: Lessons Learned,"{""Brown, C."",""Martin, P."",""Mavunda, K."",""Rodriguez, D."",""Trepka, M. J."",""Zhang, G.""}",NA,"Objectives. Surveillance for incident asthma in the general population could provide timely information about asthma trends and new, emerging etiologic factors. We sought to determine the feasibility of an asthma incidence surveillance system using voluntary reporting of asthma by outpatient clinics and emergency departments (EDs). Methods. Voluntary reporting occurred from July 2002 through June 2006. We classified reported asthma based on a case definition adapted from one developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. We validated the case definition by having pulmonologists review data from participant interviews, medical record abstractions, and pulmonary function test (PFT) results. Results. The positive predictive value (PPV) of meeting any of the case definition criteria for asthma was 80% to 82%. The criterion of taking at least one rescue and one controller medication had the highest PPV (97% to 100%). Only 7% of people meeting the incident case definition had a PFT documented in their medical record, limiting the usefulness of PFT results for case classification. Compared with pediatric participants, adult participants were more likely to be uninsured and to obtain asthma care at EDs. The surveillance system cost $5,129 per enrolled person meeting the incident case definition and was difficult to implement in participating clinics and EDs because asthma reporting was not mandatory and informed consent was necessary. Conclusions. The project was useful in evaluating the case definition's validity and in describing the participants' characteristics and health-care use patterns. However, without mandatory reporting laws, reporting of incident asthma in the general population by clinicians is not likely to be a feasible method for asthma surveillance. ©2009 Association of Schools of Public Health.",trepka_pilotasthmaincidencesurveillance_2009,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
General Landscape Connectivity Model (Glcm): A New Way To Map Whole Of Landscape Biodiversity Functional Connectivity For Operational Planning And Reporting,"{""Drielsma, Michael J."",""Love, Jamie"",""Taylor, Subhashni"",""Thapa, Rajesh"",""Williams, Kristen J.""}",NA,"Graph-theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities. We developed the new General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM), as a operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks to inform conservation priorities and plans. GLCM is built on two complementary metapopulation ecology-based measures: Neighbourhood habitat area (Ni) and habitat link value (Li). Ni is a measure of the amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross-scale connectivity to neighbouring habitat. The remaining Ni across a region can be reported as an indicator of Ecological Carrying Capacity for wildlife (plants and animals). Li at any location is its contribution to the landscape connectivity of the study region (i.e. which is reported as summed Ni across a region) by virtue of providing the 'least-cost' linkages between concentrations of habitat. Mapped Li provides valuable insights into the pattern of a region's habitat network, highlighting functioning habitat corridors and stepping-stones, and candidate areas for conservation and restoration. Due to its foundations in ecological theory and its parsimonious design, GLCM addresses a number of criteria we list as important, while addressing criticisms often levelled at graph-theoretical approaches. We present results for three south-east Australian case studies using continuous-value ecological condition surfaces as input. However, a simple habitat/non-habitat binary surface approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used. GLCM has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape connectivity assessment at regional scales, and broader. It incorporates connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes (foraging, dispersal and migration). Successively finer spatial scales are more intensively sampled based on a simple scaling-law. This approach allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data-driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations. The operational advantages of GLCM means that landscape connectivity assessments can be readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time-series remote sensing of land cover, or applied to alternative scenarios of land use, ecological restoration, climate projections or combinations of these.",drielsma_landscapeconnectivitymodelglcm_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Assessing Irrigation Water Use With Remote Sensing-Based Soil Water Balance At An Irrigation Scheme Level In A Semi-Arid Region Of Morocco,"{""Chehbouni, Abdelghani"",""Er-Raki, Salah"",""Khabba, Said"",""Kharrou, Mohamed Hakim"",""Le Page, Michel"",""Simonneaux, Vincent""}",NA,"This study aims to evaluate a remote sensing-based approach to allow estimation of the temporal and spatial distribution of crop evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation water requirements over irrigated areas in semi-arid regions. The method is based on the daily step FAO-56 Soil Water Balance model combined with a time series of basal crop coefficients and the fractional vegetation cover derived from high-resolution satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. The model was first calibrated and validated at plot scale using ET measured by eddy-covariance systems over wheat fields and olive orchards representing the main crops grown in the study area of the Haouz plain (central Morocco). The results showed that the model provided good estimates of ET for wheat and olive trees with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 0.56 and 0.54 mm/day respectively. The model was then used to compare remotely sensed estimates of irrigation requirements (RS-IWR) and irrigation water supplied (WS) at plot scale over an irrigation district in the Haouz plain through three growing seasons. The comparison indicated a large spatio-temporal variability in irrigation water demands and supplies; the median values of WS and RS-IWR were 130 (175), 117 (175) and 118 (112) mm respectively in the 2002-2003, 2005-2006 and 2008-2009 seasons.

"Impact, Efficiency, Inequality, And Injustice Of Urban Air Pollution: Variability By Emission Location","{""Marshall, Julian D."",""Nguyen, Nam P.""}",NA,"Reducing exposure to air pollution is an important goal for many local and national governments. Disparities in air pollution exposure by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class are well documented; reducing these disparities is another important policy target. Meeting both goals requires tools to evaluate how emission reduction options affect average exposures and exposure disparities. Here, we consider the role of emission location in implementing control strategies, and investigate the effect of two practical, space-based approaches-low-emission zones and truck rerouting-on diesel particle levels in Southern California. We employ Eulerian grid modeling to explore the impact that emission location has on four outcomes important to policymakers: total pollution exposure, exposure efficiency (i.e. exposure impact per unit emission), exposure inequality (i.e. deviations from exposure being equally distributed across the population; unequal exposure among individuals), and exposure injustice (i.e. associations between exposure and demographic attributes such as race or ethnicity; unequal exposure among groups). Our results highlight potential trade-offs (e.g. an increase in equality but reduction in justice for interventions in some locations) as well as opportunities for 'win-win' solutions (locations for which emission reductions would reduce all four target outcomes). We find that a simple, straightforward approach-reducing emissions in neighborhoods with a high proportion of minority residents-may or may not yield the strongest benefits to environmental justice; the reason is that the straightforward approach fails to account for meteorology and where pollution travels after being emitted. In short, we demonstrate an approach that can be used to identify areas in which emissions reductions would have high efficiency and would also result in disproportionately large reductions to average exposure, exposure inequality, and exposure injustice. The approach presented here could be used to design and prioritize local or national emission reduction efforts.",nguyen_impactefficiencyinequalityinjustice_2018,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Assessing Waterlogging Stress Level Of Winter Wheat From Hyperspectral Imagery Based On Harmonic Analysis,"{""Li, S."",""Liu, S."",""Liu, T."",""Wang, Q."",""Yang, F.""}",NA,"Frequent waterlogging disasters can have serious effects on regional ecology, food safety, and socioeconomic sustainable development. Early monitoring of waterlogging stress levels is vital for accurate production input management and reduction of crop production-related risks. In this study, a pot experiment on winter wheat was designed using three varieties and seven gradients of waterlogging stress. Hyperspectral imagery of the winter wheat canopy in the jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage, filling stage, and maturation stage were measured and then classified. Wavebands of imaging data were screened. Waterlogging stress level was assessed by a combined harmonic analysis method, and application of this method at field scale was discussed preliminarily. Results show that compared to the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine algorithms, the random forest algorithm is the best batch classification method for hyperspectral imagery of potted winter wheat. It can recognize waterlogging stress well in the wavebands of red absorption valley (RW: 640–680 nm), red-edge (RE: 670–737 nm), and near-infrared (NIR: 700–900 nm). In the RW region, amplitudes of the first three harmonic sub-signals (c1, c2, and c3) can be used as indexes to recognize the waterlogging stress level that each winter wheat variety undertakes. The third harmonic sub-signal amplitude c3 of the RE region is also suitable for judging stress levels of JM31 (one of the three varieties which is highly sensitive to water content). This study has important theoretical significance and practical application values related to the accurate control of waterlogging stress, and functions as a new method to monitor other types of environmental stress levels such as drought stress, freezing stress, and high-temperature stress levels. © 2021 by the authors.

Protected Areas In Boreal Canada: A Baseline And Considerations For The Continued Development Of A Representative And Effective Reserve Network,"{""Andrew, Margaret E."",""Cardille, Jeffrey A."",""Wulder, Michael A.""}",NA,"Boreal forests maintain regionally important biodiversity and globally important ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and freshwater resources. Many boreal systems have limited anthropogenic disturbances and are preserved, in effect, to date largely by their harsh climates and remoteness. As of 2011, almost 10\% of Canada is subject to some manner of formal protection, with 4.5\% of this protected area found within the boreal zone. The management of existing parks and protected areas (PPAs) is shared amongst many federal, provincial, and territorial jurisdictions. Although there are currently low levels of anthropogenic development in some portions of the boreal zone (especially the north), if expansion of protected areas is of interest, there are challenges to traditional PPA networks that may be more prominent in the boreal zone than elsewhere: (1) the boreal zone is home to charismatic mammal species with area requirements much larger than typical PPAs; (2) the boreal zone is characterized by natural disturbance regimes that impact large areas; and (3) projected changes to climate for the boreal zone are among the greatest in the world, creating temporal considerations for conservation planning exercises. There is currently no PPA assessment specific to boreal Canada. To address this lack of an assessment, we developed a conservation gap analysis of the current PPA system with respect to a variety of environmental surrogates (ecozones, land cover, vegetation productivity, and landscape structure). The amount of formally protected land varied within each surrogate, with few commonly reported features meeting national or international conservation targets. Furthermore, few reserves met the areal requirements that have been previously recommended to protect large mammals or accommodate the disturbance regimes present. We also discuss considerations and implications of area-based versus value-based protection objectives. While recognizing that there are still scientific challenges around understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of PPAs, based upon our review and assessment, the following considerations should inform conservation options for the boreal zone: (1) representation of the distribution of natural features within the PPA network; (2) effective maintenance of habitat requirements and spatial resilience to both cyclical and directional changes in spatial patterns through large, connected reserves; and (3) implementation of sustainable forest management practices (where applicable) throughout the broader landscape, as traditional on-reserve protection is unlikely to be sufficient to meet conservation goals. The Canadian boreal is unique in possessing large tracts of inaccessible forested lands that are not subject to management interventions, thereby offering functions similar to protected lands. The question of how to more formally integrate these lands into the existing PPA network requires further consideration. Further, the important temporal role of landscape dynamics in designing an effective PPA needs to be further studied as well as development of a better understanding of design needs in the context of a changing climate.",andrew_protectedborealcanadabaseline_2014,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The value of AGB uncertainty ranges from 0.68 Mg/ha to 37.80 Mg/ha, and the average AGB uncertainty was 4.32 +/- 1.75 Mg/ha. The forest AGB estimates of China in this study correspond reasonably well with the AGB estimates derived from the forestry and grassland statistical yearbook at the provincial level (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 30.15 Mg/ha). In addition, we found that previous AGB products generally underestimate the forest AGB compared with our estimated AGB at the pixel-level and ground-truth AGB measurements.

Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423 km(2)) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5th and 6th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak run-off, annual erosion. sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming. compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2:1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation-consensus process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Vegetation, as the main component of the ecosystem, plays an important role in its health. One of the key determinants of vegetation health is its resilience in the face of environmental disorders. This research was conducted in parts of the Namakzar-e Khaf watershed in Northeast of South Khorasan Province with the aim of quantifying the vegetative resilience on behalf of the ecosystem health in response to long-term precipitation changes. First, the annual precipitation standardization was performed during a thirty-year period by the SPI method. Then, the average variation in TNDVI index obtained from the Landsat satellite images was examined and the resilience was tested by calculating the four effective factors (amplitude, malleability, damping and hysteresis). According to the results, the amplitude in the survey period was 6.04% and the vegetation has had different values of damping over the years. The most prominent example of vegetation resilience occurred between 1986 and 1996, with malleability of 0.7 and damping of zero. Vegetation in this period, after the elimination of drought effects (1986), has not only returned to the amount of vegetation of reference year with severe precipitation (1996) but also increased by 0.25%. This increase, as the index of hysteresis, has been presented for the first time in the ecosystem health discussion quantitatively in the present study. A set of quantitative calculations showed that despite reduced annual precipitation and drought events, the vegetation has been able to maintain its resilience, which indicates the health of vegetation in the studied ecosystem. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

Coastal Mountain Landscape And Urban Plant Planning Based On Remote Sensing Imaging,"{""Chen, Y.""}",NA,"Due to the gradual decline of plant diversity, the distribution structure and spatial pattern of plant diversity have undergone significant changes in recent years. As a substantial reference standard for assessing whether the ecological functions of urban gardens can be performed commonly, the quality of the urban ecological environment, and the goodness of the urban human settlement environment, plant diversity is essential. If plant diversity presents a rich situation, it can play a critical role in improving the ecological environment’s quality and providing a solid material foundation for human development. Suppose you want to achieve sustainable growth in urban development. In that case, it is of positive significance to carry out protection and development projects for plant diversity within the city’s jurisdiction. To implement long-term green development goals, it is necessary to formulate a planning outline that meets actual needs. The stability of the upper-level planning and the richness of the landscape can also be fully guaranteed. The methods used in this study mainly include (1) unary linear regression and Mann-Kendall trend test; (2) interannual change extraction and data normalization; and (3) correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. The changing trend of ecological vegetation within a predetermined range and its significant development stage are obtained through unary linear regression and trend testing. Interannual change extraction and data normalization are used to get the interannual change characteristics of vegetation and climate factors and make them comparable. Use correlation analysis and multiple linear regression methods to analyze the driving analysis of natural and human ecological vegetation changes. Therefore, changes in climatic conditions and human activities can directly affect vegetation growth trends’ critical factors.

The WP ranged from 0.85 to 1.71 kg/m(3) with the WP mean value and SD being 1.26 and 0.23 kg/m(3). A comparative analysis of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), rice yield, WP, water stress, and rainfall maps indicates greater space for improvement of water use efficiency in the Songnen Plain, which will facilitates irrigation water resource management.",du_estimationwaterconsumptionproductivity_2015,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Use Of A Neuro-Variational Inversion For Retrieving Oceanic And Atmospheric Constituents From Satellite Ocean Colour Sensor: Application To Absorbing Aerosols,"{""Brajard, J."",""Jamet, C."",""Moulin, C."",""Thiria, S.""}",NA,"This paper presents a new development of the NeuroVaria method. NeuroVaria computes relevant atmospheric and oceanic parameters by minimizing the difference between the observed satellite reflectances and those computed from radiative transfer simulations modelled by artificial neural networks. Aerosol optical properties are computed using the Junge size distribution allowing taking into account highly absorbing aerosols. The major improvement to the method has been to implement an iterative cost function formulation that makes the minimization more efficient. This implementation of NeuroVaria has been applied to sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery. A comparison with in situ measurements and the standard SeaWiFS results for cases without absorbing aerosols shows that this version of NeuroVaria remains consistent with the former. Finally, the processing of SeaWiFS images of a plume of absorbing aerosols off the US East coast demonstrate the ability of this improved version of NeuroVaria to deal with absorbing aerosols. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal Variation In Space Use By Nonbreeding Bald Eagles Within The Upper Chesapeake Bay,"{""Mojica, Elizabeth K."",""Paxton, Barton J."",""Watts, Bryan D.""}",NA,"Access to food resources is essential to self-maintenance and reproduction and, for species of conservation concern, foraging areas are considered critical habitat. Human disturbance is an important factor restricting access to prey resources for Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and guidelines in the Chesapeake Bay have been developed to mitigate its impact. However, our ability to implement such guidelines has been limited by a lack of information on important foraging areas. We used Brownian bridge movement modeling to develop a population-wide utilization probability surface for Bald Eagles along shorelines within the upper Chesapeake Bay. We used locations (n=320 304) for individuals (n=63) tracked with GPS satellite transmitters between 2007 and 2011 in the analysis. We examined seasonal variation by developing utilization surfaces for summer and winter. Although shoreline use was widespread, segments receiving high levels of activity were relatively rare. Shoreline classified as having the highest category of use and accounting for 10\% of the total utilization made up 0.41\% and 0.55\% of the total shoreline for winter and summer, respectively. From a management perspective, there is a clear pattern of diminishing returns in conservation value for including sequentially lower-use shorelines in land-use management plans. Shoreline use shifted dramatically in both location and extent between seasons. During the summer months, use was highly concentrated on shorelines along the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay or along major (>1 km wide) tributaries. During the winter months, use shifted away from the main stem of the bay and was more focused on minor (<100 m wide) tributaries and inland ponds. Seasonal shifts in shoreline use suggest the need for season-based management objectives.",watts_seasonalvariationspacenonbreeding_2015,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

In addition to the loss of crucial forest services, inefficiencies at converting these natural resources into economic gain for people ultimately exacerbates poverty. Therefore, it is important to know which conservation strategies have proven to be effective in preventing ecosystem degradation and thus be encouraged in future management plans. Here, we used a high-resolution remotely sensed dataset spanning 15 years to study forest cover dynamics across various protected areas in Tanzania. Our findings highlight particular management approaches more effective in preventing forest cover loss and promote forest cover gain, and provide valuable information for conservation efforts. Results show that National Parks have the least forest cover loss, whereas multiple-use Game Controlled Areas have the highest rates of forest loss. In fact, results suggest that these multiple use areas tend to lose more forest cover than areas with no protection or management status at all.

However, it is difficult to identify the grassland fuel and soil with Remote Sensing. In this paper, we introduced fractal into the spectral analyses of the field-derived spectra (FDS) of grassland fuel and soil to solve the problem above. The study area laid on the Westward of Changling, Jinlin province, China. Study subjects included soil and dominant species: Leymus chinensis, Reed, Chloris virgate, Kalimeris integri folia and Artemisia mongolica. FDS of study subjects were measured with ASD FS3 and continuums of FDS were calculated by Matlab 2010. Meanwhile, Box-counting values of FDS and continuums were calculated by Matlab 2010. According to the spectral and continuum analysis, it is difficult to identify soil, Leymus chinensis, Reed, Chloris virgate, and Artemisia mongolica because of the similar spectral curves. However, the Artemisia mongolica can be identified for the strong reflection.

An Improved Actor-Critic Algorithm In Continuous Spaces With Action Weighting,"{""Liu, Q."",""Qian, W. S."",""Zhai, J. W."",""Zhang, P."",""Zhong, S.""}",NA,"Classic reinforcement learning algorithms mainly aim at the discrete state and action spaces. For the complex environment or the more applicable continuous spaces, the methods for the discrete spaces cannot satisfy the requirement. One feasible method is to discretize the state and action spaces, then the methods applied in discrete spaces can solve these problems with continuous state and action spaces. However, the reasonable discretization for the state and action spaces is not an easy problem. The methods applicable in continuous spaces do not have to discretize the state or action spaces, but most of them did not consider the constraint of the action range, additionally, the fluctuations of the optimal action were heavily. To be more applicable in continuous action spaces, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for continuous action space based on weighting of the actions by considering the constraint of the action range and decreasing the fluctuation, called AW-PS-AC. AW-PS-AC is designed in the framework of the actor-critic which is a classic method for the continuous space. The action exploration policy takes the Gaussian distribute by using the optimal action as the mean value, so that the selective action is the action with a small exploration factor. The optimal state value function and the optimal policy are approximated by linear function approximation, where the gradient descent method is utilized to update one set of the value function parameter and two sets of the policy parameters. The two sets of the policy parameters are weighted to obtain the optimal policy to constraint the optimal action, so that the optimal action will not surpass the action range and the optimal policy will not fluctuate significantly. The weighting for the actions can satisfy the constraint of the action range. Moreover, the samples can be utilized more comprehensively, resulting in a better performance under only a small amount of the data. To speed the convergence rate, an improved temporal difference algorithm is designed, where the temporal difference error (TD-error) of the value function are employed to update the optimal policy and the policy eligibility trace is introduced to improve the convergence rate for the algorithm. To prove the convergence of this proposed method, under the three given assumptions, AW-PS-AC is analyzed theoretically and its convergence is proved. On two classic benchmarks of the classic reinforcement learning benchmarks which have the nonlinear system dynamics, pole-balancing problem and puddle world problem, AW-PS-AC is compared with the representative methods which are representative in continuous spaces, namely, continuous actor-critic learning automaton (CALAC), continuous-action on Q-learning (CAQ) and incremental natural actor-critic with scaling gradient (INAC-S), and they are implemented on them. The results show that the AW-PS-AC algorithm performs well in the two experiments. The good performances in the two experiments demonstrate that the AW-PS-AC algorithm can solve the approximated-optimal problems effectively in continuous space. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, AW-PS-AC outperforms them not only in convergence but also in stability. From the experiments, it is clearly that AW-PS-AC algorithm can converge only after only a few episodes, moreover, it can be stable all the time after it is converged. © 2017, Science Press.

The accessing window assignments of the ground facilities to the satellites are used as the design variables, the adjacent window's minimum interval of the same ground facility and the maximum accessing number of a ground facility are considered as the constraints, and the end time of the task, the access benefit based on success rate and the access cost are designed as the objective functions, and then an accessing and planning model of multi-station incompletely accessing multi-satellite with the consideration of the cost and the benefit is established.

The mapping use of the soil Pacotuba FLONA and the damping zone were obtained through a Landsat image. The contingent valuation method was used using the forms to estimate the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. At FLONA de Pacotuba there is potential to produce NTFPs, with an offer mainly for medicinal and ecological purposes.

Rapid Assessment Of Plant Diversity Using Modis Biophysical Proxies,"{""Behera, Mukunda Dev"",""Mahanand, Swapna"",""Roy, Partha Sarathi""}",NA,"The spectral information derived from satellite data provides important inputs for assessing plant diversity. If a suitable satellite-derived biophysical proxy is applicable to assess and monitor plant diversity of different biogeographic regions will be of interest to policy makers and conservationists. We selected four biogeographic regions of India, i.e., semi-arid, Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, and Northeast as the test sites on the basis of variations in moisture availability. The flora data collected for the study sites are the extract of the national biodiversity project 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level'. The available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived biophysical proxies at high temporal frequencies was considered to compare the biophysical proxies: surface reflectance-red and near-infrared, normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, enhanced vegetation index-EVI, leaf area index-LAI, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation-FAPAR at different temporal scales (monthly, post-monsoon, seasonal, annual) in each selected biogeographic regions of India. Generalized linear model (GLM) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) were utilized to evaluate the relationship between plant diversity and MODIS-derived biophysical proxies. MARS summarized the suitable biophysical proxies at monthly scale in descending order for the total forest area in semi-arid was red, NDVI, and FAPAR; for Eastern Ghats was EVI, FAPAR, and LAI; for Western Ghats was EVI, LAI, and FAPAR; and for Northeast was NDVI, near-infrared, and red. Furthermore, monthly FAPAR commonly found to be the suitable proxy to large scale monitoring of plant diversity in the moisture varied biogeographic regions of India, except Northeast.

The objective of this study is to analyze and characterize the water use and water balance in the croplands of Kansas using satellite observations, meteorological data, and in situ irrigation water use records. We used actual evapotranspiration (ETa), precipitation, soil moisture, and irrigation water use to calculate water balance for Kansas in 2015 at scales of counties, climatic divisions, and groundwater management districts (GMD). The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance model was implemented to estimate 30-m resolution ETa. Results showed that the seasonal (May - September) precipitation, soil water storage change, and ETa are 528 mm, 80 mm, and 555 mm, respectively, on average of all croplands in the state.

We acquired QuickBird satellite images of Kampong Thom, Cambodia in 2011 and airborne LiDAR measurements in some parts of the same area. After haze reduction and atmospheric correction of the satellite data, we calibrated reflectance values from the mean reflectance of the objects (obtained by segmentation from areas of overlap between dates) to reduce the effects of the observation angle and solar elevation. Then, we performed object-based classification using the satellite data (overall accuracy = 77.0\%, versus 92.9\% for distinguishing forest from non-forest land). We used a two-step method to estimate AGB and map it in a tropical environment in Cambodia. First, we created a multiple-regression model to estimate AGB from the LiDAR data and plotted field-surveyed AGB values against AGB values predicted by the LiDAR-based model (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 38.7 Mg/ha), and calculated reflectance values in each band of the satellite data for the analyzed objects.

Improved Radar Composites And Enhanced Value Of Meteorological Radar Data Using Different Quality Indices,"{""Bartok, J."",""Gaál, L."",""Gažák, M."",""Gera, M."",""Jurašek, M."",""Kelemen, M."",""Méri, L.""}",NA,"Radar measurements are inherently affected by various meteorological and non-meteorological factors that may lead to a degradation of their quality, and the unwanted effects are also transferred into composites, i.e., overlapping images from different radars. The paper was aimed at answering the research question whether we could create ‘cleaner’ radar composites without disturbing features, and if yes, how the operational practice could take advantage of the improved results. To achieve these goals, the qRad and qPrec software packages, based on the concept of quality indices, were used. The qRad package estimates the true quality of the C-band radar volume data using various quality indices and attempts to correct some of the adverse effects on the measure-ments. The qPrec package uses a probabilistic approach to estimate precipitation intensity, based on heterogeneous input data and quality-based outputs of the qRad software. The advantages of the qRad software are improved radar composites, which offer benefits, among others, for aviation meteorology. At the same time, the advantages of the qPrec software are manifested through improved quantitative precipitation estimation, which can be translated into hydrological modeling or climatological precipitation mapping. Beyond this, the developed software indirectly contributes to sustainability and environmental protection—for instance, by enabling fuel savings due to the more effective planning of flight routes or avoiding runway excursions due to information on the increased risk of aquaplaning. © 2021 by the authors.

FM is estimated by cutting forage in known areas, using allometric equations, or with the use of remote sensors (RS); however, the accuracy and practicality of the different methods for estimating FM is variable. The objective was to obtain predictive models using environmental and pasture management variables to predict FM. Regression models were fitted to estimate FM based on variables of pasture management (PM) or measurements obtained by RS, such as reflectance, air temperature, and rainfall. A mixed pasture grazed by beef cattle was studied for three years. With 80 % of data, models were built by ordinary least squares (OLS) or by machine learning (ML) algorithms. The remaining 20 % of the data was used to validate the models using the coefficient of determination and average bias between estimated and observed values. The base model of study was the relationship between pasture height before grazing and FM, this model was fitted using OLS; the r2 was 0.43. When models that included PM variables were fitted, the r2 was 0.45 for OLS and 0.63 for ML. When fitting models with PM and RS variables, the r2 was 0.71 for OLS and 0.96 for ML. ML-fitted model ensembles reduced the bias of FM estimates of the examined pasture. Overall, ML models better represented the relationship between pasture height before grazing and FM than OLS models, when fitted with pasture management variables and RS information. ML models can be used as a tool for daily decision-making in pastoral production systems. © 2023 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

Assessing Canal Seepage And Soil Salinity Using The Electromagnetic Remote Sensing Technology,"{""Cassel S, F."",""Zoldoske, D.""}",NA,"Canal seepage and soil salinity are two major problems in irrigated areas of California's Central Valley, USA. Seepage is very common throughout the vast network of irrigation canals found in California. Most of these canals are earthen structures, where seepage contributes to the loss of millions of litres of water annually. Salinity problems are attributed to saline parent material, clayey soils, intensive irrigation, shallow water tables, and inadequate drainage that prevents the leaching of soluble salts. Several irrigation management practices, including sequential reuse of drainage waters within farm boundaries, are currently being tested in the region. Such practices are expected to reduce drainage volume, conserve irrigation water, and contribute to soil reclamation. Canal seepage and soil salinity can be assessed very accurately using the electromagnetic (EM) remote sensing technique. When coupled with a GPS and data logging capabilities, a mobilized EM system can provide automated and geo-referenced measurements over large areas. The study objectives were to locate seepage along irrigation canals and assess soil salinity in agricultural fields using the EM approach. Calibration of the EM data was performed following soil sampling. Samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity, texture, and moisture. Surface maps describing spatial distribution of these parameters were generated using GIS. The study suggested that the location of seepage could be detected rapidly and cost-effectively with the EM meter. The salinity assessment survey indicated that soil salinity levels ranged from 1 to 39 dS/m, with high spatial variability observed in most areas. Elevated salinity values were associated with poor drainage management.

'Tidy' And 'Messy' Management Alters Natural Enemy Communities And Pest Control In Urban Agroecosystems,"{""Egerer, Monika"",""Philpott, Stacy M.""}",NA,"Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people's values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for 'tidiness' are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a 'tidy garden' versus a 'messy garden' influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular 'tidy' management practice-woodchip mulching-on the one hand, and simulating 'messy' gardens by adding 'weedy' plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some 'messiness' in their garden plots as a ""lazy gardener"" approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.",egerer_tidymessymanagementalters_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The objective of this study was to compare maize ETa estimated by the two-step approach using a locally developed crop coefficient curve with satellite-retrieved evapotranspiration by six models incorporated in the OpenET to identify the best evapotranspiration estimation alternatives to the two-step approach for water management in northern New Mexico. Maize (Zea mays L.) was planted at the NMSU Agricultural Science Center at Farmington from 2017 to 2022 and uniformly managed across years. Water management in plants was based on maize's actual evapotranspiration estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration and the local crop coefficient, which is described as a third-order polynomial function of the accumulated heat units by maize plants. For the same growing seasons, maize ETa was retrieved from satellite, and was estimated by six models listed within the OpenET from 2017 to 2022. The results show that maize daily ETa was consistently smaller when measured by SIMS and PT-JPL during maize initial and actively growing stages, while ETc(kc), SIMS and eeMETRIC showed similar maize daily ETa during maize full canopy development and mid-season, and which overcome the evapotranspiration estimated by DisALEXI, PT-JPL, geeSEBAL, and SSBop. ETc(kc) drastically dropped and became the lowest value among all ETa estimation models after the first fall snow or the first killing frost. Regarding the seasonal average, all six models included in OpenET showed smaller maize evapotranspiration. Maize seasonal evapotranspiration varied from 589.7 to 683.2 mm. eeMETRIC compares most similarly to the ETc(kc) model, followed by SIMS, with percent errors of 2.58 and 7.74\% on a daily basis and 2.43 and 7.88\% on a seasonal basis, with the lowest MBE and RMSE values, respectively, and could be used as an alternative for maize actual daily evapotranspiration for water management in northern New Mexico.

The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks.

Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol: A Commercial System-Of-Systems To Incentivize Forest Restoration And Management,"{""Gyimah, R."",""Marino, B. D. V."",""Truong, V."",""William Munger, J.""}",NA,"Forest carbon sequestration offsets are methodologically uncertain, comprise a minor component of carbon markets and do not effectively slow deforestation. The objective of this study is to describe a commercial scale in situ measurement approach for determination of net forest carbon sequestration projects, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM, to address forest carbon market uncertainties. In contrast to protocols that rely on limited forest mensuration, growth simulation and exclusion of CO2 data, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM is based on standardized methods for direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy covariance, a meteorological approach integrating forest carbon fluxes. NEE is used here as the basis for quantifying the first of its kind carbon financial products. The DMFCP differentiates physical, project and financial carbon within a System-of-SystemsTM (SoS) network architecture. SoS sensor nodes, the Global Monitoring PlatformTM (GMP), housing analyzers for CO2 isotopologues (e.g., 12CO2,13CO214CO2) and greenhouse gases are deployed across the project landscape. The SoS standardizes and automates GMP measurement, uncertainty and reporting functions creating diverse forest carbon portfolios while reducing cost and investment risk in alignment with modern portfolio theory. To illustrate SoS field deployment and operation, published annual NEE data for a tropical (Ankasa Park, Ghana, Africa) and a deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, USA) are used to forecast carbon revenue. Carbon pricing scenarios are combined with historical in situ NEE annual time-series to extrapolate pre-tax revenue for each project applied to 100,000 acres (40,469 hectares) of surrounding land. Based on carbon pricing of $5 to $36 per ton CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) and observed NEE sequestration rates of 0.48 to 15.60 tCO2eq acre−1 yr−1, pre-tax cash flows ranging from $230,000 to $16,380,000 across project time-series are calculated, up to 5× revenue for contemporary voluntary offsets, demonstrating new economic incentives to reverse deforestation. The SoS concept of operation and architecture, with engineering development, can be extended to diverse gas species across terrestrial, aquatic and oceanic ecosystems, harmonizing voluntary and compliance market products worldwide to assist in the management of global warming. The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol reduces risk of invalidation intrinsic to estimation-based protocols such as the Climate Action Reserve and the Clean Development Mechanism that do not observe molecular CO2 to calibrate financial products. Multinational policy applications such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, constrained by Kyoto Protocol era processes, will benefit from NEE measurement avoiding unsupported claims of emission reduction, fraud, and forest conservation policy failure.

The study utilised the Total Economic Value framework in conjunction with the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity concept to develop and estimate indicators of urban farming benefit into valuation through the direct market and stated preferences approaches. The study employed field surveys, in-depth interviews and remote sensing analysis. Here we show for the first time that the Total Economic Value of urban farming benefits reached up to US$ 13.11 in a square metre annually if all urban farming forms occupy a square metre each. However, this value had a gap with the benchmark of US$ 15.89/m2 annually.

Although field checking of known oilfield brine-contaminated sites is relatively straightforward, the ability to detect and inventory brine-contaminated sites over remote and expansive areas can be time consuming and expensive. A more efficient and cost-effective method is needed to delineate brine-contaminated sites accurately.

Long-term Landsat time series allow for analyzing forest canopy dynamics over several decades at a spatial resolution of 30 m. These dynamics have not been related to plant diversity in the herb layer of forests yet. Here, we related canopy layer dynamics of 132 one hectare temperate forest plots derived from Landsat time series (1985–2015) to herb layer plant species diversity observed in 2015. To quantitatively characterize the dynamics in the canopy over this period, we applied Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation representation (SAX) to yearly NDVI time series of the plots and calculated the frequency of the representations of similar time series patterns, hereafter called SAX-metrics. We used the SAX-metrics as predictors to estimate with beta regression models the Simpson's diversity index of the herb layer of our forest plots subdivided into six forest types. Models including SAX-metrics, describing abrupt decreases in NDVI, and high, medium, or low NDVI values had pseudo R2 between 0.13 and 0.63.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive urban ecological efficiency (UEE) framework in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India, from 2000 to 2020. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to develop a remote sensing-based UEE index (UEEI) based on five effective ecological parameters (Greenness, Dryness, Heat, Wetness and vegetation health. A single sensitivity parameter was also calculated to determine the role of a single parameter based on which management strategies can be carried out. The findings showed that (i) there were substantial deteriorations of UEE in the last 20 years. In 2000 the areas with good EE were about 65.5\% which declined to 53.72\% in 2010 and 20.87\% in 2020. The areas with good UEE decreased 68\% and 61\% from 2000 to 2020 and 2010 to 2020, respectively; (ii) the areas with good UEE were 52\% in 2000, while 38\% in 2010.

The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class.

Evaluating the value of eco-assets has become a focus of concern. Quantitative remote sensing measurements, land data and other auxiliary data were used to measure the eco-assets in 46 regions of the Wanjiang Demonstration Area from 1990 to 2013. This paper analyzes temporal and spatial variations of eco-assets’ distribution, composition, change patterns and the factors driving variations. The results show that the distribution of eco-assets in the regions is very uneven, the central region has higher ecological assets than other regions, and it declined first and then rose during the period 1990-2013. The total amount of eco-assets increased by 3.05%. The change in the amount of ecological assets was not large, but it is important that the amount of assets was basically stable, and increases in the proportion of degraded areas was small. Grassland and water body eco-assets decreased by 11.19% and 0.66%, respectively, and that of cultivated land decreased by 15.54%, but forest land increased by 6.42%. As for the change pattern of ecological as-sets, the per capita assets of Hefei had the largest reduction, and those of Xuancheng the second largest. The spatial and temporal changes of ecological assets in the Wanjiang Demonstration Area include natural factors and human factors. The government's macro-control and economic policies are the main driving factors for the spatial and temporal changes of the ecological assets pattern. © 2019, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

"Changes In Wetland Landscape Patterns On Yinchuan Plain, China","{""Yuan, H."",""Zhang, R.""}",NA,"Wetlands, with their many values and important functions, are precious resources. They have, however, undergone great changes during economic development and population growth. Relying on recent advances in remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, this paper probes changes in wetland landscapes on Yinchuan Plain during 1978-2006. A series of remote sensing images was used to identify wetland landscape types. Landscape pattern indices, such as patch number, patch density, landscape shape, and Shannon's diversity, evenness, and contagion indices were calculated with GIS and landscape analysis software. Changes in wetland landscape patterns on Yinchuan Plain were analyzed. The analysis show that the total area of wetlands on Yinchuan Plain decreased from 391,540,239 m2 in 1978 to 267,979,957 m2 in 2006, a significant change over 28 years. The area of rivers and lakes has shrunk, and the area of paddies has increased consistently, with increasing wetland fragmentation and heterogeneity. The number of patches, patch density, and landscape shape index shows that wetland landscape patterns have undergone great changes. The landscape diversity, landscape evenness, and contagion indices indicate that wetland landscapes have become less heterogeneous. We discuss the causes of these changes and the sustainable development of wetland ecosystems. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",yuan_wetlandlandscapepatternsyinchuan_2010,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

SOC is one of the critical factors in food production and plays an important role in the climate change because it affects the physio-chemical soil characteristics, plant growth, and contributes to sustainable development on global levels. For the purpose of our investigations, 120 soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected throughout different land uses and soil types of the study area. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship of SOC, soil characteristics, and environmental factors. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat 5 TM in July 1995 and operational land imager (OLI) in July 2018 were used to model SOC pool. The results revealed significant variations of soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) among different soil textures and land-uses. Soil with high clay content revealed an increase in the percentage of soil organic carbon, and had mean SOCP of 6.08 +/- 1.91 Mg C ha(-1), followed by clay loams and loamy soils. The higher values of SOCP were observed in the northern regions of the study area. The phenomenon is associated with the expansion of the human activity of initiating fish ponds that reflected higher values of SOC that were related to the organic additions used as nutrients for fish. Nevertheless, the SOC values decreased in southeast of the study area with the decrease of soil moisture contents and the increase in the heavy texture profiles. As a whole, our findings pointed out that the human factor has had a significant impact on the variation of soil organic carbon values in the Eastern Nile Delta from 1995 to 2018. As land use changes from agricultural activity to fish ponds, the SOCP significantly increased. The agriculture land-use revealed higher SOCP with 60.77 Mg C ha(-1) in clay soils followed by fish ponds with 53.43 Mg C ha(-1). The results also showed a decrease in SOCP values due to an increasing in land surface temperature (LST) thus highlighting that influence of temperature and ambient soil conditions linked to land-use changes have a marked impact on surface SOCP and C sequestration.",mohamed_evaluatingeffectshumanactivity_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

We gathered 496 RUE values and assessed their variation according to genotype, resource availability and phenological stage. Mean RUE was 1.93 +/- 1.2 g of dry matter (DM) per megajoule of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) (+/- SD). The RUE was most responsive to genotype and to direct and indirect manipulations of resource availability.

Timely and accurate crop yield forecasts for Ukraine at regional level become a key element in providing support to policy makers in food security. In this paper, feasibility and relative efficiency of using moderate resolution satellite data to winter wheat forecasting in Ukraine at oblast level is assessed. Oblast is a sub-national administrative unit that corresponds to the NUTS2 level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) of the European Union. NDVI values were derived from the MODIS sensor at the 250 m spatial resolution. For each oblast NDVI values were averaged for a cropland map (Rainfed croplands class) derived from the ESA GlobCover map, and were used as predictors in the regression models. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the best time for making reliable yield forecasts in terms of root mean square error was identified. For most oblasts, NDVI values taken in April-May provided the minimum RMSE value when comparing to the official statistics, thus enabling forecasts 2-3 months prior to harvest. The NDVI-based approach was compared to the following approaches: empirical model based on meteorological observations (with forecasts in April-May that provide minimum RMSE value) and WOFOST crop growth simulation model implemented in the CGMS system (with forecasts in June that provide minimum RMSE value). All three approaches were run to produce winter wheat yield forecasts for independent datasets for 2010 and 2011, i.e. on data that were not used within model calibration process. The most accurate predictions for 2010 were achieved using the CGMS system with the RMSE value of 0.3 t ha(-1) in June and 0.4 t ha(-1) in April, while performance of three approaches for 2011 was almost the same (0.5-0.6 t ha(-1) in April). Both NDVI-based approach and CGMS system over-estimated winter wheat yield comparing to official statistics in 2010, and underestimated it in 2011. Therefore, we can conclude that performance of empirical NDVI-based regression model was similar to meteorological and CGMS models when producing winter wheat yield forecasts at oblast level in Ukraine 2-3 months prior to harvest, while providing minimum requirements to input datasets.

In this study, we evaluated the capability of the emerging terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technique in estimating grassland AGB in the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China. Seven variables (i.e., canopy cover, canopy volume, mean height, maximum height, minimum height, range of height, and standard deviation of height) were extracted from the TLS data of 30 plots across the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China, and were used to build regression models with field measured AGB using four regression methods, which are simple regression (SR) model, stepwise multiple regression (SMR) model, random forest (RF) model and artificial neural network (ANN) model. The results demonstrate that TLS is a feasible technique for extracting grassland structural parameters. Mean grass height and canopy cover obtained from TLS data have good correspondence with field measurements (R2 > 0.7, p-values < 0.001). Among the four regression models, the SMR model yields the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 48.89 g/m2), followed by the RF model (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 68.72 g/m2), the SR model (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 86.4 g/m2), and the ANN model (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 101.40 g/m2). Minimum grass height and canopy coverage are the two most important variables influencing the prediction accuracy of the SMR model, and the prediction accuracy of the SMR model increases with the increase of point density.

In addition, while MAIAC has limited spatial coverage, the spatial frequency of the proposed direct AOD retrieval was nearly 1.5-times higher than that of the MAIAC AOD. Our findings confirmed that machine learning-based high-resolution AOD estimates can be obtained using only satellite data. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",kang_directaerosolopticaldepth_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Evaluate The Effect Of Topographic Factors And Lithology On Forest Cover Distribution: A Case Study Of The Moroccan High Atlas,"{""Daghor, Lamia"",""El Moutaki, Saida"",""Lhissou, Rachid"",""Maimouni, Soufiane"",""Oukassou, Mostafa""}",NA,"Understanding the relationship between the spatial distribution of forest vegetation and influencing factors provides valuable information to decision-makers in land planning, for the sustainable development of forests and efficient monitoring of environmental and ecological issues. This paper aims to understand the effect of topographic factors and lithology on forest cover distribution around Bin El Ouidane dam in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, using remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), field observation, and statistical analysis. The forest vegetation was quantified by calculating the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) from Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDVI was classified according to the density of forest vegetation into four levels: bare soil, low density of forest cover, moderate density of forest cover, and high density of forest cover. The correlation analysis between NDVI, interpreted as forest densities and topographic parameters (elevation, slope, and aspect), derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), showed that elevation has the most significant positive correlation with forest density, with r = 0.563 and a p-value less than 0.05. Additionally, moderate and high densities of forest vegetation are optimal in the terrain aspect of the South-East and North-West, respectively. However, the NDVI variation cannot be interpreted only by altitude and terrain aspect. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification has been used to map and to separate the forest vegetation types. The statistical results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the altitude is the most important topographic factor affecting the distribution of forest species. The analysis of frequency histograms revealed that Holm oaks are increasing at high altitudes, and are more abundant in the North-West, while the Thuya species prefer moderate altitudes and are more abundant in the South-East-facing aspects. In our study area, the Holm oak develops on limestone formations. On the contrary, Thuya does not thrive in lithological conditions, and is found with a decreasing level of predominance on limestones, marls-limestones, and sandstones, respectively. The conclusion of the study shows that a combination of topographic factors and lithological conditions affects the spatial distribution of forest vegetation. The adaptation of the forest species to specific topography and lithological conditions should be considered for forest management. It can be helpful in selecting potential sites for reforestation of these species, for conservation of the natural resources, including water and soil.",maimouni_evaluateeffecttopographicfactors_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Site-Specific Seeding For Maize Production Using Management Zone Maps Delineated With Multi-Sensors Data Fusion Scheme,"{""Haesaert, G."",""Mouazen, A. M."",""Munnaf, M. A.""}",NA,"Uniform rate seeding (URS) density may result in under- or over-optimal plant population that negatively affects crop growth and yield. Site-specific seeding (SSS) is one of the solutions to manage in-field soil variation by optimizing the input seed rate to match soil fertility. This study has evaluated the agronomic and economic response of maize to SSS compared to the URS using a data fusion scheme. Two fields of 5.5 ha and 10 ha in Belgium and France, respectively, were scanned using an on-line visible and near-infrared spectroscopy sensor to measure soil pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), moisture content (MC), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Crop normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were retrieved from several Sentinel-2 images. Measured crop yield, retrieved NDVI and on-line measured soil attributes were then fussed using k-means clustering algorithm to delineate management zone (MZ) maps, whose classes were ranked based on their fertility level and crop yield. A parallel strips experiment was overlaid upon the MZ map, to allow comparing the performance of SSS against URS. Two SSS treatments were implemented in the strip experiment, e.g., the “Kings” approach that recommended the highest seeding density for the highest fertile MZ class and vice versa, and the “Robin Hood” approach followed the opposite principle. Results revealed that SSS treatments increased maize grain yield by 0.25–0.70 Mg ha−1 and thus improved gross margin by 26.7–92.67 € ha−1, compared to the URS. Besides, the SSS-Kings treatment outperformed the URS and SSS-Robin Hood in both fields, whereas the SSS-Robin Hood outperformed the URS treatment only in one field. Soil OC, MC, Mg, and pH revealed a positive correlation each with grain yield in the SSS-Kings treatment. The SSS-Kings treatment is therefore recommended to manage in-field soil variation, which can result in optimizing input seed rates for increasing maize productivity and profitability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",munnaf_sitespecificseedingmaize_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

While parameter optimization (PO) algorithms have been used to estimate the model parameter for best model performance, the use of data assimilation (DA) has been receiving increased prominence to characterize the uncertainties in such models. However, it is still an open question that how DA techniques can be used together with PO algorithms to enhance the performance of LSMs for different applications. In this study, a combined framework composed of the PO algorithm-Adaptive Surrogate Modeling Based Optimization (ASMO) and the DA algorithm-Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM), is used to improve the soil moisture (SM) estimates of Community Land Model (CLM) across the Tibetan Plateau in China. The SM data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite are used as the benchmark data for model improvement. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, the simulated SM values are validated against the SM observations collected from the in situ networks in the Tibetan Plateau, China. The findings revealed that the joint application of ASMO and EPFM algorithms results in more accurate and reliable SM estimates of CLM compared to when they are solely employed.

Using Morphometric Analysis For Assessment Of Flash Flood Susceptibility In The Mediterranean Region Of Turkey,"{""Dutal, H.""}",NA,"Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters around the world because of their rapid and unpredictable nature. It is expected that the frequency and intensity of flood events will increase because of extreme rainfall events induced by climate change. In this context, the generation of a flood susceptibility map contributes to effective flood management in a basin. The present study aims to generate a flash flood susceptibility map for the Imali Stream Basin (ISB) situated within the Mediterranean region of Turkey. For this purpose, morphometric analysis, geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used in this study. ASTER GDEM (v.3) was used to delineate 9 sub-watersheds and to obtain the required morphometric parameters. To generate a flash flood susceptibility map, the original compound values ​​calculated for each sub-watershed were transformed into values ​​between 0 and 1 by using the min–max normalization method. Then, these values were divided into 3 classes called low, moderate, and high by using the equal interval classification method in ArcGIS. According to both flash flood susceptibility maps produced by using morphometric analysis and PCA, sub-watershed 5 has the highest flash flood susceptibility in the basin. The flash flood that occurred in sub-watershed 5 in 2016 contributes to these results. Therefore, flood management based on morphometric analysis can be a highly effective method for decision-makers and planners in the Mediterranean region, one of the hotspots to be affected by climate change. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",dutal_morphometricanalysisassessmentflash_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

We present how detailed riparian vegetation mapping can be used to prioritize conservation and restoration sites within a riparian and instream habitat restoration program targeting 3 native fish species on the San Rafael River, a desert river in southeastern Utah, United States. We classified vegetation using a combination of object-based image analysis (OBIA) on high-resolution (0.5m), multispectral, satellite imagery with oblique aerial photography and field-based data collection. The OBIA approach is objective, repeatable, and applicable to large areas. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80\% (Cohen's =0.77). We used this high-resolution vegetation classification alongside existing data on habitat condition and aquatic species' distributions to identify reaches' conservation value and restoration potential to guide management actions. Specifically, cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima) density layers helped to establish broad restoration and conservation reach classes. The high-resolution vegetation mapping precisely identified individual cottonwood trees and tamarisk thickets, which were used to determine specific locations for restoration activities such as beaver dam analogue structures in cottonwood restoration areas, or strategic tamarisk removal in high-density tamarisk sites.

It is a crucial variable of various economic and process-based models. Rice is grown under irrigated triple- and double-rice cropping systems and a rainfed single-rice cropping system in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). These rice cropping systems are adopted according to the geographical location and water infrastructure. However, little work has been done to map triple-cropping of rice using Sentinel-1 along with the effects of water infrastructure on the rice cropping intensity decision. This study is focused on monitoring rice cropping patterns in the An Giang province of the VMD from March 2017 to March 2018. The fieldwork was carried out on the dates close to the Sentinel-1A acquisition. The results of dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1A data show a strong correlation with the spatial patterns of various rice growth stages and their association with the water infrastructure. The VH backscatter (sigma degrees) is strongly correlated with the three rice growth stages, especially the reproductive stage when the backscatter is less affected by soil moisture and water in the rice fields. In all three cropping patterns, sigma degrees VV and sigma degrees VH show the highest value in the maturity stage, often appearing 10 to 12 days before the harvesting of the rice. A rice cropping pattern map was generated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of Sentinel-1A data. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80.7\% with a 0.78 Kappa coefficient.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of conservation practices subsidized by the Oklahoma Conservation Commission on phosphorus and sediment loads to Lake Wister. Conservation practices designed to increase vegetative cover in grazed pastures were evaluated using Landsat imagery and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Several vegetative indices were derived from Landsat imagery captured before and after the implementation of conservation practices. Collectively, these indicators provided an estimate of the change in vegetative soil cover attributable to conservation practices in treated fields. Field characteristics, management, and changes in vegetative cover were used in the SWAT model to simulate sediment and phosphorus losses before and after practice implementation. Overall, these conservation practices yielded a 1.9\% improvement in vegetative cover and a predicted sediment load reduction of 3.5\%. Changes in phosphorus load ranged from a 1.0\% improvement to a 3.5\% increase, depending upon initial vegetative conditions. The use of fertilizers containing phosphorus as a conservation practice in low-productivity pastures was predicted by SWAT to increase net phosphorus losses despite any improvement in vegetative cover. This combination of vegetative cover analysis and hydrologic simulation was a useful tool for evaluating the effects of conservation practices at the basin scale and may provide guidance for the selection of conservation measures subsidized in future conservation programs.",white_evaluatingconservationprogramsuccess_2010,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Combining High-Resolution Images And Lidar Data To Model Ecosystem Services Perception In Compact Urban Systems,"{""Giannico, Vincenzo"",""Lafortezza, Raffaele""}",NA,"In this study, we aim to understand how the provision of ecosystem services (ESS) is spatially distributed within a compact urban system considering the structure and spatial arrangement of green spaces in relation to built-up areas and other infrastructures. For this purpose, we devised an approach to assess the ESS provided by urban green spaces through the integration of social data (i.e., stakeholders' perception of the multiple benefits of green spaces) with remotely sensed data, such as high-resolution satellite images and Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point-cloud. We developed a spatially explicit indicator (or metric) called Normalized Difference Green-Building Volume (NDGB), derived from remote sensing, that can be used to predict the way people perceive the ESS conveyed by green spaces in cities. We designed the NDGB metric using the city of Bad, Southern Italy, as a case example by involving four groups of stakeholders (n = 202) to assess ten urban green spaces. Our results show a strong positive relationship between the NDGB and the way stakeholders perceive the ESS provided by these urban green spaces. Thus, our indicator accurately expresses the relationship between stakeholders' perceptions of ESS provided by green spaces and the physical data (i.e., green space structure) produced by remote sensing technology. The green space most highly evaluated by the NDGB indicator, the periurban park ""Lama Balice"", was also the one on which all stakeholder group responses converged, including the group of NGOs and associations, which assigned average low scores for perceived ESS across all the green spaces presented in the study. The study was developed using the city of Bari in Southern Italy as testbed. There is a need to further extend and replicate our approach to other urban systems across different regions (e.g., Northern Europe, North America, Asia), especially those which are in the process of pursuing more sustainable green infrastructure planning and development, as they could be inclined to adopt our approach in ongoing decision making processes.

Satellite-derived and modelled biogeophysical data were used to delineate an area of biological and physical homogeneity spatially consistent with the static boundaries of the Scotian Slope Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), off eastern Canada. We used iterative cluster analysis applied to an archive (2004-2014) that consisted of remotely-sensed Chlorophyll a, sea-surface temperature, and primary production derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and simulated mixed layer depth to define ""dynamic"" boundaries of the EBSA at bi-weekly, seasonal and annual resolutions. The final cluster extended further east than the static EBSA in summer and fall, indicating that characteristics of the static EBSA environment persist beyond the current boundaries in these seasons. In winter and spring, the final areas derived by our analysis was smaller than the static EBSA, but again showed extension beyond the current eastern boundary. Both ice and cloud cover affecting remotely-sensed data and the extent of water column mixing were important in determining the size of the final cluster. The dynamic cluster east of the original static boundary incorporated an area of lower Chlorophyll a and water column primary production in the spring, but higher values in the autumn relative to the static area. Overall physical and biological characteristics of the static and dynamic EBSA considered in this research were similar within and across years.

Satellite-based forest volume estimation was first developed in the 1990s, and the accuracy of the estimation has been improved over time. One of the satellite-based forest volume estimation issues is that it tends to overestimate the large volume class and underestimate the small volume class. Free availability of the major satellite imagery and the development of cloud-based computational platforms facilitate an immense amount of satellite imagery in the estimation. In this paper, we set three objectives: (1) to examine whether the long Landsat time series contributes to the improvement of the estimation accuracy, (2) to explore the effectiveness of forest disturbance record and land cover data as ancillary spatial data on the accuracy of the estimation, and (3) to apply the bias correction method to reduce the bias of the estimation. We computed three Tasseled-cap components from the Landsat data for preparation of short (2014–2016) and long (1984–2016) time series. Each data entity was analyzed with harmonic regressions resulting in the coefficients and the fitted values recorded as pixel values in a multilayer raster database. Data included Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) unit field inventory measurements provided by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service and the National Land Cover Database and disturbance history data added as ancillary information. The totality of the available data was organized into seven distinct Random Forest (RF) models with different variables compared against each other to identify the ones with the most satisfactory performance. A bias correction method was then applied to all the RF models to examine the effectiveness of the method. Among the seven models, the worst one used the coefficients and fitted values of the short Landsat time series only, and the best one used coefficients and fitted values of both short and long Landsat time series. Using the Out-of-bag (OOB) score, the best model was found to be 34.4% better than the worst one. The model that used only the long time series data had almost the same OOB score as the best model. The results indicate that the use of the long Landsat time series improves model performance. Contrary to the previous research employing forest disturbance data as a feature variable had almost no effect on OOB. The bias correction method reduced the relative size of the bias in the estimates of the best model from 3.79% to −1.47%, the bottom 10% bias by 12.5 points, and the top 10% bias by 9.9 points. Depending on the types of forest, important feature variables were differed, reflecting the relationship between the time series remote sensing data we computed for this research and the forests’ phenological characteristics. The availability of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and accessibility of the precise locations of the FIA data are likely to improve the model estimates further. © 2021 by the authors.

To assess the effectiveness of this conservation effort, we (1) evaluated BLM archived images of riparian photo points in the watershed, (2) tested for change over time using data from systematic, intermittent, aerial sampling that acquired 2-cm resolution images from low-altitude surveys conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2006, and (3) compared Landsat scenes of the area from before and after 2003. Willow (Salix spp.) cover was chosen as the primary ecological indictor of riparian condition and we introduce willow canopy (m(2)) per m of stream length in the image field-of-view, as a practical measure of willow status. Archived images from photo points show mostly low-condition riparian plant communities, often with little or no willow canopy evident before 2003, but with conspicuous improvement thereafter. This subjective perception is supported by objective analyses finding, (1) the relative increase in willow cover nearly tripled on one stream, more than doubled on three others, and increased on all but one (fire affected) and (2) a highly significant post-2003 increase in willows in the Landsat record. Thus, the post-2003 increase in willow cover documented in three complementary lines of evidence from ground, air, and space support the predicted ecological benefits of reduced hot-season riparian grazing and the utility of 2-cm imagery as a tool for assessing watershed-wide conservation benefits from a federal cost-share-eligible conservation practice. This appears to be the first use of willow measurements from an aerial survey as a particular indicator of riparian condition and trend and the first demonstration of change detection based on objective measurements from a watershed-scale riparian monitoring effort that used systematic sampling (versus subjective selection) and high sample density to address the large Type II error (false negative) risk common to conventional land-management survey efforts.

Assessment Of Spatial And Temporal Variation In No2 Levels Over Tourist Reception Areas In Poland,"{""Mochocki, D."",""Zgłobicki, W.""}",NA,"Featured Application: Recognizing the temporal and spatial variation in NO2 pollution will allow more effective management of tourist reception areas. Air quality in tourist reception areas can be a significant health concern. It also plays an increasingly important role when it comes to choosing tourist destinations. NO2 is a harmful gas that can cause an increased number of cancer or respiratory diseases. The development of satellite remote sensing techniques now enables a much broader spectrum of air quality analysis than mere point measurements at environment monitoring stations. In the study, the spatial diversity of nitrogen dioxide air pollution over tourist reception areas in Poland was assessed. The lowest pollution was found in national parks and tourist regions. The most polluted air was found in tourist reception areas located near industrial regions and large urban agglomerations. Temporal variation—annual and monthly—and spatial variation were determined (for the period 2019–2021). The highest concentrations, exceeding the WHO recommended value (40 μmol/m2), occurred in the winter and autumn. Low pollution was found in most reception areas in the summer (except cities). In 2020, due to restrictions related to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the NO2 pollution decreased (10–20%). In the cold half of the year (October–April), NO2 concentrations greater than 40 μmol/m2 occurred for about 20% of national parks, 50% of health resorts, 30% of tourist regions, and 100% of provincial capitals. © 2023 by the authors.",mochocki_assessmentspatialtemporalvariation_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
The Drawing Of A National Blue Product Space And Its Evolution,"{""Qi, Xiaofei"",""Xiao, Wenwen"",""Zhang, Jianghua"",""Zhao, Bingxin""}",NA,"As countries transition to a blue economy to increase the long-term benefits of the sustainable use of marine resources, the different pathways toward the blue growth engine depend on identifying profitable ocean-related sectors and activities that offer advantages when competing with other countries.

In order to identify land use patterns and variations in land cover, a 10-year period of land use/land cover changes from 2000 to 2020 was monitored using satellite imagery and the supervised classification method. Primary data were collected through household surveys and focus group discussions. Our analysis suggests that land use has changed over the past 20 years in the study area. As a result, the land area under settlements has substantially increased from 19 square kilometers in 2000 to 48 square kilometers in 2020. Waterbodies were 24 square kilometers in 2010, dropping to 4 square kilometers in 2020, whereas croplands decreased to 218 square kilometers in 2020 from 259 square kilometers in 2000.

In this study, an early landslide detection method based on the D-InSAR technique is proposed. First, SAR data are used to monitor landslide deformation in the Wudongde hydropower reservoir. Then, the ground surface deformation is derived by using the D-InSAR technique, which includes both soil and non-soil deformations. To remove the non-soil deformation, the vertical deformation filter method and slope deformation filter method for extracting soil deformations are established, and the error of D-InSAR results is analyzed. By using two methods, Permanent Scatterers InSAR and Corner Reflectors InSAR, the errors caused by the atmospheric delay are estimated quantitatively. Additionally, the relationship between the landslide deformation and the temporal-spatial change of the SAR data is analyzed, and used to identify landslides.

In-depth knowledge of species' relationships with different land use and climate variables is invaluable to guide conservation efforts, as well as enable predictions to be made about the impacts of future changes in these variables. Here we use 10 years of bumblebee abundance data from the UK, collected by citizen scientists as part of the BeeWalk scheme, to investigate associations between 14 bumblebee species and various land use, habitat and climate variables. National-scale land cover and climate data were complemented with observer-collected habitat data. Bumblebee presence and abundance showed strong relationships with environmental variables. However, interspecific variation was far stronger than commonalities, which suggests that targeted conservation work is required to effectively safeguard particular species. Within species, we found evidence of different habitat associations between reproductive and worker castes. The results also showed that wetland and riparian habitats had consistently positive associations with a number of species, while semi-natural, arable and urban areas had strongly species-specific associations. Synthesis and applications. This study reveals strong effects of specific habitats occurring within broad land cover types on the presence and abundance of bumblebees, with several distinct habitats having importance for different species and castes. Consequently, conservation efforts need to be carefully tailored to particular species. Nevertheless, reversing the loss of semi-natural areas such as wetlands may be the single most generally effective action for bumblebee conservation while improving habitats in urban and arable areas could benefit particular (rare) species. Our results also suggest that the combination of long-term, detailed monitoring data of both species and habitats, here collected by citizen scientists, with remotely sensed landcover and climate data is essential to extend knowledge of species' habitat requirements and to support future research and conservation. © 2022 The Authors.

Monitoring The Production Of Central California Coastal Rangelands Using Satellite Remote Sensing,"{""Potter, C.""}",NA,"There is a long history of livestock grazing on the California Central Coast, dating back over 150 years. In this study, methods were reviewed and results presented for analysis of NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor data to monitor year-to-year variation of forage production on Central Coast rangelands around Big Sur, California. Time series plots from 2000 to 2012 of vegetation greenness for ten rangeland sites showed similar inter-annual patterns in satellite yield index (SYI) values. Most sites reached their maximum greenness levels each year in early May. The year with the highest observed SYI level across most sites was 2005. In the northern portion of the region (north of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park), 2007 was the year with the lowest observed SYI level, whereas in the southern allotments, 2007 was a year with a relatively high SYI level. These methods have the potential to monitor the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland production across the area of individual grazing allotments on the Central Coast. Such a cost-effective and timely approach is required for conservation monitoring in the Big Sur coastal ecosystems where rapid climate change may shift vegetation cover in favor of more extensive rangelands at the expense of forested lands. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",potter_monitoringproductioncentralcalifornia_2014,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Contribution Of Phytoecological Data To Spatialize Soil Erosion: Application Of The Rusle Model In The Algerian Atlas,"{""Boussadia-Omari, Lynda"",""Guettouche, Mohamed Said"",""Hirche, Aziz"",""Ihaddaden, Akli"",""Nedjraoui, Dalila"",""Ouillon, Sylvain"",""Salamani, Mustapha""}",NA,"Among the models used to assess water erosion, the RUSLE model is commonly used. Policy makers can act on cover (C-factor) and conservation practice (P-factor) to reduce erosion, with less costly action on soil surface characteristics. However, the widespread use of vegetation indices such as NDVI does not allow for a proper assessment of the C-factor in drylands where stones, crusted surfaces and litter strongly influence soil protection. Two sub-factors of C, canopy cover (CC) and soil cover (SC), can be assessed from phytoecological measurements that include gravel-pebbles cover, physical mulch, annual and perennial vegetation. This paper introduces a method to calculate the C-factor from phytoecological data and, in combination with remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS), to map it over large areas. A supervised classification, based on field phytoecological data, is applied to radiometric data from Landsat-8/OLI satellite images. Then, a C-factor value, whose SC and CC subfactors are directly derived from the phytoecological measurements, is assigned to each land cover unit. This method and RUSLE are implemented on a pilot region of 3828 km(2) of the Saharan Atlas, composed of rangelands and steppe formations, and intended to become an observatory. The protective effect against erosion by gravel-pebbles (50\%) is more than twice that of vegetation (23\%). The C-factor derived from NDVI (0.67) is higher and more evenly distributed than that combining these two contributions (0.37 on average). Finally, priorities are proposed to decision-makers by crossing the synthetic map of erosion sensitivity and a decision matrix of management priorities.

This study aims at examining the independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to accurately estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB) of primary tropical rainforests in Sabah, Malaysia. Thirty field plots were established in three types of lowland rainforests: alluvial, sandstone hill and heath forests that represent a wide range of AGB density and stand structure. We derived the height percentile and laser penetration variables from the airborne LiDAR and calculated the vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation values, and the texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data. We found that there are moderate correlations between the AGB and laser penetration variables from airborne LiDAR data (r = −0.411 to −0.790). For Landsat 8 OLI data, the 6 vegetation indices and the 46 texture measures also significantly correlated with the AGB (r = 0.366–0.519). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to establish the estimation models for independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI data. The results showed that the model based on a combination of the two remote sensing data achieved the highest accuracy (R2adj = 0.81, RMSE = 17.36%) whereas the models using Landsat 8 OLI data airborne LiDAR data independently obtained the moderate accuracy (R2adj = 0.52, RMSE = 24.22% and R2adj = 0.63, RMSE = 25.25%, respectively).

The TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was applied on the results of the multiobjective optimization (MOO) based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to choose the final optimal solution among the Pareto solutions front generated by MOO.

Overall, results indicated that integration of MOO and MCDM provides an efficient procedure for land use optimization in a complex watershed. Recommendations for Resource Managers The optimization of land use allocation across a complex watershed requires the combined application of several models and techniques to achieve a sustainable decision-making process. By optimization of land use patterns according to the final solution, the surface runoff and sediment load of the watershed will decline, while the economic profit and land use suitability will improve.

The approach was developed to provide the basis for the management plan of a cluster of Natura 2000 special conservation areas in the Central Apennine mountains, Italy (with a total area of 79,500 ha, including 22,130 ha of grasslands). It includes a novel methodology for estimating sustainable stocking rates of different plant communities, at a detailed spatial scale over large areas, based on the integration of: (i) a classification of grassland types, based on physical habitat stratification and vegetation sampling; (ii) a forage-value assessment of each grassland type, obtained from field sampling of botanical composition and corrected with remote-sensing information on pasture microtopography; (iii) an estimate of primary productivity at a detailed spatial scale, obtained from the remote-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calibrated with biomass field data. Additionally, to obtain a bioclimatic characterization of the grasslands and to determine the optimal grazing season for each grassland type, intra-annual phenological signatures were obtained from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Given the inherent limitations in the sustainable stocking rates concept, and the particular susceptibility of dry grasslands to changes in grazing regimes, we tested two biological indicators, the Auchenorrhyncha quality index (AQI) and the Arthropod-based biological soil quality index (QBS-ar). These indicators take into account above- and below-ground arthropod diversity, respectively, and are applied here for the first time to the specific purpose of monitoring grazing load effects on ecological quality and biodiversity of Natura 2000 dry grasslands. We conclude that: (i) it is possible to effectively integrate biomass estimates, obtained from publicly available satellite data, with a relatively simple field sampling of botanical composition, to achieve a detailed spatialization of sustainable stocking rates; (ii) within the same Natura 2000 habitat type there can be a large spatial heterogeneity in both sustainable stocking rates and optimal stocking season: thus, grazing should be kept under careful human control to maintain the habitats in the desired conservation status; (iii) while plant species richness was not correlated to grazing intensity, both AQI and QBS-ar had a significant negative correlation to grazing levels and can thus be useful for monitoring the actual ""sustainability"" of livestock loads on different aspects of grassland ecosystems.

Forests And Trees: A Public Health Perspective,"{""Innes, J. L."",""Sanchez-Badini, O.""}",NA,"Forests have historically supplied humans with timber, fuel, and forage. They have also provided goods and services associated with human physical, mental, social, and spiritual health. Given competing priorities for funding in healthcare, research on forests and health is important from a health economics perspective. Engagement with forests (including wilderness areas, managed production forests, and urban forests) for enhanced human health and wellbeing, and perhaps for illness prevention at a fraction of the cost of medical interventions, is a major opportunity for forest management in the 21st century. Despite this general recognition, there is a lack of information regarding public health policies and approaches that exist in relation to forests and trees. The available literature suggests that the majority in the field of public health view the natural environment with ambivalence. However, a paradigm shift is underway and there is an emerging field working with the positive impacts that trees and forests have on human health and wellbeing. While the value of forests has been noted by many health practitioners in Europe and Japan, health practitioners and the associated health industry in North America remain largely focused on treatment rather than preventative approaches. Largely as a result of advocacy from forestry and recreational organizations, this view is beginning to change, but the focus in the healthcare industry on treatment rather than prevention remains deeply entrenched. © S.F.S.P..

La fréquentation des forêts (y compris les zones sauvages, les forêts exploitées et les forêts urbaines) pour améliorer la santé et le bien-être de l’homme, et peut-être pour prévenir les maladies à une fraction du coût des interventions médicales, constitue un important débouché pour la gestion forestière au xxie siècle. Bien que ces bienfaits soient largement reconnus, on constate un manque d’information en ce qui concerne les politiques et les approches de santé publique en relation avec les forêts et les arbres. La littérature disponible suggère que la majorité des acteurs dans le domaine de la santé publique ont une perception ambivalente de l’environnement naturel.

Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Of Selective Logging In The State Of Mato Grosso Between 1992 And 2016,"{""Ferreira, Nilson Clementino"",""Miguel, Eder Pereira"",""Moretti, Mariana Soares"",""Pedlowski, Marcos Antonio"",""Trondoli Matricardi, Eraldo Aparecido"",""da Costa, Olivia Bueno""}",NA,"Selective logging is a forestry activity that includes harvesting a group of tree species in native forests, usually those of higher value or commercial interest. Selective logging can be carried out legally, in forest management areas and forest areas previously authorized for deforestation, or illegally, in any other unauthorized cases that occur in a predatory manner. In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamic of selectively logged forests in the state of Mato Grosso was assessed based on a time-series (from 1992 to 2016) of logged forests detected using remotely sensed data. Visual interpretation and semi-automatic classification of Landsat imagery were used to detect forests impacted by selective logging activities in the study area. Based on the results, it was estimated that 41,926 km(2) of native forests were selectively logged at least once between 1992 and 2016 in the state of Mato Grosso, an annual average of 1,747 km(2). Selectively logged forests detected showing persistent or recurrent forest disturbances were more frequently observed in the most recent years of this analysis. Most of the selectively logged forests in the study area and period have not been deforested by 2016. It indicates that selective logging is a dissociated phenomenon with deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso. It was also observed that an average of 18 km(2).year(-1) and 268.18 km(2).year(-1) of native forests was selectively logged within Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands between 1992 and 2016. A significant tendency to increase or decrease logging activities within those protected areas in the analyzed period was not observed. Selectively logged forests were persistently detected in the old timber centers located in the central-northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, showing, potentially, new cutting cycles in those previously logged forests. More recently, selective logging activities have reached the last native forest frontier in northwestern Mato Grosso.

P."",""Mushinski, D."",""Zahran, S.""}",NA,"In February of 2016, the City of Flint, Michigan commenced the FAST start initiative with the aim “to get the lead out of Flint” by replacing lead and galvanized steel service lines throughout the city. An estimated 29,100 parcels are scheduled for service line replacement (SLR) at an expected cost of $172 million. The lead exposure benefits of SLR are evaluated by analyzing Sentinel data on hundreds of repeatedly sampled homes in Flint from February 16, 2016 to July 21, 2017, comparing water lead (WL) in homes with and without lead service lines. Samples taken from homes with lead service lines were significantly more likely to exceed specified thresholds of WL than homes without lead service lines. Second, regardless of service line material type, sampled homes experienced significant reductions in WL with elapsed time from Flint's switchback to water provided by the Detroit Water and Sewage Department. Third, the risk of exceedance of WL > 15 μg/L was uncorrelated with service line material type. These results are robust to sample restrictions, period stratification, time operations, reference group definitions, and statistical modeling procedures. On the question of what is gained from SLR over optimal corrosion control techniques, we simulated age-specific lead uptake (μg/day) and blood lead levels (μg/dL) for children in Flint at 16 and 90 weeks of elapsed time from Flint's switchback to Detroit water. At 90 weeks from the switchback in water source, the quantity of water lead consumed by children in homes with lead service lines decreased 93%, as compared to 16 weeks. Lead exposure benefits of SLR have declined in time, with modest differences in lead uptake across homes with different service lines. In light of results, policy considerations for Flint and nationwide are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",zahran_waterleadexposurerisk_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Identifying The Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of Forest Ecotourism Values With Remotely Sensed Images And Social Media Data: A Perspective Of Public Preferences,"{""Chen, Binjie"",""Deng, Jinsong"",""Gan, Muye"",""Lin, Yue"",""Wang, Ke"",""Xu, Zhihong"",""You, Shixue"",""Zheng, Qiming"",""Zhu, Congmou""}",NA,"Ecotourism, as a cultural ecosystem service, is an essential part of rural economic growth. Developing feasible methods and indicators for ecotourism values is vital to exploring the interactions between public preferences and ecosystems, thus providing information for sustainable ecosystem management. However, forest ecotourism value assessments at the regional scale still lack scientific frameworks covering the spatiotemporal dimension. Here, we proposed a framework to assess forest ecotourism values and explore the contributions of public preferences, selecting a typical and abundant forest area, Lin'an County, China. First, we applied a text mining approach on social comments to identify key variables related to public preferences. Then, we mapped these variables with remote sensing and GIS data and incorporated them with a Maxent model. This model revealed the spatiotemporal patterns of forest ecotourism value and its interaction with public preferences, over two periods, i.e., 2010-2014 and 2015-2019. Our results showed that albeit with a minor change magnitude in the entirety of ecotourism values (1-3\% overall decrease), about 34\% and 44\% of forests were observed as significant increases and decreases in ecotourism values, respectively. A large number of increases were concentrated in the village scenic areas, while decreases were observed in planted areas. Such notable changes were mainly attributable to changes in accessibility variables with 67\% of contributions in 2010-2014 and 72\% in 2015-2019. Variables related to human perception and vision (forest attribute and color diversity) also played a part. Our findings infer that local rural-building policies have an evident influence on the distribution and intensity of forest ecotourism.

Each source has its own characteristics, including the spectral bands, spatial resolution, and temporal coverage, which may affect the performance of the vehicle detection algorithm. Vehicle detection for urban applications using remote sensing imagery (RSI) is a difficult but significant task with many real-time applications. Due to its potential in different sectors, including traffic management, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and defense, the detection of vehicles from RS data, such as aerial or satellite imagery, has received greater emphasis. Machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), has proven to be effective in vehicle detection tasks. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely utilized to detect vehicles and automatically learn features from the input images. This study develops the Improved Deep Learning-Based Vehicle Detection for Urban Applications using Remote Sensing Imagery (IDLVD-UARSI) technique. The major aim of the IDLVD-UARSI method emphasizes the recognition and classification of vehicle targets on RSI using a hyperparameter-tuned DL model. To achieve this, the IDLVD-UARSI algorithm utilizes an improved RefineDet model for the vehicle detection and classification process. Once the vehicles are detected, the classification process takes place using the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) model. Finally, a Quantum-Based Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (QDMO) algorithm is applied to ensure an optimal hyperparameter tuning process, demonstrating the novelty of the work. The simulation results of the IDLVD-UARSI technique are obtained on a benchmark vehicle database.

"Quantification Of Groundwater Storage Variations And Stressed Areas Using Multi-Temporal Grace Data: A Case Study Of Upper Indus Plains, Pakistan","{""Amin, M."",""Jamil, A."",""Khan, M. R.""}",NA,"Groundwater is depleting at a more rapid rate than its replenishment in Indus Basin due to increased demand attributed to urbanization, inefficient water management practices especially in the agricultural sector and increase in impervious area in the name of development that can expose the country to severe challenge in the future. Through an unregulated groundwater exploitation now farmers often meet inadequacy in surface water supplies. The concurrent use of surface water and groundwater water now takes place on more than 70% of irrigated lands. Therefore, water resources should be monitored on frequent intervals to sensitize policy makers to formulate an optimal framework for water management practices. This study assessed the competence of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite (GRACE)—based estimation of changes in Ground Water Storage (GWS) as a substitute approach for groundwater quantitative approximation for management of groundwater resources in the Indus basin. The GRACE satellite Total Water Storage (TWS) data from 2011 to 2015 was used to calculate GWS. A common reduction trend was seen in the Upper Indus Plain (UIP) where the average net loss of groundwater was observed to be 1701.39 km3 of water amid 2011-2015. A net loss of around 0.34 km3/year groundwater storage was deduced for the UIP where flooding in 2014 assumed a fundamental part in natural replenishment of groundwater aquifer of the UIP. In view of TWS varieties three out of four doabs Bari, Rachna, Thal demonstrated a decrease in groundwater capacity though Chaj doab brought about increment of 0.09 km3. Based on this study, GRACE-Tellus satellite data is competent enough to hint for groundwater storage variations, however there is a vibrant need to calibrate GRACE-Tellus data with hydrological stations data periodically in order to take a maximum advantage for utility of GRACE to monitor groundwater variations on regional scale.

In New Zealand, the introduced brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, is a reservoir of bovine tuberculosis and as such poses a major threat to the livestock industry. Aerial 1080 poisoning is an important tool for possum control but is expensive, creating an ongoing need for ever more cost-effective ways of using this technique. Aims. To develop geographic information system (GIS) models to better predict spatial variation in the distribution of unmanaged possum populations, to facilitate better targeting of control activities. Methods. Relative abundance of possums and their distribution among habitat types were surveyed in a dry high-country area of the northern South Island. Two GIS-based models were developed to predict the relative abundance of possums on trap lines. The first model used remotely sensed (digital) environmental data; the second complemented the remotely sensed data with fine-scale habitat and topographic data collected on the ground. Key results. Digital environmental factors and habitat features proved to be key predictors of relative possum abundance. In both GIS models, height above valley floor, presence of forest cover and mean annual temperature were the strongest predictors. Conclusions. Predictive maps (projections) of relative possum abundance produced from these models can provide useful decision-support tools for pest-control managers, by enabling possum control to be targeted spatially. Implications. Spatially targeted pest control could allow effective control activities for invasive species or disease vectors to be applied at a lower cost for the same benefit.",porphyre_spatialpredictionbrushtailpossum_2013,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Integrating Remote Sensing And Diver Observations To Predict The Distribution Of Invasive Lionfish On Bahamian Coral Reefs,"{""Davis, Alexandra C.

Although the dynamics and ecological effects of lionfish invasions have been examined in detail at the scale of individual reefs, relatively little information is available on the patterns of the invasion over larger areas. This study combined species counts and microhabitat observations from SCUBA surveys with satellite-derived bathymetry and habitat data to create predictive species distribution maps of lionfish in a 58 km(2) region along the southern edge of the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Models predicted lionfish presence, absence, and density, and were created iteratively using various resolutions and types of data to mimic the datasets that may be available to management in the region. The best-fit model for presence and absence, which combined physical variables derived from remotely sensed satellite data and diver-collected microhabitat data, predicted 89\% of lionfish presence and absence. The best-fit model for lionfish density used 2 resolutions of physical habitat data as well as biological data on densities of large native groupers and accurately predicted 67\% lionfish density. These results suggest that physical habitat may be more important for initial lionfish presence and that biotic interactions influence lionfish density on the reefs. Understanding the limitations and value of each type of data when creating models may be advantageous for planning targeted lionfish removals and prioritizing sites for conservation efforts.",davis_integratingremotesensingdiver_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
A Call For Viewshed Ecology: Advancing Our Understanding Of The Ecology Of Information Through Viewshed Analysis,"{""Aben, Job"",""Pellikka, Petri"",""Travis, Justin M.

Compared to auditory and olfactory cues, the range at which visual cues are likely to be informative to animals is particularly sensitive to the spatial structure of the environment. However, quantification of and accounting for availability of visual information in fundamental and applied ecological research remains extremely limited. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of animal behaviour in a spatial context would greatly benefit from objective quantification of the area an animal can potentially obtain visual information from and therefore draw broad attention to viewshed analysis. This analysis identifies all cells of a gridded surface that are connected by lines-of-sight to a viewpoint, hence, providing information on how much of the environment surrounding a location can be seen. Although heavily used in non-ecological disciplines including civil planning and archaeology, viewshed analysis has seldom been applied in an ecological context.

In this study, the carbon stocks of Dongting Lake wetland during 1995-2020 were estimated using the Integrate Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Tool (InVEST) model and land use/cover data derived from remote sensing data. Subsequently, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was utilized to explore the driving mechanisms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks based on natural and socio-economic factors. Finally, evolution of land use status and carbon stocks was simulated based on patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model during 2030-2050 under different scenarios. The results showed that: 1) over the past 25 years, carbon stocks have been fluctuating in a 'decrease-increase-decrease' pattern, with an average decrease of 39.70 x 10(6) t per year; 2) compared with socio-economic factors, climate conditions have a greater influence on the change of carbon stocks distribution; 3) under the natural variation scenario, the carbon stocks in 2030 is 1345.36 x 10(6) t, which is increased compared with the year of 2020. However, the carbon stocks in 2040-2050 started to show a decreasing trend. Under the ecological conservation scenario, the increase in forest area leads to a significant increase in carbon stocks from 2030 to 2050, which showed a continuous growth trend and obviously enhanced the carbon sequestration capacity of the Ecological and Economic Circle around Dongting Lake.

Gesanet: Geospatial-Awareness Network For Vhr Remote Sensing Image Change Detection,"{""Li, S."",""Wang, X."",""Zhao, K."",""Zhao, X.""}",NA,"The characteristics of very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images (RSIs) have higher spatial resolution inherently and are easier to obtain globally compared with hyperspectral images (HSIs), making it possible to detect small-scale land cover changes in multiple applications. RSI change detection (RSI-CD) based on deep learning has been paid attention to become a frontier research field in recent years and is currently facing two challenging problems. The first is high dependence on registration between bitemporal images caused by high spatial resolution. The other is high pseudo-change information response caused by low spectral resolution. In order to address the abovementioned two problems, a novel RSI-CD framework called geospatial-awareness network (GeSANet) based on the geospatial position matching mechanism (PMM) with multilevel adjustment and the geospatial content reasoning mechanism (CRM) with diverse pseudo-change information filtering is proposed. First, the PMM assigns independent 2-D offset coordinates to each position in the previous temporal image. Afterward, bilinear interpolation is employed to obtain the subpixel feature value after the offset, and the sparse results based on the difference are transmitted to the next level prediction to realize multilevel geospatial correction. The CRM extracts the global features from the corrected sparse feature map in terms of dimensions, implementing effective discriminant feature extraction on the basis of the original feature map in a stepwise refinement manner through the cross-dimension exchange mechanism, to filter out various pseudo-change information as well as maintain real change information. Comparison experiments with five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are carried out on two popular datasets with diverse changes, and the results show that the proposed method has good robustness and validity for multitemporal RSI-CD. In particular, it has a strong comparative advantage in detecting small entity changes and edge details.

We find posterior NH3 emissions peak more in springtime than prior emissions at continental to national scales, and annually they are generally smaller than the prior emissions over central Europe, but larger over most of the rest of Europe. Annual posterior anthropogenic NH3 emissions for 25 European Union members (EU25) are 25\% higher than the prior emissions and very close (<2\% difference) to other inventories. Our posterior annual anthropogenic emissions for EU25, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are generally 10\%-20\% smaller than when treating NH3 fluxes as uni-directional emissions, while the monthly regional difference can be up to 34\% (Switzerland in July). Compared to monthly mean in-situ observations, our posterior NH3 emissions from both schemes generally improve the magnitude and seasonality of simulated surface NH3 and bulk NHx wet deposition throughout most of Europe, whereas evaluation against hourly measurements at a background site shows the bi-directional scheme better captures observed diurnal variability of surface NH3. This contrast highlights the need for accurately simulating diurnal variability of NH3 in assimilation of sun-synchronous observations and also the potential value of future geostationary satellite observations. Overall, our top-down ammonia emissions can help to examine the effectiveness of air pollution control policies to facilitate future air pollution management, as well as helping us understand the uncertainty in top-down NH3 emissions estimates associated with treatment of NH3 surface exchange. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric ammonia contributes to air pollutants and excessive deposition of reactive nitrogen that is detrimental to sensitive ecosystems. Ammonia is emitted mainly by agricultural livestock and fertilizer use. While surface measurements of NH3 are sparse, satellite observations can provide near daily global coverage. Here we calculate monthly NH3 emissions over Europe, the only region adopting NH3 control policies, using an air quality model coupled with a process-based bi-directional NH3 flux scheme and NH3 measurements observed by the CrIS satellite instrument. Our CrIS-derived annual regional total anthropogenic NH3 emissions are close (<2\% difference) to statistic-based bottom-up estimates and are 10\%-20\% lower than when treating NH3 exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere as one-way emissions. Our top-down NH3 emissions estimates may help to assess the efficacy of NH3 abatement policies and provide quantitative support for future policy making.",cao_4dvarinversioneuropean_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Measures of neighborhood environment were resources for healthy foods and physical activity (‘resources’), greenness, violent crime rate, perceived safety and social cohesion. Fixed effects models estimated associations between changes in neighborhood environment exposures and changes in BMI z-score and whether effects differed by sex, baseline age, neighborhood socioeconomic status and population density. Results: Approximately 22% of the cohort was obese (BMI z-score ≥ 95th percentile). In adjusted models, increases in neighborhood greenness and perceived safety were associated with decreases in BMI z-score (mean change in BMI z-score for 1-SD increase for both: -0.012; 95% CI= (−0.018, −0.007)).

However, interpreting monitoring data and deciding when and how to apply environmental management remains a subjective and underdeveloped area of research. Control charts, developed in industrial settings to identify when manufacturing processes were beyond the acceptable bounds of production quality, represent one solution. Despite their potential utility, control charts have rarely been adopted in environmental monitoring. In theory, they are able to identify undesirable trends early and provide transparent and broadly consensual criteria for defining when management action should take place, that is action is triggered when parameter values are observed beyond the agreed control limits of the process. Once triggered, a predetermined management action is implemented. Possible actions are many and varied, and range from investigation and increased monitoring to intervention in the system. Here, the utility of control charts in monitoring water supply in south-western Australia from 1911 to 2010 is examined, and their ability to provide an early, transparent and easily understandable means of triggering management action is assessed. Two control chart types are applied: the X-bar chart and the CUSUM chart. X-bar charts varied widely in their ability to trigger action and were insensitive to many traditional threshold criteria (of which there are many to choose from). In contrast, standard CUSUM charts are specifically designed to detect subtler shifts away from a mean trend and hence provided a more consistent warning of the decline in water supply. While managers were aware of the decline in water supply from an early stage, we believe that control charts could have clearly communicated this earlier, enabling consensus among decision makers to be reached more rapidly. © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.",gove_controlchartsimproveddecisions_2013,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The results show that the downstream Saraunj sub-basins (SWS-11) and Odra sub-basins (SWS-12) were high priority and required immediate soil and water conservation attention. Sub catchments Lobchla West (SWS-4), Deotar (SWS-5), Balot South (SWS-8), Nandhour (SWS-9), and Nakoliy (SWS-10) had medium priority and were designated for moderate soil erosion and degradation. In contrast, sub-catchments Aligad (SWS-1), Kundal (SWS-2), Lowarnala North (SWS-3), Bhalseni (SWS-6), and Uparla Gauniyarao (SWS-7) had low priority, indicating a low risk of soil erosion and degradation. Using the existing groundwater level data, the potential map of groundwater was validated to confirm its validity. According to the guidelines provided by the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD), the results of the groundwater potential zones for good to very good zones have been integrated at the slope and stream order. In a 120.94 km2 area with a slope of 0-5\% in first-order streams, 36 ponds were proposed, and in a 218.03 km2 area with a slope of 15\% in first- to fourth-order streams, 105 retention dams were proposed and recognized as possible sites for artificial groundwater recharge. The proposed water harvesting structure may aid in continuously recharging these zones and benefit water resource managers and planners. Thus, various governmental organizations can use the results to identify possible future recharge areas.",gururani_mappingprospectsartificialgroundwater_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
"Baseline Health Indicators Of Eastern Pacific Green Turtles (Chelonia Mydas) From Baja California Sur, Mexico","{""Fernández-Sanz, H."",""Lara-Uc, M. M."",""Reséndiz, E.""}",NA,"Sea turtle health is an important component of conservation since these taxa is susceptible to infectious diseases that can cause illness leading to mortality. Threats to the health, survival, and reproduction of sea turtles are increasingly documented; however, prevention and control has not yet been successfully achieved. Thus, information about health indicators of sea turtles is a useful tool in order to achieve the best possible conservation measures. The objective of this study was to establish a baseline of health indicators of free-ranging Eastern Pacific green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from neritic foraging and juvenile developmental habitats in Baja California Sur. Here, we contribute baseline and reference interval values of vital signs, complete blood count, and plasma blood chemistry for live specimens from coastal lagoons: Ojo de liebre and San Ignacio in Baja California Sur, Mexico. With the integration of these indicators, 79 turtles were diagnosed as “healthy.” Development of site-specific baseline of health indicators for free-ranging sea turtle populations allows to infer that the habitat provides adequate conditions for these species to carry out the activities corresponding to their stage of development and helps to create the management plans and pertinent conservation strategies as well as for the organisms in the area. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",resendiz_baselinehealthindicatorseastern_2018,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Extracting Soil Moisture From Fengyun Satellite Images Using A Convolutional Neural Network,"{""Han, Y."",""Li, P."",""Wang, W."",""Zhang, C."",""Zhang, X."",""Zhou, S.""}",NA,"Objective: Obtaining soil moisture data with high temporal and spatial resolution is important for agricultural management and scientific research. The goal of this study is to use the Fengyun meteorological satellite as the data source, and utilize the advantage of convolutional neural network (CNN) that can independently learn the deep correlation between input variables to obtain high-quality soil moisture data. Fengyun 3 meteorological satellite is China's second-generation meteorological satellite. The goal of Fengyun 3 is to acquire all-weather, multi-spectral and 3D observations of global atmospheric and geophysical elements, providing satellite observation data to medium-term numerical weather prediction; monitoring ecological environment and large-scale natural disasters; providing satellite meteorological information for global environmental change, global climate change research, and others. The medium-resolution spectral imager II (MERSI-II) is one of the main loads of Fengyun 3D (FY-3D) and is equipped with 25 channels, including 16 visible-near-infrared channels, 3 short-wave infrared channels, and 6 medium-long infrared channels. Among the 25 channels, 6 channels with 250 m ground resolution and 19 channels with 1 000 m ground resolution are obtained. The research used FY-3D to obtain high-precision soil moisture data and constructed a soil moisture monitoring technology system that can greatly reduce the dependence on foreign data, operating cost of large-scale monitoring systems, and improve system stability, safety, and monitoring timeliness. Improving the ability of meteorological services and level of domestic satellite applications is important. To obtain high spatial and temporal resolution soil moisture data using Fengyun satellite imagery, this study proposes a method of extracting soil moisture data using convolutional neural network(CNN). Method: CNN is a new machine learning technology that was newly developed in recent years and has attracted research attention because of its powerful autonomous learning ability. This technology has achieved great success in image classification, image segmentation, and other fields. This study constructed a soil moisture convolutional neural network (SMCNN) to achieve the goal of obtaining large-scale high-precision soil moisture monitoring using FY-3D remote sensing image. The SMCNN model includes seven parts, namely, input, temperature subnetwork, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extraction module, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) extraction module, surface albedo extraction module, soil moisture subnetwork, and output. The temperature and soil moisture subnetworks contain a feature extractor and an encoder. The feature extractor is used to generate a feature vector for each pixel, where the feature extractor of the temperature subnetwork has 11 convolutional layers, and the feature extractor of the humidity subnetwork consists of 9 convolutional layers, and the convolutional layer uses a 1×1 type convolution kernel. The encoder is used to fit the extracted features to the target variable. Both subnetworks use the average variance as a loss function. In the model training stage, the preprocessed FY-3D image and corresponding observation point data are used as inputs, and in the model test phase, only the preprocessed FY-3D image is used as the input. The temperature subnetwork is used to obtain the ground temperature from the FY-3D image, the NDVI extraction module is used to extract the NDVI from the FY-3D image, the EVI extraction module is used to extract the EVI from the FY-3D image, and the surface albedo extraction module is used to obtain surface albedo. The extraction results of the aforementioned four parts are used as input to the soil moisture subnetwork. The soil moisture subnetwork uses the extracted ground temperature, NDVI, EVI, and ground albedo to retrieve soil moisture. The output of the model is the pixel-by-pixel soil moisture value. The model is trained using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and finally the tr ined model is used to extract regional soil moisture data. Result: Ningxia was selected as the experimental area. The FY-3D used in this study is all from the satellite ground receiving station of Ningxia Meteorological Bureau, including 161 images in 2018 and 92 images in 2019, with a total of 253. After the images were stitched together, a total of 92 images covering the entire territory of Ningxia were formed. The ground observation data used in this study came from the automatic weather station deployed by the Ningxia Meteorological Bureau. The time range was from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019. A total of 36 ground temperature stations and 37 soil moisture stations were observed. To verify the validity and rationality of this proposed method, we selected the linear regression and back propagation(BP) neural network models as the contrast models to conduct the data experiment. The mean square error was selected as the evaluation index. The comparison experimental results show that the RMSE of the SMCNN model is 0.006 7, which is higher than the comparison model. The experimental results show that the SMCNN model has advantages in extracting soil moisture from wind cloud images. Conclusion: The SMCNN model proposed in this paper fully utilizes deep learning technology to learn independently and improves the accuracy of obtaining soil moisture. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) Based on the analysis of the characteristics of FY-3D data, a step-by-step inversion strategy is established for the inversion of soil moisture requirements, and each step inversion uses a more relevant variable. The proposed strategy is an important reference for inverting other variables. 2) CNNs are used to construct network structures for inversion of surface temperature and soil moisture, and organized into a complete soil moisture inversion network structure. This structure enables direct access to soil moisture data from FY-3D data. 3) The feature value extracted by the 1×1 type convolution kernel used can be regarded as a spectral index and has a physical meaning. The main disadvantage of this study is that in the late stage of crop growth, the effect of vegetation index becomes invalid due to the saturation problem, which influences the inversion effect. This study aims to find other suitable supplementary parameters to introduce into the model to solve the effect of vegetation index saturation. © 2020, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

Stereo Mapping Of Ming Great Wall With Remote Sensing,"{""Chen Jun"",""Jin ShuPing"",""Liao AnPing"",""Rong DaWei"",""Yang ZhaoJun"",""Zhang HongWei"",""Zhao YouSong""}",NA,"Listed by UNESCO in 1987 as a World Heritage site, the world-famous Ming Great Wall stretches several thousands of kilometers across northern China, and served as a massive military defensive system which in recent times has a unique historical, artistic and scientific value. Due to historical reasons and lack of advanced technologies, construction resources and conservation status of Ming Great Wall have not been investigated in any systematic manner; indeed, the extent of the Great Wall has not even been measured. This has resulted in a shortage of reliable first-hand scientific information on actual size, spatially resource distribution and preservation status of this World Heritage site. Driven by the urgent need to establish protection, research, renovation and management of Ming Great Wall, a comprehensive investigation and spatial mapping was jointly organized and completed by the State Bureau of Survey and Mapping and State Administration of Culture Heritage. High resolution digital stereo models at 1:10000 map scale covering the whole length of the Ming Great Wall have been created by photogrammetric reconstruction using nearly ten thousand aerial images. Spatial distribution and attributes of the wall sections, trenches and various subsidiary facilities in the surroundings of the Great Wall were measured with the help of digital photogrammetry workstations and results from field studies. Reliable and precise information about the Ming Great Wall has now been obtained and documented, including surface lengths, resource distribution, and preservation status. For example, the total length of Ming Great Wall is 8851.8 km, of which 6259.6 km is of actual wall, 2232.5 km of natural terrain, and 359.7 km of trenches. In category lengths, 1828.8 km is constructed of stone, 3411.3 km of earth, 249.6 km in brick, 197.5 km of cliff wall and the rest 572.4 km of other means.

Current efforts focus on revegetation in deforested oilfields, while research remains limited on alternative ecological restoration strategies aimed at establishing new eco-systems in oilfields. This study employed multi-source remote sensing data from 1985 to 2022 to calculate a remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) and constructed an integrated forest health index (IFHI), in order to evaluate the ecological restoration effects in the Gudao shelterbelt of Shengli Oilfield in the Yellow River Delta, and investigated the impact of oil extraction by considering forest phenology. The RSEI of the shelterbelt showed an upward trend and reached a Good level of ecological environment quality from 1990 to 2003, but it declined after that, indicating the potential of RSEI to quickly assess ecological restoration effects and guide management at different stages. Comparing the restoration effects of different tree species, a Robinia pseudoacacia L. (RP) and Fraxinus velutina Torr.

For the selected beaches, which differed for typology, location, shape, level of urbanization and tourism, we identified the available surfaces for recreational uses trough the observation of satellite images. WTP results indicate that respondents would be willing to pay a contribution from 9 to 15(sic) per season. WTP is principally positive correlated with some variables like beach frequentation, residence in the localities, available services on the beach. The value of the selected beaches was calculated multiplying the sustainable carrying capacity of each site with their related maximum WTP.

A Geoscience-Aware Network (Gaslumnet) Combining Unet And Convnext For Slum Mapping,"{""Feng, Z."",""Hu, Y."",""Lu, W."",""Peng, F."",""Yang, Y.""}",NA,"Approximately 1 billion people worldwide currently inhabit slum areas. The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 11.1) underscores the imperative of upgrading all slums by 2030 to ensure adequate housing for everyone. Geo-locations of slums help local governments with upgrading slums and alleviating urban poverty. Remote sensing (RS) technology, with its excellent Earth observation capabilities, can play an important role in slum mapping. Deep learning (DL)-based RS information extraction methods have attracted a lot of attention. Currently, DL-based slum mapping studies typically uses three optical bands to adapt to existing models, neglecting essential geo-scientific information, such as spectral and textural characteristics, which are beneficial for slum mapping. Inspired by the geoscience-aware DL paradigm, we propose the Geoscience-Aware Network for slum mapping (GASlumNet), aiming to improve slum mapping accuracies via incorporating the DL model with geoscientific prior knowledge. GASlumNet employs a two-stream architecture, combining ConvNeXt and UNet. One stream concentrates on optical feature representation, while the other emphasizes geo-scientific features. Further, the feature-level and decision-level fusion mechanisms are applied to optimize deep features and enhance model performance. We used Jilin-1 Spectrum 01 and Sentinel-2 images to perform experiments in Mumbai, India. The results demonstrate that GASlumNet achieves higher slum mapping accuracy than the comparison models, with an intersection over union (IoU) of 58.41%. Specifically, GASlumNet improves the IoU by 4.60~5.97% over the baseline models, i.e., UNet and ConvNeXt-UNet, which exclusively utilize optical bands. Furthermore, GASlumNet enhances the IoU by 10.97% compared to FuseNet, a model that combines optical bands and geo-scientific features.

Predictive Soil Mapping Using Historic Bare Soil Composite Imagery And Legacy Soil Survey Data,"{""Bedard-Haughn, A. K."",""Shirtliffe, S. J."",""Sorenson, P.

While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958-1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75-25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R-2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R-2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R-2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g(-1), with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time.",sorenson_predictivesoilmappinghistoric_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

The current study used an integrated approach that combines remote sensing and GIS to simulate and predict plausible LULC changes for Dedza district in Malawi for the years 2025 and 2035 based on Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov Chain model embedded in IDRISI Software. The model was validated using a simulated and actual LULC of 2015. The overall agreement between the two maps was 0.98 (98\%) with a simulation error of 0.03 (3.0\%).

Mapping Winter-Wheat Biomass And Grain Yield Based On A Crop Model And Uav Remote Sensing,"{""Feng, Haikuan"",""Li, Zhenhai"",""Xu, Kaijian"",""Yue, Jibo"",""Zhou, Chengquan""}",NA,"Timely and accurately estimates of crop biomass and grain yield estimation are crucial for agricultural management. Optical remote sensing techniques can provide crop parameters (e.g., biomass, fractional vegetation cover (FVC)) at regional and larger scales. However, such techniques saturate at high crop canopy cover and cannot detect biomass stored in reproductive organs. The AquaCrop model can be used to estimate FVC, biomass, and grain yield output based on crop growth environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, rainfall, irrigation). In this work, we developed a method for estimating and mapping crop biomass and grain yield using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images and AquaCrop. The combination of low-cost UAV remote sensing data and AquaCrop can be used to map wheat biomass and grain yield before harvest. This work investigated whether biomass and grain yield can be predicted using measurements of biomass and FVC in several winter-wheat fields at an early growing stage using ground-based and remote sensing-based methods. FVC, biomass, and grain yield were measured at several key growing stages (jointing (S1), heading (S2), flowering (S3), grain filling (S4)) and harvest (H) during 2014-2015. We specifically evaluated the performances of using field- and UAV-based FVC and biomass measurements from different growing-stage combinations (e.g., S1-S4, S1-S3, and S1-S2) to calibrate the AquaCrop model and estimate biomass and grain yield. The results indicate that winter-wheat biomass and grain yield can be estimated by calibrating AquaCrop using (i) biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results also reveal that the biomass and grain yield estimated using FVC and AquaCrop have poor accuracy compared with the biomass and grain yield estimated using (i) only biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results suggest that the combined use of UAV remote sensing and AquaCrop can be used to obtain maps of biomass and biomass yield. When estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one month (13 May) before harvest (11 June), the predicted biomass and grain yield agreed with the measured values (biomass: n = 96, coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.61, mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.69 t ha(-1), root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 2.10 t ha(-1), normalized RMSE (nRMSE) = 18.5\%; grain yield: n = 48, R (2) = 0.63, MAE = 0.96 t ha(-1), RMSE = 1.16 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 21.9\%).

Geospatial-Based Soil Management Analysis Using Novel Technique For Better Soil Conservation,"{""Aslam, Bilal"",""Khalil, Umer""}",NA,"In the current times, anthropogenic activities and natural change in the processes cause much change in the world, causing multiple hazards and disturbing the natural flow. One such hazard is soil erosion, which is increasing day by day due to changes in climate and anthropogenic activities. Thus, identifying the soil erosion vulnerable zones and map such regions is extremely useful for the town and land planning. Such soil vulnerability mapping gives a quantifiable and reliable method to evaluate soil erosion in a wide variety of circumstances. In the current research, the soil erosion method, revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system (GIS), has been applied for soil erosion approximation in the Rawalpindi Tehsil situated in the province of Punjab in the northeast part of Pakistan. The Rawalpindi metropolis is a semi-arid area with a drainage area of 259 km(2) up to the gauging station. The datasets of the RUSLE model were valued from the remote sensing data, and the probable soil loss regions were estimated with the help of GIS. All the datasets, i.e., slope, soil, precipitation, crop management factor, was then used for soil erosion potential mapping. The potential map is generated from the weighted overlay method that gives an output showing that most of the study area is in medium (67.2\%) to high (20.2\%) erosion zone with erosion intensities of < 20 tons ha(-1) year(-1) and < 40 tons ha(-1) year(-1) respectively. Concurrently, few patches lie in high potential zones that need to be looked after and need to be pondered in terms of mitigation measures. Accuracy assessment for land-use and land-cover classes for the Rawalpindi watershed was also accomplished by comparing ground-truth with satellite data, and the Kappa coefficient of the agreement was also obtained. The overall accuracy was 85\%, and the Kappa coefficient was found to be 84\%, inferring the acceptability of results.

Guiding Decisions On The Future Of Dams: A Gis Database Characterizing Ecological And Social Considerations Of Dam Decisions,"{""Gold, A. J."",""Lowder, K. A."",""Parent, J.

Most of these dams no longer serve their original purpose and removal can provide ecological benefits and eliminate future maintenance costs and hazards. However, many decision-makers have been ill-prepared by community resistance to proposals to remove dams. Given the number of dam removal initiatives that have failed or been delayed due to community resistance, both ecological and social attributes of dams need to be better mapped and conveyed in understandable ways. The goal of this study was to support future decisions regarding dams by 1) developing a set of metrics to assess the social and ecological dimensions of dams, and 2) using these metrics to develop a GIS database, for the 1000+ dams in the Narragansett Bay/Rhode Island area of southern New England. The database characterizes the ecological benefits of dam removal or modification, in terms of fish passage, and the social dimensions that may need to be considered when engaging a community in discussions about the future of a dam. Our emphasis was on small-head dams (i.e. <5 m tall) which comprise most dams in the study area. We created social value metrics that used GIS data to assess dams and their impoundments for potential benefits to waterfront properties, history, sense-of-place, and recreation. We modeled our ecological metrics and ranking system after the Nature Conservancy's Northeast Aquatic Connectivity study which considered factors relating to river connectivity and watershed quality. We evaluated our social and ecological metrics using case studies of dams in the study area that had been previously removed or modified. We assumed that both sets of dams were ecologically important, but the modified dams had higher social value that prohibited their removal. Dams that had been removed or modified were both ranked as high priority in terms of value for fish passage, particularly for diadromous fish. Dams that were modified to include fish passage had substantially larger impoundments, more waterfront properties, and more features associated with recreational or cultural value (e.g. boating opportunity, visibility, etc.). Our social metrics were consistent with expectations based on the limited case studies (7 removals, 19 modifications) available in the study area.

Also, few studies have explored the potential benefits of PGIS/PPGIS approaches for landscape management and stewardship among the participating stakeholders. Objectives: Our aim is (1) to establish an understanding of the realization of landscape services at the local scale across three multifunctional rural landscapes in Tanzania through PGIS/PPGIS approaches and (2) to create an understanding of these approaches’ potential to support participatory spatial planning. Methods: Semi-structured surveys (n = 313) including participatory mapping of provisioning and cultural landscape services were organised to characterise their spatial patterns. The survey results were shared with the communities (n = 97) in workshops where services were ranked and the participants interviewed about their map-reading capacity, personal learning experiences, and their ability to use maps to express opinions. Results: The most abundant landscape services are sites for social gatherings and cultivation. The spatial patterns of provisioning services are realizations of human benefits from the patterns of the biophysical landscape. Overall, cultural landscape services show clustering and small spatial extent (except aesthetics). The PGIS/PPGIS approach allows for local-level, spatially specific discussions between stakeholders. The visual power of maps and satellite images is particularly emphasised.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the flood hazard areas in hydrological plain basins with scarce slope, taking as a case study the Samborombon river basin located in the Pampean Plain, Argentina. For this, a flood hazard map was made based on the analytical hierarchy process and using a GIS, taking into account physical aspects of the terrain, observations, and field measurements. Likewise, the map was validated using satellite images and the inhabitants in danger in the basin were quantified. The results show that the flood hazard areas correspond mainly to the floodplain of rivers and tributaries, while the main and secondary divide zones have low flood hazard sectors. On the other hand, numerous urban settlements were identified within flood hazard areas, these being urban settlements in the vicinity of old urban centers and new gated communities with high value homes, quantifying 1961 inhabitants at flood hazard and showing poor territorial planning.

Soft Classification Of Mixed Seabed Objects Based On Fuzzy Clustering Analysis Using Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Data,"{""Kim, Heungsik B."",""Miller, John R."",""Narayanan, Ramu"",""Sohn, Gunho""}",NA,"Coastal seabed mapping is essential for a variety of nearshore management related activities including sustainable resource management, ecological protection, and environmental change detection in coastal sites. Recently introduced airborne LIDAR bathymetry (ALB) sensors allow, under favorable environmental conditions and mapping requirements, time and cost efficient collection of shallow coastal seabed data in comparison to acoustic techniques. One important application of these sensors, given ALB seabed footprint size on the order to several meters in diameter for shallow waters, is the development of seabed classification maps and techniques to classify both benthic species and seabed sediment. The coastal seabed is a complex environment consisting of diverse habitats and, thus, necessitates classification methods which readily account for seabed class heterogeneity. Recent ALB classification studies have relied on classification techniques that assign each ALB shot to a single seabed class (i.e., hard classification) instead of allowing for assignment to multiple seabed classes which may be present in an illuminated ALB footprint (i.e., soft classification). In this study, a soft seabed classification (SSC) algorithm is developed using unsupervised classification with fuzzy clustering to produce classification products accounting for a sub-footprint habitat mixture. With this approach, each shot is assigned to multiple seabed classes with a percentage cover measuring the extent to which each seabed class is present in the ALB footprint. This has the added benefit of generating smooth spatial ecological transitions of the seabed instead of sharp boundaries between classes or clusters. Furthermore, due to the multivariate nature of the SSC output (i.e., percentage cover for each seabed class for a given shot), a recently developed self-organizing map neural network-based approach to geo-visualization of seabed classification results was used to visualize seabed habitat diversity. An ALB dataset of an area approximately 20000 m(2) collected from Quebec, Canada was used. Cross-validation of the SSC approach yields percentage cover accuracy of approximately 71.7\% with 16 seabed classes for a real ALB dataset, while dominant seabed class prediction based on hardening of percentage cover predictions yielded 66\% accuracy for 4 seabed classes.

The accuracy of the remote sensing approach wits assessed by comparing the Output from automated mapping of physical habitat features using image analysis and GIS and habitat maps derived from field Survey. 2. Unsupervised classification of the aerial photography and ATM imagery mapped hydraulic habitat such as pools and riffles with overall accuracies of 57\% and 65.5\%, respectively. Submerged sand and silt deposits, which are important to river lamprey ammocoetes could not be identified on the imagery by simple unsupervised or Supervised classification. They Could be mapped indirectly, however, by association between their presence and morphological attributes such as backwaters and embayments in the bank profile detectable on the imagery. Remotely determining the likely presence and location of lamprey ammocoete habitat can be useful in planning detailed electrofishing campaigns to estimate lamprey densities, to assess conservation status and any change over time, and to determine the need for restoration strategies. 3. The results suggest that on rivers wider than 20m without a continuous wooded riparian fringe, and where there is good quality imagery, it is possible to automate mapping of physical habitat features; important to many river species with high nature conservation interest. As a result organizations charged with monitoring and conserving river species should consider investing in airborne imagery covering river sytems of high conservation value.

The discharge of raw wastewater in the river, the dumping of garbage at the riverbanks, missing regulations of proper disposal and a lack of education of the population are resulting in an unsatisfactory condition of the river. Community involvement is not planned in the current state of the management strategy. This chapter is an assessment of the current state of Bagmati River based on three indicators: the role of local stakeholders in the management system, water quality and the role of water in the urban dynamics. On the basis of 240 household surveys we identified the income and financial reserves of the locals and the religious and cultural values. These aspects play a significant role in implementing new adaptions of technologies and in implementing new rules and guidelines. The spatial analysis was conducted with the use of GIS and remote sensing through updating the land use plan that was the basis for an interactive map enhanced by a photographic record built on site. The map facilitated us to locate 10 sampling sites along the stretch of Bagmati River and its main tributaries, where water samples were extracted. The samples were examined under physico-chemical, chemical and biochemical water quality parameters. The contrast of the land use map and the lab results enabled us to see the impact of the different urban land uses and urban activities on the water quality.

Accurate predictions of changes to coastal ecosystem boundaries, including in response to projected relative sea-level rise, enable advanced planning to minimize and offset anticipated losses and minimize social disruption and cost of reducing threats to coastal development and human safety. The observed mean landward migration of three mangroves' seaward margins over four decades was 25, 64, and 72 mma-1, 12 to 37 times the observed relative sea-level rise rate. Two of the sites had clear trends in reductions in mangrove area, where there was a highly significant correlation between the change in position of the seaward mangrove margin and change in relative sea-level. Here it can be inferred that the force of sea-level rise relative to the mangrove surface is causing landward migration. Shoreline movement was variable at a third site and not significantly correlated with changing sea-level, where it is likely that forces other than change in relative sea-level are predominant. Currently, 16.5%, 23.4%, and 68.0% of the three mangroves' landward margins are obstructed by coastal development from natural landward migration.

Individuals or entities often have multiple interests ranging from financial benefits to reducing climate change-related risks, where choosing one interest may negatively impact other interests and societal welfare. These types of COI require specific management strategies. This study examines COI from land-use decisions as an intersection of different perspectives on land use (e.g., land conservation versus land development), which can have various consequences regarding GHG emissions. This study uses the state of New Jersey (NJ) in the United States of America (USA) as a case study to demonstrate COI related to soil-based GHG emissions from land conversions between 2001 and 2016 which caused $722.2M (where M = million = 106) worth of “realized” social costs of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) emissions. These emissions are currently not accounted for in NJ’s total carbon footprint (CF), which can negatively impact the state’s ability to reach its carbon reduction goals. The state of NJ Statutes Annotated 26:2C-37 (2007): Global Warming Response Act (GWRA) (updated in 2019) set a statewide goal of reducing GHG emissions to 80 percent below 2006 levels by 2050. Remote sensing and soil data analysis allow temporal and quantitative assessment of the contribution of land cover conversions to NJ’s CF by soil carbon type, soil type, land cover type, and administrative units (state, counties), which helps document past, and estimate future related GHG emissions using a land cover change scenario to calculate the amount of GHG emissions if an area of land was to be developed. Decisions related to future land conversions involve potential COI within and outside state administrative structures, which could be managed by a conflict-of-interest policy. The site and time-specific disclosures of GHG emissions from land conversions can help governments manage these COI to mitigate climate change impacts and costs by assigning financial responsibility for specific CF contributions. Projected sea-level rise will impact 16 out of 21 NJ’s counties and it will likely reach coastal areas with densely populated urban areas throughout NJ. Low proportion of available public land limits opportunities for relocation. Increased climate-change-related damages in NJ and elsewhere will increase the number of climate litigation cases to alleviate costs associated with climate change.

Furthermore, a method to improve predictions of wheat traits was proposed by sequentially removing soil pixels from the distribution of vegetation index (VI) values. The experimental area, located at Aranjuez (Madrid, Spain), was divided into four sectors with 133 plots in total. Different N doses were applied to the plots to create high experimental intravariability. In each plot, wheat traits were measured at harvest. An (UAV) was flown at growth stages (GS) – GS32, GS39, and GS65 – to ensure correct monitoring of the crop. Four VIs, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) and Blue-Red Index (BRI1) were selected based on the sensor spectral information and their suitability for estimating wheat traits. A sequential cutting method (threshold value optimization, TVO) was implemented to remove soil background pixels, based on threshold values computed from the VIs distributions.

The coordinated development of ecology and economy is a major theoretical and practical problem for the Qinba Mountains, which is once one of the 14 contiguous destitute areas in China. Based on the land use and cover change (LUCC) data interpreted by medium-resolution remote sensing images, this study adopted the modified equivalent factor method to calculate ecosystem service value (ESV) and its temporal and spatial variation in the Qinba Mountains. A comprehensive index system was constructed to measure the socioeconomic development level and to reveal the coupling relationship between the ESV and socioeconomic development. The results show that: (1) for 2000-2015, the ESV in these areas was increasing, the proportion of forest ESV was the largest, and it increased significantly. (2) The level of socioeconomic development was constantly improving, and the differences within the region were gradually emerging. (3) Except for the Hantai District, which has been in a highly uncoordinated state, the degree of coordination between ESV and socioeconomic development has improved year by year, and most counties were in a state of medium coordination, or above.

Mountain ecosystems are generally considered to be less complex and less species diverse due to the harsh environmental conditions. As such, they are also more sensitive to the various impacts of the Anthropocene. For this reason, mountain regions may serve as sentinels of change and provide ideal ecosystems for studying climate and global change impacts on biodiversity. We here review different facets of anthropogenic impacts on mountain freshwater ecosystems. We put particular focus on micropollutants and their distribution and redistribution due to hydrological extremes, their direct influence on water quality and their indirect influence on ecosystem health via changes of freshwater species and their interactions. We show that those changes may drive pathogen establishment in new environments with harmful consequences for freshwater species, but also for the human population. Based on the reviewed literature, we recommend reconstructing the recent past of anthropogenic impact through sediment analyses, to focus efforts on small, but highly productive waterbodies, and to collect data on the occurrence and variability of microorganisms, biofilms, plankton species and key species, such as amphibians due to their bioindicator value for ecosystem health and water quality.

Forest-Scale Phenotyping: Productivity Characterisation Through Machine Learning,"{""Bombrun, Maxime"",""Dash, Jonathan P."",""Dungey, Heidi S."",""Pearse, Grant D."",""Pont, David"",""Watt, Michael S.""}",NA,"Advances in remote sensing combined with the emergence of sophisticated methods for large-scale data analytics from the field of data science provide new methods to model complex interactions in biological systems. Using a data-driven philosophy, insights from experts are used to corroborate the results generated through analytical models instead of leading the model design. Following such an approach, this study outlines the development and implementation of a whole-of-forest phenotyping system that incorporates spatial estimates of productivity across a large plantation forest. In large-scale plantation forestry, improving the productivity and consistency of future forests is an important but challenging goal due to the multiple interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, the long breeding cycle, and the high variability of growing conditions. Forest phenotypic expression is highly affected by the interaction of environmental conditions and forest management but the understanding of this complex dynamics is incomplete. In this study, we collected an extensive set of 2.7 million observations composed of 62 variables describing climate, forest management, tree genetics, and fine-scale terrain information extracted from environmental surfaces, management records, and remotely sensed data. Using three machine learning methods, we compared models of forest productivity and evaluate the gain and Shapley values for interpreting the influence of categorical variables on the power of these methods to predict forest productivity at a landscape level. The most accurate model identified that the most important drivers of productivity were, in order of importance, genetics, environmental conditions, leaf area index, topology, and soil properties, thus describing the complex interactions of the forest. This approach demonstrates that new methods in remote sensing and data science enable powerful, landscape-level understanding of forest productivity. The phenotyping method developed here can be used to identify superior and inferior genotypes and estimate a productivity index for individual site. This approach can improve tree breeding and deployment of the right genetics to the right site in order to increase the overall productivity across planted forests.",bombrun_forestscalephenotypingproductivity_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Holidays In Lights: Tracking Cultural Patterns In Demand For Energy Services,"{""Roman, Miguel O."",""Stokes, Eleanor C.""}",NA,"Successful climate change mitigation will involve not only technological innovation, but also innovation in how we understand the societal and individual behaviors that shape the demand for energy services. Traditionally, individual energy behaviors have been described as a function of utility optimization and behavioral economics, with price restructuring as the dominant policy lever. Previous research at the macro-level has identified economic activity, power generation and technology, and economic role as significant factors that shape energy use. However, most demand models lack basic contextual information on how dominant social phenomenon, the changing demographics of cities, and the sociocultural setting within which people operate, affect energy decisions and use patterns. Here we use high-quality Suomi-NPP VIIRS nighttime environmental products to: (1) observe aggregate human behavior through variations in energy service demand patterns during the Christmas and New Year's season and the Holy Month of Ramadan and (2) demonstrate that patterns in energy behaviors closely track sociocultural boundaries at the country, city, and district level. These findings indicate that energy decision making and demand is a sociocultural process as well as an economic process, often involving a combination of individual price-based incentives and societal-level factors. While nighttime satellite imagery has been used to map regional energy infrastructure distribution, tracking daily dynamic lighting demand at three major scales of urbanization is novel. This methodology can enrich research on the relative importance of drivers of energy demand and conservation behaviors at fine scales.

However, hydrologists in Saudi Arabia face serious challenges, specifically due to the rare availability of surface runoff data. In this study, the soil conservation service-curve number (SCS-CN) method integrated with geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) was utilized to estimate the surface runoff in Wadi-Uranah basin, in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Different thematic maps such as slope, hydrologic soil group (HSG), land use/land cover (LULC), and daily rainfall have been created in GIS environment and processed to generate the curve number (CN) and surface runoff maps. Based on the soil classification results, the study area was categorized into two HSGs (B and C). The dominant HSG was group C, representing about 98.8\% of the total area. The LULC analysis showed four main land use types in the study region: urban, rocks, barren soil, and agricultural areas. Furthermore, the finding results showed that CN values for the normal conditions (CNII) ranged between 74 and 93 in agricultural and both urban and rock areas, respectively. The CN(II)values were further corrected using slope data to derive slope-adjusted CNII. Moreover, the rainfall-runoff results showed an increase in the daily runoff of the study region with a minimum of 15 mm to a maximum of 74 mm. Another interesting result was rainfall-runoff linear regression analysis that showed a good correlation of 0.98. Additionally, the peak runoff hydrograph flows for 10-, 50-, and 100-year return periods obtained from the SCS-based dimensionless unit hydrograph were 828, 1353, and 1603 m(3)/s, respectively.

In this context, the development of risk analysis and management tools as well as sustainable and cost-effective treatment processes is essential. The research project TALGENTOX, funded by the Ibero-American Science and Technology Program for Development (CYTED-2019), aims to address this ambitious challenge in countries with different environmental and social conditions within the Ibero-American context. It is based on a multidisciplinary approach that combines ecology, water management and technology fields, and includes research groups from Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Spain. In this review, the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in freshwaters from these countries are summarized. The presence of cyanotoxins has been confirmed in all countries but the information is still scarce and further monitoring is required. In this regard, remote sensing or metagenomics are good alternatives at reasonable cost. The risk management of freshwaters from those countries considering the most frequent uses (consumption and recreation) has been also evaluated. Only Spain and Peru include cyanotoxins in its drinking water legislation (only MC-LR) and thus, there is a need for regulatory improvements. The development of preventive strategies like diminishing nutrient loads to aquatic systems is also required. In the same line, corrective measures are urgently needed especially in drinking waters. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have the potential to play a major role in this scenario as they are effective for the elimination of most cyanotoxins classes. The research on the field of AOPs is herein summarized considering the cost-effectiveness, environmental character and technical applicability of such technologies.

Advanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, forest fragmentation, rainfall and soil types were derived from remote sensing data. Multiple buffer zones of villages, roads, railways and canals were also determined for analyzing the forest health status. These layers were prepared in the geographical information system. These layers were given weightage using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. These layers were integrated to prepare forest health map using weighted overlay method. The results revealed that the largest forest area was found under moderately healthy forest (37\%) followed by healthy forest (31\%) and unhealthy forest (13\%).

Remote sensing precipitation estimations have recently been widely employed in water resources management due to the lack of observed precipitation measurements in remote areas. However, remote sensing precipitation estimations are not free from systematic errors. This study aims to bias-correct the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) satellite precipitation estimations using the Gaussian-Copula approach and illustrates how it improves the simulated flow characteristics in the Shah Bahram basin in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, southwestern Iran. The Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) calculated between the original CHIRPS precipitation estimation and observation in the Shah Bahram basin equals - 0.14; however, when bias-corrected CHIRPS data was compared to observation, the NSE increased to 0.23, suggesting about 158\% improvement in the CHIRPS precipitation estimation when bias-corrected with the Gaussian-Copula approach. Next, the bias-corrected precipitation time series were utilized as the hydrologic modeling system inputs to simulate flow specifications such as discharge and peak value. Then, the simulation of the flow parameters was carried out with both original and bias-corrected CHIRPS satellite precipitation estimations and the ground-based precipitation. Though the NSE statistic of the simulation for the testing period has not changed significantly, the Pbias statistic has considerably improved.

G."",""Morse, A."",""Tasumi, M."",""Trezza, R.""}",NA,"The quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) from irrigated projects is important for water rights management, water resources planning and water regulation. Traditionally, ET has been estimated by multiplying a weather-based reference ET by crop coefficients (Kc) determined according to the crop type and the crop growth stage. However, there is typically question regarding whether crops grown compare with the conditions represented by the Kc values, especially in water short areas. In addition, it is difficult to estimate the correct crop growth stage dates for large populations of crops and fields. METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) is an image-processing model for calculating ET as a residual of the surface energy balance. METRIC is a variant of SEBAL, an energy balance process developed in the Netherlands by Bastiaanssen and was extended to provide tighter integration with ground-based reference ET. METRIC was applied with Landsat images in southern Idaho to predict monthly and seasonal ET for water rights accounting and for operation of ground water models. ET ""maps"" (i.e., images) provide the means to quantify, in terms of both the amount and spatial distribution, the ET on a field by field basis. The ET maps have been used in Idaho to quantify net ground-water pumpage in areas where water extraction from underground is not measured and to estimate recharge from surface-irrigated lands.

Acute form of water scarcity is a common phenomenon in this area during the hot-summer period. The water scarcity in this study region is due to the presence of monsoonal vagaries, unfavorable lithological condition and availability of poor groundwater. Therefore, watershed management is the primary concern for sustainable development of natural resources like water and land for optimal development of watershed and economic activities. Therefore, optimal measurement of rainfall-induced runoff is indeed necessary to understand the hydrological behavior. Several traditional statistical and advanced machine learning methods has been used previously to measure surface runoff among the researchers. It is difficult to simulate the required runoff with physical-based models due to the complexity and non-linear behavior of the runoff phenomena, as well as the absence of relevant historical data in all places.

Mapping Beach Morphodynamics Remotely: A Novel Application Tested On South African Sandy Shores,"{""Harris, Linda"",""Nel, Ronel"",""Schoeman, David""}",NA,"Sandy beaches have been identified as threatened ecosystems but despite the need to conserve them, they have been generally overlooked. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) has emerged as an efficient method of selecting areas for conservation priority. However, SCP analyses require digital shapefiles of habitat and species diversity. Mapping these attributes for beaches from field data can take years and requires exhaustive resources. This study thus sought to derive a methodology to classify and map beach morphodynamic types from satellite imagery. Since beach morphodynamics is a strong predictor of macrofauna diversity, they could be considered a good surrogate for mapping beach biodiversity. A dataset was generated for 45 microtidal beaches (of known morphodynamic type) by measuring or coding for several physical characteristics from imagery acquired from Google Earth. Conditional inference trees revealed beach width to be the only factor that significantly predicted beach morphodynamic type, giving four categories: dissipative, dissipative-intermediate, intermediate and reflective. The derived model was tested by using it to predict the morphodynamic type of 28 other beaches of known classification. Model performance was good (75\% prediction accuracy) but misclassifications occurred at the three breaks between the four categories. For beaches around these breaks, consideration of surf zone characteristics in addition to beach width ameliorated the misclassifications. The final methodology yielded a 93\% prediction accuracy of beach morphodynamic type. Overlaying other considerations on this classification scheme could provide additional value to the layer, such that it also describes species' spatial patterns. These could include: biogeographic regions, estuarine versus sandy beaches and short versus long beaches. The classification scheme was applied to the South African shoreline as a case study. The distribution of the beach morphodynamic types was partly influenced by geography. Most of the long, dissipative beaches are found along the west coast of the country, the south coast beaches are mostly dissipative-intermediate, and the east coast beaches range from short, estuarine pocket and embayed beaches in the former Transkei (south east), to longer intermediate and reflective beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (in the north east). Once combined with the three biogeographic regions, and distinguishing between estuarine and sandy shores, the South African coast comprised 24 different beach types. Representing shorelines in this form opens up potential for numerous spatial analyses that can not only further our understanding of sandy beach ecology at large spatial scales but also aid in deriving conservation strategies for this threatened ecosystem.

This study investigated the influence of land use change and seasonality on the quality of springs. For this purpose, physicochemical parameters characteristic of water quality in five collection points of springs with a surrounding area of distinct land use history were analyzed between 2015 and 2017. Following the current legislation, the only parameter in imbalance was dissolved oxygen (DO). However, these are common values, considering springs. The results showed that most of the parameters presented variation to different land uses. This interpretation was intensified mainly by the variations in Sodium, TN, DO and temperature. However, few of these variables were related to local seasonality (only turbidity, sulfate and potassium). These results prove that it is possible to integrate the change in the use and occupation of the basin, determined by the variations observed in the sampled points.

Alluvial Groundwater Recharge Estimation In Semi-Arid Environment Using Remotely Sensed Data,"{""Almeida, Cristiano N."",""Coelho, Victor Hugo R."",""Freitas, Emerson S."",""Gusmao, Ana Claudia V."",""Montenegro, Abelardo A. A."",""Montenegro, Suzana"",""Oliveira, Leidjane M."",""Silva, Bernardo B.""}",NA,"Data limitations on groundwater (GW) recharge over large areas are still a challenge for efficient water resource management, especially in semi-arid regions. Thus, this study seeks to integrate hydrological cycle variables from satellite imagery to estimate the spatial distribution of GW recharge in the Ipanema river basin (IRB), which is located in the State of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. Remote sensing data, including monthly maps (2011-2012) of rainfall, runoff and evapotranspiration, are used as input for the water balance method within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Rainfall data are derived from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Version 7 (3B43V7) product and present the same monthly average temporal distributions from 15 rain gauges that are distributed over the study area (r = 0.93 and MAE = 12.7 mm), with annual average estimates of 894.3 (2011) and 300.7 mm (2012). The runoff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) method, which is based on regional soil information and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor image, represents 29\% of the TMPA rainfall that was observed across two years of study. Actual evapotranspiration data, which were provided by the SEBAL application of MODIS images, present annual averages of 1213 (2011) and 1067 (2012) mm. The water balance results reveal a large inter-annual difference in the IRB GW recharge, which is characterized by different rainfall regimes, with averages of 30.4 (2011) and 4.7 (2012) mm year(-1). These recharges were mainly observed between January and July in regions with alluvial sediments and highly permeable soils. The GW recharge approach with remote sensing is compared to the WTF (Water Table Fluctuation) method, which is used in an area of alluvium in the IRB. The estimates from these two methods exhibit reliable annual agreement, with average values of 154.6 (WTF) and 124.6 (water balance) mm in 2011. These values correspond to 14.89 and 13.53\% of the rainfall that was recorded at the rain gauges and the TMPA, respectively. Only the WTF method indicates a very low recharge of 15.9 mm for the second year. The values in this paper provide reliable insight regarding the use of remotely sensed data to evaluate the rates of alluvial GW recharge in regions where the potential runoff cannot be disregarded from WB equation and must be calculated spatially.

LST dynamic was investigated for three different periods: Before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. The study was conducted in Casablanca City. The results showed that during the emergence of COVID-19 with lock-down policy applied, the LST decreases remarkably compared to the previous 4-years’ average LST. After the easing of restrictions, the LST increased to exceed the previous 4-year mean LST. Furthermore, throughout all studied periods, the LST recorded its higher values in industrial zones and areas with high urban density and urban transportation, which indicates the conspicuous impact of anthropogenic activities on the LST variation.

Air Pollution is severely degrading the quality of air and climatic systems and is affecting the health of the people and plants. This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal distributions of some selected air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) and their association with NDVI in Lahore and its adjoining regions from July 2018 to December 2020. The present study utilized air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) observations obtained from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5P, and NDVI retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra satellite. The mean annual high NO2 concentrations of 163.0 × 10–6 mol m−2, 160.0 × 10–6 mol m−2, and 154.0 × 10–6 mol m−2 were found over northwestern, central, and southern boundaries of Lahore, respectively, while the SO2 concentration of 315.4 × 10–6 mol m−2 was observed over the northwestern boundary of Lahore. Moreover, the mean annual NDVI ranging from 0.5 to 0.65 was observed in the east, northeast, southeast and outside the boundary of Lahore towards Amritsar. The monthly time series analyses show that the highest values of NO2, SO2 and NDVI are found to be 149 × 10–6 ± 1.58 × 10–5 (mole m−2), 544 × 10–6 ± 1.68 × 10–4 (mole m−2), and 0.670 ± 0.12 in January 2019, December 2020 and February 2019, respectively.

"Geomorphic And Land Cover Identification Of Dust Sources In The Eastern Great Basin Of Utah, Usa","{""Hahnenberger, Maura"",""Nicoll, Kathleen""}",NA,"This study identifies anthropogenically disturbed areas and barren playa surfaces as the two primary dust source types that repeatedly contribute to dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of western Utah, U.S.A. This semi-arid desert region is an important contributor to dust production in North America, with this study being the first to specifically identify and characterize regional dust sources. From 2004 to 2010, a total of 51 dust event days (DEDs) affected the air quality in Salt Lake City, UT. MODIS satellite imagery during 16 of these DEDs was analyzed to identify dust plumes, and assess the characteristics of dust source areas. A total of 168 plumes were identified, and showed mobilization of dust from Quaternary deposits located within the Bonneville Basin. This analysis identifies 4 major and 5 secondary source areas for dust in this region, which produce dust primarily during the spring and fall months and during moderate or greater drought conditions, with a Palmer Drought Index (PDI) of 2 or less. The largest number of observed dust plumes (similar to 60\% of all plumes) originated from playas (ephemeral lakes) and are classified as barren land cover with a silty clay soil sediment surface. Playa surfaces in this region undergo numerous recurrent anthropogenic disturbances, including military operations and anthropogenic water withdrawal. Anthropogenic disturbance is necessary to produce dust from the vegetated landscape in the eastern Great Basin, as evidenced by the new dust source active from 2008 to 2010 in the area burned by the 2007 Milford Flat Fire; this fire was the largest in Utah's history due to extensive cover of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) along with drought conditions. However, dust mobilization from the Milford Flat Burned Area was limited to regions that had been significantly disturbed by post-fire land management techniques that consisted of seeding, followed by chaining or tilling of the soil. Dust storms in the eastern Great Basin negatively impact air quality and transportation in the populated regions of Utah; this study details an improved forecasting protocol for dust storm events that will benefit transportation planning and improve public health.

Conventional approaches (both field-based and remote sensing) to monitoring rangeland productivity fail to effectively capture important aspects of this heterogeneity. While field methods can effectively capture high levels of detail at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, they are limited in their applicability and scalability to larger spatial extents and longer time periods. Alternatively, remote sensing based approaches that scale broad spatiotemporal extents simplify important heterogeneity occurring at fine scales. We address these limitations to monitoring rangeland productivity by combining a continuous plant functional type (PFT) fractional cover dataset with a Landsat derived gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) model. Integrating the annual PFT dataset with a 16-day Landsat normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) composite dataset enabled us to disaggregate the pixel level NDVI values to the sub-pixel PFTs. These values were incorporated into the productivity algorithm, enabling refined estimations of 16-day GPP and annual NPP for the PFTs that composed each pixel.

"Governance Issues Constraining The Deployment Of Flood Resilience Strategies In Maroua, Far North Region Of Cameroon","{""Ndi, Roland Akoh"",""Wanie, Clarkson Mvo""}",NA,"Purpose - Cities across the globe, particularly those of the less developed world, face long-term challenges associated with floods which impact negatively on the resilience of city systems and their inhabitants. In the city of Maroua, most urban management stakeholders have been unable to integrate flood resilience research into urban development issues. It is against this background that the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the governance issues constraining the deployment of flood resilience strategies implemented by residents in flood-prone zones and those used by the government via administrative authorities and institutions charged with urban development to flood-related risks in the city of Maroua, Far North Region of Cameroon. Design/methodology/approach - Field surveys, participant observations, interviews, and on-the-spot appraisals were carried out with residents in flood-prone neighbourhoods and municipal authorities on the state of recurrent floods including mitigating strategies being implemented. Findings - The results revealed that Maroua has a fragile ecological setting which has increased the vulnerability of the town to flood-related risks. This is further aggravated by the fact that municipal authorities are yet to have a thorough mastery of such recurrent flood incidences due to their limited planning horizons, rendering the urban poor disproportionately susceptible to flood-related stresses. This exposes them to unavoidable flood associated hazards such as water borne diseases (typhoid and cholera) as they are bogged down by physical and financial limitations. Besides, decision-making processes in relation to managing urban systems are not guided by good governance as efforts to enhance and integrate the local population for flood resilience are neither participatory nor inclusive, ushering the urban environment of Maroua into a frivolous path to profligacy. Originality/value - For resilience to be deeply entrenched, the paper proffers for the mainstreaming of flood resilience strategies into urban development plans through multi-stakeholder involvement across different sectors and departments, as well as the setting up of a practical time table for monitoring the progress of these measures through geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and geographical information systems.",wanie_governanceissuesconstrainingdeployment_2018,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

A Quantitative Framework For Analysing Long Term Spatial Clustering And Vegetation Fragmentation In An Urban Landscape Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data,"{""Dube, Timothy"",""Kowe, Pedzisai"",""Mutanga, Onisimo"",""Odindi, John""}",NA,"Rapid urbanization threatens urban green spaces and vegetation, demonstrated by a decrease in connectivity and higher levels of fragmentation. Understanding historic spatial and temporal patterns of such fragmentation is important for habitat and biological conservation, ecosystem management and urban planning. Despite their potential value, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) measures have not been sufficiently exploited in monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban areas. LISA statistics are an important structural measure that indicates the presence of outliers, zones of similarity (hot spots) and of dissimilarity (cold spots) at proximate locations, hence they could be used to explicitly capture spatial patterns that are clustered, dispersed or random. In this study, we applied landscape metrics, LISA indices to analyse the temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation patterns of vegetation patches in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe using Landsat series data for 1994, 2001 and 2017. Analysis of landscape metrics showed an increase in the fragmentation of vegetation patches between 1994-2017 as shown by the decrease in mean patch size, an increase in number of patches, edge density and shape complexity of vegetation patches. The study further demonstrates the utility of LISA indices in identifying key hot spot and cold spots. Comparatively, the highly vegetated northern parts of the city were characterised by significantly high positive spatial autocorrelation (p < 0.05) of vegetation patches. Conversely, more dispersed vegetation patches were found in the highly and densely urbanized western, eastern and southern parts of the city. This suggest that with increasing vegetation fragmentation, small and isolated vegetation patches do not spatially cluster but are dispersed geographically. The findings of the study underline the potential of LISA measures as a valuable spatially explicit method for the assessment of spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban vegetation patterns.",kowe_quantitativeframeworkanalysingterm_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Although many studies are available for the region, there is a need for a general overview of the best available information. Here, we assembled a comprehensive collection of environmental data and briefly described the ocean climatology and its variability in the Azores. Data sources used in this study included remote sensing oceanographic data for 2003-2013 (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, particulate inorganic carbon, and particulate organic carbon), derived oceanographic data (primary productivity and North Atlantic oscillation index) for 2003-2013, and in situ data (temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate and silicate) obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. We have produced 78 geographic datasets of environmental data for the Azores region that were deposited at the World Data Center Pangaea and also made available at the SIGMAR Azores website. As with previous studies, our results confirmed a high spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variability of the marine environment in the Azores region, typical of mid-latitudes. For example, lower sea surface temperature was found in the northern part of the study area coinciding with higher values for chlorophyll-a concentration, net primary production (NPP), and particulate organic and inorganic carbon. Higher values for some of these parameters were also found on island slopes and some seamounts. Compiled data on the environmental conditions at near-seabed revealed some notable variations across the study area (e.g., oxygen and nutrients) and with depth (e.g., temperature, salinity, and oxygen). Knowledge of these patterns will help improve our understanding of the distribution of many deep-sea organisms such as fish, cold-water corals, and sponges, thereby supporting the implementation of marine spatial planning and other management measures. It should be noted that the assembled datasets suffer from a number of limitations related to the accuracy of remote sensing and global bathymetry data, or to the limited and unevenly distributed collection of environmental observations.

In addition, it discusses ways in which multiple uses enhance the economic feasibility of a telemedicine consultation link in a given geographic area. The overall consultation rate during periods of remote physician coverage was 21 per cent, compared with 24 per cent during on-site coverage. The telephone became a partial substitute for the TV for some uses but could not replace it in diagnostic decisions. As telemedicine is obviously underutilized in a one-satellite system, we compare a five-satellite network with other ways of delivering service. The resulting estimated cost of $18.50 an hour, or 2/3 of the cost of a physician providing direct care, includes a TV component of $5.30 an hour of use in a 1,750-hour year. The critical factor is that the NP can be a physician substitute if there is TV backup. The TV appears to prevent unnecessary referrals compared to a physician on site. Whether TV increases the length of the consult compared to the phone for conditions of equal severity is not entirely clear. If TV is compared to transporting a patient to a central place, the implicit value of transport time and disutility required to justify using TV is $7.55 per consult in a five-clinic network.

Towards A Comprehensive And Consistent Global Aquatic Land Cover Characterization Framework Addressing Multiple User Needs,"{""Clevers, Jan G. P. W."",""Herold, Martin"",""Tsendbazar, Nandin-Erdene"",""Xu, Panpan""}",NA,"Aquatic land cover represents the land cover type that is significantly influenced by the presence of water over an extensive part of a year. Monitoring global aquatic land cover types plays an essential role in preserving aquatic ecosystems and maintaining the ecosystem service they provide for humans, while at the same time their accurate and consistent monitoring for multiple purposes (e.g. climate modelling, biodiversity conservation, water resource management) remains challenging. Although a number of global aquatic land cover (GALC) datasets are available for use to monitor aquatic ecosystems, there are prominent variabilities among these datasets, which is primarily caused by the inconsistency between different land versus water-related monitoring approaches and character-ization schemes. As aquatic land cover exists in many different forms on Earth (e.g. wetland, open water) and can be mapped by different approaches, it is necessary to consider a much more consistent and comprehensive characterization framework that not only ensures the consistency in the monitoring of aquatic land cover but also serves the needs of multiple users (e.g. climate users, agricultural users) interested in different aspects of aquatic lands. In this study, we addressed this issue by 1) reviewing 33 GALC datasets and user needs identified from the citing papers of current datasets and international conventions, policies and agreements in relation to aquatic ecosystems, 2) proposing a global characterization framework for aquatic land cover based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classifier principles and the identified user needs, and 3) highlighting the opportunities and challenges provided by remote sensing techniques for the implementation of the proposed framework. Results show that users require or prefer various kinds of information on aquatic types including vegetation type, water persistence, the artificiality of cover (i.e. artificial vs natural), water salinity, and the accessibility to the sea (i.e. coastal vs inland). Datasets with medium to high spatial resolution, intra-annual dynamics and inter-annual changes are needed by many users. However, none of the existing datasets can meet all these requirements and a rigorous quantitative accuracy assessment is lacking to evaluate its quality for most of the GALC datasets. The proposed framework has three levels and users are allowed to derive their aquatic land cover types of interest by combining different levels and classifiers of information. This comprehensive mapping framework can help to bridge the gap between user needs and current GALC datasets as well as the gap between generic and aquatic land cover monitoring. The implementation of the framework can benefit from evolving satellite-data availability, improved computation capability and open-source machine learning algorithms, although at the same time it faces challenges mainly coming from the complexity of aquatic ecosystems. The framework proposed in this study provides insights for future operational aquatic land cover monitoring initiatives and will support better understanding and monitoring of complex aquatic ecosystems.",xu_comprehensiveconsistentglobalaquatic_2020,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Assessment Of Water Quality Based On Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager Associated With Human Activities In Korea,"{""Choi, M."",""Lim, J.""}",NA,"Water pollution such as green algae blooms and eutrophication in freshwater fatally influences both water quality and human society. Water quality issues in the 4 major rivers in Korea, including the Nakdong, have recently become a major concern. For this reason, it is essential to monitor water quality parameters (WQPs) that have a widespread characteristic to ensure maintenance of an effective water management system. The possibility of utilizing remote sensing technology for monitoring water quality on a regional scale has been recently investigated. The main objective of this study is to evaluate potential applications of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for estimating water quality in the Nakdong River, Korea. Correlations between Landsat 8 bands and in situ measurements are determined, and water quality models are established for estimating suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and total phosphorus (TP). The results demonstrate that WQPs correlated well with band reflectance values from Landsat 8. Band 5 was reasonably correlated with all WQPs, particularly with SS (R = −0.74) and Chl-a (R = −0.71). This study constructed multiple regression equations for WQPs based on correlation analysis through band combination and band ratio. The spatial distribution of WQPs in the Nakdong River on October 27, 2013 and May 16, 2014 indicate that the river was nearly eutrophic from human activities. Based on the results, the Landsat 8 OLI may be an appropriate data for estimating and monitoring water quality parameters on a regional scale. However, further validation is required to support the findings of this study. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",lim_assessmentwaterqualitybased_2015,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

These methodologies aim to address issues such as insufficient protected area, excessive human-induced influences, and inadequate protection of endangered animals within nature reserve boundaries. Leveraging comprehensive data from diverse sources, including ground surveys and remote sensing detection, we conducted a survey using the Chebaling National Nature Reserve in China and its environs as a case study. Models such as the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), Fragstats, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) were employed to identify areas with highly suitable habitats, significant landscape diversity, and superior ecosystem quality for 16 key species. Subsequently, the irreplaceable value of the research area was calculated using the Marxan model, leading to the establishment of a novel natural boundary and development plan. We propose expanding the original nature reserve to 1344 km², dividing it into a core reserve (321 km², 23.88%) and a general control area (1023 km², 76.12%). Additionally, we recommend further division of the general protected area into several functional zones to facilitate the integration of functional diversity and ecological protection. This contributes to a more scientifically informed and rational management approach for the Chebaling National Nature Reserve. Moreover, this integrated framework offers valuable insights for assessing and identifying animal habitats globally and spatially zoning other nature reserves. © 2023 The Authors",wang_optimizingnaturalboundarydefinition_2024,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Topographic Diversity As An Indicator For Resilience Of Terrestrial Protected Areas Against Climate Change,"{""Beierkuhnlein, Carl"",""Hoffmann, Samuel"",""Lawrence, Alexandra""}",NA,"Habitat loss from unrelenting human pressure is causing an unprecedented decline in global biodiversity. Protected areas (PAs) are meant to counteract loss and fragmentation of ecosystems and today PAs form the backbone of conservation strategies worldwide. However, anthropogenic climate change can severely reduce the effectiveness of PAs. Conservation professionals are in need of concrete spatial information on climatic changes within PAs in order to put forward practicable strategies to safeguard PA effectiveness in the face of climate change. In this study, we take advantage of openly accessible data on the disappearing climate index (DCI) to examine which PA characteristics are linked to climate change resilience on a global scale. DCI provides a measure of the relative area (percent of total area) within a PA that exhibits certain climatic conditions that will either disappear entirely or move outside the boundaries of the PA by the year 2070. Our results show that topographic diversity is highly correlated with reduced climate change impacts in PAs worldwide. We analyzed three different PA characteristics representing topographic diversity: PA area, maximal elevational difference (MED) and median terrain ruggedness (TR). All three characteristics are highly correlated with a decrease in the disappearing climate index (DCI). These results hold true across localities and even PA management practices. IUCN management category IV (habitat/species management area) and V (protected landscape/seascape) exhibit on average the highest DCI values. As an indicator for PA resilience under climate change, topographic diversity can be assessed easily through publicly available data and remote sensing products. This ease-of-use leaves topographic diversity standing in marked contrast to overall environmental diversity as an actionable conservation metric. Of course, topographic diversity alone is not a sufficient criterion on which to base conservation decisions. However, neither should the potential usefulness of topographic diversity be underestimated. As an actionable and complementary metric in combination with biological information topographic diversity can be an exceptional tool for decision making by PA managers, conservation practitioners and politicians.

J.""}",NA,"Opportunities to boost climate change mitigation and adaptation (CCMA) and sustainable conservation financing may lie in enhancing blue carbon sequestration, particularly in developing nations where coastal ecosystems are extensive and international carbon markets offer comparatively attractive payments for environmental stewardship. While blue carbon is receiving increased global attention, few credit-generating projects are operational, due to low credit-buyer incentives with uncertainty in creditable emissions reductions and high project costs. Little empirical guidance exists for practitioners to quantify return-on-investment (ROI) and viability of potential projects, particularly for rehabilitation where multiple implementation options exist with diverse associated costs. We map and model drivers of mangrove natural regeneration (NR) using remote sensing (high-resolution satellite imagery segmentation and time-series modeling), and subsequent carbon sequestration using field- and literature-derived data, across abandoned aquaculture ponds in the Philippines. Using project-specific cost data, we then assess ROI for a hypothetical rehabilitation-focused mangrove blue carbon project at a 9.68 ha abandoned pond over a 10-year timeframe, under varied rehabilitation scenarios {[}NR vs. assisted natural regeneration (ANR) with planting], potential emissions reduction accreditation methodologies, carbon prices and discount rates. NR was faster in lower-lying ponds with lower tidal exposure (greater pond dike retention). Forecasted carbon sequestration was 3.7- to 5.2-fold and areal ""greenbelt"" regeneration 2.5- to 3.4-fold greater in our case study under ANR than NR. Variability in modeled sequestration rates drove high uncertainty and credit deductions in NR strategies. ROI with biomass-only accreditation was low and negative under NR and ANR, respectively. ROI was greater under ANR with inclusion of biomass and autochthonous soil carbon; however, neither strategy was highly profitable at current voluntary market carbon prices. ANR was the only scenario that fulfilled coastal protection greenbelt potential, with full mangrove cover within 10 years. Our findings highlight the benefits of ANR and soils inclusion in rehabilitation-oriented blue carbon projects, to maximize carbon sequestration and greenbelt enhancement (thus enhance pricing with potential bundled credits), and minimize forecasting uncertainty and credit-buyers' perceived risk. An ANR rehabilitation strategy in low-lying, sea-facing abandoned ponds with low biophysical intervention costs may represent large blue carbon CCMA opportunities in regions with high aquaculture abandonment.",duncan_potentialreturninvestmentrehabilitation_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Feasibility Study Of Using Crowdsourcing To Identify Critical Affected Areas For Rapid Damage Assessment: Hurricane Matthew Case Study,"{""Liu, Rui"",""Yuan, Faxi""}",NA,"The rapid damage assessment plays a critical role in crisis management. Collection of timely information for rapid damage assessment is particularly challenging during natural disasters. Remote sensing technologies were used for data collection during disasters. However, due to the large areas affected by major disasters such as Hurricane Matthew, specific data cannot be collected in time such as the location information. Social media can serve as a crowdsourcing platform for citizens' communication and information sharing during natural disasters and provide the timely data for identifying affected areas to support rapid damage assessment during disasters. Nevertheless, there is very limited existing research on the utility of social media data in damage assessment. Even though some investigation of the relationship between social media activities and damages was conducted, the employment of damage-related social media data in exploring the fore-mentioned relationship remains blank. This paper, for the first time, establishes the index dictionary by semantic analysis for the identification of damage-related tweets posted during Hurricane Matthew in Florida. Meanwhile, the insurance claim data from the publication of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation is used as a representative of real hurricane damage data in Florida. This study performs a correlation analysis and a comparative analysis of the geographic distribution of social media data and damage data at the county level in Florida.

In this study, the distribution of the White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) in Poland was used to assess the usefulness of a demographic model compared to an area-based model for predicting the occurrence of breeding pairs in local landscapes. The models were applied to the European Forest Map and to CORINE land cover data, two spatial databases derived from remote sensing. We tested the performance of the models by comparing predicted occurrence of the species with actual occurrence in 10 km x 10 km of the Polish Ornithological Atlas Database (POAD). Both models proved useful for identifying areas with high potential for hosting breeding woodpeckers. However, the demographic model performed consistently better at predicting the presence of at least one breeding pair in local landscapes. In north-eastern and south-eastern Poland, expected occurrences coincided with the actual occurrence of the species according to POAD. In north-western Poland, however, occurrence was predicted but not confirmed by the atlas data. The eastern regions are situated at the border to Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. These countries hold large areas of high conservation value forests and large populations of White-backed Woodpecker. This pattern evokes the need for cross-border governance, and planning with an eco-regional perspective that considers both EU and non-EU countries. Moreover, the results stress the need to incorporate population requirements when assessing the distribution of forests with high conservation value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. In this study, we verified whether China's GF-2 HD satellite (GF-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the Landsat 8 OLI and China's GF-1 HD satellite (GF-1). We performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. We evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km2 per device. The construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m2 of grassland. The average area of grassland damaged by 3 MW and 1.5 MW turbines was 5757 m2 and 2496 m2, respectively. Approximately 2.44 km2 of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. Roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. The average difference between the measured and calculated GF-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. Therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and GF-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. In addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed.

Wetlands: An Overview,"{""Tiner, R.

Besides their intrinsic value to specially adapted plants and animals, wetlands produce a wealth of environmental services that directly benefit human societies (Table 1.1). Given this recognition, there has been increasing attention given to wetland conservation around the globe (e.g., Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Wetlands have been acquired as nature preserves, sanctuaries, and wildlife management areas or identified as globally important for water birds or vital for storing carbon to help ameliorate the effect of human-induced greenhouse gases on atmospheric temperature. Wetland restoration has become a subject for scientific investigation as well as for commercial enterprise. Some governments have enacted laws and/or policies to protect wetlands or regulate conversion of these valued resources and initiated wetland inventories to aid wetland management and conservation. Since this book focuses on advances in remote sensing technology to perform such inventories, a brief overview of wetlands seems warranted.

This study aims to assess the cooling effect of blue-green spaces in Bhubaneswar, India, and explore their implications for mitigating UHI effects. Satellite images were processed with Google Earth Engine (GEE) to produce information on the blue-green spaces’ land surface temperatures (LST). The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were employed to quantify the presence and characteristics of these blue-green spaces. The findings revealed significant spatial variations in the LST, with higher temperatures observed in bare land and built-up areas and lower temperatures in proximity to the blue-green spaces. In addition, a correlation analysis indicated the strong influence of the built-up index (NDBI) on the LST, emphasising the impact of urbanisation on local climate dynamics. The analysis demonstrated the potential of blue-green spaces in reducing surface temperatures and mitigating UHI effects. Based on these results, strategic interventions were proposed, such as increasing the coverage of green spaces, optimising access to water bodies, and integrating water-sensitive design principles into urban planning to enhance the cooling effects and foster a more sustainable and resilient urban environment. This study highlighted the importance of leveraging remote sensing and GEE for urban UHI analyses. It provides valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to prioritise nature-based solutions for heat mitigation in Bhubaneswar and other similar cities.

The Himalayan foothill region of Lower Dibang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh, India is dotted with dairy farming units, locally known as Khutti (cowsheds). The semi-pastoral traditional practice of dairying among the Nepali community has its own economic, geographical and social ramifications. The khuttis or the goths (dairy units) move from one place to another depending on fodder availability and seasonality. This chapter seeks to identify the cost and production, price and profitability of dairying livelihood; the status of livelihood of the dairy farming households and its relationship with the changing climatic conditions in the study area. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the study. Primary data was collected with the help of structured survey schedule. A handheld geographical positioning system (GPS) device was used to derive accurate longitudinal and latitudinal positions of the dairy farms and other features. Topographic maps and satellite imageries were used for the construction of maps. A simple cost-benefit analysis was carried out to assess the cost and profitability of the dairy units. Generally the households manage to stay marginally above the poverty level, with the standards of living being generally low. Buffaloes tended to provide better returns from dairying than cows. The markedly traditional mode of dairying has aided the gradual improvement of the livelihood of the dairying community although their tenuous existence could be undermined by climate change in the coming years.

Use Of Hedgerows By Mammals In An Intensive Agricultural Landscape,"{""Dupras, J."",""Pelletier-Guittier, C."",""Theau, J.""}",NA,"Agricultural intensification causes habitat modification, sometimes leading to habitat loss and subsequent loss of connectivity. Remaining species in these agriculture-dominated landscapes often use hedgerows, such as windbreaks or riparian strips, as movement corridors or even as habitats. However, the understanding of the use of these hedgerows by mammals is limited and could be improved with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, which are unbiased, detailed and repeatable. The aim of this study was to assess the attributes that affect medium- and large-sized mammals' use of hedgerows, with in situ and remotely sensed data (including LiDAR and multispectral images) in an agriculture-dominated landscape in southern Quebec. Twenty-three hedgerows were selected and characterized with both field surveys and remote sensing analyses, like LiDAR metrics and vegetation indices. Wildlife frequentation of each hedgerow was measured using camera traps, from late spring to early fall in 2018. 431 mammal detections were obtained among all 23 hedgerows. From this, seven species were recorded, all of them opportunistic and well adapted to agricultural environment. Results showed significant differences in mammal use of hedgerows. Coefficients of the better-ranked models based on AICc indicated a positive relationship between hedgerow length and their use by mammals, and a negative relationship with the hedgerow width. Hedgerow use by mammals also increased as tree cover and understory density increased, and as human disturbance decreased. These results characterized for the first time the variables influencing hedgerow use by a broad set of medium- and large-sized mammal species and confirmed their use as movement corridors and/or habitat. This study also confirmed the complementary usefulness of variables derived from remote sensing combined with field data. The low explanatory power of variables often cited in the literature (e.g. NDVI, gappiness) also highlights the need to further explore their specific influence on mammals. The information provided by this study supports the beneficial role played by hedgerows for wildlife conservation in intensive agricultural landscapes.

The results show that the greatest frequency of hot spots occurred in wood and oil palm plantations and logging concessions (47\%), followed by conservation areas (31\%) and community land (22\%). Local elections involve land transactions, and fires were used as a cheap way to increase the land value. The use of fire as means of land clearing was strongly influenced by local politics.

Recently, deep learning approaches have been applied to these tasks separately. However, the lack of semantic supervision makes the training of stereo matching model susceptible to data disturbance, resulting in inferior generalization ability; foreground objects are sometimes confused with background pixels in RGB images, limiting the classification accuracy. By exploring the relationship between these two tasks, semantic stereo solves these problems simultaneously with multitask learning. Previous methods took semantic stereo as two parallel processing tasks, so they did not take full advantages of the additional information from both tasks and only obtained slight improvement. In this work, we designed a multitask learning framework semantic stereo network (S2Net). The proposed network generates cost volumes with feature maps supervised by semantic information to estimate disparity maps and fuses RGB-D feature maps to predict classification maps, therefore gathering multitask learning information. To enhance the performance of trained model, we also considered the continuity of disparity values and the duality of stereo image pairs in data augmentation. When applied in datasets without training, S2Net obtained 2.937% D1-Error in the WHU dataset, lower than 4.297% of the previous best method, depicting the generalization ability improvement from semantic supervision. In terms of semantic segmentation, the introduction of disparity maps increases the mean intersection over union (mIoU) from 61.375% to 69.096% in the US3D datasets.

Then we provided a classification of key published papers, based on the different types of mass movements studied and their location in the world. The spatial comparison of past research and estimated global hazard of the mass movement in agricultural areas highlighted a relevant bias: a strong scientific focus on southern European countries, yet large rural areas are at risk on all continents, many of these unexplored by science. The third section is related to the contribution of remote sensing technologies (e.g., LiDAR and RPAS photogrammetry) in mapping the investigated processes. This study could help to guide future research for better management of such socio-economically relevant agricultural landscapes.",tarolli_slopeinstabilitiessteepcultivation_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Time-Series Analysis Of Landsat-Mss/Tm/Oli Images Over Amazonian Waters Impacted By Gold Mining Activities,"{""Costa, M. P. F."",""Lobo, F. L."",""Novo, E. M. L. M.""}",NA,"Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapajós River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapajós River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapajós aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",lobo_timeseriesanalysislandsat_2015,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Artificial Intelligence Based Methods For Smart And Sustainable Urban Planning: A Systematic Survey,"{""Azmi, R."",""Chenal, J."",""Diop, E. B."",""Koumetio Tekouabou, S.

Building futuristic smart and sustainable cities is proving to be a response to these challenges. Recent publications show that urban planning decision support is increasingly using artificial intelligence through machine learning methods to address these challenges. 172 papers were published in 2020 compared to 8 before 2010 with a forecast of at least 200 papers in 2021. Despite the explosive number of scientific publications on applications artificial intelligence for urban planning decision support, few studies have made a systematic assessment of the state of the art to inform future research. This would help focus on the approaches used, the planning problems most commonly addressed, the data used and even the study areas. We found that the top 5 most addressed urban planning issues include: land use/cover, urban growth, urban buildings, urban mobility and urban environment. Furthermore, a large amount of data was used from sensors and simple or ensemble machine learning methods were more used in this case. Deep learning methods are more used for land use/cover, buildings and climate issues which are mostly based on satellite image data. On the other hand, China and the United States are the most studied territories while Africa is almost not. A high intensity of collaboration between researchers affiliated with Chinese, American and English institutions was observed. Thus, urban planning researchers should benefit from this synthesis work by understanding the general idea of the application of machine learning methods in urban planning, its trends, issues, current challenges and future research directions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE).",koumetiotekouabou_artificialintelligencebasedmethods_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Using Satellite-Based Estimates Of Evapotranspiration And Groundwater Changes To Determine Anthropogenic Water Fluxes In Land Surface Models,"{""Anderson, R. G."",""Famiglietti, J.

Previous studies have addressed this issue via use of irrigation area, applied water inventory data, or soil moisture content. These approaches have a variety of drawbacks including data latency, accurately prescribing irrigation intensity, and a lack of conservation of water volume for models using a prescribed soil moisture approach. In this study, we parameterize irrigation fluxes using satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) compared to ET from a suite of land surface models without irrigation. We then incorporate the irrigation flux into the Community Land Model (CLM) and use a systematic trial-and-error procedure to determine the ground- and surface-water withdrawals that are necessary to balance the new irrigation flux. The resulting CLM simulation with irrigation produces ET that matches the magnitude and seasonality of observed satellite ET well, with a mean difference of 6.3 mm month(-1) and a correlation of 0.95. Differences between the new CLM ET values and satellite-observed ET values are always less than 30 mm month(-1) and the differences show no pattern with respect to seasonality.

Our findings indicate: (1) groundwater flows south to north in the highly fractured basement aquifer related to the brittle deformation associated with the Najd Fault System; (2) massive gabbroic bodies separate the fractured basement aquifer into east and west conduits; (3) the tailings storage facility (TSF) pond and leach pad were constructed over the west conduit; and (4) cyanide-rich wastewater has leaked downward through tears and cuts in the lining of the TSF pond into the fractured aquifer and cyanide contaminants have migrated northward along the west conduit. Evidence for the latter includes: (1) toxic concentrations of cyanide (total: 0.018–9.4 mg/L; free weak-acid dissociable: 0.003–0.7 mg/L) were observed in groundwater samples north of the TSF pond; (2) similarities in electrical conductivity (EC) values and chloride/bromide (Cl−/Br−) ratios between groundwater north of the pond (EC: 88.8 mS/cm; Cl−/Br−: 346 to 363) and those of the TSF pond water (mean EC: 99 mS/cm; Cl−/Br−: 242 to 383) were observed; (3) the geochemical (e.g., sodium [Na+], Cl−) and isotopic compositions (δ18O and δ2H values) of groundwater are consistent with mixing of groundwater upgradient from the SGM with isotopically enriched pond water; and (4) cyanide contamination could not have resulted from an overflow of the TSF pond during flash flood events, given that rainfall is negligible and effective flood control systems are in place.

G."",""Gong, G."",""He, P."",""Li, G."",""Zhang, B."",""Zhang, S.""}",NA,"Understanding the spatial expansion process of salt marshes and quantifying the factors driving this expansion are crucial for the management and restoration of coastal wetlands. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the expansion process of Scirpus mariqueter using drone remote sensing and quantify its relationship with habitat quality. Our hypothesis was that landscape metrics could serve as valuable indicators for prioritizing habitat restoration efforts along the coast. We utilized drone remote sensing and adopted the simple Greenness Index to reflect the growth status of S. mariqueter. Using this index, we computed the standard deviation ellipse and growth center. To evaluate habitat quality, we developed a method based on our previous research and other relevant reports. We then conducted a quantitative analysis of the expansion process of S. mariqueter in areas with varying habitat quality. We found that S. mariqueter’s optimal elevation was 3.7 m, with a range of 2.5 to 4.3 m. The threshold value for soil total nitrogen was 0.3 g/kg, and the tolerance threshold for soil salinity was 2500 ppm. These three factors, elevation, soil total nitrogen, and soil salinity, collectively influenced habitat quality, with weights of 0.68, 0.23, and 0.09, respectively, as determined through geodetector analysis. During the summer, we observed a dominance of dispersal in S. mariqueter, with the species primarily spreading to areas with increased habitat quality. Patch shapes tended to be compact and regular in this season. In contrast, during the autumn, a dominance of decline was observed, with S. mariqueter mainly distributing to areas exhibiting decreased habitat quality. Patch shapes tended to be complex and irregular in the autumn season. Eventually micro-geomorphic modification and patch shape filling methods based on UAV observations are proposed to aid wetland restoration. These findings are of utmost importance for the restoration of coastal wetlands and the enhancement of ecosystem resilience. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",gong_spatialpatternscirpusmariqueter_2023,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Semisupervised Change Detection With Feature-Prediction Alignment,"{""Huang, X."",""Li, J."",""Zhang, X.""}",NA,"Change detection (CD) has received raising attention for its broad application value. However, traditional fully supervised CD methods have a huge demand for pixel-level annotations, which are laborious and even impossible in some few-shot scenarios. Recently, several semisupervised CD (SSCD) methods have been proposed to utilize numerous unlabeled remote sensing image (RSI) pairs, which can largely reduce the annotation dependence. These methods are mainly based on: 1) adversarial learning, whose optimization direction is difficult to control as a black-box method, or 2) feature-consistency learning, which has no explicit physical meaning. To deal with these difficulties, we propose a novel progressive SSCD framework in this article, termed feature-prediction alignment (FPA). FPA can efficiently utilize unlabeled RSI pairs for training by two alignment strategies. First, a class-aware feature alignment (FA) strategy is designed to align the area-level change/no-change feature extracted from different unlabeled RSI pairs (i.e., across regions) with the awareness of their locations, in order to reduce the feature difference within the same classes. Second, a pixelwise prediction alignment (PA) is devised to align the pixel-level change prediction of strongly augmented unlabeled RSI pairs to the pseudo-labels calculated from the corresponding weakly augmented counterparts, in order to reduce the prediction uncertainty of various RSI transformations with physical meaning. Experiments are carried out on four widely used CD benchmarks, including Learning, Vision and Remote Sensing Laboratory (LEVIR-CD), Wuhan University building CD (WHU-CD), CDD, and GZ-CD, and our FPA achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and generalization.

This is particularly notorious in the Paute River watershed in southern Ecuador. We seek to show how, under tenets of the global economy, rural mountain landscapes suffer constant modifications due to the agricultural practices of dwellers and migrants. Erosion of arable slopes takes center stage in analyzing vulnerability due to the high erodibility factor found in this watershed. By using remote sensing and GIS applications, we analyzed the potential erodibility with intersections of rural development constraining of ecosystem services, including the production of water, food, and cultural values in the Paute River watershed. We found six sources of migratory flows and analyzed topographic and elevation effects in potential erodibility indexes of agroecological options to ameliorate the environmental stress. We identified factors associated with migration trends observed in the area and assessed vulnerability issues of resource management that could prevent deforestation, soil erosion, and acculturation amidst the pressures of development in the region. We conclude that sustainable development options can be implemented with a watershed management approach oriented to diminish emigration.

Spatial Features Of Urban Vitality And The Impact Of Built Environment On Them Based On Multi-Source Data: A Case Study Of Shenzhen,"{""Li, S."",""Peng, Z."",""Wang, H."",""Wang, N."",""Wu, J.""}",NA,"As a key index to evaluate whether a city is attractive or has a healthy, comprehensive, and sustainable development potential, urban vitality is critical to the future development and construction of a city. Exploring the mechanism of how the built environment influences urban vitality from the perspective of urban morphology can be conducive to future urban space planning and design and can provide city planners with quantitative and scientific decision-making support. This study uses urban POI, cellular signaling, and nighttime light remote sensing data from Shenzhen to measure its cultural, social, and economic vitality, which constitutes a comprehensive vitality assessment of the city. Spatial features of these urban vitalities were then analyzed to further illustrate their distribution patterns. Using Bivariate Moran's I method, the spatial autocorrelations between economic, social, and cultural vitality were calculated. From the five dimensions of Density, Design, Diversity, Distance to Transit, and Destination Accessibility, the 5D detection index system was constructed to measure the urban built environment. This study also used GeoDetector to detect and analyze the spatial differentiation between various built environmental factors and comprehensive, economic, social, and cultural vitality and to explore the mechanism of the influence of the built environment on urban vitality. The results show that: 1) The spatial distribution of comprehensive vitality is extremely uneven in Shenzhen, with a higher vitality in the southern and western regions of Shenzhen city and a lower vitality in the northern and eastern regions. Areas with higher comprehensive vitality usually developed along the main roads and metro lines and are distributed in strips along the coastline of central-southern and western Shenzhen. The high-value areas of the urban comprehensive vitality center are primarily concentrated in city- or district-level commercial centers, and employment centers. Comprehensive vitality in Shenzhen reflects social vitality. 2) Urban comprehensive, economic, social, and cultural vitality are significantly affected by the built environment, as indicated by the 5D system. High POI and building density, average building floors, and land use entropy, have significant positive impacts on urban vitality. However, residential population density did not have a significant impact on each aspect of urban vitality. 3) Some interactions between built environment factors had a greater impact on urban comprehensive vitality, such as residential population density, road network density, land use entropy, and road network density. Overall, the interaction between building density, average building floors, land use entropy, and other factors, have a more positive impact on each aspect of urban vitality. 4) The presentation of urban comprehensive vitality is the result of multiple dimensions and factors. In the influencing mechanism of urban comprehensive vitality, building density and average building floors were the fundamental factors. POI density and land use entropy were the direct driving factors. Residential population density was an inducing factor. Distance from the administrative center, intersection density, road network density, metro station density, and bus station density were adjustive factors.

Nitrogen Measurement For Variable-Rate N Management In Maize,"{""Doerge, TA""}",NA,"Numerous proximal and remote soil and plant-testing methods are available to guide variable-rate N management in maize production. These include preseason and late spring soil nitrate tests, late season stalk nitrate tests, handheld chlorophyll meter readings, remote sensing of soil and crop canopy properties, site-specific data from yield monitors and soil electrical conductivity maps. Field applicators have even been equipped to sense the N status of a crop and direct the application of any needed N on-the-go. However, the adoption rates of variable-rate N management are low worldwide despite the potential economic and environmental benefits of this practice and the availability of variable-rate application technology in key areas of maize production. A major obstacle is the finding that recommended N fertilizer rates based on yield goal are often poorly correlated with actual economically optimum N rates. Nitrogen response patterns are often field and season specific and can vary widely within the same field, further complicating adoption. Paired field comparisons of uniform- and variable-rate N management have revealed no consistent advantages for either strategy in yields achieved, whole-field N usage or N use efficiency by plants. Research with other agronomic crops also indicates that the scale for determining crop N need may be as low as 1 m(2). An additional constraint is that growers implementing variable-rate N techniques often are required to install several adequately fertilized N reference strips in their fields that have proven to be both hybrid and season specific. In addition to these agronomic and logistical challenges, the maximum potential benefit of a variable N strategy vs. a conventional uniform-rate N strategy is typically between 12 and 37 USD(\$)/ha. When the cost of developing and executing the variable-rate strategy is considered, the practice shows a low economic return. In the future, innovations in N soil testing, better crop simulation models, and improved N sensing and application equipment may assist growers in capturing the benefits of site-specific N management in maize production.",doerge_nitrogenmeasurementvariablerate_2005,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Testing Early Warning Metrics For Drought-Induced Tree Physiological Stress And Mortality,"{""Anderegg, Leander D. L."",""Anderegg, William R.

Advances in mechanistic understanding and prediction are greatly limited by an inability to detect in situ where trees are likely to die in order to take timely measurements and actions. Thus, algorithms of early warning and detection of drought-induced tree stress and mortality could have major scientific and societal benefits. Here, we leverage two consecutive droughts in the southwestern United States to develop and test a set of early warning metrics. Using Landsat satellite data, we constructed early warning metrics from the first drought event. We then tested these metrics' ability to predict spatial patterns in tree physiological stress and mortality from the second drought. To test the broader applicability of these metrics, we also examined a separate drought in the Amazon rainforest. The early warning metrics successfully explained subsequent tree mortality in the second drought in the southwestern US, as well as mortality in the independent drought in tropical forests. The metrics also strongly correlated with spatial patterns in tree hydraulic stress underlying mortality, which provides a strong link between tree physiological stress and remote sensing during the severe drought and indicates that the loss of hydraulic function during drought likely mediated subsequent mortality. Thus, early warning metrics provide a critical foundation for elucidating the physiological mechanisms underpinning tree mortality in mature forests and guiding management responses to these climate-induced disturbances.",anderegg_testingwarningmetricsdrought_2019,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

It also discusses the existing problems in the development of frontier technology for agricultural informatization in China and proposes corresponding countermeasures. Firstly, the paper introduces the frontier techniques for agricultural informatization. For advanced agricultural sensor technology, three types of techniques are described, namely life information sensing technique, environmental information sensing technique, and comprehensive information collecting technique. For precision farming technology and intelligent equipment, onboard farmland information collection technique, precision farming positioning and controlling technique, decision model and prescription generating technique, and precise implementation technique are described. For agricultural intelligent robot technology, terrestrial mobile platform navigation and control technique and action planning technique are introduced. For agricultural internet of things technology and equipment, several issues are discussed including the sophisticated monitoring and scheduling of resources, ecological environment monitoring and management, agricultural product quality safety traceability, etc. For agricultural information service technology, frontier techniques and applications for agricultural remote sensing and agricultural information resource value-added services are evaluated. Major problems existed in the development of agricultural informatization technology in China are also discussed. For agricultural sensor technology, the existing problems include that the agricultural information dynamic sensing technique needs to be improved, advanced agricultural sensor technique and industry development are not perfect, and agricultural sensor after-sales supports arenot sufficient. For precision farming technology and intelligent equipment, China has not had its 3S technical support system that is suitable for agricultural applications and its intelligent equipment research and development is not sufficient. For agricultural robot technology, the research direction selection is very subjective, and the research content mainly focuses on the planting industry. Leading robot research agencies rarely involve the agriculture domain. For the industrialization of agricultural robot, related domestic patents are not sufficient and foreign companies take a large market share. For agricultural internet of things technology and equipment, there are also some problems in the technology standard, security, industrialization, application and promotion. For agricultural information services, agricultural remote sensor practicality needs to be improved, software development capability is not sufficient, and the service targets are not well trained. Finally, suggestions are proposed as countermeasures to the existing problems. Agricultural information technology innovation needs to be accelerated. Major engineering projects need to be established to support the informatization development. Subsidies for agricultural informatization need to be implemented. Agricultural informatization standards and evaluation system need to be improved. Researches show that agricultural sensor technology is the basis of agricultural information acquisition and informatization.

Much of this increase came from fields that were previously protected under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a Federal land retirement incentive. This Geographic Information Systems (GIS) study quantifies these land changes in Minnesota, a northern state in the U.S. Corn Belt, prior to the past decade using 1997 and 2008 CRP GIS data layers for individual fields. Currently available CRP enrollment data by county masks significant changes occurring on a field-level scale, data which is no longer publicly available. Results suggest that marginal lands better suited for riparian wildlife habitat and surface water protection were plowed under in favor of industrial corn production. This was especially notable with fields in close proximity to refineries or those in drinking water supply management or groundwater contamination susceptibility areas. Federal ethanol mandates, farm bill policies, and high corn prices contribute to the pressure to farm these sensitive lands. Currently, CRP enrollments are capped at 9.7 million hectares, reduced from a long-standing 13-million-hectare cap by the 2014 farm bill. Discussions are now underway in the U.S. Congress to craft the 2018 farm bill and farming and conservation interests are strongly urging the Federal government to restore the 13-million-hectare enrollment cap.

Total forest cover of Nam Dong remained stable, but there were major transitions within forest and non-forest categories. Recent policy initiatives, particularly forest land allocation, have resulted in short-term benefit maximization through land speculation and illegal logging, while increased awareness of the economic potential of forests and their products have motivated people to access forests more frequently, leading to a highly dynamic landscape and increased barriers to forest conservation. This study suggests that (1) state-sponsored logging needs to be reduced, (2) forest allocation should proceed more rapidly to give farmers better incentive to improve and protect allocated forests, and (3) small-scale industry should increase.

Monitoring Of Wetland Inundation Dynamics In The Delmarva Peninsula Using Landsat Time-Series Imagery From 1985 To 2011,"{""Huang, C."",""Jin, H."",""Lang, M. W."",""Stehman, S. V."",""Yeo, I. Y.""}",NA,"Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, the provision of which is largely controlled by fluctuations in inundation and soil saturation. Inundation is highly dynamic and can vary substantially through time in response to multiple drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration. This research focused on developing a practical and effective framework for regional, long-term monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics using airborne LiDAR intensity data (Lang et al., 2013) and Landsat time-series imagery. Subpixel water fraction (SWF) maps indicating the percent of surface water within each 30-m pixel were generated on an annual basis over the entire Delmarva Peninsula on the East Coast of the United States from 1985 to 2011. Comprehensive accuracy assessments of the SWF maps were conducted using historical high-resolution aerial photography to determine the reference condition. The assessment resulted in an estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.78% for the sample of open water areas (mean SWF was ~ 40% for this region of the map). Moreover, a separate accuracy assessment targeting inundation in wetlands (i.e. presence or absence of water) yielded an overall accuracy of 93%. Accuracies derived indicated that Landsat data can be calibrated to accurately extract long-term water information at the regional scale. Characteristics of inundation were examined with respect to different wetland types defined by water regime and dominant vegetation types, as well as different physical drivers. Results showed that tidal wetlands typically exhibited more intensive inundation than nontidal wetlands, and a higher degree of inundation was associated with emergent wetlands compared to wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation. Analysis of change drivers revealed that tide exerted a statistically significant influence on coastal inundation with r2 values of 32–36% and p < 0.01, whereas inundation changes in inland wetland areas were in part driven by precipitation with r2 values of 25–34% and p < 0.08. Because an up-to-date archive of Landsat imagery is globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable, the developed framework can be easily implemented to generate a continuous inundation record in many regions of the globe to assist in ongoing and future studies focused on wetland hydrology and wetland management. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",jin_monitoringwetlandinundationdynamics_2017,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
"Estimating Aboveground Biomass Using Sentinel-2 Msi Data And Ensemble Algorithms For Grassland In The Shengjin Lake Wetland, China","{""Li, Chunhua"",""Xu, Wenbin"",""Zhou, Lizhi""}",NA,"Wetland vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) directly indicates wetland ecosystem health and is critical for water purification, carbon cycle, and biodiversity conservation. Accurate AGB estimation is essential for the monitoring and supervision of ecosystems, especially in seasonal floodplain wetlands. This paper explored the capability of spectral and texture features from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for modeling grassland AGB using random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in Shengjin Lake wetland (a Ramsar site). We use five-fold cross-validation to verify the model effectiveness. The results indicated that the RF and XGBoost models had a robust and efficient performance (with root mean square error (RMSE) of 126.571 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.844 for RF, RMSE of 112.425 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.869 for XGBoost), and the XGBoost models, by contrast, performed better. Both traditional and red-edge vegetation indices (VIs) obtained satisfactory results of AGB estimation (RMSE = 127.936 g center dot m(-2), RMSE = 125.879 g center dot m(-2) in XGBoost models, respectively), with the red-edge VIs contributed more to the AGB models. Moreover, we selected eight gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures calculated by four processing window sizes using the mean value of four offsets, and further analyzed the results of three analysis sets. Textures derived from traditional and red-edge bands using a 7 x 7 window size performed better in biomass estimation.

The introduction of textures moderately improved the accuracy of modeling AGB, whereas the use of textures alo ne was not satisfactory.

Annual Change Analysis Of Mangrove Forests In China During 1986-2021 Based On Google Earth Engine,"{""Cao, Jingjing"",""Liu, Kai"",""Peng, Liheng"",""Wang, Ziyu"",""Wen, Xin""}",NA,"Mangroves are a key type of protected coastal wetland, with a range of benefits such as protection from wave damage, sand fixation, water purification and ecological tourism. As the academic knowledge of mangroves has gradually increased, the use of remote sensing to monitor their dynamic changes in China has become a hot topic of discussion and has received attention in academic circles. Remote sensing has also provided necessary auxiliary decision-making suggestions and data support for the scientific and rational conservation, restoration and management of mangrove resources. In this paper, we used Landsat satellite series data combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and adaptive threshold partitioning (OTSU method) to monitor mangrove dynamics in coastal China from 1986 to 2021 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE), with three main results. (1) Based on the massive data and efficient computational capability of the GEE platform, we achieved large-scale interannual mangrove distribution extraction. The overall classification accuracy for 2019 exceeded 0.93, and the mangrove distribution extraction effect was good. (2) The total mangrove area and the mean patch size in China showed overall increasing trends, and Guangdong and Guangxi were the top two provinces in China in terms of the largest mangrove area. (3) Except for Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve, the mangrove areas in other national mangrove reserves mainly showed increasing trends, confirming the effectiveness of the reserves. Data on the spatial structure and area trends of mangroves in China can provide scientific references for mangrove conservation and development, and serve in the further restoration of mangrove ecosystems.",wang_annualchangeanalysismangrove_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
How Federal Health-Care Policies Interface With Urban And Rural Areas: A Comparison Of Three Systems,"{""Baracskay, D.""}",NA,"Global public health policies span national borders and affect multitudes of people. The spread of infectious disease has neither political nor economic boundaries, and when elevated to a status of pandemic proportions, immediate action is required. In federal systems of government, the national level leads the policy formation and implementation process, but also collaborates with supranational organisations as part of the global health network. Likewise, the national level of government cooperates with sub-national governments located in both urban and rural areas. Rural areas, particularly in less developed countries, tend to have higher poverty rates and lack the benefits of proper medical facilities, communication modes and technology to prevent the spread of disease. From the perspective of epidemiological surveillance and intervention, this article will examine federal health policies in three federal systems: Australia, Malaysia and the USA. Using the theoretical foundations of collaborative federalism, this article specifically examines how collaborative arrangements and interactions among governmental and non-governmental actors help to address the inherent discrepancies that exist between policy implementation and reactions to outbreaks in urban and rural areas. This is considered in the context of the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, which spread significantly across the globe in 2009 and is now in what has been termed the 'post-pandemic era'. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",baracskay_federalhealthcarepolicies_2012,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Reclamation of the mangroves in this region ceased in the 1930s. However, they are still subject to adverse environmental influences, such as sediment starvation due to migration of the main river channels in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta over the last few centuries, cyclone landfall, wave action from the Bay of Bengal-changing hydrology due to upstream water diversion-and the pervasive effects of relative sea-level rise. This study builds on earlier work to assess changes from 2000 to 2020 in mangrove extent, genus composition, and mangrove 'health' indicators, using various vegetation indices derived from Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery by performing maximum likelihood supervised classification. We show that about 110 km(2) of mangroves disappeared within the reserve forest due to erosion, and 81 km(2) were gained within the inhabited part of Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) through plantation and regeneration. The gains are all outside the contiguous mangroves. However, they partially compensate for the losses of the contiguous mangroves in terms of carbon. Genus composition, analyzed by amalgamating data from published literature and ground-truthing surveys, shows change towards more salt-tolerant genus accompanied by a reduction in the prevalence of freshwater-loving Heiritiera, Nypa, and Sonneratia assemblages. Health indicators, such as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), show a monotonic trend of deterioration over the last two decades, which is more pronounced in the sea-facing parts of the mangrove forests. An increase in salinity, a temperature rise, and rainfall reduction in the pre-monsoon and the post-monsoon periods appear to have led to such degradation. Collectively, these results show a decline in mangrove area and health, which poses an existential threat to the Indian Sundarbans in the long term, especially under scenarios of climate change and sea-level rise. Given its unique values, the policy process should acknowledge and address these threats.",samanta_assessmentattributionmangroveforest_2021,FALSE,sample_1000,NA

Reducing unnecessary medication regimen complexity (eg, by consolidating the number of administration times or using alternative formulations) may benefit residents and staff. Objective: To develop and validate an implicit tool to facilitate medication regimen simplification in aged care facilities. Method: A purposively selected multidisciplinary expert panel used modified nominal group technique to identify and prioritize factors important in determining whether a medication regimen can be simplified. The five prioritized factors were formulated as questions, pilottested using non-identifiable medication charts and refined by panel members. The final tool was validated by two clinical pharmacists who independently applied the tool to a random sample of 50 residents of aged care facilities to identify opportunities for medication regimen simplification. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohen’s kappa. Results: The Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE (MRS GRACE) was developed as an implicit tool comprising of five questions about 1) the resident; 2) regulatory and safety requirements; 3) drug interactions; 4) formulation; and 5) facility and follow-up considerations. Using MRS GRACE, two pharmacists independently simplified medication regimens for 29/50 and 30/50 residents (Cohen’s kappa=0.38, 95% CI 0.12–0.64), respectively. Simplification was possible for all residents with five or more administration times. Changing an administration time comprised 75% of the two pharmacists’ recommendations. Conclusions: Using MRS GRACE, two clinical pharmacists independently simplified over half of residents’ medication regimens with fair agreement.

Vocational Education And Training: The Terra Incognita Of Innovation Policy,"{""Dalitz, Robert"",""Toner, Phillip""}",NA,"Is what is known from research on systemic innovation reflected in innovation policy, both as guiding principles and as actions? This paper highlights a major paradox in the translation of research on innovation into innovation policy in Australia. The innovation studies literature has established the central role of the vocational education and training (VET) system and VET-trained workers in technology generation, diffusion and incremental innovation. Research has also established that the pattern of innovation in Australia, compared with that in many other OECD countries, makes firms more reliant on VET skills to implement innovation. Despite this recognition in the innovation literature, this paper argues that the VET system is largely excluded from government innovation policy and programmes in Australia. Evidence for this exclusion is derived from a textual analysis of the principal Australian government policy statements and government-sponsored studies of the Australian innovation system, and from an analysis of the interest groups represented on government innovation advisory and policy structures. Tentative explanations are advanced for this exclusion and a number of important benefits are identified for the VET system and the wider innovation system arising from closer integration of VET into innovation policy",toner_vocationaleducationtrainingterra_2012,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
Investigation Of Satellite Precipitation Product Driven Rainfall-Runoff Model Using Deep Learning Approaches In Two Different Catchments Of India,"{""Agarwal, A."",""Bhattacharya, B."",""Neelamsetty, S. S."",""Rathinasamy, M."",""Yeditha, P. K.""}",NA,"Rainfall-runoff models are valuable tools for flood forecasting, management of water resources, and drought warning. With the advancement in space technology, a plethora of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) are available publicly. However, the application of the satellite data for the data-driven rainfall-runoff model is emerging and requires careful investigation. In this work, two satellite rainfall data sets, namely Global Precipitation Measurement-Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrieval Product V6 (GPM-IMERG) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), are evaluated for the development of rainfall-runoff models and the prediction of 1-day ahead streamflow. The accuracy of the data from the SPPs is compared to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)-gridded precipitation data set. Detection metrics showed that for light rainfall (1-10 mm), the probability of detection (POD) value ranges between 0.67 and 0.75 and with an increasing rainfall range, i.e., medium and heavy rainfall (10-50 mm and.50 mm), the POD values ranged from 0.24 to 0.45. These results indicate that the satellite precipitation performs satisfactorily with reference to the IMD-gridded data set. Using the daily precipitation data of nearly two decades (2000-2018) over two river basins in India's eastern part, artificial neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), and long short-time memory (LSTM) models are developed for rainfall-runoff modelling. One-day ahead runoff prediction using the developed rainfall-runoff modelling confirmed that both the SPPs are sufficient to drive the rainfall-runoff models with a reasonable accuracy estimated using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient, correlation coefficient, and the root-mean-squared error. In particular, the 1-day streamflow forecasts for the Vamsadhara river basin (VRB) using LSTM with GPM-IMERG inputs resulted in Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSC) values of 0.68 and 0.67, while ELM models for Mahanadhi river basin (MRB) with the same input resulted in NSC values of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, during training and validation stages. At the same time, the LSTM model with CHIRPS inputs for the VRB resulted in NSC values of 0.68 and 0.65, and the ELM model with CHIRPS inputs for the MRB resulted in NSC values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively, in training and validation stages. These results indicated that both the SPPs could reliably be used with LSTM and ELM models for rainfall-runoff modelling and streamflow prediction. This paper highlights that deep learning models, such as ELM and LSTM, with the GPM-IMERG products can lead to a new horizon to provide flood forecasting in flood-prone catchments. © 2022 The Authors",yeditha_investigationsatelliteprecipitationproduct_2022,FALSE,sample_1000,NA
"A Preliminary Study Of The Strata And Age Of Ancient Agricultural Terraces In The Ganjia Basin, Northeastern Tibetan Plateau","{""Chen, F."",""Chen, X."",""Wu, D."",""Yuan, Z."",""Zhang, C.""}",NA,"Agricultural terraces are a manifestation of man's ability to transform nature during the past thousands of years, and they have played an important role in the development of human society. The Ganjia Basin in Xiahe County, Gansu Province, is located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. A large area of banded landscape is distributed on the hills and piedmonts in the Ganjia Basin, which is claimed to be composed of large-scale abandoned ancient terraces. Based on fieldwork, satellite remote sensing data and GIS analysis in the present study, we found that the ancient terraces cover an area of 42.2 km2 and are mainly distributed on slopes between 2936 and 3326 m a.m.s.l. (meters above mean sea level) on both sides of the Yangqu River and its tributaries in the basin. Additionally, we analyzed various environmental proxies, including magnetic susceptibility (MS), grain size, the contents of total organic carbon (nitrogen) (TOC, TN), and palynological assemblages, from three representative sections of ancient agricultural terraces (GJAT-1, GJAT-1, and GJAT-3), and compared them with the MS values and clay content of a natural profile with accurate chronological control in the Ganjia Basin. The results indicate that the terraces are reclaimed paleosols dating to the Late Holocene (3000 kyr BP), and that the homogeneous MS values of the top 25-35 cm of the terrace profiles differ from those of the natural soil section, which confirms the existence of a cultivation layer in the terraces. However, the increases in the contents of TOC and TN above the cultivated layer, and the fact that the trend of MS in the terrace profile is broadly in line with the natural profile, indicate that the terraces were only used for a short interval and have been abandoned for a relatively long time. Combined with historical documentary evidence, we infer that the ancient Xiahe agricultural terraces were constructed as a result of the ""Gongjianshou (bowman) militia farming"" policy during the Northern Song China (1074-1125 CE). Climate reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere and northern China demonstrate that the temperature was higher and that the precipitation increased during this interval, providing a favorable environment for agricultural production. Overall, our results provide a typical example of societal adaptation to climate change in the past. © 2022, Science Press.

In this paper, the prescription map was discussed based on the improved nitrogen fertilizer optimization algorithm (NFOA), using satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, and supplemented by meteorological data. Based on the principles of NFOA, firstly, remote sensing data and meteorological data were collected from 2019 to 2021 to construct a prediction model for the potential yield of rice based on the in-season estimated yield index (INSEY). Secondly, based on remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) and spectral features of bands, the grain nitrogen content (GNC) prediction model constructed using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to improve the values of GNC taken in the NFOA. The nitrogen demand for rice was calculated according to the improved NFOA. Finally, the nitrogen fertilizer application recommended prescription map of rice in large-scale cropland was generated based on UAV multispectral images, and the economic cost-effectiveness of the prescription map was analyzed.

In this study, three factors including structure and function of ecosystem, ecological stress from social activities and response of human, were given priority consideration in the process of constructing a comprehensive index system of biodiversity assessment combining with previous research and pressure-state-response (PSR) framework model. Also, all indicators were processed by using weighted processing and normalization method and the comprehensive evaluation method of regional biodiversity were constructed based on remote sensing and GIS technology. Finally, the habitat quality status were assessed on the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance in 2011 and 2019. The results show that:(1) The population emigration generally occupy the dominant position in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance from 2011 to 2019, but road net density has increased significantly. The human interference index and the fragmentation degree of ecological space increases accordingly. (2) The comprehensive index of biological diversity assessment (BDI) in all ecological function zones generally were maintained at above 0.4, and ecological environment quality status were in mid and good grade in 2011 and 2019. (3) The average BDI value of ecological function zones increased from 0.582 to 0.606, and the proportion of ecological function zones in the mid and good grade increased from 61.5% to 76.9% from 2011 to 2019. (4) The BDI value of two ecological function zones has decreased, occupied 15.4% from 2011 to 2019. In the last ten years, the habit qualities in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance generally presents a trend toward better change. But controlling density of population, road network construction and ecological space fragmentation, and the construction of protection pattern based on the new territorial space planning, still are the key issues of biological diversity protection within a certain period. But population density, is critical pressures to biodiversity protection during future period of time, and increasing the area of nature reserve and strictly controlling is an effective pathway to relieve the stress.

This index is a function of the ratios between pollutant concentration values and their standards; it aims at identifying all situations in which there is a possible environmental risk even when several pollutants are below their limit values but air quality is reduced. AQBI is evaluated by using a high-resolution three-dimensional dispersion model: the air concentration for each substance is computed starting from detailed emissions sources: point, line and area emissions hourly modulated. This model is driven with accurate meteorological data from ground stations and remote sensing systems providing vertical profiles of temperature and wind; these data are integrated with wind and temperature profiles at higher altitudes obtained by a Local Area Model. The outputs of the dispersion model are compared with pollutant concentrations provided by measuring stations, in order to recalibrate emission data. A three-dimensional high resolution grid of AQBI data is evaluated for an industrial area close to Alessandria (Northern Italy), assessing air quality and environmental conditions. Performance of AQBI is compared with the Air Quality Index (AQI) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. AQBI, computed taking into account all pollutants, is able to point out situations not evidenced by AQI, based on a preset limited number of substances; therefore, AQBI is a good tool for evaluating the air quality either in urban and in industrial areas.

Al Ain is the fastest changing city in the Arabian Peninsula. It has gone from a desert oasis to a thriving modern city in just over 30 years. Maps, colour aerial photographs, satellite imagery, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used as an aid for understanding the development of the city. Change and development in the city is evident from comparison of old maps, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery taken during 1976, 1978, 1984, 1994, 1998 and 2000. The city was found to have a tendency for major expansion in the direction of the west and south-west. Expansion in any direction was found to be governed by the availability of utilities (water, electricity), economic activities along roads (agriculture, industry), geographical constraints (valleys, sand dunes, mountains), and legal factors (boundary with Sultanate of Oman, planning and institutional rules). Many cities around the world are developed at the cost of agricultural areas, which are the main source of food. For example, in Tempe, Arizona between 1970 and 1979 and in Cairo. However, in Al Ain the research concludes that the development is based on conservation of agricultural areas (oases) and reclamation of the desert.

Results Of the 29, 15 (51.7%) reported a reduction in the number of nuclear medicine studies performed due to the shortage of supply, although the reduction was small. The decrease per month was less than 20 studies in 73% of the institutions. Of the nuclear medicine studies that involve the use of mTc, the studies whose reduction in number most seriously affected patient management were, in decreasing order: mTc-MAA lung perfusion scans, mTc-MAG3, mTc-DTPA, or mTc-DMSA renoscans, mTc-MDP bone scans, mTc-HMPAO or ECD brain SPECT studies, mTc-MIBI or tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT studies, mTc-radiocolloid sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, mTc-HSA-D or pyrophosphate bleeding scans, mTc-GSA hepatic function reserve scans, and mTc-MIBI parathyroid scans.

A Conceptual Framework For Assessing The Benefits Of A Global Earth Observation System Of Systems,"Fritz, Steffen",2008,"The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-ofSystems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Specifically, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and specifically, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the benefits of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal benefit areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a “benefit chain” concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the benefits, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and benefit curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.",fritz_conceptualframeworkassessingbenefits_2008,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"benefit chain concept - causal pathway from incremental improvements in the observing system (cost = investment cost for marginal increase in eo effort) to better management and outcomes (benefit = marginal increase in societal benefits given a marginal increase in effort) - marginal cost-benefit ratio, i.e., shape of a logistic benefit-cost curve, max incremental benefit:cost is where the slope is steepest"
A Cost-Benefit Analysis Of The National Map,"Halsing, David",2004,"The Geography Discipline of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted this cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of The National Map.

This CBA is a supporting document to accompany the Exhibit 300 Capital Asset Plan and Business Case of The National Map Reengineering Program. \nThe framework for estimating the benefits is based on expected improvements in processing information to perform any of the possible applications of spatial data. This analysis does not attempt to determine the benefits and costs of performing geospatial-data applications. Rather, it estimates the change in the differences between those benefits and costs with The National Map and the current situation without it. The estimates of total costs and benefits of The National Map were based on the projected implementation time, development and maintenance costs, rates of data inclusion and integration, expected usage levels over time, and a benefits estimation model. \nThe National Map provides data that are current, integrated, consistent, complete, and more accessible in order to decrease the cost of implementing spatial-data applications and (or) improve the outcome of those applications. The efficiency gains in per-application improvements are greater than the cost to develop and maintain The National Map, meaning that the program would bring a positive net benefit to the Nation.

A Decision Support System For Forest Fire Management,"Kaloudis, S.T.",2005,"Forest fires are considered natural phenomena but the magnitude of the problem can be attributed to poor forest management and to the extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, the abolishment of traditional activities related to forests has sent away people from the forests that they used to protect them. The aforementioned reasons result in the annual destruction of large forest areas, agricultural cultivations, industries, animals and even human lives. At the same time, catastrophic floods entail the gradual desolation of the affected areas and large amounts of carbon dioxide along with smoke particles aggravate air quality. In the present paper, a Decision Support System is proposed capable to support policy makers and services to counteract wildfires destruction danger in lowland Pine forests. The system is composed of two major components: (a) A Wildfire Destruction Danger Index useful for preventive and suppressive measures planning and decision policy making and (b) a Forest Management Planning Decision Support System useful for fire risk reduction through forest management plan. The open architecture of the system allows incorporation of data coming from external sources e.g. satellite systems, meteorological stations etc. All its subsystems can stand alone so as to satisfy the needs of responsible organisations (peripheral institutions of fire brigade, forest inspection and local authorities).

A Design For A Data And Information Service To Address The Knowledge Needs Of The Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus And Strategies To Facilitate Its Implementation,"Lawford, Richard",2019,"Food security is essential to sustain human societies. Food production flourishes when water, energy, and land are abundant, but more often it is limited by scarcities in one or more of these resources. In particular, food production is limited by the relatively fixed amount of water that circulates in the hydrosphere, the lack of new land for crops in many countries, and the depletion of critical minerals and fossil fuels in many source regions. An integrated Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus planning and management approach promises improved resource efficiencies, new business opportunities, more coherent resource and environmental policies, and economies of scale for the data and information services underpinning better decision-making. This paper distills discussions on data and information from four regional workshops held as part of a Future Earth W-E-F Nexus Cluster project. The workshops reviewed ways to enhance the sustainability of the W-E-F Nexus through better governance; collecting, analyzing, and communicating data and information; and integrating both with management for better planning and decision-making. The focus of this paper is to explore the potential application of an integrated data and information system to enhance water, energy, and food sustainability. In particular, this paper's objective is to explore how a multisector W-E-F Nexus data and information system could be developed and operated to meet the planning and decision-making information needs of practitioners and to facilitate the implementation of the W-E-F Nexus concept. This “Hypothesis and Theory” paper provides a hypothesis and system design and proposes steps that could be taken to implement and test the system in a W-E-F Nexus environment. Data and information, along with modern technologies, can play a central role in facilitating paradigm shifts that reinforce the W-E-F Nexus by explicitly assessing environmental services, meeting the growing urban food demand, valuing water and other resources used to produce food and energy for export, promoting resource use efficiency through integrated planning and management, and strengthening links between the W-E-F Nexus and appropriate Sustainable Development Goals.",lawford_designdatainformationservice_2019,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
"A New Process For Organizing Assessments Of Social, Economic, And Environmental Outcomes: Case Study Of Wildland Fire Management In The Usa","Bruins, Randall",2009,"Ecological risk assessments typically are organized using the processes of planning (a discussion among managers, stakeholders, and analysts to clarify ecosystem management goals and assessment scope) and problem formulation (evaluation of existing information to generate hypotheses about adverse ecological effects, select assessment endpoints, and develop an analysis plan). These processes require modification to be applicable for integrated assessments that evaluate ecosystem management alternatives in terms of their ecological, economic, and social consequences. We present 8 questions that define the steps of a new process we term integrated problem formulation (IPF), and we illustrate the use of IPF through a retrospective case study comparing 2 recent phases of development of the Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system, a planning and budgeting system for the management of wildland fire throughout publicly managed lands in the United States. IPF extends traditional planning and problem formulation by including the explicit comparison of management alternatives, the valuation of ecological, economic and social endpoints, and the combination or integration of those endpoints. The phase 1, limited prototype FPA system used a set of assessment endpoints of common form (i.e., probabilities of given flame heights over acres of selected land-resource types), which were specified and assigned relative weights at the local level in relation to a uniform national standard. This approach was chosen to permit system-wide optimization of fire management budget allocations according to a cost-effectiveness criterion. Before full development, however, the agencies abandoned this approach in favor of a phase 2 system that examined locally specified (rather than system-optimized) allocation alternatives and was more permissive as to endpoint form. We demonstrate how the IPF process illuminates the nature, rationale, and consequences of these differences, and argue that its early use for the FPA system may have enabled a smoother development path.",bruins_processorganizingassessmentssocial_2009,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,this is more about an improved decisionmaking process rather than anything about the esi that goes into the decisionmaking
A Scalable Earth Observations-Based Decision Support System For Hydropower Planning In Africa,"Koppa, Akash",2021,"Hydropower is a key part of the increasing shift in power production from nonrenewables to renewable energy. In regions such as Africa, hydropower reservoirs are vital for achieving several sustainable development goals, including clean water, energy, and poverty elimination. However, the operations of hydropower reservoirs are often suboptimal due to the lack of hydrologic data for generating reliable inflow forecasts. Here, we present a decision support system (DSS) framework for hydropower planning at daily to seasonal time scales by combining data from earth observation satellites (EOS) with ensemble climate forecasts from dynamical models and hydrologic modeling. The large uncertainty inherent in satellite-based datasets is overcome by using a data validation framework which does not require ground-based measurements. In addition, an EOS evapotranspiration product is used as a proxy for streamflow in calibrating hydrologic models. Compared to a DSS forced with a climatological forecast (zero-skill), the hydropower production with the new DSS increased by 20%.

A Transformative Concept: From Data Being Passive Objects To Data Being Active Subjects,"Plag, Hans-Peter",2019,"The exploitation of potential societal benefits of Earth observations is hampered by users having to engage in often tedious processes to discover data and extract information and knowledge.

This transition would greatly increase data usage and exploitation, and support the extraction of knowledge from data products. Enabling the data subjects to actively reach out to potential users would revolutionize data dissemination and sharing and facilitate collaboration in user communities. The three core elements of the transformative DAS concept are: (1) “intelligent semantic data agents” (ISDAs) that have the capabilities to communicate with their human and digital environment.

A User-Driven Approach To Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities For Societal Benefit,"Zell, Erica",2012,"In order to help data providers make informed decisions regarding the availability and accessibility of Earth observations for societal benefit, a cross-sectoral meta-analysis of observation priorities was conducted from the perspective of users. The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observations’ (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Users’ needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs. The 10 highest ranked observations are: (1) Precipitation, (2) Soil Moisture, (3) Surface Air Temperature, (4) Land Cover, (5) Surface Wind Speed (6) Vegetation Cover, (7) Surface Humidity, (8) Urbanization, (9) Vegetation Type, and (10) Surface Wind Direction and Sea Surface Temperature (tie).

"A Performance, Semantic And Service Qualityenhanced Distributed Search Engine For Improving Geospatial Resource Discovery","Gui, Zhipeng",2013,"Geospatial resource discovery is a critical step for developing geographic science applications. With the increasing number of geospatial resources available online, many Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) components (e.g. catalogues and portals) have been developed to help manage and discover geospatial resources.

In this article, we report a search engine framework for efficient geospatial resource discovery, which reduces integration costs by leveraging existing Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) components. Specifically, (1) the framework provides integration capability and flexibility by adopting the brokering approach, implementing a ‘plug-in’-based framework for metadata processing and proposing a dynamically configurable search workflow; (2) the asynchronous messaging and batch processing-based metadata record retrieval mode enhances the search performance and user interactivity; (3) an embedded semantic support system improves the discovery recall level and precision by providing semantic-based search rule creation and result similarity evaluation functions and (4) the engine assists user decision-making by integrating a service quality monitoring and evaluation system, data/service visualization tools, multiple views and additional information.

"A Political History Of U.s. Commercial Remote Sensing, 1984-2007: Conflict, Collaboration, And The Role Of Knowledge In The High-Tech World Of Earth Observation Satellites","Kenneth, Thompson",2007,"The political history of U.S. commercial remote sensing began in 1984 when the U.S. government first attempted to commercialize its civil earth observation satellite system – Landsat. Since then, the high technology of earth imaging satellite systems has generated intense debates and policy conflicts, primarily centered on U.S. government concerns over the national security and foreign policy implications of high-resolution commercial satellite systems. Conversely, proponents of commercial observation satellites have urged U.S. policymakers to recognize the scientific and socio-economic utility of commercial remote sensing and thus craft and implement regulatory regimes that allow for a greater degree of information openness and transparency in using earth observation satellite imagery. This dissertation traces and analyzes that tumultuous political history and examines the policy issues and social construction of commercial remote sensing to determine the role of knowledge in the effective crafting and execution of commercial remote sensing laws and policies.\nAlthough individual and organizational perspectives, interests, missions, and cultures play a significant role in the social construction of commercial observation satellite systems and programs, the problem of insufficient knowledge of the myriad dimensions and complex nature of commercial remote sensing is a little studied but important component of this social construction process. Knowledge gaps concerning commercial remote sensing extend to various dimensions of the subject matter, such as the global, economic, technical, and legal/policy aspects.\nNumerous examples of knowledge voids are examined to suggest a connection between deficient knowledge and divergent policy perceptions as they relate to commercial remote sensing. Relevant knowledge voids are then structurally categorized to demonstrate the vastness and complexity of commercial remote sensing policy issues and to offer recommendations on how to fill such knowledge gaps to effect increased collaboration between the US government and the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry. Finally, the dissertation offers suggestions for future STS studies on policy issues, particularly those that focus on the global dimensions of commercial remote sensing or on applying the knowledge gap concept advanced by this dissertation to other areas of science and technology policymaking.",kenneth_politicalhistoryu.scommercial_2007,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

An Economic Value Of Remote-Sensing Information: Application To Agricultural Production And Maintaining Groundwater Quality,"Forney, W.M.",2012,"Does remote-sensing information provide economic benefits to society, and can a value be assigned to those benefits? Can resource management and policy decisions be better informed by coupling past and present Earth observations with groundwater nitrate measurements? Using an integrated assessment approach, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) applied an established conceptual framework to answer these questions, as well as to estimate the value of information (VOI) for remote-sensing imagery. The approach uses moderate-resolution land-imagery (MRLI) data from the Landsat and Advanced Wide Field Sensor satellites that has been classified by the National Agricultural Statistics Service into the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Within the constraint of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s public health threshold for potable groundwater resources, the USGS modeled the relation between a population of the CDL’s land uses and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers in a case study region in northeastern Iowa. Employing various multiscaled, multitemporal geospatial datasets with MRLI to maximize the value of agricultural production, the approach develops and uses multiple environmental science models to address dynamic nitrogen loading and transport at specified distances from specific sites (wells) and at landscape scales (for example, across 35 counties and two aquifers). In addition to the ecosystem service of potable groundwater, this effort focuses on the use of MRLI for the management of the major land uses in the study region—the production of corn and soybeans, which can impact groundwater quality. Derived methods and results include (1) economic and dynamic nitrate-pollution models, (2) probabilities of the survival of groundwater, and (3) a VOI for remote sensing. For the northeastern Iowa study region, the marginal benefit of the MRLI VOI (in 2010 dollars) is $858 million ± $197 million annualized, which corresponds to a net present value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits in perpetuity.

"Application Of Earth Observation Dataset And Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Technique For Forest Fire Risk Assessment In Sikkim, India","Laha, Arnab",2021,"Forest fire is one of the primary and recurring problems in Sikkim, India impacting the ecological heritage of the region. The article presents a fire risk model based on the identification of the major factors that contribute to forest fire, namely, vegetation type, vegetation density, land surface temperature, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance from settlements, rivers and roads, and then integrating them using a multi-criteria decision-making technique in a GIS framework. We document that more than 50% of the area of all the districts except North Sikkim falls into high to moderate risk zones. The model shows that 61% of fire information for resource management system data for the last 16 years coincide with the mapped high-risk zone of the state. Areas with low slope and with moderate vegetation density fall into very high risk, whereas areas with high slope and with high vegetation density correspond to moderate risk zones. Further, aspect and density of human intervention differentiate the very high and high-risk zones of the region.

As Seen From Space: Tele-Epidemiological Data As Pandemic Memory,"Gleason, Louis",2022,"In the modern world, data is instrumental in historical storytelling. The magnitude of events, who they impacted, and the degree to which the events were managed are all, very often, told through the lens of data. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of such data-driven history, where statistics on infections, death, vaccination, and average mobility are used to tell the story of how the pandemic unfolded in a given locale. While such statistical history is useful, it can also efface the histories of locations that lack access to the proper surveillance infrastructure, or are otherwise unable to deploy it. This produces an erasure of pandemic memory in healthcare-challenged areas, as deaths and infections go unrecorded and undocumented. This paper proposes the use of satellites to correct this, using Earth observation technologies to track viral vectors and find and document mass burial sites to produce a fuller picture of pandemic history, with an emphasis on filling the statistical gaps between the developed and developing world.",gleason_spaceteleepidemiologicaldata_2022,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,"tele-epidemiology - addressing disparities in data to fill gaps and provide a better understanding of pandemic history.  interesting, with concrete examples of potential benefits, but no actual measurement of benefit"
Ascribing Societal Benefit To Environmental Observations Of Earth From Space: The Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (Misr),"Macauley, Molly",2006,"At the request of managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this paper describes frameworks for and illustrates societal benefits associated with Earth observations from an experimental satellite known as the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). MISR is a unique camera that images Earth's atmosphere and other characteristics simultaneously from nine angles. This multiangle perspective enhances our ability to measure and monitor dimensions of climate, weather, air quality, natural hazards, and the biosphere. ""Societal benefit"" in this paper generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit. The paper has two objectives: to demonstrate how several societal benefit frameworks work, and to highlight some of these benefits in the case of MISR. Such consideration of practical benefits is timely, as their realization is becoming a prominent objective of future space remote sensing activities. At least four groups of experts recommend that societal benefit serve as a heavily weighted criterion for prioritizing Earth science research opportunities.

Assessing The Full Effects Of Public Investment In Space,"Clark, John",2014,"Many space-related impact studies have been carried out in the past, but there is no conclusive, comprehensive evaluation of the economic and social effects of public investments in space. Such evaluations are not easy to perform, for several reasons: the space sector is not a recognised category in official statistics; social benefits, which are likely to be very important, are hard to assess; and impacts from R&D are complex and occur in the long term. However, important steps can be made towards better evaluation of impacts. The full set of impacts of space investments may be simultaneously evaluated from both a ""bottom-up"" and a ""top-down"" perspective. In the bottom-up perspective, each effect is measured separately, while the top-down perspective provides a framework for integrating the effects. Although both perspectives have their own advantages and drawbacks, combining them yields both detailed and integrated results. Our discussion of the bottom up approach starts by identifying an extensive list of impacts. Next, data availability issues and methodological improvements are identified, leading to recommendations on programmes to collect data and perform case studies. Finally, suggestions are made for presenting impacts in the form of a scoreboard. The core of the top-down evaluation methodology proposed is social cost benefit analysis. Effects are weighted, where possible, on the basis of observed market prices or other estimations of monetary values. For effects that are hard to measure or monetize, multi-criteria analysis can be applied using surveys and expert opinion. Our core recommendations are to clearly define the space sector, to collect additional data, and to use improved methodologies.

Assessing The Usability And Potential Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts In Land Management Decisions In The Southwest Uk: Challenges And Reflections,"Bruno Soares, Marta",2017,"The potential usability and benefits of seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) to help inform decision-making processes is widely accepted. However, the practical use of SCF in Europe is still fairly recent and, as such, current knowledge of the added benefits of SCF in supporting and improving decision-making is limited. This study is based on research conducted to co-develop a semi-operational climate service prototype – the Land Management Tool (LMTool) – with farmers in South West regions of the UK. The value of the SCF provided to the farmers was examined to help us understand the usability and (potential) value of these forecasts in farmers' decisions during the winter months of 2015/2016. The findings from the study point to the need to explore and develop (new) research methods capable of addressing the complexity of the decision-making processes, such as those in the farming sector. The farmers who used the SCF perceived it as useful and usable as it helped them change and adapt their decision-making and thus, avoid unnecessary costs. However, to fully grasp the potential value of using SCF, farmers emphasised the need for the provision of SCF for longer periods of time to allow them to build trust and confidence in the information provided.

Assessing The Value Of Earth Observation For Managing Coral Reefs: An Example From The Great Barrier Reef,"Bouma, Jetske A.",2011,"The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reefprotection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5â€“10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.",bouma_assessingearthobservationmanaging_2011,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"voi/bayesian decision theory, elicitation of decision maker perceptions - marine conservation, great barrier reef"
Assessing The Value Of Information For Water Quality Management In The North Sea,"Bouma, Jetske A.",2009,"Global Earth Observation (GEO) is one of the most important sources of information for environmental resource management and disaster prevention. With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from ‘in situ’ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.",bouma_assessinginformationwaterquality_2009,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"voi/bayesian decision theory, stakeholder perception elicitation - marine water quality"
Assessing The Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Decision-Making,"Bruno Soares, Marta",2018,"Seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) can support decision-making and thus help society cope with and prepare for climate variability and change. The demand for understanding the value and benefits of using SCF in decision-making processes can be associated with different logics. Two of these would be the need to justify public and private investment in the provision of SCF and demonstrating the gains and benefits of using SCF in specific decision-making contexts. This paper reviews the main factors influencing how SCF is (or can be) valued in supporting decision-making and the main methods and metrics currently used to perform such valuations. Our review results in four key findings: (a) there is a current emphasis on economic ex ante studies and the quantification of SCF value; (b) there are fundamental differences in how the value of SCF is defined and estimated across methods and approaches; (c) most valuation methods are unable to capture the differential benefits and risks of using SCF across spatiotemporal scales and groups; and (d) there is limited involvement of the decision-makers in the valuation process. The paper concludes by providing some guiding principles towards more effective valuations of SCF, notably the need for a wider diversity and integration of methodological approaches. These should particularly embrace ex-post, qualitative, and participatory approaches which allow co-evaluation with decision-makers so that more comprehensive and equitable SCF valuations can be developed in future.",brunosoares_assessingseasonalclimateforecasts_2018,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,"good examination of the term ""value"" in context of seasonal climate forecasts though"

The authors assimilated GRACE-derived monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies for each of the four major subbasins of the Mississippi into the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) using an ensemble Kalman smoother from January 2003 to May 2006. Compared with the open-loop CLSM simulation, assimilation estimates of groundwater variability exhibited enhanced skill with respect to measured groundwater in all four subbasins. Assimilation also significantly increased the correlation between simulated TWS and gauged river flow for all four subbasins and for the Mississippi River itself. In addition, model performance was evaluated for eight smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, all of which are smaller than the scale of GRACE observations. In seven of eight cases, GRACE assimilation led to increased correlation between TWS estimates and gauged river flow, indicating that data assimilation has considerable potential to downscale GRACE data for hydrological applications.",zaitchik_assimilationgraceterrestrialwater_2008,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

Bayesian Framework For Assessing The Value Of Scientific Space Systems: Value Of Information Approach With Application To Earth Science Spacecraft,"Brathwaite, Joy",2013,"Space systems play an important role in today's society by generating or transmitting information from source to sink(s). The acquisition of the space system is often justified by the type, quantity and quality of information provided or transmitted. This work posits that the value of a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through the value of information these systems provide. To this effect, a Bayesian framework is developed to assess system value in which systems are viewed as information sources, and stakeholders as information recipients. Information has value to stakeholders as it helps to update their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher expected pay-offs than in the absence of information. This increase in expected pay-offs is ascribed to the value of the system. Based on this idea, a new metric, Value-of-Design (VOD), is introduced to quantify the value of a class of space systems with unpriced services. The Bayesian framework assesses the Value-of-Design for the space system by considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these actions. The framework here developed is then applied to the case of an Earth Science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig operators in the Gulf of Mexico. Probability models of stakeholders’ beliefs, and economic models of pay-offs are developed and integrated with a spacecraft design tool. Results from the application point to clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value, and minimum information thresholds below which it is difficult to justify the acquisition of the system. Additionally, the system is analyzed in Cost-VOD trade space to provide program managers with additional insights into the coupling of a system's predicted value generation and its associated lifecycle cost.",brathwaite_bayesianframeworkassessingscientific_2013,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"voi/bayesian decision theory, disaster early warning systems for hurricanes with respect to oil rigs"
Benefits And Beneficiaries Of The Oklahoma Mesonet: A Multisectoral Ripple Effect Analysis,"Ziolkowska, Jadwiga R.",2017,"Since the Oklahoma Mesonet (the state’s automated mesoscale weather station network) was established in 1994, it has served a number of diverse groups and provided public services to foster weather preparedness, education, and public safety, while also supporting decision-making in agricultural production and wildland fire management. With 121 monitoring stations across the state, the Oklahoma Mesonet has developed an array of technologies to observe a variety of atmospheric and soil variables in 5- to 30-min intervals.

Benefits Of Meteorological Services In South Eastern Europe,"Hautala, Raine",2008,"The study evaluated the impacts and potential benefits of meteorological and hydrological information services in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro. The services were analysed for the sectors of transport, construction industry, energy production, flood protection and agriculture production. The study was part of a larger project for the development of weather and climate observation networks and meteorological services in South Eastern Europe countries. In Albania advanced meteorological information services would produce annual savings worth 24 to 26 million euro. In Bosnia-Herzegovina the potential annual benefits were estimated to be about 10 to 22 million euro, in the FYR Macedonia 12 to 40 million euro and in Moldova 12 to 19 million euro per year. For Montenegro the data available did not enable the differentiation from Serbia for aviation and agriculture sectors. For road transport, construction industry and flood protection the annual savings resulting from better hydrometeorological information would be 1 to 3 million euro. Due to the lack of source information only part of the approximate potential benefits could be estimated at magnitude level, even though, the results show that hydrometeorological services are beneficial and worth developing further. The benefits are to a large extent due to higher predictability rates and better planning of operations as well as better preparedness for accidents and the reduction of human and material losses caused by these accidents. The realisation of the potential benefits requires comprehensive development of the hydrometeorological service systems. This means further development of observation infrastructure, data and transmission systems as well as service processes, operation models and know-how.

California's Covid-19 Economic Shutdown Reveals The Fingerprint Of Systemic Environmental Racism,"Blum, Richard",2020,"Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States often experience higher-than-average exposures to air pollution. However, the relative contribution of embedded institutional biases to these disparities can be difficult to disentangle from physical environmental drivers, socioeconomic status, and cultural or other factors that are correlated with exposures under status quo conditions. Over the spring and summer of 2020, rapid and sweeping COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders around the world created large perturbations to local and regional economic activity that resulted in observable changes in air pollution concentrations, compositions, and distributions. Here, we use the pandemic-related emergency order and subsequent economic slowdown to causally estimate pollution exposure disparities in California. Using both public ground-based sensor data and a citizen-science network of monitors for respirable particulate matter (PM2.5), along with satellite records of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), we show that the initial sheltering-in-place period produced disproportionate air pollution reduction benefits for Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and low- income communities. By linking these pollution data with weather, geographic, socioeconomic, and mobility data in difference-in-differences models, we demonstrate that these disparate pollution reductions cannot be explained by environmental conditions, geography, income, or local economic activity and are instead driven by non-local activity. This study thus provides causally-identified evidence of systemic racial and ethnic bias in pollution control under business-as-usual conditions.",blum_california'scovid19economic_2020,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
Capacity Building Approach And Application: Utilization Of Earth Observation Data And Geospatial Information Technology In The Hindu Kush Himalaya,"Thapa, Rajesh",2019,"While the Earth observation (EO) data and geospatial information technology (GIT) are getting more open and accessible, lack of skilled human resources and institutional capacities are limiting effective applications in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This paper aims to present the capacity building approach and applications designed to fill these gaps and empower decision makers and practitioners in using EO data and GIT through information education and training. The capacity building approach consists of four components: assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring (ADIM). The assessment component focuses on identifying the needs and priorities of capacity building for targeted groups or institutions. The design component develops training content in order to execute the plan in coordination with subject matter experts (SME). The implementation component executes the capacity building activity in any of these four formats—standard training, training of trainers, on-the-job training, and exposure learning. The monitoring component helps to identify the participants’ expectations, learning achievements, and feedback so as to improve future capacity building events. In the application of ADIM, we conducted needs assessment in four countries, designed 26 types of capacity building contents and implemented 39 capacity building events. A range of thematic topics—from agriculture and food security, water resources and hydro-climatic disasters, land use, land cover and ecosystem, weather and climate services, to crosscutting issues—were covered in the events. Altogether, the activities reached out to over 1,000 individuals (35% of them women) from over 200 unique institutions in 30 countries. Institutional capacity was built for universities in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to design and deliver courses independently. The capacity of partner agencies were built to co-design and co-develop data and applications. The approach also experienced challenges in the nomination process and in identifying women participants due to the lack of women professionals in the field and in the respective agencies.

Resilience and good communication are intimately linked and with climate change precipitating more numerous and onerous weather-related catastrophes, a conversation on resilience is timely and necessary. The goal is robust communities that are able to withstand the shock of disaster. Communicating well under ordinary circumstances is challenging; communicating during a crisis is extraordinarily difficult.",drake_communicatingclimatechangenatural_2016,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
Connecting Earth Observation To High-Throughput Biodiversity Data,"Bush, Alex",2017,"Understandably, given the fast pace of biodiversity loss, there is much interest in using Earth observation technology to track biodiversity, ecosystem functions and ecosystem services. However, because most biodiversity is invisible to Earth observation, indicators based on Earth observation could be misleading and reduce the effectiveness of nature conservation and even unintentionally decrease conservation effort. We describe an approach that combines automated recording devices, high-throughput DNA sequencing and modern ecological modelling to extract much more of the information available in Earth observation data. This approach is achievable now, offering efficient and near-real-time monitoring of management impactson biodiversity and its functions and services.",bush_connectingearthobservationthroughput_2017,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

"Contingent Valuation Study Of The Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Maize Farmers In The Republic Of Benin, West Africa","Amegnaglo, Coco",2017,"This study aims to assess the economic benefits of seasonal climate forecasts in West Africa based on a random survey of 354 maize farmers and to use the contingent valuation method. Results indicate that farmers need accurate seasonal climate forecasts between 1 and 2 months before the onset of rains. The most desirable dissemination channels are radio, local elders, local farmer meetings and extension agents. The most likely used farming strategies are change of: planting date, crop acreage, crop variety, and production intensification. The vast majority of farmers are willing to pay for seasonal climate forecasts, and the average annual economic value of seasonal climate forecasts are about USD 5492 for the 354 sampled farmers and USD 66.5 million dollar at the national level. Furthermore, benefits of seasonal climate forecasts are likely to increase with better access to farmer based organisation, to extension services, to financial services, to modern communication tools, intensity of use of fertilizer and with larger farm sizes. Seasonal climate forecasts are a source of improvement of farmers’ performance and the service should be integrated in extension programmes and in national agricultural development agenda.",amegnaglo_contingentvaluationstudybenefits_2017,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,not satellite specifically
Cost And Value Of Multidisciplinary Fixed-Point Ocean Observatories,"Cristini, Luisa",2016,"Sustained ocean observations are crucial to understand both natural processes occurring in the ocean and human influence on the marine ecosystems. The information they provide increases our understanding and is therefore beneficial to the society as a whole because it contributes to a more efficient use and protection of the marine environment, upon which human livelihood depends. In addition the oceans, which occupy 73% of the planet surface and host 93% of the biosphere, play a massive role in controlling the climate. Eulerian or fixed-point observatories are an essential component of the global ocean observing system as they provide several unique features that cannot be found in other systems and are therefore complementary to them. In addition they provide a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work, combining physical, chemical and biological observations on several time scales. The fixed-point open ocean observatory network (FixO3) integrates the 23 European open ocean fixed-point observatories in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. The programme also seeks to improve access to key installations and the knowledge they provide for the wider community, from scientists, to businesses, to civil society. This paper summarises the rationale behind open ocean observatories monitoring the essential ocean variables. It also provides an estimate of the costs to operate a typical fixed-point observatory such as those included in the FixO3 network.

Decision Analysis For Tornado Warning And Evacuation,"Durage, Samanthi",2016,"Uncertainties associated with decision making regarding tornado warnings can lead to false warnings and missed events. A false warning is a situation when the public is warned about a tornado and one does not actually occur. A missed event is a catastrophic situation where a tornado touchdown occurs without an advance warning. This paper mainly focuses on how false warnings and missed events influence the decision-making process of households and forecasters. The underlying factors for false warnings and missed events are analyzed in detail. Forecasters’ decision making about tornado warnings and the public’s decision to respond to a warning are analyzed using a probabilistic decision-tree approach. A logical basis for decision making is developed, and a fundamental inequality for decisions regarding tornado warnings is identified. This logical basis is applicable to other disasters as well. False warning and missed event probabilities are analyzed using the data from the Canadian Prairies. The overall analysis is applicable to improve the tornado-warning performance in the Canadian Prairies.\n\n",durage_decisionanalysistornadowarning_2016,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
"Decision Support Model And Visualization For Assessing Environmental Phenomena, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, And Satellite Design Using Earth Observation Data","Reid, Jack",2020,"With the increasing availability of Earth Observation (EO) data has come a commensurate rise in EO applications. To address the dual needs of processing data for applications and designing missions with applications in mind, we present a multi-disciplinary, integrated modeling framework to advance environmental management, policymaking, and observation platform design. This core modeling framework is called Environment-Vulnerability-DecisionTechnology (EVDT). EVDT is not the model itself, it is the framework that guides the creation of an integrated model customized to each application with a specific set of stakeholders in mind and designed using Systems Architecture. The EVDT framework can be customized to build integrated models specific to a certain application. Individual models in the framework include certain core models (Environment, Vulnerability, Decision, Technology) and optional models such as Public Health which are added when needed for a specific application. The Environment Model uses earth science methods to estimate the state of environmental phenomena; The Vulnerability Model captures societal impact of environmental changes including ecosystem services; the Decision Model captures human behavior and policy consequences; and the Technology Model provides tools to design earth observation systems or select among earth observation technologies such as satellites, airborne sensors, and in-situ sensors. The intent in developing this framework and its applications is to lead to the development of a standard to facilitate the re-use of models and the design of future remote observation systems. The presented prototype specifically focuses on two case studies. The first case study considers the dynamics of human and environmental behavior related to the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro.

Decision-Analytic Assessment Of The Economic Value Of Weather Forecasts: The Fallowing/Planting Problem,"Katz, Richard",1987,"A decision-analytic approach is taken to the problem of assessing the economic value of imperfect weather forecasts. Emphasis is placed on measures of the quality of such information and on the relationship between quality and economic value. The fallowing/planting problem for a spring wheat farmer is examined in detail as a specific application. It is assumed that the farmer's goal is to maximize the total expected discounted return over an infinite horizon, which places this problem within the general framework of Markov decision processes. By means of stochastic dynamic programming, the economic value to the farmer of currently available seasonal precipitation forecasts, as well as of hypothetical improvements in the quality of such forecasts, is estimated. Because the relationship between the quality and value of forecasts is highly nonlinear, the need to explicitly determine value-of-information estimates, rather than relying on quality as a surrogate for value, is made clear.",katz_decisionanalyticassessmenteconomic_1987,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

The workshop, entitled ""Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations: Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions,"" brought together more than 60 international experts including economists, scientists, and engineers to consider the state of the science and applications of valuing Earth observations (EO).\n\nThis 2-day workshop built upon previous activities developed under the GEOValue initiative. This workshop brought together expert analysts from multiple disciplines and backgrounds who are developing methods to identify and measure the value of information generated from the use of satellite and in-situ data. The mix of government agencies, international financial institutions, and independent consultants who participated in the workshop blended to develop a rich mix of views, approaches, and outcomes.\n\nDuring the first part of the workshop, the focus was on the latest science in valuing EO. A number of methodologies were described. Approaches generally assess the societal benefits of specific actions (for example, investments in EO). Some methods focus on broad measures of economic activity (for example, gross domestic product) or methods to assess total economic value such as contingent valuation surveys. Alternatively, use-case approaches (a use case is defined as an evaluation in which one or more decisions, applications, or other uses of data, information, and information products are specifically considered) start with the specific actions and how information is used to support decision making and affect outcomes. \n\nThe second part of the meeting was focused on the use and development of value chains and decision trees. A value chain can be defined as the set of value-adding activities that one or more organizations perform in creating and distributing goods and services. In terms of EO, the value chain approach can be applied to consider societal benefits of the data and assess the value of data and data features. The EO value chain considers the geospatial data sources and the processing of the data into value added information to be incorporated into decision-support systems, leading to decision maker's actions. To understand the value of EO, one would also need to recognize the demand side of the equation or how EO benefits users. Extending the value chain concept and incorporating tenets of Bayesian decision making, a decision tree would include one or more use cases. The value provided by the marginal increase in information could flow from one or several parts of the supply side of the value chain. The decision tree is based on the premise that information has no value if it is not used in at least one decision. By connecting the value chain and the decision tree, a framework is created that allows for conceptualizing the value of EO in its many uses. One can then apply economic techniques to monetize the marginal benefit of an outcome with information versus one without. \n\nA third part of the meeting applied the value chain and decision-tree frameworks to five specific thematic areas, each with the focus of using information for a decision point: \n- Effect of increasing temperatures on human health; \n- Flooding- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts to safety and property damage; \n- Energy and mineral supply- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts of shortfalls on the economy; and\n- Effects of natural hazards on transportation systems- Effects on mobility, safety, and the economy.\n\nDuring the working session, five separate groups worked to define and delineate the value chains and decision trees associated with each topic, discussing the related challenges and data needs. The outcomes were reported back to the full group. Because of the complexity of the topics, most groups first identified a network of value chains and then narrowed the scope to develop a single value chain to address their group's topic. Although they worked separately and on different topics, the groups came to similar conclusions, concurring that the value chain and decision-tree frameworks are very effective for informing quantitative impact assessments and developing a relatable narrative to assist the public in understanding the link between EO and citizens.",pearlman_demonstratingearthobservationsmethods_2019,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,"workshop looking at valuing eo, value chains"

Moreover, converting this data into insights requires integration of non-EOS data-sets that can provide biophysical and climatic context for EOS. Digital Earth Australia has demonstrated its ability to link EOS to rainfall and stream gauge data to provide insight into surface water dynamics during the hydrological extremes of flood and drought.

Do Users Benefit From Additional Information In Support Of Operational Drought Management Decisions In The Ebro Basin?,"Lines, Clara",2018,"We follow a user-based approach to examine how information supports operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin and how these can benefit from additional information such as from remote sensing data. First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information. Risk-averse farmers were found to benefit least from the additional information, while less risk-averse farmers stand to benefit most as the additional information helps them take better informed decisions when weighing their options.",lines_usersbenefitadditionalinformation_2018,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"drought forecasting for farmers and water managers, improvements by including remote-sensed snowfall information. structured interviews to determine water use and management practices"

Policy makers face a trade-off between imposing today the very high costs of mitigation, adaptation, and coastal protection upon national economies and leaving the costs of major disasters for future generations. Predictions of future LSL trajectories with reliable estimates of uncertainties are a crucial input to risk and vulnerability assessments in support of informed decisions. Current aleatory uncertainties in observations related to past and current LSL variations combined with epistemic uncertainties in some of the global, regional and local processes forcing LSL changes produce a large range of plausible future LSL trajectories and weak estimates of uncertainties.

Earth Observation From Space - The Issue Of Environmental Sustainability,"Durrieu, Sylvie",2013,"Remote sensing scientists work under assumptions that should not be taken for granted and should, therefore, be challenged. These assumptions include the following:\n 1. Space, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO), will always be available to governmental and commercial space entities that launch Earth remote sensing missions. \n 2. Space launches are benign with respect to environmental impacts. \n 3. Minimization of Type 1 error, which provides increased confidence in the experimental outcome, is the best way to assess the significance of environmental change. \n 4. Large-area remote sensing investigations, i.e. national, continental, global studies, are best done from space. \n 5. National space missions should trump international, cooperative space missions to ensure national control and distribution of the data products. \nAt best, all of these points are arguable, and in some cases, they’re wrong. Development of observational space systems that are compatible with sustainability principles should be a primary concern when Earth remote sensing space systems are envisioned, designed, and launched. The discussion is based on the hypothesis that reducing the environmental impacts of the data acquisition step, which is at the very beginning of the information stream leading to decision and action, will enhance coherence in the information stream and strengthen the capacity of measurement processes to meet their stated functional goal, i.e. sustainable management of Earth resources. We suggest that unconventional points of view should be adopted and when appropriate, remedial measures considered that could help to reduce the environmental footprint of space remote sensing and of Earth observation and monitoring systems in general. This article discusses these five assumptions in the context of sustainable management of Earth’s resources. Taking each assumption in turn, we find the following: \n(1) Space debris may limit access to Low Earth Orbit over the next decades. \n(2) Relatively speaking, given that they’re rare event, space launches may be benign, but study is\nmerited on upper stratospheric and exospheric layers given the chemical activity associated with rocket combustion by-products. \n(3) Minimization of Type II error should be considered in situations where minimization of Type I error\ngreatly hampers or precludes our ability to correct the environmental condition being studied. \n(4) In certain situations, airborne collects may be less expensive and more environmentally benign,\nand comparative studies should be done to determine which path is wisest. \n(5) International cooperation and data sharing will reduce instrument and launch costs and mission redundancy.

Economic Benefits Expected From Earth Observation Applications. The Case Of The Eu Fp7 Itaca Project,"Pavone, Rosario",2014,"This paper offers a contribution of how Earth Observation Applications can give economic benefits to the community of End Users. A short overview of EO benefits is given with specific reference to cultural heritage applications. In particular, the paper focuses on the case of a EU FP7 Project ITACA (Innovation Technologies and Applications for Coastal Archaeological sites), which started in January 2014 and it is currently underway. The paper briefly describes the ITACA project and its aims. During the project an economic impact assessment is carried out, initially from a qualitative point of view, through the submission of a questionnaire to the partners involved in the project. The same questionnaire was given also to identified End-Users in order to investigate the precise stakeholders' nature and behaviour and the likely economic modifications they will undergo once the project takes shape and new technical propositions are made potentially available also by way of different service models. Factors affecting positively and negatively the various stakeholder’s communities will be listed and discussed in full. Next stage is involving the quantification of potential benefits ITACA project may produce. Therefore, an evaluation of effects on economic activities of the areas and on communities the archaeological sites is being made. Once qualitative and quantitative assessments are completed, a business plan outlining also the appropriate road/roads to market is going to be prepared and suggestions will be made about which organizational/governance model best fit the expected results. This paper also deals with considerations about strength, weakness, opportunities and threats before during and after project’s deployment. The paper presents all preliminary results to be discussed with the scientific community. EU FP7 ITACA project is coordinated by Planetek Hellas E.P.E.

Economic Value Of Current And Improved Weather Forecasts In The U.s. Household Sector,"Lazo, Jeffrey",2002,"The National Weather Service (NWS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the primary federal agency responsible for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of weather forecast information. With an annual budget of about $1,383 million, the average U.S. household pays about $13 a year for the services of the NWS. There is little if any reliable economic information indicating whether these services are worth this $13 a year to households, although it is widely assumed that the benefits far exceed the costs. Furthermore, there is even less information on the value to households of potential improvements to or changes in current weather forecasting services. As NOAA considers new programs and implements new technologies, it is likely to be asked to justify proposed new expenditures using a benefit-cost framework. This study was commissioned to assist in evaluating and quantifying, to the extent possible, the benefits to households of potential improvements in weather forecasting services, as well as how the public values current forecast services. Table S-1 presents this study’s best estimates of annual per household values for improved and current weather forecasts. Based on Census estimates of about 105 million U.S. households, total national values for improving weather forecasts to the maximum levels proposed in the survey are estimated to be $1.73 billion per year.

Economic Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Agriculture: Review Of Ex-Ante Assessments And Recommendations For Future Research,"Meza, Francisco",2008,"Advanced information in the form of seasonal climate forecasts has the potential to improve farmers’ decision making, leading to increases in farm profits. Interdisciplinary initiatives seeking to understand and exploit the potential benefits of seasonal forecasts for agriculture have produced a number of quantitative ex-ante assessments of the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts. The realism, robustness, and credibility of such assessments become increasingly important as efforts shift from basic research toward applied research and implementation. This paper surveys published evidence about the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts for agriculture, characterizing the agricultural systems, approaches followed, and scales of analysis. The climate forecast valuation literature has contributed insights into the influence of forecast characteristics, risk attitudes, insurance, policy, and the scale of adoption on the value of forecasts. Key innovations in the more recent literature include explicit treatment of the uncertainty of forecast value estimates, incorporation of elicited management responses into bioeconomic modeling, and treatment of environmental impacts, in addition to financial outcomes of forecast response. It is argued that the picture of the value of seasonal forecasts for agriculture is still incomplete and often biased, in part because of significant gaps in published valuation research. Key gaps include sampling of a narrow range of farming systems and locations, incorporation of an overly restricted set of potential management responses, failure to consider forecast responses that could lead to “regime shifts,” and failure to incorporate state-of-the-art developments in seasonal forecasting. This paper concludes with six recommendations to enhance the realism, robustness, and credibility of ex-ante valuation of seasonal climate forecasts.",meza_economicseasonalclimateforecasts_2008,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

These services are purchased by users in order to be able to offer optimally or demand a certain service or, with respect to security, these services aim at helping to prevent damage from extreme events.\n\nA rough estimate for a number of selected sectors shows that benefits from weather services in Switzerland are in the region of hundreds of millions Swiss Francs (1 Swiss Franc ∼ €0.66, US$0.83 as at 2008).\n\nThis pilot study shows that it is not possible to estimate one single figure representing the overall benefit from weather services in a country. Concerning the economic sector, a benefit analysis should therefore concentrate on those sub-sectors where weather services are particularly relevant, i.e. agriculture, construction, energy, insurance, telecommunication, tourism, transport, logistics and water availability. Analysis of benefits from climate data is of particular interest to MeteoSwiss since the Federal Office is the main source for climate data in Switzerland.

Economic Value Of Environmental And Weather Information For Agricultural Decisions - A Case Study For Oklahoma Mesonet,"Ziolkowska, Jadwiga R.",2018,"For the past 24 years, weather information and monitoring provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet (the state’s largest weather and environmental monitoring network) has been used by many farmers across the state to optimize their farm operations and improve profitability of agricultural production. Several research studies delineated advantages of Mesonet weather information for efficient agricultural decision-making. However, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative research in this field is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for Oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on profitability analysis, USDA NASS and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center. The results show that the cumulative economic benefits for agricultural production in Oklahoma from utilizing Mesonet information (assuming the profitability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying Mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006–2014 (combining generated profits and prevented losses in agricultural production). Mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic benefits in terms of prevented losses than additional production profits, especially in drought years. A regional analysis for Oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative benefits of Mesonet applications in the Southwest ($45.9 million), North Central region ($38.2 million), and in Panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006–2014. Also, high temporal variations were found for all Oklahoma climate regions.This research is focused on the agricultural sector, while it also sets the baseline for a more holistic understanding of the economic value and benefits of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet that can further be applied to other sectors in the state.",ziolkowska_economicenvironmentalweatherinformation_2018,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,NA

Enhancing The Application Of Earth Observations For Improved Environmental Decision-Making Using The Early Warning Explorer (Ewx),"Shukla, Shraddhanand",2021,"The mitigation of losses due to extreme climate events and long-term climate adaptation requires climate informed decision-making. In the past few decades, several remote sensing and modeled-based Earth observations (EOs) have been developed to provide an unprecedented global overview and routine monitoring of climate and its impacts on vegetation and hydrologic conditions, with the goal of supporting informed decision-making. However, their usage in decision-making is particularly limited in climate-risk vulnerable and in situ data-scarce regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to EOs. Here, we describe the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX), which was developed to address this crucial limitation and facilitate the application of EOs in decision-making, particularly in the food and water-insecure regions of the world. First, the EWX’s core framework, which includes (i) the Viewer, (ii) GeoEngine, and (iii) Support Applications, is described.

Next, examples are provided to demonstrate how EWX can be used to monitor development, progression, spatial extent, and severity of climate-driven extreme events to support timely decisions related to mitigation of food insecurity and flooding impacts. Finally, the value of a regional implementation of EWX at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, is highlighted.

Enhancing The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index By Integrating Spatiotemporal Information From Satellite And In Situ Data,"Oikonomou, Panagiotis",2019,"Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts.

Extending Data For Urban Health Decision-Making: A Menu Of New And Potential Neighborhood-Level Health Determinants Datasets In Lmics,"Thomson, Dana",2019,"Area-level indicators of the determinants of health are vital to plan and monitor progress toward targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tools such as the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART) and UN Habitat Urban Inequities Surveys identify dozens of area-level health determinant indicators that decisionmakers can use to track and attempt to address population health burdens and inequalities. However, questions remain as to how such indicators can be measured in a cost-effective way. Area-level health determinants reflect the physical, ecological, and social environments that influence health outcomes at community and societal levels, and include, among others, access to quality health facilities, safe parks, and other urban services, traffic density, level of informality, level of air pollution, degree of social exclusion, and extent of social networks. The identification and disaggregation of indicators is necessarily constrained by which datasets are available. Typically, these include household- and individual-level survey, census, administrative, and health system data. However, continued advancements in earth observation (EO), geographical information system (GIS), and mobile technologies mean that new sources of area-level health determinant indicators derived from satellite imagery, aggregated anonymized mobile phone data, and other sources are also becoming available at granular geographic scale.

WorldPop and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have already modeled dozens of household survey indicators at country or continental scales at resolutions of 1 × 1 km or even smaller. This paper aims to broaden perceptions about which types of datasets are available for health and development decision-making. For data scientists, we flag area-level indicators at city and sub-city scales identified by health decision-makers in the SDGs, Urban HEART, and other initiatives. For local health decision-makers, we summarize a menu of new datasets that can be feasibly generated from EO, mobile phone, and other spatial data—ideally to be made free andpublicly available—and offer lay descriptions of some of the difficulties in generating such data products.",thomson_extendingdataurbanhealth_2019,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

"Fire And Smoke Observed From The Earth Observing System Modis Instrument-Products, Validation, And Operational Use","Kaufman, Y.J.",2003,"The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, launched on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terra satellite at the end of 1999, was designed with 36 spectral channels for a wide array of land, ocean, and atmospheric investigations. MODIS has a unique ability to observe fires, smoke, and burn scars globally. Its main fire detection channels saturate at high brightness temperatures: 500 K at 4 µm and 400 K at 11 µm, which can only be attained in rare circumstances at the 1 km fire detection spatial resolution. Thus, unlike other polar orbiting satellite sensors with similar thermal and spatial resolutions, but much lower saturation temperatures (e.g. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Along Track Scanning Radiometer), MODIS can distinguish between low intensity ground surface fires and high intensity crown forest fires. Smoke column concentration over land is for the first time being derived from the MODIS solar channels, extending from 0.41 µm to 2.1 µm. The smoke product has been provisionally validated both globally and regionally over southern Africa and central and south America. Burn scars are observed from MODIS even in the presence of smoke, using the 1.2 to 2.1 µm channels. MODIS burned area information is used to estimate pyrogenic emissions. A wide range of these fire and related products and validation are demonstrated for the wild fires that occurred in northwestern USA in Summer 2000. The MODIS rapid response system and direct broadcast capability is being developed to enable users to obtain and generate data in near real-time. It is expected that health and land management organizations will use these systems for monitoring the occurrence of fires and the dispersion of smoke within two to six hours after data acquisition.",kaufman_firesmokeobservedearth_2003,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
Forest Service Spending On Large Wildfires In The West,"Ellison, Autumn",2012,"Since the 1970s, federal spending on wildfire suppression in the United States has grown, reaching $1 billion annually over the past decade. The USDA Forest Service has also increasingly used private contractors to conduct fire suppression. As with all activities that the Forest Service performs, the agency can employ staff directly, contract with outside businesses, or enter into agreements with nonprofit and other government entities to perform fire suppression. Historically, the Forest Service primarily used agency personnel for much of its suppression activities. However, with the decline of Forest Service personnel in the 1990s, the agency turned to contractors more frequently. Despite these growing costs and the larger role of private businesses in fire suppression, relatively little is known outside the land management agencies about what these funds are spent on, how they are spent, which activities are contracted out, and where this spending occurs. Yet, the choices that the Forest Service makes in wildfire suppression spending affect communities and economies near wildfires. In particular, local and regional capture of suppression contracts and local employment of agency staff can help mediate the negative economic impacts of a wildfire.",ellison_forestservicespendingwildfires_2012,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

Geographic Microtargeting Of Social Assistance With High-Resolution Poverty Maps,"Smythe, Isabella",2022,"Hundreds of millions of poor families receive some form of targeted social assistance. Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learning–based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learning–based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion.

Getting The Most Out Of Ensemble Forecasts: A Valuation Model Based On User-Forecast Interactions,"Millner, Antony",2008,"A flexible theoretical model of perceived forecast value is proposed that explicitly includes the effects of user and ensemble characteristics and their interactions. The model can be applied to arbitrary decision problems and is sensitive to a much wider range of factors than traditional forecast valuation models. A simple illustration of its application to the cost–loss decision problem familiar from the forecast valuation literature is discussed. It is shown that perceived value is highly sensitive to perceived model accuracy and that in most cases a high level of perceived accuracy is required for the forecasts to be thought to have any value at all. Decisions with a cost–benefit ratio that is close to the climatological probability of the adverse event are shown to be less sensitive to perceived accuracy. The model shows that it is possible for perceived value to remain unchanged when perceived accuracy increases, thus suggesting an explanation for why forecast uptake often does not increase after improvements in model performance are made. Last, it is argued that attempts to increase forecast uptake should be targeted at those users whose cost–benefit ratios fall in a restricted range that depends on the climatological probability of the event and an objective measure of the ensemble accuracy.",millner_ensembleforecastsvaluationmodel_2008,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,not satellite specifically

In addition, we find that there is not a high premium on immediate resolution of uncertainty, if resolution would otherwise occur within, say, twenty years; this implies that time is available to plan and execute a carefully designed research program. On the other hand, we find that if the real world political process would result in a suboptimal control policy being chosen under uncertainty, and this choice could be prevented by early resolution of uncertainty, the benefit of early resolution may be as much as three orders of magnitude greater.",peck_globalwarminguncertaintiesinformation_1993,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,this is  about carbon emissions trajectory and policy rather than any kind of remote observation-related information

Identifying Methods For Quantifying The Societal Impacts Of The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,2011,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) generates tremendous value for the nation. The Agency provides critical environmental data, forecasts, cutting edge knowledge, management and stewardship that the United States needs to plan for and react to in a constantly changing global environment. The Agency, however, needs to do more to understand and measure exactly how its activities, products and services affect the well-being of the nation. Existing and emerging social science methods can be harnessed to help the Agency assess the degree to which we are meeting our mission goals and to improve the value we provide to society. The first NOAA Science Challenge workshop brought together policy makers at NOAA with social science leaders from inside and outside of the Agency to explore methods for better quantifying the ways in which NOAA affects society. As an initial step in better understanding the broader societal impacts of NOAA, we focused on the NOAA line offices and programs that deal most directly with the public: the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (including the National Sea Grant College Program), and the programs that support climate activities at NOAA (the Climate Program Office and the National Climate Data Center). While it is easy to see why society needs NOAA, the workshop revealed just how difficult it can be to rigorously quantify the societal impact of NOAA’s activities, products, and services. As a first step, the line offices identified specific NOAA products, services, and activities (outputs) for which they would like to quantify societal impacts. These examples were meant to highlight a diversity of products and services. We focused initially on relatively straightforward examples that could serve as both a departure for discussion and illustrations of how programs within the Agency might begin thinking about quantifying the societal impact of their work. For each output, the line offices developed a narrative (story) that linked the output with a sector of society and ultimately a state of societal well-being. Workshop participants further developed these stories and explored methods and approaches to better quantify how these NOAA outputs affect societal well-being. The workshop identified many methods that can be applied to better understand the way the Agency affects society. One class of methods is data denial, in which intermediate and final users of NOAA data products are asked to operate in the absence of NOAA data. Other methods involve retrospective analyses of the ways in which the public and private sector have used NOAA outputs. Still other approaches require that users imagine how their decisions would differ in the absence of NOAA activities, products and services.Table 1 provides a sampling of value chains, metrics, and methods developed at the workshop. The participants identified a variety of metrics to measure societal well-being and change including revenues, economic value, lives saved, sense of place, preferences and attitudes, property damages, and crop yields. While one day is insufficient to fully develop these methods and approaches, the workshop was an important opportunity for policy makers at NOAA and social scientists to work together to understand how the Agency can harness social science methods to do a better job of meeting its mission goals. Certain line offices are still more adept at measuring the baseline of societal well-being than in trying to tease out the contribution of any single program or activity. This corresponds, in large part, to the enterprise nature of many activities at the Agency – many programs inside and outside of the Agency combine to achieve our mission goals. As the Agency moves forward in its efforts to understand how NOAA affects society, the methods and metrics used to do so will be refined and improved. Possible next steps in the process include:\n○ More enterprise level approaches to developing value chains and valuations.\n○ Follow-up workshops or symposia on methods for quantifying the societal impacts of specific types of NOAA outputs including: research, information, and weather.",nationaloceanicandatmosphericadministration_identifyingmethodsquantifyingsocietal_2011,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,this reports results from a workshop; examples are not strictly a review but were not applied by the authors

Intangible Economic Benefit Of Remote Sensing Data In Indonesia,"Diana, Shinta Rahma",2020,"Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) as a space ecosystem runner government institution of the space agency in Indonesia is mandated by Indonesia space law of 2013 to carry out remote sensing activities that are not only strategic nationally in nature but also charged being benefits economically. This study investigated the intangible economic benefits of remote sensing activities in Indonesia. This research explored qualitatively the advantage of the use of remote sensing information by users obtained from the results of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The conceptual framework of intangible benefit is based on the information system success model by the De-Lone and McLean Information Value model. The results showed that the quality of remote sensing was good. This can be seen from most responses of user respondents on the Perceived System Quality and Information Quality indicators giving a good rating. The response of the user respondents caused a sense of satisfaction and also caused the use of the system to be more intense. These had a good impact on the performance of respondents, both individually and organizationally.

Integrated National-Scale Assessment Of Wildfire Risk To Human And Ecological Values,"Thompson, Matthew",2011,"The spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of wildfire risk are challenging U.S. federal land management agencies to meet societal needs while maintaining the health of the lands they manage. In this paper we present a quantitative, geospatial wildfire risk assessment tool, developed in response to demands for improved risk-based decision frameworks. The methodology leverages off recent and significant advancements in wildfire simulation models and geospatial data acquisition and management. The tool is intended to facilitate monitoring trends in wildfire risk over time and to develop information useful in prioritizing fuels treatments and mitigation measures. Wildfire risk assessment requires analyzing the likelihood of wildfire by intensity level, and the magnitude of potential beneficial and negative effects to valued resources from fire at different intensity levels. This effort is designed to support strategic planning by systematically portraying how fire likelihood and intensity influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values at the national scale. We present results for the continental United States, analyze high risk areas by geographic region, and examine how risk evaluations changes under different assumptions with sensitivity analysis.

Integrating Earth Observation Data Into Geospatial Databases That Support Public Health Decisions,"Morain, S.A.",2006,"There are several reasons why public health communities do not use information from Earth observations routinely. Most notable among them are: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that would deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly in their already heavy workloads. The Public Health Applications in Remote Sensing (PHAiRS) project is engineering elements of an enhanced disease surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the desert southwest of the United States. Several Earth observations (EO) data sets are replacing parameters traditionally used in dust forecasting models to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement. Output from the enhanced dust forecasting model is nested within a regional version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (Eta version) model (NCEP/Eta). Simulations using the enhanced dust model have been compared to actual dust episodes recorded by NCEP/Eta’s atmospheric patterns and by dust data from a ground-based Continuous Air Monitoring System (CAMS). The simulations were rerun after replacing the land cover layer with land cover classes derived from MODIS (MOD-12). For the CAMS test cases, this resulted in a significant improvement in dust episode patterns. Additional EO data assimilations investigate whether further improvements can be gained by replacing the topographic layer with higher resolution digital elevation data from SRTM, dustgenerating areas derived from MOD-15’s Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, soil moisture data from AMSR-E, and aerodynamic surface roughness. Ongoing simulations aim eventually to measure hourly, daily, and weekly model improvements from EO data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis. The overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several EO data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of EO data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c), develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence.",morain_integratingearthobservationdata_2006,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,dust forecasting - compares model outputs using higher-resolution eo data to see how model performs? no valuation of information except for model performance

"Interactive Model For Assessing Mangrove Health, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, And Satellite Design In Rio De Janeiro Using Earth Observation Data","Reid, Jack",2020,"There is an increasing need for tools to translate Earth Observation (EO) data into societally relevant metrics to inform human decision-making. To address this need, we present a multi-disciplinary, interactive modeling framework to advance ecological forecasting and policymaking using EO data. This framework will integrate four model components into one tool: Earth Science, Social Impact, Human Behavior and Satellite Design. The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management of EO and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing, machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering. This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study: the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence shing, preventing coastal erosion, and attracting an ecotourism industry. The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model components. The Earth Science Model builds upon work by NASA biospheric scientists to use EO data, cloud computing and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a 600 km2 area, as well as work by the Espa co research group at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro on the local mangrove ecosystem. To create the Human Decision Making model, we have partnered with Instituto Pereira Passos (the data science o ce of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand the policy history and socioeconomic factors. To build the Social Impact model, we are collaborating with ecosystem services economists to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact socioeconomic wellbeing. The Satellite Design Model accounts for the types of data collection used by policy makers since 1985. Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive model that policymakers can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes?

In particular, satellites and RS can be used for space and earth observations, support military operations, precision agriculture, meteorological forecasting, communication and internet connectivity to lesser-known applications such as in transport tracking and monitoring of utility networks. In this paper, we analyse the current trends, benefits and limitations of the use of satellites and RS. In particular, we try to identify the main socio-economic benefits deriving from the use of RS in several sectors.

The present study investigates the complexity of an inland freshwater wetland system, presenting a conceptual framework for mapping and monitoring the dynamics of Lake Kolleru (a wetland of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention), utilizing a geospatial platform. Illustrating the pace of land use changes leading to the progressive elimination of the wetland ecosystem of freshwater Lake Kolleru, this study also highlights the impacts of such changes on the socio-economic system. A comprehensive temporal analysis (1977–2007) provided a structural base to schematically analyse the dynamics of biophysical and ecological changes to the wetland by effectively using a spectrum of remote sensing data. The present status and changing trends in ecological dimensions of Lake Kolleru were illustrated, utilizing information from spatial analyses, complimented with socio-economic assessment. Attention is drawn to the potential of utilizing earth resources systems in exploring space–time interactions in freshwater ecosystems heavily modified through aquaculture interventions. Further, the spatial derivatives are meant as reference material for local authorities and decision-makers to rehabilitate the economic livelihood activities to the social community dependent on the lake ecosystem.

Knowledge Generation Using Satellite Earth Observations To Support Sustainable Development Goals (Sdg): A Use Case On Land Degradation,"Giuliani, Gregory",2020,"Land degradation is a critical issue globally requiring immediate actions for protecting biodiversity and associated services provided by ecosystems that are supporting human quality of life. The latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Landmark Assessment Report highlighted that human activities are considerably degrading land and threating the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion\npeople. In order to reduce and ideally reverse this prevailing situation, national capacities should be strengthened to enable effective assessments and mapping of their degraded lands as recommended by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Landsat In Contexts: Deconstructing And Reconstructing The Data-To-Action Paradigm In Earth Remote Sensing,"Fried, Samantha",2019,"There is a common theme at play in our talk of data generally, of digital earth data more specifically, and of environmental monitoring most specifically: more data leads to more action and, ultimately, to societal good. This data-to-action framework is troubled. Its taken-for grantedness prevents us from attending to the processes between data and action. It also dampens our drive to investigate the contexts of that data, that action, and that envisioned societal good. In this dissertation, I deconstruct this data-to-action model in the context of Landsat, the United States' first natural resource management satellite. First, I talk about the ways in which Landsat's data and instrumentation hold conflicting narratives and values within them. Therefore, Landsat data does not automatically or easily yield action toward environmental preservation, or toward any unified societal good. Furthermore, I point out a parallel dynamic in STS, where critique is somewhat analogous to data. We want our critiques to yield action, and to guide us toward a more just technoscience. However, critiques- like data- require intentional, reconstructive interventions toward change. Here is an opportunity for a diffractive intervention: one in which we read STS and remote sensingthrough each other, to create space for interdisciplinary dialogue around environmental preservation. A focus on this shared goal, I argue, is imperative. At stake are issues of environmental degradation, dwindling resources, and climate change. I conclude with beginnings rather than endings: with suggestions for how we might begin to create infrastructure that attends to that forgotten space between data, critique, action, and change.",fried_landsatcontextsdeconstructingreconstructing_2019,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
Landscape Analysis Of Cobalt Mining Activities From 2009 To 2021 Using Very High Resolution Satellite Data (Democratic Republic Of The Congo),"Brown, Chloe",2022,"The cobalt mining sector is well positioned to be a key contributor in determining the success of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Despite the important contribution to the DRC’s economy, the rapid expansion of mining operations has resulted in major social, health, and environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the cumulative impact of mining activities on the landscape of a prominent cobalt mining area in the DRC. To achieve this, an object-based method, employing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, was used to map land cover across the city of Kolwezi and the surrounding mining areas, where long-term mining activity has dramatically altered the landscape. The research used very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery (2009, 2014, 2019, 2021) to map the spatial distribution of land cover and land cover change, as well as analyse the spatial relationship between land cover classes and visually identified mine features, from 2009 to 2021. Results from the object-based SVM land cover classification produced an overall accuracy of 85.2–90.4% across the time series. Between 2009 and 2021, land cover change accounted to: rooftops increasing by 147.2% (+7.7 km2); impervious surface increasing by 104.7% (+3.35 km2); bare land increasing by 85.4% (+33.81 km2); exposed rock increasing by 56.2% (+27.46 km2); trees decreasing by 4.5% (−0.34 km2); shrub decreasing by 38.4% (−26.04 km2); grass and cultivated land decreasing by 27.1% (−45.65 km2); and water decreasing by 34.6% (−3.28 km2). The co-location of key land cover classes and visually identified mine features exposed areas of potential environmental pollution, with 91.6% of identified water situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature, and vulnerable populations, with 71.6% of built-up areas (rooftop and impervious surface class combined) situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature. Assessing land cover patterns over time and the interplay between mine features and the landscape structure allowed the study to amplify the findings of localised on-the-ground research, presenting an alternative viewpoint to quantify the true scale and impact of cobalt mining in the DRC.

Linking Earth Observation And Mobile Technologies For Improved Decision-Support In Case Of Droughts And Related Food Insecurity,"Enenkel, Markus",2015,"Droughts are complex events that constitute a natural part of the climate. Among all natural disasters they show the largest spatio-temporal extent, cause enormous economic loss and numerous casualties. Although droughts pose a threat to both industrialized and developing countries the latter often suffer from chronic poverty and vulnerability, which pave the way for wide-ranging impacts. Earth observation can support aid organizations that are often struggling to cope with the impact of large-scale drought events. However, exploiting the added-value of new technologies requires tools that are adapted to individual user requirements and in-depth knowledge transfer. Within the framework of a project named SATIDA (Satellite Technologies for Improved Drought Risk Assessment) this dissertation links satellite-derived information that aims at the detection of environmental anomalies to information about socio-economic conditions, collected via a corresponding open-source mobile application. The satellite component is based on the combination of different satellite observations (rainfall, soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation health) in an Enhanced Combined Drought Index (ECDI). The soil moisture component, which is considered a key variable between atmospheric and land surface conditions, is improved by linking near-real-time (NRT) observations from active and passive microwave sensors to an offline dataset that was generated within the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). This way, it is possible to detect soil moisture anomalies based on more than 37 years of data (19782015). Supported by Doctors without Borders, the tests were conducted in the Central African Republic and in Ethiopia. The dissertation results in three key findings. First, current NRT observations of soil moisture are mature enough to be considered for operational drought monitoring. Second, the method to combine different variables in the ECDI facilitates exploiting the individual strengths of all input datasets, and the robust detection of major drought events.

Linking Poverty-Based Inequalities With Transportation And Accessibility Using Mobility Data: A Case Study Of Greater Maputo,"Mattal, Shagun",2022,"Accessibility is widely considered as the most crucial benefit of any transportation system. Low accessibility may cause compromise on living conditions, low economic growth, high unemployment, social seclusion, and long-term social inequalities. In developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, surveys fail to keep up with the pace of rapid urbanization. Additionally, numerous location-based data sets, including mobile phone location data and Google Maps travel time, enable near-real-time observations of actively changing mobility dynamics. In this study, we use these novel data sets to assess various facets of accessibility and corresponding poverty-based inequalities within the Greater Maputo region in Mozambique. A data-based approach is seldom used in the Sub-Saharan African context. Consistent poverty-based inequalities in access to opportunities by driving, transit, and walking are observed. The transit system was ascertained to be more inefficient in the poorer regions. The richer regions witnessed most decreased access to opportunities because of high congestion. People living in the poorest regions were observed to travel much longer distances to access facilities than did those living in the richest regions. These differences were particularly significant for essential services of education, healthcare, and employment. These results can help urban planners and policymakers identify disadvantaged communities and develop policies to ameliorate the conditions.

To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition.

Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations.

Near Real-Time Wildfire Management Using Distributed Satellite System,"Thangavel, Kathiravan",2022,"Climate action (SDG-13) is an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations (UN), and wildfire is one of the catastrophic events related to climate change. Large-scale forest fires have drastically increased in frequency and size in recent years in Australia and other nations. These wildfires endanger the forests and urban areas of the world, demolish vast amounts of property, and frequently result in fatalities. There is a requirement for real-time/near real-time catastrophic event monitoring of fires due to their growing frequency. In order to effectively monitor disaster events, it will be feasible to manage them in real-time or near real-time, thanks to the advent of the Distributed Satellite System (DSS). This research examines the possible applicability of DSS for wildfire surveillance. For spacecraft to continually monitor the dynamically changing environment, satellite missions must have broad coverage and revisit intervals that DSS can fulfil. A feasibility analysis, as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, are included in this paper to enable prompt action and swiftly provide alerts. In our previous research, it is shown that on-board implementation, i.e., data processing utilising hardware accelerators, is feasible. To enable Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operation (TASO), the same will be included in the proposed DSS architecture, and the outcomes will be provided.

Position Paper: Evaluation Methods And Techniques,"Smart, Alan",2014,"This paper reviews methodologies in economics for valuing the benefits of geospatial data and services; including the value of open data. Section 2 explores the meaning of socioeconomic value and reviews the methodologies underpinning value assessment. It explains the theoretical background to economic welfare analysis, total turnover analysis and value added analysis. The use of different methods for economic impact assessment is then outlined. The methods include benefit cost analysis, multiplier analysis and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling1. This section also outlines the background to value chain analysis and real options analysis. Examples of the application of these techniques are discussed. They include the application of earth observation to agricultural and water resource management and the use of mapping to improve decision making in areas such as emergency management, managing endangered species, conducting property tax assessments and verifying insurance claims. These examples illustrate the potential for geospatial data to deliver value over a wide and growing range of applications. Section 3 addresses the issues that arise in applying these techniques. It points out that the methodology selected must address the questions being asked by policy makers and/or users of geospatial data. In the current defensive fiscal environment experienced by governments in many OECD countries, it is important that the valuation method links the use of geospatial data services to a clearly defined and quantifiable outcome. There needs to be a ‘line of sight’ between application of geospatial data services and the benefits that are identified. The paper suggests that evaluations should clearly outline such relationships and suggests a hierarchy of methods that can be applied in such circumstances. The methods include cost effectiveness analysis, benefit cost analysis and regional and economy wide economic modelling. Section 4 comments on the issues that arise draws some conclusions and raises some questions for discussion. It concludes that there is a need to: align methodology to the decision maker’s needs; develop better evidence based economic assessments; adopt more structured approaches to addressing the rapid evolution in the use and application of geospatial data; develop greater capability in building better business cases; and reaching a consensus on internationally recognised methodologies.

Potential Benefits Of Climate Forecasting To Agriculture,"Jones, J.W.",2000,"Climate variability leads to economic and food security risks throughout the world because of its major influences on agriculture. Accurate forecasts of climate 3–6 months ahead of time can potentially allow farmers and others in agriculture to make decisions to reduce unwanted impacts or take advantage of expected favorable climate. However, potential benefits of climate forecasts vary considerably because of many physical, biological, economic, social, and political factors. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential economic value of climate forecasts for farm scale management decisions in one location in the Southeast USA (Tifton, GA; 31°23′N; 83°31′W) for comparison with previously-derived results for the Pampas region of Argentina. The same crops are grown in both regions but at different times of the year. First, the expected value of tailoring crop mix to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases for a typical farm in Tifton was estimated using crop models and historical daily weather data. Secondly, the potential values for adjusting management of maize (Zea maize L.) to different types of climate forecasts (perfect knowledge of (a) ENSO phase, (b) growing season rainfall categories, and (c) daily weather) were estimated for Tifton and Pergamino, Argentina (33°55′S; 60°33′W). Predicted benefits to the farm of adjusting crop mix to ENSO phase averaged from US$ 3 to 6 ha−1 over all years, depending on the farmer’s initial wealth and aversion to risk. Values calculated for Argentina were US$ 9–15 for Pergamino and up to US$ 35 for other locations in the Pampas. Varying maize management by ENSO phase resulted in predicted forecast values of US$ 13 and 15 for Tifton and Pergamino, respectively. The potential value of perfect seasonal forecasts of rainfall tercile on maize profit was higher than for ENSO-based forecasts in both regions (by 28% in Tifton and 70% in Pergamino). Perfect knowledge of daily weather over the next season provided an upper limit on expected value of about US$ 190 ha−1 for both regions. Considering the large areas of field crop production in these regions, the estimated economic potential is very high. However, there are a number of challenges to realize these benefits.

In addition we estimate that had the information from such a system been available in the 1970s and 1980s the Kodiak king crab stock collapse could have been avoided and $60 million in annual revenues generated. Benefit estimates (as measured by revenue increases) are based on the assumptions that when better data is delivered those data will be integrated into stock assessment models; when better data are integrated into the models the new data will actually improve the reliability of the models; and when the reliability of the models is improved predictions will be accepted by managers or industry members.",wellman_potentialbenefitscoastalocean_2008,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"voi/bayesian - how do fisheries management decisions benefit from access to an enhanced coastal ocean observing system, e.g., stock assessment models, reducing uncertainty in management decisions"
Potential Value Of Gcm-Based Seasonal Rainfall Forecasts For Maize Management In Semi-Arid Kenya,"Hansen, James",2009,"We estimate the potential value of general circulation model (GCM)-based seasonal precipitation forecasts for maize planting and fertilizer management decisions at two semi-arid locations (Katumani and Makindu) in Southern Kenya. Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October–February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions – representing upper and lower bounds of predictability – and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15–30% of the average gross value of production and 24–69% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. GCM predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24% at Katumani and 9% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study’s assumptions, despite high probability (25% at Katumani, 34% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts.",hansen_potentialgcmbasedseasonal_2009,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,GCM not satellite data

Quantifying The Cost Reduction Potential For Earth Observation Satellites,"Shao, Anthony",2014,"In the present budget environment, there is a strong need to dramatically drive down the cost of space missions. There is the perception that SmallSats are inherently much lower cost than more traditional larger satellites and can play a central role in reducing overall space mission cost, but this effect has been difficult to quantify. Without quantifiable evidence of their value, SmallSats are under-utilized as a method for reducing space mission cost. The purpose of this study is to quantify the relationship between cost and performance for space systems, by creating a Performance-Based Cost Model (PBCM). Today, most acquisition performance analyses focus on cost overruns, or how much the system costs relative to what it is expected to cost. Instead, PBCM allows us to focus on more important questions, such as, how much performance we can achieve for a given cost, or what the cost is for a given level of performance. In this paper, we present the relationship between cost vs. orbit altitude for a fixed resolution and coverage requirement, cost vs. resolution, and cost vs. coverage. Traditional cost models for space systems are typically weight-based, primarily because mass allocation is determined early in mission design and has historically correlated well with actual hardware cost. To provide the underlying cost data for this study, we apply 3 cost models widely used throughout the aerospace cost modeling community: the Unmanned Space Vehicle Cost Model (USCM), the Aerospace Corp. Small Satellite Cost Model (SSCM), and the NASA Instrument Cost Model (NICM). Our first application of the PBCM is for Earth observation systems. Past Earth observation systems have used traditional space technology to achieve the best possible performance, but have been very expensive. In addition, low-cost, responsive dedicated launch has not been available for SmallSats. Space system mass is proportional to the cube of the linear dimensions—equivalent to saying that most spacecraft have about the same density. This means that by flying at lower altitudes, satellites can reduce their payload size and therefore the entire mass of the satellite, thus reducing the cost of the system dramatically. We conclude that for an Earth observation system, an increase in performance, reduction in cost, or both, is possible by using multiple SmallSats at lower altitudes when compared to traditional systems. Specifically,\nBy using modern microelectronics and light-weight materials such as composite structures, future SmallSats\nobservation systems, operating at a lower altitude than traditional systems, have the potential for:\n– Comparable or better performance (resolution and coverage)\n– Much lower overall mission cost (by a factor of 2 to 10)\n– Lower risk (both implementation and operations)\n– Shorter schedules\nRelevant secondary advantages for the low-altitude SmallSats include:\n– Lower up-front development cost\n– More sustainable business model\n– More flexible and resilient\n– More responsive to both new technologies and changing needs\n– Mitigates the problem of orbital debris\nThe principal demerits of the approach are the lack of low-cost launch vehicles, the need for a new way of doing business, and changing the way we think about the use of space assets.

A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately $370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly ($55,000–$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.",stroming_quantifyinghumanhealthbenefits_2020,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,satellite data used to improve forecasts of habs

This paper outlines prerequisites to beneficial forecast use; highlights key issues, approaches and challenges related to each; and suggests an evolutionary strategy. The first prerequisite is that forecast information must address a need that is both real and perceived. Second, benefit arises only through viable decision options that are sensitive to forecast information. Third, benefit depends on prediction of the components of climate variability that are relevant to viable decisions. Fourth, appropriate forecast use requires effective communication of relevant information. Finally, sustained use requires institutional commitment and favorable policies. It is useful to consider three phases of effort: an exploratory phase to gain understanding and assess potential, a pilot phase characterized by co-learning between researchers and target decision makers, and an operational phase focusing on engaging and equipping relevant institutions.

These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving.

Remote Sensing In Environmental Justice Research-A Review,"Weigland, Matthias",2019,"Human health is known to be affected by the physical environment. Various environmental influences have been identified to benefit or challenge people’s physical condition. Their heterogeneous distribution in space results in unequal burdens depending on the place of living. In addition, since societal groups tend to also show patterns of segregation, this leads to unequal exposures depending on social status. In this context, environmental justice research examines how certain social groups are more affected by such exposures. Yet, analyses of this per se spatial phenomenon are oftentimes criticized for using “essentially aspatial” data or methods which neglect local spatial patterns by aggregating environmental conditions over large areas. Recent technological and methodological developments in satellite remote sensing have proven to provide highly detailed information on environmental conditions. This narrative review therefore discusses known influences of the urban environment on human health and presents spatial data and applications for analyzing these influences. Furthermore, it is discussed how geographic data are used in general and in the interdisciplinary research field of environmental justice in particular. These considerations include the modifiable areal unit problem and ecological fallacy. In this review we argue that modern earth observation data can represent an important data source for research on environmental justice and health. Especially due to their high level of spatial detail and the provided large-area coverage, they allow for spatially continuous description of environmental characteristics. As a future perspective, ongoing earth observation missions, as well as processing architectures, ensure data availability and applicability of ’big earth data’ for future environmental justice analyses.",weigland_remotesensingenvironmentaljustice_2019,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
Remote Sensing For Biodiversity Monitoring: A Review Of Methods For Biodiversity Indicator Extraction And Assessment Of Progress Towards International Targets,"Petrou, Zisis",2015,"Recognizing the imperative need for biodiversity protection, the convention on biological diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets.

However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited.

Reviewing Innovative Earth Observation Solutions For Filling Science-Policy Gaps In Hydrology,"Lehmann, Anthony",2014,"Improved data sharing is needed for hydrological modeling and water management that require better integration of data, information and models. Technological advances in Earth observation and Web technologies have allowed the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) for improved data sharing at various scales.

A series of recent European projects are contributing to the promotion of innovative Earth observation solutions and the uptake of scientific outcomes in policy. Several success stories involving different hydrologists’ communities can be reported around the World. Gaps still exist in hydrological, agricultural, meteorological and climatological data access because of various issues. While many sources of data exists at all scales it remains difficult and time-consuming to assemble hydrological information for most projects. Furthermore, data and sharing formats remain very heterogeneous. Improvements require implementing/endorsing some commonly agreed standards and documenting data with adequate metadata. The brokering approach allows binding heterogeneous resources published by different data providers and adapting them to tools and interfaces commonly used by consumers of these resources. The challenge is to provide decision-makers with reliable information, based on integrated data and tools derived from both Earth observations and scientific models. Successful SDIs rely therefore on various aspects: a shared vision between all participants, necessity to solve a common problem, adequate data policies, incentives, and sufficient resources. New data streams from remote sensing or crowd sourcing are also producing valuable information to improve our understanding of the water cycle, while field sensors are developing rapidly and becoming less costly. More recent data standards are enhancing interoperability between hydrology and other scientific disciplines, while solutions exist to communicate uncertainty of data and models, which is an essential pre-requisite for decision-making. Distributed computing infrastructures can handle complex and large hydrological data and models, while Web Processing Services bring the flexibility to develop and execute simple to complex workflows over the Internet. The need for capacity building at human, infrastructure and institutional levels is also a major driver for reinforcing the commitment to SDI concepts.",lehmann_reviewinginnovativeearthobservation_2014,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

Satellite Image Analysis For Disaster And Crisis-Management Support,"Voigt, Stefan",2007,"This paper describes how multisource satellite data and efficient image analysis may successfully be used to conduct rapid-mapping tasks in the domain of disaster and crisis management support. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has set up a dedicated crosscutting service, which is the so-called ""Center for satellite-based Crisis Information"" (ZKI), to facilitate the use of its Earth-observation capacities in the service of national and international response to major disaster situations, humanitarian relief efforts, and civil security issues. This paper describes successful rapid satellite mapping campaigns supporting disaster relief and demonstrates how this technology can be used for civilian crisis-management purposes. During the last years, various international coordination bodies were established, improving the disaster-response-related cooperation within the Earth-observation community worldwide. DLR/ZKI operates in this context, closely networking with public authorities (civil security), nongovernmental organizations (humanitarian relief organizations), satellite operators, and other space agencies. This paper reflects on several of these international activities, such as the International Charter Space and Major Disasters, describes mapping procedures, and reports on rapid-mapping experiences gained during various disaster-response applications.

Satellite Observations Of No2 Indicate Legacy Impacts Of Redlining In U.s. Midwestern Cities,"Hrycyna, Elizabeth",2022,"Redlining was a practice of financial discrimination in the mid-20th century in which banks refused loans or increased interest rates based on the grade of an applicant’s neighborhood as designated by the federally sponsored Home Owner’s Lending Commission (HOLC). The HOLC primarily graded neighborhoods from “A” (best) to “D” (hazardous) based on characteristics including the racial demographics and economic status of the residents, with neighborhoods with higher percentages of non-white and/or recent immigrant residents given lower grades; this and similar discriminatory practices can be traced to modern-day economic and environmental inequalities between neighborhoods. The legacy of redlining and related housing discrimination on modern-day urban air quality, which presents a significant threat to public health, remains an important issue in addressing environmental injustice in U.S. cities. In our study, we used remotely sensed estimates of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) collected with the TROPOMI satellite sensor, and shapefiles of redlined neighborhoods, to determine whether air quality varies among historic HOLC grades in 11 U.S. Midwestern metropolitan areas. This approach allowed us to test these tools for within-city analysis of NO2 for which high spatial and temporal resolution measurements are not often available, despite their importance for monitoring impacts on human health. We found that NO2 levels were as much as 16% higher in neighborhoods that were graded “D” compared to those graded “A” (as in Chicago), with the mean difference across all cities an increase of 7.3% ± 5.9%. These results present evidence of persistent modern-day inequality in urban air quality associated with historic discriminatory policies and should be used as an argument for government action improving air quality in neighborhoods that were poorly graded by the HOLC.",hrycyna_satelliteobservationsno2legacy_2022,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

Simulating The Value Of El Nino Forecasts For The Panama Canal,"Graham, Nicholas",2006,"The Panama Canal relies on rain-fed streamflow into Gatun Lake, the canal’s primary storage facility, for operations—principally ship passage and hydropower generation. Precipitation in much of Panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and this relationship is reflected in Gatun Lake inflows. For example, the correlation coefficient between wet season (July–December) inflow and NINO3 SST is -0.53 over the period 1914–1997. Operational capabilities to predict\ntropical Pacific SSTs have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such SST forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inflows (compared with climatological expectations). Because substantial reductions in lake inflow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inflows, coupled with a method for translating that information into effective operational policy, might result in more efficient canal management. A combined simulation/optimization/assessment ‘‘virtual’’ canal system was implemented and exercised using operational El Nino forecasts over the period 1981–1998. The results show the following main points:\n(i) At current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to flow forecasts) unless flows are substantially reduced (i.e., during El Nino episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate.\n(ii) The inclusion of accurately specified levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneficial policies.\n(iii) The situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inflows are relatively high, and those where storage and inflows are relatively low. In the former case, demands can be met without the benefit of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments.\n(iv) For a nominally configured canal system, the use of operational El Nino forecasts with appropriately specified uncertainty resulted in approximately $US 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic climatological forecasts.",graham_simulatingelninoforecasts_2006,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,not satellite specifically

It was organized by these three organizations, and by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Twenty-five experts from America, Europe and Australia have gathered in Ispra to present their experience in the field of the evaluation of the benefits from Earth Observations obtained by in-situ, remote and the new citizen’s sensors. The discussion was based on the outcomes of two previous workshops held in 2010 on the same issue, in US and in Europe. The background section presents the rationale behind the need of understanding the benefits Earth Observations, supported by several initiatives at the continental (e.g. INSPIRE Directive in Europe) and at the global (e.g. GEOSS) level. The aim of the workshop, described in the second section of this document, was to support the development of international capabilities to determine, quantify and document the socioeconomic benefits from EO and their use, and to jointly develop a programme of activities to be followed in the next few years by the research group. The foreseen activities of the programme were the consolidation of the body of literature in the field, the collection and analysis of suitable methodologies to assess Earth Observations’ benefits, and of evidence of benefits from existing case studies, the development of appropriate outreach initiatives, the strengthening of the existing community of researchers and the link with other communities of scientists, to set up multidisciplinary studies. To this aim, each participant brought his/her own experience in the analysing and assessing the impacts of Earth Observation in their own field of research, generating an interesting list of multifaceted examples and case studies in which the same problem is analysed from different perspectives. Section 3 contains a summary of each presentation, which gave the elements for the subsequent discussion among experts, leading to the preliminary programme of activities.

Spatio-Temporal Design For A Water Quality Monitoring Network Maximizing The Economic Value Of Information To Optimize The Detection Of Accidental Pollution,"Destandau, Francois",2020,"The reduction of damage due to water pollution requires good knowledge of the quality of surfacewaters. The Water Quality Monitoring Networks (WQMNs) have evolved over time according to the objectives of each one of them: knowledge of long-term quality evolution, search for the origin of pollution, detection of accidental pollution, etc. Information provided by WQMNs could be improved by a spatial approach, optimizing the location or the number of monitoring stations, or by a temporal approach, optimizing the sampling frequency. However, there is a cost for monitoring water quality.\nIn this article, we show, for the first time, how the estimation of the Economic Value of Information (EVOI) can be used to determine the spatio-temporal design of the network.

"Supporting Better Decisions Across The Nexus Of Water, Energy And Food Through Earth Observation Data: Case Of The Zambezi Basin","Gomo, Fortune",2018,"The water–energy–food (WEF) nexus has been promoted in recent years as an intersectional concept designed to improve planning and regulatory decision-making across the three sectors. The production and consumption of water, energy and food resources are inextricably linked across multiple spatial scales (from the global to the local), but a common feature is competition for land which through different land management practices mediates provisioning ecosystem services. The nexus perspective seeks to understand the interlinkages and use systems-based thinking to frame management options for the present and the future. It aims to highlight advantage and minimise damaging and unsustainable outcomes through informed decisions regarding trade-offs inclusive of economic, ecological and equity considerations. Operationalizing the WEF approach is difficult because of the lack of complete data, knowledge and observability – and the nature of the challenge also depends on the scale of the investigation. Transboundary river basins are particularly challenging because whilst the basin unit defines the hydrological system this is not necessarily coincident with flows of food and energy. There are multiple national jurisdictions and geopolitical relations to consider. Land use changes have a profound influence on hydrological, agricultural, energy provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Future policy decisions in the water, energy and food sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land and water resources, intensifying competition for these resources in the future. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyse the land cover changes in the Zambezi river basin (1.4 million km2) from 1992 to 2015 using the European Space Agency annual global land cover dataset. Early results indicate transformative processes are underway with significant shifts from tree cover to cropland, with a 4.6 % loss in tree cover and a 16 % gain in cropland during the study period. The changes were found to be occurring mainly in the eastern (Malawi and Mozambique) and southern (Zimbabwe and southern Zambia) parts of the basin. The area under urban land uses was found to have more than doubled during the study period gearing urban centres increasingly as the foci for resource consumption. These preliminary findings are the first step in understanding the spatial and temporal interlinkages of water, energy and food by providing reliable and consistent evidence spanning the local, regional, national and whole transboundary basin scale.",gomo_supportingdecisionsnexuswater_2018,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
The Value Of Short-Run Climate Forecasts In Managing The Coastal Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus Kisutch) Fishery In Washington State,"Kaje, Janne",2008,"In recent years our understanding of the intricate connections between climate variability, marine and freshwater environmental conditions and the responses of fish stocks has improved considerably. With predictable relationships between the environment and stock abundance, fishery managers should be able to forecast variation in stock survival and recruitment. Such forecasts present an opportunity for increasing the economic value of fisheries and for achieving other management objectives, such as stock conservation and maintenance of population diversity. After describing a 4-step framework for addressing the question ‘What is a forecast worth?’ in a fishery decision-making context, we introduce the management system for Washington's coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fishery. Then we apply the 4-step framework to estimate the value of improved run size forecasts in the annual harvest management of coho salmon in Washington State. Our principal analytical tool is a stochastic simulation model that incorporates the main characteristics of the fishery. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and constraints to the use of climate-based forecasts in fishery management on various spatial and temporal scales, and we consider the challenges associated with forecasting variations in fish stock size caused by shifts in climate and related ocean conditions.",kaje_shortrunclimateforecasts_2008,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

The Economic Value Of Seasonal Forecasts: Stochastic Economywide Analysis For East Africa,"Rodrigues, Joao",2016,"There is growing interest within the climate change and development community in using seasonal forecast information to reduce the losses to agriculture resulting from climate variability, especially within food-insecure countries. However, forecast systems are expensive to establish and maintain, and therefore, gauging the potential economic return to investments in forecast systems is crucial. Most studies that evaluate seasonal forecasts focus on developed countries and/or overlook agriculture’s economywide linkages. Yet forecasts may be more valuable in developing regions such as East Africa, where climate is variable and agriculture has macroeconomic importance. We use computable general equilibrium and process-based crop models to estimate the potential economywide value of national seasonal forecast systems in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. Stochastic seasonal simulations produce value distributions for forecasts of varying accuracy and varying levels of farm coverage. A timely and accurate forecast adopted by all farmers generates average regional income gains of US$113 million per year. Gains are much higher during extreme climate events and are generally pro-poor. The forecast value falls when forecast skill and farm coverage decline. National economic and trading structures, including the importance of agricultural exports, are found to be major determinants of forecast value.

The 10-Year Implementation Plan defines a vision statement for GEOSS, its purpose and scope, expected benefits for nine “Societal Benefit Areas” (SBAs) (disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity), technical and capacity building priorities, and the GEO governance structure. The full value of GEOSS lies in its ability to integrate information across disciplines. Thus, GEOSS is concerned with: interlinking weather forecasting systems with other Earth observation systems; supporting efforts to advance sustainable energy; and devising end-to-end information services and sustained observing systems essential for addressing climate variability and change. The international collaborative framework of GEO allows: water experts to define the data and systems needed for improved water-cycle forecasting; international teams to monitor ecosystems and generate maps and other decision support tools; development of an Agricultural Monitoring System of Systems that will integrate in-situ and space data from multiple fields; and comprehensive monitoring critical to the conservation and sustainable use of the world’s biological diversity. In particular, in the field of water, unique regional cooperative approaches are now on-going and under planning for making maximum use of, and contributing to, GEOSS. The current GEO Work Plan furnishes the blueprint for activities to implement GEOSS, and provides concrete examples of how decision makers can use the data and services available through GEOSS to address major global opportunities and challenges. This is why GEO strives to develop a GEOSS that would serve the needs of all SBAs through interconnecting existing and future Earth observation systems, interlinking observation systems, and promotion of open data sharing.",koike_globalearthobservationsystem_2010,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

The Role Of Geoscience Information In Reducing Catastrophic Loss Using A Web-Based Economics Experiment,"Bernkopf, Richard",2003,"What role can geoscience information play in the assessment of risk and the value of insurance, especially for natural hazard type risks? In an earlier, related paper Ganderton and others (2000) provided subjects with relatively simple geoscience information concerning natural hazard-type risks. Their research looked at how subjects purchase insurance when faced with relatively low probability but high loss risks of the kind that characterize natural hazards and now, increasingly, manmade disasters. They found evidence to support the expected utility theory (definitions of economics terms can be found in a glossary at the end of report), yet there remained the implication that subjects with excessive aversion to risk were willing to pay considerably more for insurance than the actuarially fair price plus any reasonable risk premium. Here, we report the results of additional experiments that provide further support for the basic postulates of expected utility theory. However, these new experiments add considerably to the decision environment facing subjects by offering an option to purchase geoscientific information that would assist them when calculating expected losses from hazards more accurately.\n\nUsing an Internet-based mechanism to present information and gather data in an experimental setting, this research provided subjects with considerable textual and graphical information, and time to process it. Over a period of three months, almost 400 subjects participated in on-line experiments that generated approximately 22,000 usable data points for the empirical analysis discussed in this report.\n\nIn the design of the experiment, we modeled the decisions to purchase (1) a detailed map giving subjects more information regarding the distribution of losses from a hazard and (2) insurance to indemnify them from any losses should they occur. On the basis of this design, we find strong evidence in support of the expected utility theory. Many of the findings reinforce those found in the early, similar study (Ganderton and others, 2000). However, this research also finds interactions between the decision to become better informed and the decision to insure. We chose an empirical framework that allows for both explicit and implicit (unobservable) correlations between the two decisions. The results suggest that at the end of the computer game subjects recognize the benefits of greater geoscience information. They take advantage of it, but are sensitive to its cost. When subjects use the more detailed information, they are more likely to purchase insurance when it offers a net benefit.",bernkopf_rolegeoscienceinformationreducing_2003,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"Econ experimental setting where players can buy insurance to cover potential losses, based on more or less detailed map of risk of loss"
The Value Of Earth Observation For Managing The Great Barrier Reef,"Bouma, Jetske A.",2009,"Effective decision-making requires information, but how much information is enough and how much money should be invested in additional information is often unclear. This paper attempts to assess the economic benefits of informational investments, specifically of investments in Earth Observation (EO) for managing the Great Barrier Reef. We develop an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the expected contribution of informational investments to decision-making. We hypothesize that EO can improve decision-making by allowing for better-targeted emission reduction measures in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. For assessing the benefits (cost savings) of improved targeting we develop a model to optimize emission reductions under different states: emissions from all catchments may affect reef quality, or emissions from certain catchments may affect reef quality more. The states reflect the current uncertainties relating to water quality management in the region. The analysis suggests that the expected benefits of EO information for managing the GBR can be substantial, and depend on the perceived accuracy of EO information and on decision-makers prior beliefs.",bouma_earthobservationmanagingbarrier_2009,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"voi/bayesian decision theory, elicited decision maker perceptions of value - marine conservation, great barrier reef"
The Value Of El Nino Forecasts In The Management Of Salmon: A Stochastic Dynamic Assessment,"Costello, Christopher",2020,"The El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest source of interannual variability in global climate. Variability in climate has been linked to variability in fisheries, specifically salmon stocks of the Pacific Northwest. The ability to forecast El Niño events already exists and is likely to improve in coming years. An accurate prediction may have value because it allows for better management decisions. In this article, we develop a bioeconomic model of the coho salmon fishery and derive the value of information from improved El Niño forecasting ability. We find that a perfect El Niño forecast results in an annual welfare gain of approximately $1 million, while imperfect forecasts lead to smaller gains. Results also suggest that optimal management in the face of uncertainty involves a “conservative” management strategy, resulting in lower harvest, higher wild fish escapement, and lower hatchery releases than management in the absence of such uncertainty.",costello_elninoforecastsmanagement_2020,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,not satellite specifically

Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies.

The Value Of Ocean Surface Wind Information For Maritime Commerce,"Kite-Powell, Hauke",2011,"Observations, nowcasts, and forecasts of ocean surface wind conditions are of economic value to activities such as maritime transportation, commercial fishing, offshore energy, recreational boating, and search and rescue. In this paper, we estimate the value to the maritime shipping industry of ocean surface wind information and of wind and wave condition forecasts based on this information. Commercial ships transiting the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans are exposed to severe wind and wave conditions associated with extratropical storms. These storms impose costs on maritime commerce by delaying and sometimes damaging vessels or causing loss of cargo. Ocean surface wind information allows ships to limit their exposure to these conditions. We estimate that average expected annual losses to container shipping (lost containers and associated damage to vessels) in the absence of good information about extratropical storm conditions would be on the order of $250 million/year in the North Pacific and $120 million/year in the North Atlantic, and we estimate average expected annual losses to bulk shipping operations from extratropical storm exposure in these regions to be on the order of $150 million/year. A significant fraction of this risk can be avoided with ocean surface vector wind observations and forecasts. Our model results suggest that the QuikSCAT information (available until November 2009) and associated forecasts enabled a reduction in annual exposure for shipping traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific of about 50%, with total annual net savings around $150 million. The estimate of annual benefits to shipping operations from a hypothetical improved satellite instrument is around $200 million.",kitepowell_oceansurfacewindinformation_2011,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,hypothetical satellite

The Benefits And Challenges Of Having An Open And Free Basis Satellite Data Sharing Platform In Turkey: Gezgin,"Deveci, Husne S.",2016,"Turkey is a county that experiences rapid socioeconomic development, which, in turn, leads to high urbanization rates due to migration of people from rural to urban areas, many large-scale development projects (e.g. highways, dams, housing and infrastructure), and environmental problems that adversely affect agriculture, such as soil erosion and deforestation. Furthermore, Turkey lies in a region prone to natural disasters, especially earthquakes, landslides, flooding and forest fires. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires continuous monitoring to enable rapid response as well as the development of effective socioeconomic policies. In this regard, space-based earth observation (EO) systems play a critical role in the rapid acquisiton and extraction of crucial information. The first launch of the first Turkish-designed satellite, RASAT, in 2011 led to the wide-spread exploitation of space-based resources by Turkish institutions through the dissemination of EO data on an open and free basis via the GEZGIN internet portal (http://www.gezgin.gov.tr). The push for data sharing was further instigated by the nationally funded project GEOPORTAL (Satellite Image Processing and Geoportal Development Project) and European Union FP7 project EOPOWER (Earth Observation for Economic Empowerment), which strove to create conditions for sustainable economic development through the increased use of Earth observation products and services for environmental applications.

The Benefits To Mexican Agriculture Of An El Nino-Southern Oscillation (Enso) Early Warning System,"Adams, Richard",2002,"Weather agencies worldwide are attempting to determine if systematic disturbances in climate, such as the El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO), can be detected far enough in advance so that decisions can be altered to better accommodate these disturbances. Mexico is one country where ENSO related climatic disturbances have been observed. If climate forecasters were able to disseminate information on upcoming ENSO-induced weather patterns with sufficient lead time, Mexican farmers could adjust by altering a variety of crop decisions, such as growing less (or more) water consumptive crops, planting drought resistant varieties, or altering planting times. This could have a positive impact on crop production, enhancing food security, farmers’ incomes, and social welfare. The purpose of this paper is to value such forecasts in a Mexican agricultural setting. \n\nTo assess the economic consequences of climate arising from various ENSO phases, estimates of regional crop yield sensitivity for key crops were modeled using a crop biophysical simulator. The value of a forecast is then measured by the expected increase in economic benefits due to changes in cropping patterns, production and consumption arising from the yield changes under each ENSO phase forecast. These economic estimates are derived from an economic model of Mexican agriculture. The value of the ENSO information will depend on its accuracy in terms of predictions of the weather consequences of each phase.\n\nThe economic model is a stochastic, price endogenous, mathematical programming model that represents agronomic and economic conditions in a five-state Mexican region. This model depicts agricultural behavior across the three ENSO phases and provides the basis for calculating the value of information. The benefits of an ENSO early warning system for Mexico is approximately US$ 10 million annually, based on a 51-year time period of ENSO frequencies and when a forecast skill of 70% is assumed. This value translates into an internal rate of return for such an early warning system of approximately 30%. The values for higher skill levels are correspondingly higher. The values estimated here should be viewed as lower bound estimates of the value of an ENSO early warning system because benefits are not estimated for other parts of Mexican agriculture, such as non commercial (subsistence) agricultural areas, areas where there is only a weak ENSO signal that is not very predictable, and the livestock sector. Also, benefits here do not include benefits that could occur with adjustments in energy generation, water management, or any other economic sectors that may be positively affected by the existence of an ENSO early warning system.\n",adams_benefitsmexicanagricultureel_2002,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,not satellite specifically

The Economic Value Of Drought Information For Water Management Under Climate Change: A Case Study In The Ebro Basin,"Quiroga, Sonia",2011,"Drought events in the Mediterranean are likely to increase in frequency, duration and intensity due to climate change, thereby affecting crop production. Information about drought is valuable for river basin authorities and the farmers affected by their decisions. The economic value of this information and the resulting decisions are of interest to these two stakeholder groups and to the information providers. Understanding the dynamics of extreme events, including droughts, in future climate scenarios for the Mediterranean is being improved continuously. This paper analyses the economic value of information on drought events taking into account the risk aversion of water managers. We consider the effects of drought management plans on rice production in the Ebro river basin. This enables us to compute the willingness to compensate the river basin authority for more accurate information allowing for better decision-making. If runoff is reduced, river basin planners can consider the reduction of water allocation for irrigation in order to eliminate the risk of water scarcity. Alternately, river basin planners may decide to maintain water allocation and accept a reduction of water supply reliability, leaving farmers exposed to drought events. These two alternatives offer different risk levels for crop production and farmers’ incomes which determine the value of this information to the river basin authority. The information is relevant for the revision of River Basin Management Plans of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) within the context of climate change.",quiroga_economicdroughtinformationwater_2011,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,NA

In this paper we: (a) provide a review of previous research on the economic value of geological information and other earth observations as well as related products, services and infrastructure; and (b) identify important lessons from this work as well as methodological challenges that require increased attention in future research. The review of prior research shows significant economic benefits attached to the generation of this type of public information. The value of geological information has typically been measured in terms of avoided costs. Still, it is difficult to compare results across studies since they differ in scope and make alternative assumptions concerning which sectors to cover. Furthermore, previous research is not uniform in their treatment of potential (rather than only existing) users, and employ varying conceptions of avoided costs. The paper concludes that future research should devote more attention to the public and experience good characteristics of this type of information, thus highlighting the preconditions for information adoption as well as addressing the role of potential users.

The Evolution Of Earth Observation Satellites In Europe And Its Impact On The Performance Of Emergency Response Services,"Denis, Gil",2016,"The paper reviews the evolution of Earth Observation systems in Europe and Worldwide and analyses the potential impact of their performance in support of emergency response services. Earth Observation satellites play already a significant role in supporting the action of first responders in case of major disasters. The main principle is the coordinated use of satellites in order to ensure a rapid response and the timely delivery of images and geospatial information of the area affected by the event. The first part of the paper reviews the main instruments and evaluates their current performance.\nThe International Charter “Space and Major Disasters”, signed in October 2000, was the first international initiative aimed at establishing a unified system for the acquisition of space data. The charter is a cooperation agreement between space agencies and operators of space systems. At regional level, a similar instrument exists in Asia: Sentinel-Asia. In the frame of the European programme Copernicus, the emergency management service was launched in 2009. Geo-information products derived from space imagery are delivered during all phases of the emergency management cycle, in either rush or non-rush mode, free of charge for the users. In both cases, the capacities were historically drawn from national missions, funded with public money and directly operated by the space agencies or by national operators. \nThe paper focuses on the performance of the space infrastructure (satellites and ground segments). Several trends may have a significant impact on the current performance: \n– The increasing number of space systems which are privately-owned and managed by commercial operators.\n– The emergence in Europe of shared-ownership or community-owned systems. Copernicus Sentinel missions (Copernicus) or Eumetsat satellites are two typical examples. – The development of dual-use capacities and the sovereignty dimension of these systems. \n– The development of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications.\n– The development of social media and crowd-based initiatives for humanitarian aid and emergency response.\n– Possible disruptions, such as large LEO constellations or GEO infrastructures enabling persistent observation. \nA common feature is the increased number of information sources and the higher real time dimension.",denis_evolutionearthobservationsatellites_2016,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

The Socioeconomic Value Of Climate And Weather Forecasting: A Review,"Mjelde, James",1989,"This paper examines the complex nature of the process of economically valuing climate/weather forecasts. A discussion of both micro- (producer) and sector (market) economic issues is obtained through a review of previous studies. Integration of these issues is necessary to obtain the overall value of current or improved climate/weather forecasts. Previous studies have predominantly been concerned with valuing climate/weather forecasts at the producer level. By considering only producer level effects, the estimates of the value of climate/weather forecasts ignore market adjustments. Potential biases caused by ignoring these adjustments are illustrated.",mjelde_socioeconomicclimateweatherforecasting_1989,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA

The Value Of Climate Information When Farm Programs Matter,"Cabrera, Victor",2006,"Predictability of seasonal climate variations associated with ENSO suggests a potential to reduce farm risk by tailoring agricultural management strategies to mitigate the impacts of adverse conditions or to take advantage of favorable conditions. Federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information. A representative peanut–cotton–corn non-irrigated North Florida farm was used to estimate the value of the ENSO-based climate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of climate, prices, and risk aversion levels. Yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, first, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain outcomes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs. Results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when La Niña or El Niño ENSO phases are forecast. Highly risk averse farmers could benefit from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (offensive responses). The inclusion of Commodity Loan Programs (CLP) and Crop Insurance Programs (CIP) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels. However, more risk averse farmers could still benefit moderately from El Niño and marginally from La Niña forecasts when they participate in CLP and CIP.",cabrera_climateinformationfarmprograms_2006,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,not satellite specifically

Uncertainty And Risk In Wildland Fire Management: A Review,"Thompson, Matthew",2011,"Wildland fire management is subject to manifold sources of uncertainty. Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources. Our findings echo earlier literature identifying wildfire effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildfire risk assessment and wildfire management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them.

Using Satellite Data To Fill The Gaps In The Us Air Pollution Monitoring Network,"Sullivan, Daniel",2018,"Compliance with the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is determined at the county level using local air pollution monitors. However, the vast majority of counties have zero or one monitor, and air pollution concentrations can vary dramatically over short distances. In addition, recent evidence suggests monitor placement may be skewed to make NAAQS compliance easier. As a result, the network of air pollution monitors may not detect all areas with pollution levels that exceed the NAAQS. This paper explores this possibility using satellite-derived data on fine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) to assess NAAQS compliance for the continental United States at a 1 kilometer (km) resolution. We compare the satellite-based assessments with official attainment designations made by the terrestrial monitor network and calculate the number of people living in “misclassified” areas—areas with PM2.5 levels that exceed the NAAQS but are classified as being in attainment based on the ground monitors and the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) official determination. We estimate that about 24.4 million people are living in these misclassified areas— about as many as are living in properly classified nonattainment areas—and that if such areas had sped up their PM2.5 reductions as much as nonattainment areas did, 5,452 premature deaths would have been avoided, a welfare gain to society of $49 billion.",sullivan_satellitedatafillgaps_2018,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"satellite data vs. official determinations of attainment of pm2.5 standards - difference in difference design, estimates impact of misclassification or premature deaths"

Value And Validity Of Earth Resources Observations From Space,"Robinove, Charles",1973,"Observations of the earth from space can provide overall repetitive views in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Data from such surveys can be used as the basis for more detailed observations from aircraft and on the ground to guide resource exploration, development, and conservation activities. The value of earth resource observations from space has been demonstrated by the practical use ofphotographs from the Gemini and Apollo spaceflights and particularly by a series of multispectral photographs taken during the flight of Apollo 9. The analysis of those photographs has shown that the performance of the planned Earth Resources Technology Satellite will meet the needs of the resource and environmental community for small-scale repetitive images of the earth in the visible and solar infrared portions of the spectrum and has provided a limited base of material for earth scientists to work with in order to ready themselves for the ERTS data. The validity of earth resource observations from space can be derived by analogy from the successively closer observations of the moon, culminating in repeated physical sampling of the moon's surface. The method of inductive reasoning and analysis used for the moon is the opposite of the normal deductive analysis used on the earth.

Value Of Information For Climate Observing Systems,"Cooke, Roger",2014,"The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions. The difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems is the VOI of the new observing system relative to the existing system.

Using simulations, we estimate the expected value of seasonal climate information under alternative assumptions about (a) land tenure (ownership vs. short-term leases) and (b) the decision maker’s objective function (expected utility vs. prospect theory value function maximization), employing a full range of plausible parameter values for each objective function. This allows us to show the extent to which the value of information depends on risk preferences, loss aversion, wealth levels and expectations, as well as situational constraints. Our results demonstrate in a non-laboratory decision context that, in some cases, psychologically plausible deviations from expected utility maximization can lead to substantial differences in estimates of the expected value of climate forecasts.

Valuing User Preferences For Geospatial Fire Monitoring In Guatemala,"Berenter, Jared",2021,"Like many landscapes across Central America, forests in Guatemala’s Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) are increasingly susceptible to forest fire, with most forest fires resulting from untended agricultural fires. Fire damage poses significant risk to the MBR’s natural resources and cultural heritage, but budget challenges limit the capacity of national, regional, and local institutions to effectively detect, monitor, and control forest fires. The Geospatial Information System for Fire Management (SIGMA-I) is a United States government-subsidized suite of geospatial fire management tools that are widely disseminated, free of charge, to land managers and other users in Guatemala for on-the-ground fire prevention and response. Provision of SIGMA-I geospatial data and tools such as daily thermal “hotspot” maps provide positive benefits for sustainable fire management. However, little research exists supporting the nonmarket monetary value of geospatial fire monitoring tools and their component features. We used a choice experiment to estimate land managers’ willingness to pay for individual attributes of SIGMA-I hotspot mapping in Guatemala. We found quantitative evidence of positive willingness to pay for geospatial data, demonstrating positive nonmarket value of geospatial data for sustainable fire management in developing countries and regions where agricultural fires are common. Our results indicate strong preferences from Guatemala’s forest fire management community for improving the frequency of hotspot reporting and reducing detection of erroneous hotspots. As the availability of geospatial data increases, use of tools like SIGMA-I has the potential to significantly improve fire management, especially in regions where funding and resources for fire management are scarce.

Valuing Weather Observation Systems For Forest Fire Management,"Khabarov, Nikolay",2008,"Weather information is an integral part of modern fire management systems. In this paper, we investigate, by means of simulation studies, how improvements in the weather observation systems help to reduce burned area by targeting and monitoring places ripe fires are likely to occur. In our model, the air patrolling schedule is determined by the Nesterov index, which is calculated from observed weather data. We use two weather data sets based on ldquoroughrdquo and ldquofinerdquo grids. The reduction of the total burned area, associated with an air patrolling schedule based on the ldquofinerdquo grid, indicates the benefits of using better weather observations. We, also, consider a stochastic model to simulate forest fires and explore the sensitivity of the model with respect to the quality of input data. Finally, we investigate the system of systems effect. We find the largest marginal improvement from the rough grid results when we increase the quality of observations in most critical areas.",khabarov_valuingweatherobservationsystems_2008,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,voi/bayesian based on reduction in burned areas based on either coarse or fine resolution weather data.  not satellite data - aerial patrols - but can be generalized
Visual Evidence From Above: Assessing The Value Of Earth Observation Satellites For Supporting Human Rights,"Notley, Tanya",2016,"Public access to data collected by remote sensing Earth Observation Satellites has, until recently, been very limited. Now, citizens and rights advocacy groups are increasingly utilising satellite-collected images to interrogate justice issues; to document, prevent and verify rights abuses; and to imagine and propose social change. Yet while other communication technologies have received substantial critical analysis regarding their value as tools of social justice, activism and resistance, satellites have received comparatively scant attention. This article examines the uses of satellite-collected images in human rights contexts including the opportunities, challenges and risks they pose. We conclude this examination by arguing that if satellites are to be used effectively to collect evidence from above by rights advocates, greater attention to and capacity for ensuring accountability from below is required.",notley_visualevidenceassessingearth_2016,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"qualitative research approach - critical analysis, interviews, case studies of satellite images in human rights contexts.  doesn't quite ""measure"" the value, but connects specific aspects of justice to eo data"
"Weather Impacts On Natural, Social And Economic Systems","Flechsig, Michael",2000,"The EU project Weather Impacts on Natural, Social and Economic Systems (WISE) has analysed impacts of current climate variability to evaluate the sensitivity of today's society to extreme weather. Unlike studies of anticipated impacts of climate change, WISE did not rely on scenarios and projections, but on existing and newly collected data. The research involved (i) the statistical modelling of meteorological and sectoral time series, aimed at quantifying the impacts of changing weather variables on sector output, (ii) a population survey, aimed at investigating public perception of and behavioural response to unusually hot and dry summers and mild winters, and (iii) a management survey, aimed at obtaining insight into managers' awareness and perception of the importance of extreme weather on their operations. The three activities revealed a wealth of data and information, providing relevant insights into Germany's sensitivity to and perception of extreme weather events. Sectors that were analysed included agriculture, outdoor fire, water supply, human health, electricity and gas consumption and tourism. It appears from the statistical modelling that extreme weather can have impressive impacts on all sectors, especially when expressed in monetary terms. However, weather variability is generally considered a manageable risk, to which sectors in Germany appear reasonably well-adapted. The population and management surveys reveal both positive and negative impacts of extreme weather. People generally respond to these impacts by adjusting their activities. The utilities (electricity, gas and water) indicate that they are robsut to the current level of weather variability and do not consider climate change an important threat to their operations. The tourism sector experiences impacts but typically takes a reactive approach to adaptation, although it is also developing weather-insensitive products.",flechsig_weatherimpactsnaturalsocial_2000,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,survey of individuals and managers
Weather Satellites And The Economic Value Of Forecasts: Evidence From The Electric Power Industry,"Hertzfeld, Henry",2004,"Data from weather satellites have become integral to the weather forecast process in the United States and abroad. Satellite data are used to derive improved forecasts for short-term routine weather, long-term climate change, and for predicting natural disasters. The resulting forecasts have saved lives, reduced weather-related economic losses, and improved the quality of life. Weather information routinely assists in managing resources more e0ciently and reducing industrial operating costs. The electric energy industry in particular makes extensive use of weather information supplied by both government and commercial suppliers. Through direct purchases of weather data and information, and through participating in the increasing market for weather derivatives, this sector provides measurable indicators of the economic importance of weather information. Space weather in the form of magnetic disturbances caused by coronal mass ejections from the sun creates geomagnetically induced currents that disturb the electric power grid, sometimes causing signi4cant economic impacts on electric power distribution. This paper examines the use of space-derived weather information on the U.S. electric power industry. It also explores issues that may impair the most optimum use of the information and reviews the longer-term opportunities for employing weather data acquired from satellites in future commercial and government activity.",hertzfeld_weathersatelliteseconomicforecasts_2004,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
Weather Service Chain Analysis (Wsca) - An Approach For Appraisal Of The Social-Economic Benefits Of Improvements In Weather Services,"Perrels, Adriaan",2012,"The so-called Cost-Loss approach for the assessment of the economic benefits of weather forecasts is less suitable for assessing the benefits for user groups among which uncertainty about the uptake and utilization of the information is significant. Most road users can be counted to these groups. Assessment of the benefits of (improvements in) weather services for road users faces several attribution problems which may entail both over- and underestimation of these benefits. In FMI an approach has been developed which aims to account for these uncertainties by means of decomposition of the information flow ranging from forecast generation to benefit realization, i.e. so-called weather service chain analysis (WCSA). This approach can be used both in a quantitative and in a qualitative fashion. The qualitative version is meant to support information management and to identify improvement options in each section of the weather service chain. In the quantitative version the product sum of ratings per step (compared to the maximum score) is established. The quantitative version helps to identify those segments of the chain for which improvements will have the highest social-economic pay-off. It also helps to identify actions that raise the leverage of investments in weather forecast improvement. The WSCA method can be embedded in the economic modelling of particular sectors, such as (road) transport. WSCA also incites to develop regular surveying of user groups and weather service use. The paper will discuss the principles of the method and its links to economic models, as well as show a few applications for road transport.",perrels_weatherservicechainanalysis_2012,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
Web-Based Decision Support System Tools: The Soil And Water Assessment Tool Online Visualization And Analyses (Swatonline) And Nasa Earth Observation Data Downloading And Reformatting Tool,"McDonald, Spencer",2019,"The current influx of climate related information required scientists to communicate their findings to decision makers in governments, disaster preparedness organizations, and the general public. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a powerful modelling tool that allows scientists to simulate many of the physical processes involved in the water cycle. This article presents the design, methods and development efforts to overcome some of the limitations of the previously developed SWAT visualization software programs by creating a set of modular web applications that can be duplicated, customized, and run. Moreover, this article features a web application development tool for climate data retrieval. The NASAaccess fetches, extracts and reformats climate data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration servers and outputs data compatible with hydrological models. This work has the potential to increase the SWAT's model impact on non-technically trained stakeholders and decision makers charged with water and climate management.",mcdonald_webbaseddecisionsupport_2019,FALSE,soc_ben_repo,NA
What Is The Economic Value Of Satellite Imagery?,"Raunikar, Ronald",2013,"Does remote-sensing information, such as that from Landsat and similar Earth-observing satellites, provide economic benefits to society, and can this value be estimated? Using satellite data for northeastern Iowa, U.S. Geological Survey scientists modeled the relations among land uses, agricultural production, and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers. They demonstrated that information from such modeling can allow more efficient management of agricultural production without sacrificing groundwater quality. Just for northeastern Iowa, the value of such remote-sensing information was shown to be as much as $858 million ± $197 million per year, which corresponds to a current value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits into the foreseeable future.",raunikar_economicsatelliteimagery_2013,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,"voi/bayesian decision theory - agricultural production and groundwater quality via nitrate loading, with and without high-quality info from satellite imagery"
Willingness To Pay For Soil Information Derived By Digital Maps: A Choice Experiment Approach,"Diafas, Iason",2012,"Soil surveys and the information they provide are commonly believed to be good investment, with significant benefits accrued to their users. To date, the empirical evidence for this comes from studies that have shown how enhanced soil information can alter agricultural practices to yield higher returns. This study attempts to estimate the economic value of soil information generated by a host of new proximal and in situ geophysical methods for the assessment of the following soil properties: carbon content, water content, clay content, bulk density, and soil depth. The study also adopts a novel approach to the economic valuation of soil information by employing for the first time a choice experiment to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of potential users of the digital maps and their features. The choice experiment took the form of an online survey, administered to about a thousand individuals from the wider soil community. The results reveal significant WTP for maps of high resolution and accuracy that offer map interpretation in addition to a number of soil properties.",diafas_willingnesspaysoilinformation_2012,TRUE,soc_ben_repo,not satellite
