### Screening Process

Application of the search string (see SI Methods and Fig. S1) to Scopus and Web of Science databases, combined with references from an existing curated library of ESI valuation literature (Societal Benefits Library, SBL) (USGS 2024 !!!REF), yielded 28,331 records.  Pre-screening eliminated conference abstracts, spurious matches, duplicates, and incomplete records, narrowing the corpus to 13,823 unique citations (Fig. 1, Fig. S2).  The unique citations were then screened according to the following criteria: 1) the study made substantive use of ESI; 2) ESI was applied in a decision context; 3) the predicted or realized outcome of an ESI-based decision was compared to that under an alternative information set; and 4) the difference in outcome was presented in terms of some societal benefit. Reviews were excluded as they do not present original data. After pre-screening, the full SBL and an additional 1,072 randomly-sampled documents were manually screened by the team and used as a training set to inform a machine-learning classifier model on the remaining 12,493 citations, resulting in 2,287 predicted "includes" and 10,206 predicted "excludes."  All predicted "includes" and a random sample of 200 predicted "excludes" then went through a title/abstract screening process.  Of the 13,823 unique citations, 770 documents sufficiently met the title/abstract screening and were included in full text screening.  Full text screening resulted in 170 documents that met all criteria (Fig. 1, Fig. S2).  All title/abstract screening was performed in the Colandr web-based machine-learning assisted screening app [@cheng_usingmachine_2018].  Full text screening was performed using Zotero reference management software.  The final list of 170 documents included in our study is listed in the supporting information (Table SXXX).

### Valuation Methods

Nearly a third (54 studies) of the 170 included documents applied more than one information valuation method, with a total of 224 instances of valuation methods being observed (Fig. 2; see Table S2 for operational definitions used to categorize valuation methods).  The most common approaches to assessing societal benefits of ESI in the literature were quantitative economic approaches grounded in decision analysis: Value of Information (VOI) framework (n = 81; 48% of papers) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) (n = 33; 19%) (Fig. 2). Applied qualitative or subjective methods were also frequently observed, including surveys of preference assessments (n = 26; 15%) and semi-structured or in-depth interviews (n = 23; 14%). Deliberative and consensus-based approaches were rare (n = 3 and 1 studies, respectively). Methods based on decision analysis (n = 144) were more frequently observed than methods based on preference elicitation (n = 80) (See Table S2 for categorization of methods as decision analysis vs. preference elicitation).

> Figure 2. Number of valuation methods observed across included studies. Some studies applied multiple methods for valuation, thus the total number of observed methods (224) exceeds the total number of included studies (170). Color indicates value types assessed: instrumental, i.e., means to an end, including both monetary and non-monetary outcomes, and relational, i.e., deriving from meaningful and often reciprocal relationships among people, nature, and society (see Table S1).

Included studies most commonly measured societal benefits in terms of monetary instrumental value (e.g., improved profit) (n = 152) and/or non-monetary instrumental value (e.g., pollution reduction, lives saved) (n = 63), with many studies accounting for multiple instrumental metrics simultaneously (e.g., reduced crop pesticide application and the associated increase in profit; see Table S1 for definitions and examples). Studies that measured societal benefits in terms of relational value (e.g., connection with land, poverty alleviation, social justice, knowledge transfer among community, Table S1) were far less common in the literature (n = 21) and were more frequently assessed using qualitative preference elicitation methods, especially surveys, interviews, and focus groups.  Studies rarely focused exclusively on outcomes associated with relational value, but typically examined relational value alongside instrumental value; for example, recreational fishing both as a pastime and as an economic activity [@wieand_bayesianmethodology_2008].  No papers in our study described decision outcomes in intrinsic terms such as the moral right of non-human species to exist in peace; one paper [@bernknopf_earthobservations_2021] examined potential for ESI to inform regulation to reduce fatal ship strikes of blue whales, but the authors focused on decision outcomes based on compliance with conservation policy, an instrumental goal. 

Most studies in our corpus (n = 116) applied only a single method for valuing ESI.  Studies that we identified as implementing multiple methods (n = 54) most commonly combined two decision analysis-based methods, particularly VOI with CBA (n = 12 of the 54 studies) (Fig. 3). For example, Fritz et al. [-@fritz_conceptualframework_2008] applied the counterfactual framework of VOI to estimate benefit, then modeled marginal cost based on CBA to construct their benefit chain model for valuing ESI from hypothetical satellite remote sensing data. Another common pairing combined preference elicitation methods of individual interviews and focus groups (n = 8). For example, Roberts et al. [-@roberts_takinghighway_2022] used focus groups/workshops to qualitatively predict the value of weather forecast information for avoiding storm-related drownings in Lake Victoria, then after implementation of a severe weather warning system, followed with user interviews to quantify the realized benefits in lives saved. Of the remaining 34 multiple-method studies, 14 combined VOI with some other method (beyond CBA) and 16 combined surveys with some other method (beyond VOI).  Paired decision analysis-based methods were more common (n = 22) than paired preference elicitation-based (n = 18), but 14 studies combined preference elicitation methods (mostly surveys) with decision analysis methods.

The number in the bottom left quadrant indicates the total number of papers that implemented the combination of methods. The majority of papers (125 out of 170) applied only a single method.

### Societal Benefit Context Areas

For each of the 170 included studies, we categorized societal benefits into eight general decision context areas, based on existing classes from GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas and NASA Applied Sciences themes (REFS) (Fig. 4).  Across the 170 included studies we observed societal benefits in 215 specific decision contexts (i.e., 45 studies examined societal benefits in more than one context).  Studies largely focused on the societal benefits of ESI within agriculture contexts, including fisheries and forestry (n = 78, 46% of studies) (Fig. 4). A smaller but still substantial number of studies examined benefits in context of climate (n = 25, 15%), water resources (n = 22, 13%), and ecological conservation (n = 22, 13%).  Societal benefits were least frequently examined in contexts of disaster response (n = 9, 5%), health and air quality (n = 8, 5%), and wildfires (n = 6, 4%). Some studies did not focus deeply on any particular context but rather broadly across various or undifferentiated contexts ("various," n = 27, 16%), for example, the value of an ocean observing network across many potential ocean uses [@kaiser_potentialvalue_2004] or the value of Landsat data that did not differentiate among user contexts [@loomis_valuinggeospatial_2015].  Two studies focused on ESI benefits in other areas: one for monitoring pavement infrastructure [@li_economicfeasibility_2017], and one for assessing preferences for living and recreating in disturbed landscapes [@altamirano_landscapedisturbance_2020].

> Figure 4. Number of studies investigating value of information in general decision context areas. Some studies examined more than one decision context, thus the total number of specific contexts (215) exceeds the total number of included studies (170). The label “various” indicates studies where decision contexts were broad or undifferentiated; “other” indicates studies where the societal benefit did not fit into any of these contexts. Color indicates value types assessed: instrumental, i.e., means to an end, including both monetary and non-monetary outcomes, and relational, i.e., deriving from meaningful and often reciprocal relationships among people, nature, and society (see Table S1).

Studies that valued ESI across multiple decision contexts (n = 45) most frequently examined agricultural impacts alongside water resources (n = 10), climate (n = 8), ecological conservation (n = 4), and capacity building (n = 4) (Fig. 5). Four studies examined capacity building across various contexts, involving training and supporting groups of stakeholders with diverse roles within their communities, e.g., participatory mapping projects in Nepal [@parajuli_opendata_2020] and Tanzania [@eilola_lessonslearned_2021].
