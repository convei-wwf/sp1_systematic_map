### Screening Process

Application of the search string (see SI XXX) to the Scopus and Web of Science databases, combined with references from the SBL, resulted in 28,331 papers.  Pre-screening to eliminate conference abstracts, spurious matches, duplicates, and incomplete records resulted in 13,823 unique citations (See Fig. XXX and SXXX) that were then subjected to screening.  In brief, screening criteria consisted of: 1) the study made substantive use of ESI; 2) the ESI was applied in a decision context; 3) the predicted or realized outcome of an ESI-based decision was compared to the predicted or realized outcome of the decision under an alternative information set; and 4) the difference in outcome was translated into some measure of societal benefit. Reviews were excluded as they do not present original data.  Through a machine-learning assisted title/abstract screening process, 770 documents were identified for full text screening, resulting in 170 documents that met all criteria (see Fig. XXX and SXXX). 

### Valuation Methods

Across the 170 included documents we observed 224 instances of valuation methods (i.e., 54 studies included two methods).  The most common approaches to assessing societal benefits of ESI in the literature were quantitative economic approaches: Value of Information (VOI) methods (n = 81; 48% of papers) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) (n = 33; 19%) (Fig. 1; see Table SXXX for operational definitions used to categorize valuation methods). Applied qualitative or subjective methods were also frequently observed, including surveys of preference assessments (n = 26; 15%) and semi-structured or in-depth interviews (n = 23; 14%). Deliberative and consensus-based approaches were rare (n = 3 and 1 studies, respectively). Methods based on decision analysis (n = 144) were more frequently observed than methods based on preference elicitation (n = 80)

> Figure 1. Number of valuation methods observed across included studies. Some studies applied multiple methods for valuation, thus the total number of observed methods (224) exceeds the total number of included studies (170). Color indicates value types used to assess societal benefits: instrumental, i.e., means to an end, and relational, i.e., deriving from meaningful and often reciprocal relationships among people, nature, and society (see Table XXX).

These methods most commonly measured societal benefits in terms of instrumental values (e.g., improved profit, pollution reduction, lives saved) (n = 209), often accounting for multiple instrumental metrics simultaneously (e.g., reduced crop pesticide application and the associated increase in profit; see Table SXXX for definitions and examples in included corpus). Methods that measured societal benefits as relational values (e.g., poverty alleviation, social justice, knowledge transfer among community, Table SXXX) were far less common in the literature (n = 15) and were studied more frequently using qualitative preference elicitation methods, especially surveys, interviews, and focus groups.  Relational values were rarely the sole focus of an assessment, but rather were typically examined alongside instrumental values; for example, recreational fishing both as a pastime and as an economic activity [@wieand_bayesianmethodology_2008].  No studies in our resulting corpus evaluated ESI outcomes in terms of intrinsic value.

Studies that were coded as implementing multiple methods (n = 54) most commonly combined two decision-analytic methods, particularly VOI with CBA (n = 12) (Fig. 4). For example, Fritz et al. [-@fritz_conceptualframework_2008] apply the counterfactual framework of VOI to estimate benefit, then model marginal cost based on CBA to construct their benefit chain model for valuing ESI from hypothetical satellite remote sensing data. Another common pairing combined qualitative preference elicitation methods of individual interviews and focus groups (n = 8). For example, Roberts et al. [-@roberts_takinghighway_2022] used focus groups/workshops to qualitatively predict the value of forecast information for avoiding storm-related drownings in Lake Victoria, then after implementation of a severe weather warning system, followed with user interviews to quantify the realized benefits in lives saved. Of the remaining 34 multiple-method studies, 14 combined VOI with some other method (excluding VOI + CBA) and 16 combined surveys with some other method (excluding VOI + survey).  Paired quantitative methods were more common (n = 26) than paired qualitative (n = 16) and mixed methods (n = 12). Most of the mixed methods studies combined surveys with some quantitative method (n = 8).

The quadrants and colors at each intersection indicate which value types were examined; the size of the quadrants indicate how many papers examined that value type. The number in the bottom left quadrant indicates the total number of papers that implemented the combination of methods. The majority of papers did not use a combination of methods.

### Societal Benefit Domains

Across the 170 included studies we observed societal benefits in 215 contexts (i.e., 45 studies examined societal benefits in multiple contexts).  Studies largely focused on the societal benefits of ESI within agriculture, including fisheries and forestry (n = 78, 46% of studies). A smaller but still substantial number of studies examined benefits across multiple contexts (n = 27, 16%), climate (n = 25, 15%), water resources (n = 22, 13%), and ecological conservation (n = 22, 13%) (Fig. 5). Societal benefits were least frequently examined in contexts of disaster response (n = 9, 5%), health and air quality (n = 8, 5%), and wildfires (n = 6, 4%). Two studies focused on ESI benefits in other areas: one for monitoring pavement infrastructure [@li_economicfeasibility_2017], and one for assessing preferences for living and recreating in disturbed landscapes [@altamirano_landscapedisturbance_2020].

> Figure 3. Number of studies investigating value of information in different societal benefit areas (combined GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas and NASA Applied Sciences themes). Some studies examined more than one societal benefit area, thus the total number of observed contexts (215) exceeds the total number of included studies (170). “(various)” indicates studies where three or more societal benefit areas were discussed; “(other)” indicates studies where the societal benefit did not fit into any of these categories. Color indicates value types used to assess societal benefits: instrumental, i.e., means to an end, and relational, i.e., deriving from meaningful and often reciprocal relationships among people, nature, and society (see Table XXX).

Studies that valued ESI across multiple benefit areas (n = 45) most frequently examined agricultural impacts alongside water resources (n = 10), climate (n = 8), ecological conservation (n = 4), and capacity building (n = 4) (Fig. 6). Four studies examined capacity building across various contexts, involving training and supporting groups of stakeholders with diverse roles within their communities, e.g., participatory mapping projects in Nepal [@parajuli_opendata_2020] and Tanzania [@eilola_lessonslearned_2021].
