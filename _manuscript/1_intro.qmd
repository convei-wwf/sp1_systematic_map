In recent decades, remotely sensed information about the state of our planet has become increasingly vital for understanding and addressing global challenges such as climate change, water resource management, biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and public health [@macauley_ascribingsocietal_2006; @fritz_conceptualframework_2008, @rydzak_impactglobal_2010, @tassa_socioeconomicvalue_2020]. Rapid technological progress has led to widespread availability of Earth science information (ESI), comprising global or regional datasets from remote sensing (e.g., satellite hyperspectral imagery, aerial drone photography, in-situ sensor networks) as well as models founded on such data (e.g., climate forecast models, famine early warning systems), at increasingly detailed and nearly continuous spatial and temporal coverage of the planet’s surface [@worldeconomicforum_amplifyingglobal_2024]. These advances in the availability and sophistication of ESI have accelerated its application across a wide range of decision contexts [@zhu_benefitsfree_2019], supporting societal benefits as varied as impeding transmission of polio in Nigeria (Borowitz et al. 2023), protecting blue whales in the Eastern Pacific [@bernknopf_earthobservations_2021], improving targeting of cash transfers to poor villages in sub-Saharan Africa [@varshney_targetingvillages_2015; @smythe_geographicmicrotargeting_2022], and empowering Indigenous communities to monitor deforestation [@gonzalez_adoptionearthobservation_2023]. While the contribution of ESI to such societal benefits is undeniable, the magnitude of this contribution is rarely assessed. In other words, how different would the outcome have been in the absence of ESI? 

The gap in valuation of ESI is due in part to the separation of Earth system science from social and decision sciences, and further compounded by a lack of information-valuation frameworks that integrate different value types (e.g., instrumental, intrinsic, relational).  Understanding the breadth and magnitude of societal benefit of ESI, i.e., the value of practical application to socially desirable outcomes that goes beyond scientific merit [@macauley_ascribingsocietal_2006], is important for guiding development of information that is actionable, meaningful, and credible for society’s needs, thereby justifying investment in future missions, garnering public support, fostering ESI uptake, and ensuring that science and policy goals are well aligned.

The mechanism by which ESI, indeed any information, generates societal value is through its ability to improve decision making toward socially desirable outcomes.  It does this by reducing uncertainty in the decision context and thus reducing the likelihood of making decisions that result in undesireable outcomes.  Economic frameworks to quantify the value of information typically calculate the difference in expected outcome of a decision made in a world with the information and the decision made in a world without that information (e.g., [@hirschleifer_analyticsuncertainty_1979]).  Such value of information models have played a critical role in demonstrating ESI’s potential to improve instrumental societal outcomes with instrumental values (i.e., means to an end, such as improved profits or crop yields) [@macauley_valueinformation_2006; @laxminarayan_valueinformation_2012].  However, not all societal values can be so readily quantified in instrumental terms.

Inclusive and pluralistic value systems that go beyond instrumental value have long been a topic of discussion in conservation science and sustainable development (e.g., [@chan_opinionwhy_2016; @pascual_valuingnatures_2017; @klimkova_valuepluralism_2018; @fazendeiro_politicalpluralism_2021]). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Values Assessment [@ipbes_summarypolicymakers_2022], a multi-year effort by scores of experts in diverse forms of valuation, identified three categories of value that reflect the ways in which nature and ecosystems are important for people: instrumental (value as a means to satisfying specific human needs or interests), intrinsic (value independent of reference of people as valuers, inherent moral value), and relational (value deriving from meaningful, just, and reciprocal relationships with people and nature, toward living a “good life”) [@himes_whynature_2024] (Table S1).  While the IPBES assessment focused on value types and valuation methods in the context of ecosystem services, we can expand these considerations to examine values related to our relationship with Earth systems as observed through ESI.  Failing to capture potential gains related to non-instrumental values risks greatly underestimating the contribution of ESI to societal benefits.

Decision analytic value of information models are well-suited to measuring instrumental value, but these models are less suitable for capturing the pluralistic ways in which ESI can contribute to intrinsic and relational values such as sustainability, justice, and human well-being [@glynn_valueinformation_2022a].  Other valuation methods can account for instrumental and non-instrumental values alike by eliciting individual and societal preferences for goods and services through strategies across quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods approaches (e.g., market price, stated/revealed preference, surveys, interviews, focus groups) [@arias-arevalo_wideningevaluative_2018].  While these methods are commonly used for valuation of goods and services, they can also be leveraged to estimate the value of information in cases where they are used to account for the value of the differential outcome between a decision made with ESI relative to the decision made without.

In this study, we ask four questions: To what degree have various valuation methods been used to evaluate the societal value of ESI? Which types of value (instrumental, intrinsic, relational) do these methods capture, and how are these values articulated? How are qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method approaches distributed across sectors and use cases? And finally, what opportunities exist to develop more inclusive, systematic, and interdisciplinary approaches to ESI valuation? To address these questions, we develop a systematic map of the peer-reviewed literature by querying two literature databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and a curated library of ESI valuation literature, the [USGS Joint Societal Benefits of Earth Observation Digital Library](https://doi.sciencebase.gov/hd/#/geo-value?p=0&l=50&yearMin=1863&yearMax=2024) (hereafter, Societal Benefits Library or SBL) (USGS 2024 !!!REF) using a search string that included three facets: (1) Application of ESI (2) within a decision context (3) whose outcome translated into some societal benefit (See SI Methods and Fig. S1 for search string).  The resulting citations were screened for relevance with assistance of machine learning tools to identify studies where a valuation method was used to compare the difference in value between a decision made using ESI relative to the decision made using some other information source.  By addressing these questions through a systematic map of the peer-reviewed literature across a wide range of disciplines, we aim to clarify the current landscape of ESI valuation, identify methodological and disciplinary gaps, highlight emerging practices, and point toward a more pluralistic and actionable valuation framework. Our goal is to ensure that investments in Earth observations not only expand scientific understanding but also deliver equitable and measurable benefits across diverse communities and decision contexts.
