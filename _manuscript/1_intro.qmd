In recent decades, remotely sensed information about the state of our planet has become increasingly vital for understanding and addressing global challenges such as climate change, water resource management, biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and public health [@macauley_ascribingsocietal_2006; @fritz_conceptualframework_2008, @rydzak_impactglobal_2010, @tassa_socioeconomicvalue_2020]. Rapid technological progress has led to widespread availability of Earth science information (ESI), comprising global or regional datasets from remote sensing (e.g., satellite hyperspectral imagery, aerial drone photography, in-situ sensor networks) as well as models founded on such data (e.g., climate forecast models, famine early warning systems), at increasingly detailed and nearly continuous spatial and temporal coverage of the planet’s surface [@worldeconomicforum_amplifyingglobal_2024]. These advances in the availability and sophistication of ESI have accelerated its application across a wide range of decision contexts [@zhu_benefitsfree_2019], supporting societal benefits as varied as impeding transmission of polio in Nigeria [@borowitz_examiningvalue_2023], protecting blue whales in the Eastern Pacific [@bernknopf_satellitebasedremote_2025], improving targeting of cash transfers to poor villages in sub-Saharan Africa [@varshney_targetingvillages_2015; @smythe_geographicmicrotargeting_2022], and empowering Indigenous communities to monitor deforestation [@gonzalez_adoptionearthobservation_2023]. While the contribution of ESI to such societal benefits is undeniable, the magnitude of this contribution is rarely assessed. Yet if we don't understand the value of ESI, we risk underinvesting in information essential for protecting or enhancing our quality of life.

The gap in valuation of ESI is due in part to the separation of Earth system science from social and decision sciences, and further compounded by a lack of information-valuation frameworks that integrate different value types (e.g., instrumental vs. intrinsic).  Understanding the breadth and magnitude of societal benefit of ESI, i.e., the value of practical application to socially desirable outcomes that goes beyond scientific merit [@macauley_ascribingsocietal_2006], is important for guiding development of information that is actionable, meaningful, and credible for society’s needs, thereby justifying investment in future missions, garnering public support, fostering ESI uptake, and ensuring that science and policy goals are well aligned.

Inclusive and pluralistic value systems have long been a topic of discussion in conservation science and sustainable development (e.g., [@chan_opinionwhy_2016; @pascual_valuingnatures_2017; @klimkova_valuepluralism_2018; @fazendeiro_politicalpluralism_2021]). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Values Assessment [@ipbes_summarypolicymakers_2022], a multi-year effort by scores of experts in diverse forms of valuation, identified three categories of value that reflect the ways in which nature and ecosystems are important for people: instrumental value as a means to satisfying specific human needs or interests, e.g., more revenue, higher crop yield, better health outcomes; intrinsic value independent of reference to people as valuers, e.g., the right of a whale to exist without regards to human preferences; and relational value deriving from meaningful and often reciprocal human relationships beyond means to an end, e.g., connection with a sacred landscape, a sense of responsibility toward one's community [@himes_whynature_2024] (Table S1).  While the IPBES framework focused on value types in the context of nature, we can expand these considerations to examine values related to our relationship with both natural and social systems as observed through ESI-informed decision outcomes.  Failing to capture potential gains related to non-instrumental values will greatly underestimate the contribution of ESI to societal benefits.

The mechanism by which ESI, indeed any information, generates societal value is through its ability to improve decision making toward socially desirable outcomes.  It does this by aiding in the scoping of decision contexts and assessing alternatives, thus reducing the likelihood of making decisions that result in undesireable outcomes.  Note that this indicates that information, when put to use, by definition has instrumental value, and information can have intrinsic scientific value, whether used or not.  But the focus of our study is not on the nature of information itself, but rather on the societal benefits that arise from the use of ESI in decision contexts, i.e., the value of the decision outcome, whether that is expressed in instrumental, relational, or intrinsic terms.

Economic frameworks to quantify the value of information typically calculate the difference in expected outcome of a decision made in a world with, versus without, the information (e.g., [@hirshleifer_analyticsuncertainty_1979]).  Such decision analysis methods have played a critical role in demonstrating ESI’s potential to improve instrumental societal outcomes with instrumental values (i.e., means to an end, such as improved profits or crop yields) [@macauley_valueinformation_2006; @laxminarayan_valueinformation_2012].  Value of information models based on decision analysis are well-suited to measuring socially desirable outcomes in terms of instrumental value, but these models are not sufficient to capture the ways in which ESI can contribute to intrinsic and relational values such as sustainability, justice, and human well-being [@glynn_valueinformation_2022a].  Other valuation methods can account for instrumental and non-instrumental values alike by eliciting individual and societal preferences for goods and services through quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods approaches (e.g., market price, stated/revealed preference, surveys, interviews, focus groups) [@arias-arevalo_wideningevaluative_2018].  While these methods are commonly used for valuation of goods and services, they can also be leveraged to estimate the value of information in cases where they are used to account for the value of the differential outcome between a decision made with ESI relative to the decision made without.

In this study, we ask four questions: (1) To what degree have various valuation methods been used to evaluate the societal value of ESI? (2) Which types of value (instrumental, intrinsic, relational) do these methods capture, and how are these values articulated? (3) How is the application of various valuation methods distributed across sectors and decision contexts? And finally, (4) what opportunities exist to develop more inclusive, systematic, and interdisciplinary approaches to ESI valuation? Here we present a systematic map of the peer-reviewed literature to identify studies in which a valuation method was used to compare the result of a decision supported by ESI to the result supported by some alternate information source.  Through this systematic map of the peer-reviewed literature across a wide range of disciplines, we clarify the current landscape of ESI valuation, identify methodological and disciplinary gaps, highlight emerging practices, and point toward a more pluralistic and actionable valuation framework. Understanding and improving the way we value information will promote investments in Earth observations that not only expand scientific understanding but also deliver equitable and measurable benefits across diverse communities and decision contexts.
