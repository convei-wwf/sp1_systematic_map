Despite a broad, inclusive search for research on diverse methods for valuing earth observation information, we found very few examples of ESI applied in decision-support contexts that had been evaluated for its societal benefit. Such a low inclusion rate (1.2%) is in part to be expected, as our inclusion criteria are specific to methods of valuing information and data, but our search string was intentionally designed to be inclusive to maximize opportunities to find edge cases in the literature. The paucity of research directly addressing the value of ESI suggests a strong need to better understand and address how such information can be used in order to support and motivate further investments in ESI. 

The challenge of valuing information, as opposed to valuing goods or services, lies in identifying a relevant counterfactual information set as the basis of comparison.  For the purposes of our analysis, we focused only on valuation methods that were used in a manner that was responsive to the ESI in a decision context.  In many of the publications we identified, multiple valuation methods were used in sequence to first identify the difference in outcome based on the inclusion of ESI, and then to translate that difference in outcome to some other metric, usually monetary.  The first step is clearly dependent upon the availability of the ESI in question; the second step may or may not be, depending on the assumptions of a given study.  For example, Späti  et al. (2021) modeled the effect of variable-rate nitrogen application on crop yield for small-scale farmers based on several levels of spatial data resolution; they then valued the increased yield and reduced nitrogen into economic terms (Swiss francs) using market prices.  However, the nitrogen and crop prices were treated as independent of the ESI - a reasonable assumption for a small-scale farmer trading commodities within a global market - and thus this second valuation step was effectively a unit conversion, and not germane to our study.  Conversely, Adams et al. (2003) modeled the benefits of an El Niño early warning system for agriculture across five Mexican states, accounting for alternative cropping decisions to optimize yield in the face of seasonal predictions, then translated the resulting crop yield into economic terms using modeled market prices. In this case, the market model accounted for changes in price due to ESI-driven changes in supply, and therefore this second valuation step was considered relevant for our study.

We found that VOI methods dominate the current literature evaluating the societal benefits for ESI for decision support (Fig. 3). VOI is a well established and intuitive method, and Macaulay (2006) described a framework for applying VOI to ESI contexts that continues to influence recent research initiatives (e.g., VALUABLES REF). VOI methods are very well suited to situations where a reduction in uncertainty, based on an improved information set, can be expected to drive a clear and measurable improvement in decision outcomes. This is especially the case where costs of a mistake are high, where benefits can be expressed as objective quantities (typically instrumental value), and where the outcome is highly responsive to the set of actions that can be taken. For these reasons, VOI is particularly suited to agricultural contexts (Fig. 3), where an improved seasonal forecast can improve farmers’ decisions about crop choices and crop management to maximize yield and profit in the face of uncertainty; this is reflected in the high rates of VOI use in agricultural studies.

CBA is the second most prevalent method identified in our corpus (Fig. 3). CBA is a well established and reasonably intuitive manner of estimating the net present value of a particular investment decision over an extended time frame, generally with an implicit counterfactual of not making the investment. In an information context, this could be considered as the expected net benefit of investment in the infrastructure required to generate ESI, such as aerial drones or satellite instruments, and/or investment in equipment and labor to process ESI. Using CBA in valuation of ESI is most commonly observed in agriculture and conservation contexts, and like VOI, is focused primarily on instrumental value due to its traditionally monetary nature. 

Valuation methods based on decision analysis necessarily focus on decision outcomes that can be quantified.  However, many decision outcomes valued by individuals and society are impossible to objectively quantify and/or can be qualitatively valued across multiple, potentially incommensurable, value domains.  Preference elicitation methods can readily account for qualitative benefits related to ESI-based decision outcomes in instrumental and non-instrumental terms, and additionally may provide insights into procedural benefits as ESI use addresses issues of saliency and legitimacy of decision making (REF Cash et al).  Five example studies in our corpus help illustrate this. Altamirano et al (2020) used eye-level and aerial photos of various landscape disturbance gradients to survey preferences for visiting, living, scenic beauty, and well being in each landscape. Eilola et al. (2021) used interviews and focus groups to study how participatory mapping using ESI improved practitioners’ perceptions of work quality, professional competence, participation, spatial understanding. Gonzalez and Kroger (2023) used focus groups and interviews to examine how training in and adoption of remote observation technology improved empowerment and agency of Indigenous people in protecting their land from illegal deforestation. Colloredo-Mansfeld et al (2020) used participatory mapping and in-depth, semi-structured interviews to understand how UAV photography affected farming practices and perceptions, leading to a greater sense of scale and interconnectedness. Styers (2018) surveyed her undergraduate students to gauge how the incorporation of satellite data into her courses improved student engagement, curiosity, collaborative skills, and learning outcomes. In these cases and others, quantitative measures would clearly be inappropriate to capture the breadth and depth of societal benefits accrued from access to and use of ESI. 
A few studies bridged the divide between decision-analytic methods and preference-elicitation methods. In several related studies, Bouma et al. (2009, 2009a, 2009b, 2011) applied a Bayesian decision analysis to quantify societal benefits of ESI for managing water quality, but leveraged surveys of experts to elicit prior beliefs and expectations of accuracy of the ESI to inform the Bayesian analysis. Flipping that script, Luseno et al. (2003) used a conceptual Bayesian framework to guide the design of surveys and interviews of pastoralists in Ethiopia and Kenya to understand their preferences around ESI-derived climate forecasts, including the pastoralists’ prior beliefs based on traditional forecasting methods, trust in ESI forecast skill, and likelihood of using the ESI-based forecasts.
 
The scientific, political, and commercial structures governing ESI - especially whether datasets are publicly accessible or proprietary, freely available or commercial - determine who is likely to benefit from their societal value (Harris and Miller, 2011). Clearly, free versus commercial availability of ESI data has implications for its ability to generate societal benefits; for example, following Landsat’s shift from a paid service to a free and open data policy in 2008, downloads and citations for Landsat data surged, generating billions of dollars in new scientific and societal benefits (Zhu et al. 2019; Loomis et al. 2015).  Alvarez Leon and Gleason (2017) analyze how varying property rights can reinforce or challenge assumptions of scientific objectivity and ultimately users’ ability to translate ESI into scientific and societal value. For example, recent data from the European Space Agency (ESA)’s SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) mission is commercially available, and users can request that the sensor can be directed to capture imagery of particular regions of commercial interest. As a result, historical SPOT data (through 2015), while freely available through various portals, are skewed toward scenes that were valuable to commercial users at the time of capture. In contrast, Landsat data of USGS are freely and openly available, and as the sensing path is not subject to user control, the data are unlikely to show commercial bias - although as a product of the US government they may have undergone prior filtering to remove classified or sensitive information (Alvarez and Gleason, 2017).

However, even for freely and openly available satellite data, barriers to technical expertise and capacity pose significant hurdles to using for practitioners in developing countries (Kganyago and Mhangara 2019), and poor integration with ground-based and local knowledge hampers development of machine learning algorithms to translate remote sensing imagery into actionable information (Adelusi et al. 2025; Burke et al. 2021; King & Halpern 2025). Capacity building can help local communities and indigenous groups access and incorporate ESI to co-produce knowledge across contexts including conservation (e.g., Pintea 2021), deforestation (e.g., Gonzalez and Kroger 2023), marine resource management (e.g., Lauer and Aswani 2008, Mackenzie et al. 2019), and resilience to climate change (Luseno et al. 2003, Manga 2023). Such collaborations can reduce power asymmetries and increase agency and self-governance of communities as they seek to address challenges facing indigenous landscapes and territories (Manga 2023, Gonzalez and Kroger 2023); however, they can also result in internal power divisions between tech adopters and non-adopters, potentially resulting in shifts in or loss of cultural values (Gonzalez & Kroger 2023)

* Our process leveraged machine learning to make it feasible (“enfeasen”) to approach the question so openly and cast such a wide net expecting a low inclusion rate
* Colandr - several years old (check with Sam to see if the algorithm has changed with new tool availability) but still helpful, and external colandr companion provides real time feedback on inclusion/exclusion rate to allow for quantitative criteria for early stopping - other ML and AI boosted lit review tools increasingly becoming the norm
* ML classification algorithm to amplify early results using early results as training set - but important to focus on minimizing false negatives - follow up with explicit testing of a sample of predicted “excludes” to improve confidence in exclude predictions
* Even with these tools to boost efficiency of screening, we still faced a high false positive rate…
* probably because our systematic map focused not on study questions or results, typically foregrounded in the title and abstract, but rather on methods, which are often described only vaguely if at all in the abstract, it was not clear that machine learning methods would be able to accurately predict the relevance of any given paper without a substantial training set - a very unbalanced training set required special care
* AI tools such as the reflective models and Deep Research are likely to become important tools in the arsenal of anyone performing a systematic literature search

While most of the studies in our corpus identify positive societal benefits due to ESI, the tradeoff between information and privacy becomes increasingly relevant as advancements in the quality and quantity of remote sensing data accelerate the ability to identify and monitor objects and people on the ground. In general, remote sensing allows the observer to shift information asymmetry between the observer and the observed, in favor of the observer. Brennan and Macauley (1995) describe several important use cases that determine whether the shift in information asymmetry is potentially beneficial or detrimental to society, based on whether the observer and the observed are state actors or private actors (corporations, groups, individuals) and whether the relationship between observer and observed is adversarial or cooperative. The ability of state actors to monitor and enforce compliance with conservation policy, emissions targets, and peace treaties certainly produce societal benefits by enabling cooperation (REFS?); monitoring also holds promise for reducing international conflict (Gleason & Hamdan 2017), supporting human rights (Notley & Webb-Gannon 2016), and responding to genocide (Levinger 2009).  To the extent that an open, transparent government whose laws and regulations reflect the will of the governed, these information asymmetries may actually promote societal benefits, e.g., reduced crime or pollution (Brennan & Macauley 1995). However, the risks of abuse loom large, creating a clear tradeoff between the increasing capabilities of remote sensing technology and the privacy rights of the individual.

While most of the papers excluded from our target corpus either did not apply ESI data (e.g., spurious matches that were missed during our preliminary screening), or applied ESI data to calculate some other outcome (e.g., using land cover classification data to estimate ecosystem service value, but no further examination of the value of the ESI itself), two categories of excluded papers merit further consideration. These two categories of studies offer clear opportunities for those interested in evaluating the societal benefits of ESI.

First, a number of papers explicitly used cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate that an ESI data set could achieve equal or near-equal performance for a decision context but with less cost (e.g., reduced costs of labor or equipment relative to on-the-ground research) (e.g., Bernknopf et al. 2021, monetising the savings). However, we did not include these in our final corpus, reasoning that if the information itself is essentially identical between the ESI and non-ESI alternative, any outcome of a given decision would necessarily be identical, and therefore no additional marginal societal benefit would result from use of the ESI. We acknowledge that in resource-constrained settings, government or NGO cost savings can closely translate into improved societal outcomes (e.g., lowering taxes on lower income people, or increasing budgets for social safety nets), but these second-order benefits were not explicitly examined in any of the papers we screened.  While these excluded studies focused on a one-time analysis, reduced costs of labor and/or equipment imply the potential for increased frequency of measurement, which would prove valuable for certain types of decision contexts that involve rapidly changing phenomena, e.g., disaster response or wildfire management. We included several studies that explicitly valued the benefits of higher spatial resolution, though we encountered no studies that explicitly accounted for the value of higher temporal resolution. This suggests an opportunity for future valuation studies, especially in light of trends toward increasingly fine temporal resolution of accessible satellite data.

Second, a larger subset of excluded papers compared the ability of ESI to accurately predict on-the-ground phenomena by comparing values to those measured by some other means, for example, EXAMPLE (REFS). Such validation studies typically report accuracy scores, e.g., RMSE or AUC, often demonstrating the superiority of a particular ESI dataset or algorithm over the alternative approach. Importantly, while these studies presented results in terms of scientific value, they did not examine how the improved scientific knowledge would affect the decisions that generate societal benefits - though most included conceptual descriptions of potential decisions or societal value in their conclusions. With often minor additional information or economic modeling, many calibration/validation studies (e.g., REFS of examples here) could readily translate the improved scientific accuracy of an ESI dataset relative into a hypothetical or realized decision that could be translated into calculable societal benefits (e.g., REFS of papers that make this leap?).

<!--other caveats down here - no non-English, no grey literature; intended to be broad and informative but not necessarily comprehensive
-->We note that many ESI applications may rely on highly derived, modeled, or processed data, such that the word satellite or the name of the initial sensor does not appear in the paper, which may limit the citations in our corpus but excluding the ESI term would make the search impossibly large.
