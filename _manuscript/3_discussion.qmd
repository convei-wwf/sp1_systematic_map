Despite a broad, inclusive search for research on diverse methods for valuing earth observation information, we found very few examples of evaluations of the societal benefits of ESI.  Such a low inclusion rate (1.2%) is in part to be expected, as our inclusion criteria are specific to methods of valuing information and data, but our search string was intentionally designed to be inclusive to maximize opportunities to find edge cases in the literature. The paucity of research directly addressing the value of ESI suggests a strong need to better understand how such information is being used to generate societal value, and to identify methods that can effectively assess this value.

The challenge of valuing information, as opposed to valuing goods or services, generally lies in identifying a relevant counterfactual information set as the basis of comparison.  The counterfactual can be explicit, such as stated assumptions of outcomes sans ESI built into a VOI analysis, or implicit, such as the mental counterfactual a respondent may generate for comparison in a survey or interview.  Here we focused only on valuation methods where the resulting value was a function of ESI.  In several of the publications we identified, multiple valuation methods were used in sequence to first identify the difference in outcome based on the inclusion of ESI, and then to translate that difference in outcome to some other metric, usually monetary.  The first step is clearly dependent upon the availability of the ESI in question (access to ESI generates a difference in outcome); the second step may or may not be, depending on the assumptions of a given study.  For example, Späti  et al. [-@spaeti_benefitsincreasing_2021] modeled the effect of variable-rate nitrogen application on crop yield for small-scale farmers based on several spatial resolutions of ESI data; they then valued the increased yield and reduced nitrogen, made possible through the improved resolution, into economic terms (Swiss francs) using market prices.  However, the nitrogen and crop prices were treated as independent of the ESI (a reasonable assumption for a small-scale farmer trading commodities within a global market) and thus this second valuation step was effectively a unit conversion, and not germane to our study.  Conversely, Adams et al. [-@adams_benefitsmexican_2003] modeled the benefits of an El Niño early warning system for agriculture across five Mexican states, accounting for alternative cropping decisions to optimize yield in the face of seasonal predictions, then translated the resulting crop yield into economic terms using modeled market prices. The difference in crop yield was again a result of access to ESI as in the previous example, but the market model accounted for changes in price due to ESI-driven changes in supply, and therefore this second valuation step was also considered relevant for our study.

Our systematic map shows that VOI methods have been the dominant approach to evaluating societal benefits derived from using ESI for decision support (Fig. 2). VOI is a well-established and intuitive method, and Macaulay [-@macauley_valueinformation_2006] described a framework for applying VOI to ESI contexts that continues to influence recent research initiatives (e.g.,[@resourcesforthefuture_valuablesconsortium_2023]). VOI methods are very well suited to situations where a reduction in uncertainty, based on an improved information set, can be expected to drive a clear and measurable improvement in decision outcomes. This is especially the case where costs of a mistake are high, where benefits can be expressed as objective quantities (typically instrumental value), and where the outcome is highly responsive to the set of actions that can be taken. For these reasons, VOI is particularly suited to agricultural contexts, where an improved seasonal forecast can inform farmers’ decisions about crop choices and crop management to maximize yield and profit in the face of uncertainty; this is reflected in the high rates of VOI use in agricultural studies.

Our analysis revealed that CBA, a common method for estimating the net present value of a particular investment decision over an extended time frame, is the second most prevalent method for valuing ESI (Fig. 2).  In an information context, this could be considered as the expected net benefit of investment in the infrastructure required to generate ESI, such as aerial drones or satellite instruments, and/or investment in technologies and labor to process ESI. In some identified studies, CBA and VOI were used in tandem (Fig. 3): the benefits of ESI are estimated using a VOI framework, while the costs of ESI are drawn from actual or projected budgets for producing the ESI.  Use of CBA in valuation of ESI is most commonly observed in agriculture and conservation contexts, and like VOI, is focused primarily on instrumental value due to its traditionally monetary nature. 

Valuation methods based on decision analysis (Table S2) necessarily focus on decision outcomes that can be quantified.  However, many decision outcomes valued by individuals and society are impossible to objectively quantify and/or can be qualitatively valued across multiple, potentially incommensurable, value types.  Preference elicitation methods (Table S2) can readily account for qualitative and subjective benefits related to ESI-based decision outcomes in instrumental and non-instrumental terms.  For example, Altamirano et al. [-@altamirano_landscapedisturbance_2020] surveyed people's preferences for visiting, living, admiring, and thriving across gradients of landscape disturbance, comparing perceptions based on eye-level photos to perceptions based on remote sensing photography. Colloredo-Mansfeld et al. [-@colloredo-mansfeld_dronebasedparticipatory_2020], using participatory mapping and in-depth interviews, found that farmers given access to UAV photography perceived their land differently than before, improving relational value through a greater sense of scale and interconnectedness.

In addition to eliciting qualitative and subjective outcomes associated with ESI, preference elicitation methods can provide insights into benefits related to the decision process itself.  For example, Eilola et al. [-@eilola_lessonslearned_2021] used interviews and focus groups to study how participatory mapping using ESI improved practitioners’ perceptions of work quality, professional competence, participation, and spatial understanding. Gonzalez and Kroger [-@gonzalez_adoptionearthobservation_2023] used focus groups and interviews to examine how training in and adoption of remote sensing data improved empowerment and agency of Indigenous people in protecting their land from illegal deforestation.  Styers [-@styers_usingbig_2018] surveyed her undergraduate students to gauge how the incorporation of satellite data into her courses improved student engagement, curiosity, collaborative skills, and learning outcomes. In these cases and others, access to and use of ESI improves saliency and legitimacy of decision making processes [@cash_saliencecredibility_2003], providing value independent of outcome.

A few studies bridged the divide between decision-analytic methods and preference-elicitation methods (Fig. 3). For example, in several interrelated studies, Bouma et al. [-@bouma_valueearth_2009; -@bouma_valueearth_2009a; -@bouma_assessingvalue_2009; -@bouma_assessingvalue_2011] applied Bayesian decision analysis to quantify societal benefits of ESI for managing water quality, but leveraged surveys of experts to elicit prior beliefs and expectations of accuracy of the ESI to parameterize the Bayesian analysis. Flipping that script, Luseno et al. [-@luseno_assessingvalue_2003] used a conceptual Bayesian framework to guide the design of surveys and interviews of pastoralists in Ethiopia and Kenya to understand their preferences around ESI-derived climate forecasts, including the pastoralists’ prior beliefs based on traditional forecasting methods, trust in ESI forecast skill, and likelihood of using the ESI-based forecasts.
 
The scientific, political, and commercial structures governing ESI - especially whether datasets are publicly accessible or proprietary, freely available or commercial - in part determine who is likely to benefit from their societal value [@harris_earthobservation_2011]. Clearly, making ESI data freely available enhances the ability to generate societal benefits; for example, citations and downloads surged for Landsat data surged following the shift from a paid service to a free and open data policy in 2008, ultimately stimulating billions of dollars in scientific and societal benefits [@loomis_valuinggeospatial_2015; @zhu_benefitsfree_2019].  Alvarez León and Gleason [-@alvarezleon_productionproperty_2017] analyze how varying property rights can reinforce or challenge assumptions of scientific objectivity and ultimately users’ ability to translate ESI into scientific and societal value. For example, recent data from the European Space Agency (ESA)’s SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) mission is commercially available, and users can request that the sensor can be directed to capture imagery of particular regions of commercial interest. As a result, historical SPOT data (through 2015), while freely available through various portals, are skewed toward scenes that were valuable to commercial users at the time of capture. In contrast, Landsat data of USGS are freely and openly available, and its fixed sensing path avoids bias based on commercial interests [@alvarezleon_productionproperty_2017], although systematic gaps in archival georegional coverage may exist due to technical failures and inconsistent data sharing among cooperating nations [@wulder_globallandsat_2016].

Even freely and openly available satellite data come with barriers to technical expertise and capacity that pose significant hurdles to use for many practitioners [@kganyago_roleafrican_2019], and poor integration with ground-based and local knowledge hampers development of machine learning algorithms to translate remote sensing imagery into actionable information [@burke_usingsatellite_2021; @adelusi_utilizingsatellite_2025; @king_implementationautomated_2025]. Capacity building can help local communities and Indigenous peoples access and incorporate ESI to co-produce knowledge across contexts including conservation (e.g., [@pintea_cloudground_2021]), deforestation (e.g., [@gonzalez_adoptionearthobservation_2023]), marine resource management (e.g., [@lauer_integratingindigenous_2008; @mackenzie_rolestakeholders_2019], and resilience to climate change [@luseno_assessingvalue_2003; @manga_whendigital_2023]. Such collaborations can reduce power asymmetries and increase agency and self-governance of communities as they seek to address challenges facing indigenous landscapes and territories [@manga_whendigital_2023; @gonzalez_adoptionearthobservation_2023]; however, they can also create internal power divisions between tech adopters and non-adopters, potentially resulting in shifts in or loss of cultural values [@gonzalez_adoptionearthobservation_2023].

While most of the reviewed studies identify positive societal benefits due to ESI, the trade-off between information and privacy becomes increasingly relevant as advancements in the quality and quantity of remote sensing data accelerate the ability to identify and monitor objects and people on the ground. In general, remote sensing allows the observer to shift information asymmetry between the observer and the observed, in favor of the observer. Brennan and Macauley [-@brennan_remotesensing_1995] describe several important use cases that determine whether the shift in information asymmetry is potentially beneficial or detrimental to society, based on whether the observer and the observed are state actors or private actors (corporations, groups, individuals) and whether the relationship between observer and observed is adversarial or cooperative. The ability of state actors to monitor and enforce compliance with conservation policy, emissions targets, and peace treaties certainly produces societal benefits by enabling cooperation [@furumo_policysequencing_2021]; monitoring also holds promise for reducing international conflict [@gleason_crossingwatershed_2017], supporting human rights [@notley_visualevidence_2016], and responding to genocide [@levinger_geographicalinformation_2009].  To the extent that an open, transparent government whose laws and regulations reflect the will of the governed, these information asymmetries may actually promote societal benefits, e.g., reduced crime or pollution [@brennan_remotesensing_1995]. However, the risks of abuse loom large, creating a clear tradeoff between the increasing capabilities of remote sensing technology and the privacy rights of the individual.

While most of the papers excluded from our target corpus either did not apply ESI data (e.g., spurious matches that were missed during our preliminary screening), or applied ESI data to calculate some other outcome (e.g., using land cover classification data to estimate ecosystem service value, but no further examination of the value of the ESI itself), two categories of excluded papers merit further consideration. These two categories of studies offer clear opportunities for those interested in evaluating the societal benefits of ESI.

First, a number of papers used cost-effectiveness analysis, a close relative of cost-benefit analysis, to demonstrate that an ESI data set could achieve equal or near-equal performance for a decision context but with less cost (e.g., reduced costs of labor or equipment relative to on-the-ground research) (e.g., [@bernknopf_monetisingsavings_2021]). We did not include these in our final corpus, reasoning that if the information itself is essentially identical between the ESI and non-ESI alternative, any outcome of a given decision would necessarily be identical, and therefore no additional marginal societal benefit would result from use of the ESI. We acknowledge that in resource-constrained settings, government or NGO cost savings in one area can closely translate into improved societal outcomes in another (e.g., lowering taxes on lower income people, or increasing budgets for social safety nets), but these indirect benefits were not explicitly examined in any of the papers we screened.  While these excluded studies focused on a one-time analysis, reduced costs of labor and/or equipment imply the potential for increased frequency of measurement, which would prove valuable for certain types of decision contexts that involve rapidly changing phenomena, e.g., disaster response or wildfire management. We included several studies that explicitly valued the benefits of higher spatial resolution, though we encountered only one study [@stroming_quantifyinghuman_2020] that explicitly accounted for the value of higher temporal resolution. This suggests an opportunity for future valuation studies, especially in light of trends toward increasingly fine temporal resolution of accessible satellite data.

Second, a larger subset of excluded papers compared the ability of ESI to accurately predict on-the-ground phenomena measured by some other means.  For example, Marino [@marino_understandingspatiotemporal_2023] examined the potential for Sentinel-2 time series imagery to delineate subfields of sunflower crops and found that the image-based vegetation index provided a good proxy for ground-measured crop status; however, the implications for harvest decisions and resulting societal benefit were not explored. Similarly, Andrada et al. [@andrada_mappingpotential_2023] demonstrated the efficacy of a drone-based lidar system for rapidly and accurately mapping potential wildfire fuel for forest management, but the authors did not quantify the societal benefit from this valuable scientific information.  Such validation studies typically report accuracy scores, e.g., RMSE or AUC, and generally aim to demonstrate the adequacy or superiority of a particular ESI dataset or algorithm over the alternative approach. Importantly, while these studies presented results in terms of scientific value, they did not examine how the improved scientific knowledge would affect the decisions that generate societal benefits - though most included conceptual descriptions of potential decisions or societal value in their conclusions. With often minor additional information or simple economic modeling, many calibration/validation studies could readily translate the improved scientific accuracy of an ESI dataset relative into a hypothetical or realized decision that could be translated into calculable societal benefits.

Our wide-ranging search string resulted in a large corpus of studies identified as potential candidates for inclusion, but recent developments in machine learning (ML) have made such large screening processes much more feasible.  We implemented two distinct ML algorithms in our screening process.  First, for all title/abstract screening, we used the Colandr ML-assisted web-based screening tool [@cheng_usingmachine_2018] which uses machine learning and natural language processing to continually predict and sort citations in order of predicted relevance based on user screening decisions.  Importantly, Colandr does not decide the disposition of a document - the user is intentionally involved throughout and ultimately makes the decision [@cheng_usingmachine_2018].  Second, we generated a training set based on a subset of the full corpus and used this to train an ML algorithm to predict the inclusion/exclusion status of the remaining corpus, identifying nearly 80% of the corpus as likely "excludes."  Because this ML process is recommending the disposition of documents, a low false negative rate (low chance of excluding a relevant document) is critical, though false positives are less problematic, as they are subject to additional human screening.  Because our systematic map focused not on study questions or results (typically foregrounded in the title and abstract) but rather on methods (which are often described only vaguely if at all in the abstract), it was difficult to tune the ML model to reduce the false positive rate; however, for studies focused on top-line results typically described in the abstract, such ML methods would likely be far more discerning.  Increasingly sophisticated ML algorithms and AI tools such as Elicit, OpenAI Deep Research, and SciSpace Deep Review will almost certainly accelerate rapid systematic evidence synthesis, though the threat of a flood of AI-generated fraudulent literature may drive an arms race in how such reviews are conducted [@reynolds_willai_2025].

While our literature search was broad, we restricted it to two databases of academic peer-reviewed literature (Scopus and Web of Science) and the Societal Benefits Library and did not systematically search grey literature sources.  Of the 770 documents identified as candidates for full-text screening, 10 were not retrievable, and 20 more were excluded as not in English; while exclusion of non-English sources could potentially lead to bias, this subset is a tiny fraction of the retrieved papers (2.6%) so omitting these studies is unlikely to substantially affect our results.  We note that many ESI applications may rely on highly derived, modeled, or processed data, such that remote-sensing terms (e.g., "satellite") or the name of the initial sensor (e.g., "Landsat") do not appear in the title, abstract, or keywords, which may limit the citations in our corpus; however, generalizing the search by excluding the ESI terms from the search string would have made the search impossibly large.
