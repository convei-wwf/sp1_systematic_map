We identify the most frequently recurring meanings in the heterogeneous use of different value types and their association with worldviews and other key concepts. From frequent uses, we determine a core meaning for each value type, which is sufficiently inclusive to serve as an umbrella over different understandings in the literature and specific enough to help highlight its difference from the other types of values. Finally, we discuss convergences, overlapping areas, and fuzzy boundaries between different value types to facilitate dialogue, reduce misunderstandings, and improve the methods for valuation of nature's contributions to people, including ecosystem services, to inform policy and direct future research.},

While prior work highlights how such approaches may reveal sensitive information, enable surveillance, and centralize power, less is known about the corresponding privacy concerns, hopes, and fears of the people directly impacted by these policies --- people sometimes referred to as experiential experts. To understand the perspectives of experiential experts, we conducted semi-structured interviews with people living in rural villages in Togo shortly after an entirely digital cash transfer program was launched that used machine learning and mobile phone metadata to determine program eligibility. This paper documents participants' privacy concerns surrounding the introduction of big data approaches in development policy. We find that the privacy concerns of our experiential experts differ from those raised by privacy and development domain experts. To facilitate a more robust and constructive account of privacy, we discuss implications for policies and designs that take seriously the privacy concerns raised by both experiential experts and domain experts.},

  abstract = {Efforts to conserve and restore biodiversity rely on widespread, accurate, and timely monitoring to understand where and how fast biodiversity is changing and develop appropriate responses. The current landscape of biodiversity assessments typically requires time-intensive and costly field surveys that rarely match the pace of monitoring needs. Automated biodiversity monitoring could increase the speed and accuracy at which information on species and ecosystems is gathered, and thus improve the data used in conservation decision making. However, the extent of existing monitoring with these `digital assets' is not well characterized, limiting how and where current data can be used and our understanding of where key gaps remain. Here, we catalog existing digital assets for monitoring living organisms globally, finding that they predominantly come from satellite data (68\%) and monitor plants at coarse taxonomic resolutions. Additionally, the spatial coverage is biased towards regions in North America and Europe, and data availability frequently lags well behind its collection. We also developed a framework to describe key steps in creating digital assets that can be used to identify bottlenecks in their production, and suggest strategies to address barriers. In particular, investing in developing data processing algorithms, building and automating workflows, and increasing accessibility of existing data could help rapidly increase the availability of digital assets for biodiversity monitoring. Accelerating and expanding development of automated biodiversity assessments should pay broad dividends for managing and conserving biodiversity globally.},

  abstract = {Until recently, references to how satellite data have been used were mostly anecdotal, but the true value of the data and these satellite missions was rarely quantified. Resources for the Future (RFF) historically has played an important role in developing methods and establishing knowledge that can help policymakers understand the value of things that are difficult to characterize with a price tag, such as clean water, clean air, and other natural resources. For nearly as long, NASA has been exploring space for the benefit of humanity. Together, RFF and NASA created an initiative to measure the value of satellite information. The Consortium for the Valuation of Applications Benefits Linked with Earth Science (VALUABLES) was a cooperative agreement between RFF and NASA to quantify and communicate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data applications. Satellite data increasingly contribute to decisions that matter for society, whether to manage water resources, wildfire response, conservation efforts, health, air pollution, and more. Measuring the socioeconomic benefits that these Earth observations provide is an important way for scientists to understand and communicate the value of their work and for society to best harness this information and capture its value. VALUABLES developed a rigorous, robust methodology for quantifying the value of information, which can help stakeholders evaluate the benefits of Earth observation data. The methodology is grounded in the basic building blocks of behavioral choice theory, emphasizing the logic of comparing outcomes, with and without availability of the data, to identify actual or prospective benefits of the data itself. The key to understanding the value of satellite information is understanding uncertainty---and quantifying that uncertainty. Getting a handle on a system's inherent uncertainty, and how much measurements from satellites will reduce that uncertainty, is one step in measuring the value of information. Another step is to characterize how that reduction in uncertainty influences decisions and outcomes for people and the environment. This approach can be adapted to various outcomes (e.g., changes in health status, risk, and resource access) at various scales (e.g., spatial, temporal, and functional).},

  abstract = {Ecosystem service research has long been dominated by a monetary interpretation of value, neglecting other social perspectives on the importance of ecosystems for human well-being. Emphasis has been put on individual utility and rational choice, which does not adequately capture the full spectrum of social values of ecosystem services. A socio-cultural approach to value ecosystem services is increasingly advocated and is gaining more attention in the ecosystem service research agenda. The current documentation of socio-cultural perspectives on ecosystem services is, however, characterized by a conflation of the concepts of ``cultural ecosystem services'' and ``socio-cultural values'' of ecosystem services. This paper reviews (i) the concept of socio-cultural values within the ecosystem service framework, (ii) the social and ecological factors that determine socio-cultural values, and (iii) the methods by which socio-cultural values can be assessed. The clarifications of the concept of socio-cultural valuation and the structured listing of the available methods facilitate a better integration of socio-cultural values into ecosystem service assessments and help researchers to choose methods from the available portfolio.},

However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment setting, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.},
