As technological advances increase the cost-effectiveness and capacity for acquisition, storage, and processing of satellite imagery and remote sensing data, ESI will further proliferate in decision support contexts.  For example, Canadaâ€™s WildfireSat constellation of mission-specific microsatellites, slated to launch in 2029, will image the entirety of Canada in near real time to inform wildfire management, potentially saving billions of dollars in avoided damages as wildfire regimes become increasingly extreme [@hope_costbenefitanalysis_2024].  Examining the societal benefits of Earth observation is important to justify existing and future investment [@macauley_valueinformation_2006], promote diffusion of use and applications [@macauley_scienceapplications_2010], and identify gaps and priorities for future applications and missions [@zell_userdrivenapproach_2012; @andries_usingdata_2022]. Methods exist to evaluate ESI contributions across societal benefit areas and value types. However, even as the use of ESI data has grown to encompass a wide range of applications across the globe [@macauley_scienceapplications_2010], published peer reviewed studies that attempt to qualitatively or quantitatively assess these contributions remain rare.

Our systematic map of the literature revealed a large subset of research that demonstrated the scientific value of particular ESI datasets and models but did not proceed to translate this scientific value into explicit societal value. A major impediment to the uptake of valuation methods as applied to ESI may lie in the gap between science and policy. This gap may be attributable in part to lack of in-house social science and policy knowledge to apply valuation methods, and in part to poor engagement between academics and user communities [@perrels_socioeconomicbenefits_2013]. 

As technical capabilities of ESI instruments and machine learning models rapidly increase, opportunities to translate raw observations into actionable intelligence will multiply. Progress in measuring the instrumental, social, and relational value of ESI is essential to informing this work so that societies can mitigate risks and derive the greatest possible benefit.  Here we have identified concrete examples of qualitative and quantitative valuation methods to measure societal benefits of ESI across a range of decision contexts and value types. By doing so, we hope to inspire other ESI researchers to explore the societal benefit of their own work and contribute to a greater network of valuation practitioners.
