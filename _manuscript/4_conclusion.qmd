<!--Where is this paragraph going?  In part, it no longer fits since "instrumental" now contains the old "fundamental" values - Rethink it and its place... maybe this goes in the conclusion, as "potential for future ESI needs to be evaluated in societal benefits, including instrumental, relational (how does this apply to fire management?), and procedural benefits"
-->As advances in electronics and ease of launch bring down costs to put instruments into low earth orbit (Kopacz et al. 2020), microsatellites dedicated to specific missions will become increasingly useful for informing on-the ground decisions and management. For example, Canadaâ€™s WildfireSat constellation of mission-specific microsatellites, slated to launch in 2029, will image the entirety of Canada in near real time to inform wildfire management, potentially saving billions of dollars in avoided damages as wildfire regimes become increasingly extreme (Hope et al. 2024). However, as all this technology opens up new possibilities for management and decision contexts, there will remain a need to weigh the costs against potential benefits to society - many of which are likely to be non-instrumental. Considering societal benefits beyond the merely instrumental will expand the scope of what is deemed worth investing in.

Examining the contributions of Earth observation to societal benefits is important to justify existing and future investment (Macauley 2006), promote diffusion of use and applications (Macauley 2010), and identify gaps and priorities for future applications and missions (Zell et al. 2012, Andries et al. 2022). Methods exist to evaluate ESI contributions across societal benefit areas and value domains. However, even as the use of ESI data has grown to encompass a wide range of applications across the globe (Macauley et al. 2010, From Science to Applications), published peer reviewed studies that attempt to qualitatively or quantitatively assess these contributions remain rare.

Our literature screening process revealed a large subset of research that demonstrated the scientific value of particular ESI datasets and models but did not proceed to translate this scientific value into explicit societal value. A major impediment to the uptake of valuation methods as applied to ESI may lie in the gap between science and policy. This gap may be attributable in part to lack of in-house social science and policy knowledge to apply valuation methods, and in part to poor engagement between academics and user communities (Perrels et al 2013). 

As technical capabilities of ESI instruments and machine learning models rapidly increase, opportunities to translate raw observations into actionable intelligence into measurable societal benefit will multiply, but only if the methods used to apply ESI data are used appropriately. Here we have identified concrete examples of qualitative and quantitative valuation methods across a range of societal benefit areas and value domains. By doing so, we hope to inspire other ESI researchers to explore the societal benefit of their own work and contribute to a greater network of valuation practitioners.
