## Search string

Consolidated search term (January 26, 2024) included several broad topics: Earth science information; a decision context or value analysis; and some notion of societal benefit. Each of these broad topics was encoded as a collection of related terms joined by OR logic to maximize inclusivity within the topic; then the three topics were joined using AND logic to identify papers at the intersection of the three broad topics.

Terms in italics are from the exploratory search on October 25, 2023; terms in bold were added following the use of `litsearchr` R package functionality [@grames_automatedapproach_2019]; terms in bold italics were added following discussion at the American Geophysical Union conference in December 2024.  The final Web of Science search was performed using these search strings on January 26, 2024; the final Scopus search was performed using these search strings on February 4, 2024.

* Earth science information terms: 
    * (_"satellite" OR "space-based" OR "remote observation" OR "remote sensing" OR "earth observation"_ OR __"remotely sens\*" OR "MODIS" OR "Landsat"__ OR ___"GRACE" OR "SRTM" OR "Sentinel" OR "VIIRS" OR "TERRA" OR "CLARREO"___)
* Decision context terms: 
    * (_"decision" OR "optimization" OR "risk analysis" OR "management" OR "policy"_ OR __"cost benefit analysis" OR "benefit cost analysis" OR "investment" OR "contingent valuation" OR "counterfactual"__ OR ___"value chain analysis" OR "multi* criteria analysis" OR "multi* criteria decision analysis" OR "planning" OR "governance" OR "prioritization" OR "impact assessment" OR "impact evaluation" OR "willingness to pay"___)
* Societal benefit terms: 
    * (_"value\*" OR "valuation" OR "benefit\*"_ OR __"utility"__) AND (_"social" OR "societal" OR "cultural" OR "\*economic"_ OR __"environmental" OR "ecosystem service" OR "sustainable development" OR "protected area" OR "heritage site" OR "non use value" OR "capacity building" OR "disaster" OR "water resource\*" OR "climate resilience" OR "air quality" OR "conservation" OR "wildland fire\*" OR "wildfire"__ OR ___"empower\*" OR "power structure\*" OR "justice" OR "equit\*" OR "financial" OR "monetary" OR "health" OR "well-being" OR "livelihood" OR "community-\*" OR "inspiration\*" OR "educat\*" OR "arts" OR "familial" OR "spiritual" OR "religious"___)

## Screening process

## Preliminary screening of spurious matches

An early examination of search results showed that many of the ESI-focused terms resulted in spurious matches, since many of those terms on their own have alternate meanings unrelated to ESI. For example, "satellite" is used to describe sub-nodes in networks such as libraries or medical clinics; in medical research, "sentinel" (relating to the ESA’s Copernicus mission) can refer to lymph nodes and cells observed for early detection of cancers; and "terra" (relating to one of two satellites equipped with MODIS sensors) can be paired with "preta" to describe the carbon-rich black soil found in indigenous regions of the Amazon.
To eliminate some of the most common instances of these spurious matches, we identified a set of terms to be excluded using regular expressions for flexibility; if these terms were removed from titles/abstracts and no other terms in the title or abstract matched other ESI-related terms, then that document would be excluded from further consideration.

* "Satellite" terms:
    * ‘satellite’ plus any of: 'account', 'office', 'laborator(y|ies)', 'campus', '([a-z]+.)?clinic', '([a-z]+.)?hospital', '([a-z]+.)?cent(er|re)', 'lesion', 'nodule', 'mass', 'h(a)?emodialysis'
* "Sentinel" terms (relating to the Sentinel satellites of ESA’s Copernicus programme):
    * 'sentinel' plus any of: 'study', '(lymph.)?node', 'site', '([a-z]+.)?surveillance', 'species', 'behavior', 'catalyst', 'event'
* "Grace" terms (relating to NASA/JPL Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission):
    * 'grace.period'
* "Terra" terms (relating to NASA’s Terra MODIS satellite):
    * 'Terra' plus one of: 'preta', 'nova', 'firme', 'nullius'
* Health terms that frequently showed up in spurious matches:
    * Any of 'cancer’, ‘cardiac’, ‘cardio'

## Screening criteria

Exclusion criteria used in the citation screening (title + abstract) and full text phases:

* ESI data are not used:
    * No relation to Earth science information. For example, spurious matches related to health care remote observation.
    * Related to satellites but not related to information about Earth’s systems. For example, documents relating to space weather, solar or lunar information, or communications/navigation satellites.
* Data are not valued
    * ESI data are used to determine some scientific finding, but the scientific finding is not used to inform a specific societal decision or otherwise valued. 
    * For example, ESI data used to estimate changes in ecosystem service value over time, but the resulting ecosystem service value is not used to inform any management decisions within the paper - i.e., the ESI measurement did not generate value.
* Valued data is not ESI
    * Valuation methods are used in the paper, but applied to data or information other than the ESI. For example, a study that applies a new classification algorithm to the same underlying data; in this case, the additional value is attributable to the algorithm rather than the underlying data.
* Review/opinion
    * Document is a review or opinion piece and does not provide new analysis or new frameworks for valuation.
* Conference abstract/proceedings
    * Document is a conference abstract or proceeding describing presentations rather than published work
* Validation/calibration
    * A special case of "Data is not valued" - ESI data are used to generate scientific information, and this information is compared to some reference to demonstrate scientific value; however, this scientific value is not then translated into societal benefit. 
    * For example, NDVI data is used to estimate land cover, and this result is compared to some alternate information source and shown to be an adequate or even superior proxy, i.e., scientific merit. However, the resulting information is not used to inform a management decision that would translate to some societal benefit.
