> __Figure S1.__ Graphical conceptual summary of cumulative impact calculations.  (A) Stressors are mapped as intensity values on a 10 x 10 km grid, with values ranging from 0 to 1. (B) Each species is vulnerable, to different degrees, to each of the stressors, with vulnerability ranging from 0 to 1. (C) The distribution of each species is mapped as present/absent in each 10 x 10 km grid cell.  Note the colors represent different functional entities. (D) For each species x stressor combination, an impact map is generated as the product of species presence (C), species vulnerability to the stressor (B), and stressor intensity (A). (E) The cumulative impact to each species is the sum of impacts across all stressors. (F) For the species approach, a mean cumulative human impact is calculated as the average cumulative impact across all species present in each cell.  (G) For the functional entity approach, impact values are aggregated to the functional entity level by averaging impact values within each grid cell across all species associated with that functional entity. A functional vulnerability is calculated for each FE/grid cell combination, where a FE with few species is more vulnerable than a FE represented by many species. (H) For the functional entity approach, a mean cumulative human impact is calculated as the average cumulative impact across all functional entities present in each cell, weighted by functional vulnerability. (I) The functional entity impacts and species impacts are compared by taking the difference between the impacts predicted by each method for each grid cell.

> __Figure S6.__ Sensitivity of functional vulnerability (FV) and cumulative human impact (CHI) to trait variation.  Each trait was resampled 1000 times, holding other traits constant, and change in functional vulnerability (A-D) and cumulative human impact (E-H) were recalculated according to the Functional Entity approach.  Functional vulnerability generally increased slightly (A-D, green tones), as resampling tends to create novel trait combinations not found in nature, leading to more low-membership (and thus high FV) functional entities.  The effects of these changes in functional vulnerability on the overall cumulative impact were quite low.

> __Figure S7.__ Trait imputation. A) Missingness of traits for inclusion in functional entities, prior to MICE imputation.  Water column position (`wcol`), log(body length) (`log_l`), trophic level (`troph`), and adult mobility (`adult_mob`) were used to assign species to functional entities; dark boxes represent known values, yellow boxes represent missing values.  Two other traits highlighted in the red box, log(fecundity) (`log_f`) and age to maturity (`age_mat`) were used to assist in imputation where available; color scale represents proportional missingness of those traits for each combination of the other four.  B) After MICE imputation, an additional gapfill step using taxonomic relatives was used.  "None" represents proportion of species successfully imputed by MICE; "genus" represents proportion of species whose traits were gapfilled using the most common values of other species in its genus; and "family" represents the proportion filled using the most common values of other species in its family.
