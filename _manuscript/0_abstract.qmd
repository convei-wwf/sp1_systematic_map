Remotely sensed Earth science information (ESI) has become increasingly central to addressing global challenges, yet its societal value, i.e., the difference it makes in real-world decisions and outcomes, is rarely quantified. In this study, we systematically map peer-reviewed literature that explicitly assesses the societal value of ESI across instrumental, intrinsic, and relational value domains. Drawing from 13,823 publications across Scopus, Web of Science, and a curated library of ESI valuation studies, we identify 170 studies that applied ESI in a decision context and used a valuation method to compare outcomes with and without ESI. The majority of these studies employed decision analysis methods such as Value of Information and Cost-Benefit Analysis, focusing primarily on quantitative instrumental values (e.g., profit, crop yield, lives saved), particularly in agricultural contexts. Studies that applied preference elicitation methods including stated preference, surveys, interviews, and focus groups were able to capture qualitative benefits and relational values including quality of life improvements, empowerment, and procedural justice.  By highlighting the breadth of valuation methods that have been applied to date, we aim to expand our understanding of the societal benefits of ESI to help guide investment in future missions, enhance public support, and ensure that science and policy goals are well aligned.
