Abstract = {The current boom of dam construction at low latitudes endangers the integrity and function of major tropical river systems. A deeper understanding of the physical and chemical functioning of tropical reservoirs is essential to mitigate dam-related impacts. However, the development of predictive tools is hampered by a lack of consistent data on physical mixing and biogeochemistry of tropical reservoirs. In this study, we focus on Lake Kariba (Southern Africa), the largest artificial lake in the world by volume. Kariba Dam forms a transboundary reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and therefore its management represents a socio-politically sensitive issue because the Kariba Dam operation completely changed the downstream hydrological regime. Although Lake Kariba represents a unique and scientifically interesting case study, there is no consistent dataset documenting its physical and chemical behaviour over time. This limits the scope for quantitative studies of this reservoir and its downstream impacts. To address this research gap, we aggregated a consistent database of in situ measurements of temperature and oxygen depth profiles for the entire 60 years of Lake Kariba's lifetime and performed a detailed statistical analysis of the thermal and oxygen regime of the artificial lake to classify the different behaviours of the lake's sub-basins. We demonstrate that the seasonal stratification strongly depends on the depth of the water column and on the distance from the lake inflow. Satellite data confirm these spatiotemporal variations in surface temperature, and reveal a consistent longitudinal warming trend of the lake surface water temperature of about 1.5 degrees C from the inflow to the dam. Finally, our results suggest that the stratification dynamics of the lacustrine sub-basins have the potential to alter the downstream Zambezi water quality. Future research should focus on assessing such alterations and developing strategies to mitigate them.},

Title = {Spatio-Environmental Analysis of Vespula germanica Nest Records Explains Slow Invasion in South Africa},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Social wasp invasions can spread quickly and have serious impacts if they reach new regions with favourable climatic conditions. However, in areas less suitable to them, invasion patterns can show factors that may prevent their spread. We use nest records of the German wasp from the southern tip of South Africa, to map and analyse what habitats they seem to prefer. Factors investigated included temperature, rainfall, and moisture availability. We find that this invasive wasp prefers moister and cooler conditions, and because these habitats are patchy in the region they have invaded in South Africa, they can only spread slowly unassisted, and utmost between 50 and 200 km with the assistance of humans. This is the likely reason for the very slow invasion seen in South Africa. The spatial patterns we quantify here make it possible to use a remote-sensing approach to determine the suitability of an area for future invasions. Predicting the likelihood of invasions will greatly aid management actions. Public awareness around the potential accidental transport of the German wasp and similar species should also be undertaken. Investigating the distributions of invasive species in marginal habitats can give clues to the factors constraining invasive spread. Vespula germanica is the most widely distributed of all the invasive Vespids, which in the Southern Hemisphere typically have large extensive invasive populations. In contrast, the invasion into South Africa has been slow and is still confined to a small geographic area. Here we analyse the distribution of all recent nest records in South Africa (n = 405). The distance to main rivers, mean annual rainfall, summer normalised difference moisture index (NDMI) values, and mean annual temperatures (average, minimum, maximum, and summer maximum temperature) was measured for every nest. We find that value ranges of these variables are different between the value ranges recorded for nests, the general distribution area of the wasp, and the area of absence. Optimised Hot Spot Analysis was used to quantify spatial structure in the measured climatic variables. Generally, factors related to moisture stress set the environmental limits of V. germanica's landscape distribution. Due to the strong preference of nesting sites close to river courses, for higher rainfall conditions, medium to medium-high NDMI values, and lower mean annual temperatures, it is unlikely that V. germanica will be able to spread uniformly where it is currently found in South Africa.},

Abstract = {Due to the explosive increase in the world's population as well as the economic and technological development serving to provide the increasing standard of living, humans intervene more and more into the system and order of nature, therefore causing various damages in the environment. Consequently, damages to the living creatures on some parts of the Earth have become so serious that they endanger the essential elements of the environment that are necessary for living. In order to apply an efficient spatial development policy, the most suitable tools and methods should be found. They should include technical, biological, ecological, legal, official, economic and organizational etc. methods and solutions, i.e. only a systematic approach can lead to success. Based on the above mentioned, elaboration of spatial development strategies is a much more complicated and complex issue than simply development of the economy. The development policy of a given area is a complex of various economic, natural, social coherences, with a special focus on the optimal use of the endogenous resources of the area. In this study we discuss the major relationship and coherences between land-use and the use of space. Based on our former researches, we could observe that in the various development strategies, including the rural development or regional development ones, land is considered as only a resource used in agriculture and its value is calculated primarily based on its agricultural quality. However, nowadays, many researchers are shifting from land-use analysis to the use of space when it comes to endogenous resources and helping to catch up the rural areas.},

Title = {Invertebrate Biosecurity Challenges in High-Productivity Grassland: The New Zealand Example},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {To protect productive grasslands from pests and diseases, effective pre- and at border planning and interventions are necessary. Biosecurity failure inevitably requires expensive and difficult eradication, or long-term and often quite ineffective management strategies. This is compared to the early intervention more likely for sectors where there is public and political interest in plants of immediate economic and/or social value, and where associated pests are typically located above-ground on host plantings of relatively limited distribution. Here, biosecurity surveillance and responses can be readily designed. In contrast, pastures comprising plants of low inherent unit value create little, if any, esthetic interest. Yet, given the vast extent of pasture in New Zealand and the value of the associated industries, these plants are of immense economic importance. Compounding this is the invasibility of New Zealand's pastoral ecosystems through a lack of biotic resistance to incursion and invasion. Further, given the sheer area of pasture, intervention options are limited because of costs per unit area and the potential for pollution if pesticides are used. Biosecurity risk for pastoral products differs from, say, that of fruit where at least part of an invasive pathway can be recognized and risks assessed. The ability to do this via pastoral sector pathways is much reduced, since risk organisms more frequently arrive via hitchhiker pathways which are diffuse and varied. Added to this pasture pests within grassland ecosystems are typically cryptic, often with subterranean larval stages. Such characteristics make detection and response particularly difficult. The consequences of this threaten to add to the already increasing stressors of production intensification and climate change. This review explores the unique challenges faced by pasture biosecurity and what may be done to confront existing difficulties. While there is no silver bullet, and limited opportunity pre and at for improving pasture biosecurity, advancement may include increased and informed vigilance by farmers, pheromone traps and resistant plants to slow invasion. Increasingly, there is also the potential for more use of improved population dispersal models and surveillance strategies including unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as emerging techniques to determine invasive pest genomes and their geographical origins.},

Title = {Genetic Programming Approach for the Detection of Mistletoe Based on UAV Multispectral Imagery in the Conservation Area of Mexico City},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The mistletoe Phoradendron velutinum (P. velutinum) is a pest that spreads rapidly and uncontrollably in Mexican forests, becoming a serious problem since it is a cause of the decline of 23.3 million hectares of conifers and broadleaves in the country. The lack of adequate phytosanitary control has negative social, economic, and environmental impacts. However, pest management is a challenging task due to the difficulty of early detection for proper control of mistletoe infestations. Automating the detection of this pest is important due to its rapid spread and the high costs of field identification tasks. This paper presents a Genetic Programming (GP) approach for the automatic design of an algorithm to detect mistletoe using multispectral aerial images. Our study area is located in a conservation area of Mexico City, in the San Bartolo Ameyalco community. Images of 148 hectares were acquired by means of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) carrying a sensor sensitive to the R, G, B, red edge, and near-infrared bands, and with an average spatial resolution of less than 10 cm per pixel. As a result, it was possible to obtain an algorithm capable of classifying mistletoe P. velutinum at its flowering stage for the specific case of the study area in conservation area with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 96\% and a value of fitness function based on weighted Cohen's Kappa (k(w)) equal to 0.45 in the test data set. Additionally, our method's performance was compared with two traditional image classification methods; in the first, a classical spectral index, named Intensive Pigment Index of Structure 2 (SIPI2), was considered for the detection of P. velutinum. The second method considers the well-known Support Vector Machine classification algorithm (SVM). We also compare the accuracy of the best GP individual with two additional indices obtained during the solution analysis. According to our experimental results, our GP-based algorithm outperforms the results obtained by the aforementioned methods for the identification of P. velutinum.},

Title = {Effects of subsidy and regulation policy on soil and water resources of cotton planted lands in Harran Plain, Turkey},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {120},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) provides essential raw material used in the textile, feed, and vegetable oil sectors. Therefore, it is a strategic crop for agricultural, economic, and political strategies around the world. Accurate monitoring of the changes in the cotton production patterns is crucial for decision-makers. Turkey is among the top ten cotton producers and ranks fourth in the world for cotton imports. One third of the total cotton pro-duction in Turkey comes from the southeastern Anatolia region of the country. This study analyzed the impact of subsidy and regulation policies on fluctuations in cotton production areas and soil and water quality in Harran Plains, southeastern Anatolia region Turkey. Time-series (between 2016 and 2021) satellite images were utilized to determine actual crop rotation in the study area. Turkish Government implemented a new rule for crop subsidies in 2020 which stated that a farmer will be eligible for subsidy for two consecutive years; however the subsidy will not be paid if the same crop is planted in the third year. Cotton was cultivated in 83 \% of the Harran plains prior to new subsidy regulation, which decreased to 26 \% after the new regulation. Sudden decrease in cotton cultivation area clearly indicated that farmers need public support to cover the costs in agricultural production. The Gross Production Value (BPV) for each crop was calculated to determine the impact of subsidy regulation on economic value of crops in the rotation.The GPV in 2020 was 2.903,7 \$ ha(-1) that was 33.6 \% and 20.5 \% lower than 2019 and 2021, respectively. The results indicated that crop subsidies significantly altered the crop selection behavior of farmers. Water requirement of crops in rotation between 2016 and 2021 was calcu-lated to assess the effects of subsidy changes on water consumption. Cotton cultivation over a large part of the plains during the same season caused excessive water consumption, rise in groundwater level over time, soil salinity and severe water erosion. However, cotton cultivation area as well as water consumption in Harran plain new significantly decreased with the new subsidy regulation; therefore, water consumption in 2020 was the lowest among the time frame evaluated. Total sediment losses through surface runoff from the Harran Plain was estimated as 0.83 tons ha(-1) per year. The results revealed that subsidies exert significant impacts on the gross production value in the region, amount of irrigation water consumed, and quality of soil and water resources in addition to the impact on the decision of farmers for crop selection.},

Title = {Assessing the transition from deforestation to forest regrowth with an agent-based model of land cover change for south-central Indiana (USA)},

Abstract = {The Midwest and Northeast United States has experienced a net increase in forest cover since the beginning of the 20th century. However, we lack a detailed understanding of the transition to net forest cover increase because this forest regrowth occurred prior to the use of tools like household-level surveys focused on land use decision-making and availability of remote sensing data. Agent-based modeling presents an appealing means to explore what social and biophysical dynamics may have contributed to this forest regrowth process. In this paper we employ an agent-based model to analyze the process of forest regrowth in south-central Indiana from 1939 to 1993. Simulation results are presented for assumptions regarding pre-existing forest age and the stand age at which landowners harvest timber with a goal of understanding the influence of these factors on future trajectories of land cover change. The results demonstrate both the value and the burden of having many time points to evaluate the success of the model. Is the best simulation the one with the smallest net residuals across all time points? Or is the best simulation the one that best reproduces the correct trajectory of land cover change for each time interval? Model simulations that assume a harvesting frequency of 30 years all produced landscapes within 2\% of the actual forest cover in 1993, the end point of the study period. However, the trajectories of these simulations did not all mimic the gradual forest regrowth found in our observed data. The model simulation with the smallest residual values across all time points assumed a initial forest age of 5 years in 1939 and a harvesting frequency of 30 years. Ultimately, we cannot definitively conclude that one model simulation is a better representation of reality than another because we have no way of comprehensively validating the model assumptions. However, we can more plausibly conclude that the age of forest regrowth in 1939 and the frequency of timber harvesting by landowners both had an influence on the successive trajectory of land cover change in the study area.

Title = {A Review of Nontraditional Teaching Methods: Flipped Classroom, Gamification, Case Study, Self-Learning, and Social Media},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Traditional teaching methods rely solely on the use of textbooks, but teaching effectiveness assessment methods have demonstrated that most students taught by this method do not absorb the course content up to the expected level. Multiple researchers have introduced nontraditional teaching methods, but there is no scientific consensus on the best nontraditional teaching methods that are tailored to learners' abilities while most effectively addressing the course objectives. Therefore, the goal of this review was to address the following questions across all engineering disciplines, based on learners' abilities and the course objectives: (a) What are the benefits of nontraditional teaching methods? and (b) How would you categorize the benefits of nontraditional teaching methods? A qualitative review was conducted to achieve these goals, and the initial search for papers, using relevant keywords, resulted in more than 2000 peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2000 and 2017. A total of 125 peer-reviewed articles pertaining to the most frequently studied nontraditional teaching methods were comprehensively studied and analyzed. The analysis resulted in practical guidelines, including a list of the benefits of the five studied nontraditional teaching methods (flipped classroom, gamification, case study, self-learning, and social media) belonging to four categories: technical/professional, personal skills/ability, personal attitude, and time and space. Based on the results, the authors established significant guidelines for instructors who aim to optimize learners' achievements by adopting the most effective teaching styles, based on their course objectives and the learners' abilities.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal changes in urban green space in 107 Chinese cities (1990-2019): The role of economic drivers and policy},

Abstract = {Urban green space (UGS) has gained increasing attention due to its environmental and social functions. However, the compound effects of climate change, population growth and economic development on UGS are largely unknown. We selected 107 medium-sized and large cities in China to investigate dynamics in the spatial pattern of UGS in relation to government policy and other drivers based on remote sensing data for the period 1990 to 2019. To explore the effect of different levels of urbanization on changes in green space, we develop a new Normalized Urban Development Index (NUDI) to classify urban-suburban-rural gradients, viz. Long-term Builtup, New Built-up and Non-Built-up. Then, we analysed changes over time in the annual peak value of fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) for 380,000 cloud-free Landsat images, and regional UGS dynamics were evaluated using the proposed Regional Greenness Dynamic Index (RGDI). Finally, to reveal the major driver(s) of changes in UGS and estimate the extent to which patterns of urban greening are due to differences in economic development, we compared the observed UGS spatio-temporal dynamics with data on several climatic, social-economic and land use related factors for the same period. The NUDI are shown to be highly effective in mapping urban development gradients, with overall accuracy in the identified classes of 89\%. Annual maximum FVC analysis indicates that there was significant greening between 1990 and 2019 in both the long-term built up (10,667.52 km(2)) and the non-built up areas (529,310.47 km(2)), while there was a major increase in browning (25,110.43 km(2)) in the newly built-up areas. The RGDI results indicate that 65\% (71/107) of long-term built-up areas in cities trended greener over 2010 to 2019 under consideration. At the whole city scale, RGDI is negatively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP), although when considering the long-term built-up areas only, economic growth exhibits a significant positive correlation during 2010 to 2019 (R = 0.62, p < 0.01). This study offers important insights as to the patterns of change in urban greening extent over time and its underyling drivers across urban-suburbanrural gradients against the background of urban expansion, afforestation, climate change and economic development.},

Abstract = {According to the EU Habitats directive, the Water Framework Directive, and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, member states are required to map, monitor, and evaluate changes in quality and areal distribution of different marine habitats and biotopes to protect the marine environment more effectively. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a key indicator of the ecological status of coastal ecosystems and is therefore widely used in reporting related to these directives. Environmental monitoring of the areal distribution of SAV is lacking in Sweden due to the challenges of large-scale monitoring using traditional small-scale methods. To address this gap, in 2020, we embarked on a project to combine Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, novel machine learning (ML) techniques, and advanced data processing in a cloud-based web application that enables users to create up-to-date SAV classifications. At the same time, the approach was used to derive the first high-resolution SAV map for the entire coastline of Sweden, where an area of 1550 km2 was mapped as SAV. Quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the classification using independent field data from three different regions along the Swedish coast demonstrated relative high accuracy within shallower areas, particularly where water transparency was high (average total accuracy per region 0.60-0.77). However, the classification missed large proportions of vegetation growing in deeper water (on average 31\%-50\%) and performed poorly in areas with fragmented or mixed vegetation and poor water quality, challenges that should be addressed in the development of the mapping methods towards integration into monitoring frameworks such as the EU directives. In this article, we present the results of the first satellite-derived SAV classification for the entire Swedish coast and show the implementation of a cloud-based SAV mapping application (prototype) developed within the frame of the project.

Abstract = {Owing to the development of the social economy, the geographical environment and ocean utilization patterns of urban coastal zones have changed. This change, in turn, has influenced the socio-economic development of urban coastal zones. Based on the Geographic Information System technology, the area, coastline length, and shoreland use function of reclamation areas were obtained from the geographic charts (1954-2020) and remote sensing data (1988-2017) of Quanzhou Bay. In this study, we analyzed the geomorphologic change process and the relationship between land use patterns and economic development in Quanzhou Bay from the perspectives of hydrodynamics, sediments, and human activity. Our results indicated that over the past 70 years, the bay area has reduced by 21.5\%. The length of the coastline decreased from 208.36 km in 1959 to 149.11 km in 1988, whereas the shape index of the bay (SIB) decreased from 3.09 to 2.41 during the same period. Between 1988 and 2017, the coastline increased to 162.91 km, causing the SIB to increase to 2.72. The artificial index of the bay increased from 0.28 in 1959 to 0.90 in 2017. The intensity of bay the development (IBD) first increased from 0.27 in 1959 to 0.77 in 2006. During the transition to a more modern society (2006 to present), the IBD slightly decreased to 0.73 in 2017. Affected by human activity, the transformation of the reclaimed land in Quanzhou Bay can be divided into four stages that are closely linked to the economic development in the region. In the early industrialization period, reclaimed land in the region was used for agricultural production, whereas in the mid-industrialization period, it was gradually transformed into a combination of industrial (29.8\%) and agricultural (56.1\%) lands. In the later period of industrialization, the reclaimed land was gradually converted into urban industrial and port lands. Finally, with further refinement and upgrading of economic and industrial structures, the socio-economic and environmental benefits from coastal reclamation projects have been increasing, whereas the proportion of economic benefits (in the total benefits) has been decreasing. The results of this study can provide decision-making references for the optimization of utilization patterns and the economic development of reclamation lands in coastal areas.},

Abstract = {Although the northeastern US includes extensive areas of aggrading forest, uncertainty regarding the intensity and pattern of forest harvesting hampers an understanding of important ecological processes and characteristics such as carbon and nitrogen storage, habitat quality, and forest dynamics, and impedes regional conservation and management planning. Due to the complex ownership pattern dominated by thousands of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners and the difficulty of detecting selective logging using remote sensing, details of the harvesting regime remain largely unknown to the scientific and policy communities. To examine the value of statewide regulatory data for Massachusetts as a unique source of this critical information, we analyzed 17 years of timber harvest data gathered for regulatory purposes for a 168,000 ha forested landscape in Massachusetts that is the focus of concerted conservation planning and intensive study of landscape and ecosystem pattern and process. The North Quabbin Region is heavily wooded with a complicated ownership pattern dominated by over 2500 NIPF owners, three state agencies, and diverse conservation and municipal holdings. The extent and intensity of harvesting were surprising, with an annual disturbance rate of 1.5\% and a mean intensity of 44.7 m(3) ha(-1) (approximately one-fourth of average stand volume). The predominant form of harvesting was selective removal of commercially valuable tree sizes, grades and species (e.g., Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus). The spatial pattern of logging was random with regards to major physical, biological, or cultural factors. However, logging was strongly related to landowner class. NIPF owners control 60\% of the forest area and were responsible for 64.1\% of harvest area, but the highest logging intensity (volume per area harvested; 69.3 m(3) ha(-1)) among major landowners was conducted by the state agency responsible for managing southern New England's largest conservation property, the watershed of Boston's drinking reservoir. This regime of chronic disturbance is occurring over the entire landscape and exerting a major influence on forest composition, dynamics, and habitat quality. However, dispersed selective harvesting is largely unnoticed by residents, is routinely overlooked by ecologists and conservationists, and would remain unrecognized in the absence of this previously unused regulatory data. These results identify the value of regional regulatory spatial information to estimate ecological trends and to assist in conservation planning. Given similarities among ownership and forest patterns for much of the northeastern US, we expect that the broad findings of this study to have regional application. (C) 2002 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The health risks of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient ozone (O-3) have been widely recognized in recent years. An accurate estimate of PM2.5 and O-3 exposures is important for supporting health risk analysis and environmental policy-making. The aim of our study was to construct random forest models with high-performance and estimate daily average PM2.5 concentration and O-3 daily maximum of 8 h average concentration (O-3-8 hmax) of China in 2005-2017 at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. The model variables included meteorological variables, satellite data, chemical transport model output, geographic variables and socioeconomic variables. Random forest model based on 10-fold cross-validation was established, and spatial and temporal validations were performed to evaluate the model performance. According to our sample-based division method, the daily, monthly and yearly estimations of PM2.5 from test datasets gave average model-fitting R-2 values of 0.85, 0.88 and 0.90, respectively; these R-2 values were 0.77, 0.77 and 0.69 for O-3-8 hmax, respectively. The meteorological variables and their lagged values can significantly affect both PM2.5 and O-3-8 hmax estimations. During 2005-2017, PM2.5 concentration exhibited an overall downward trend, while ambient O-3 concentration experienced an upward trend. Whilst the spatial patterns of PM2.5 and O-3-8 hmax barely changed between 2005 and 2017, the temporal trend had spatial characteristics.},

Title = {DESERTIFICATION, CAUSES, EFFECTS, AND COMBATING},

Pages = {670-693},
Abstract = {Desertification is the persistent degradation of dry land ecosystems due to human activities and variations in climate. It is widely recognized that desertification is a serious threat to arid and semiarid environments which cover40\% of the global land surface. While climate oscillations have historically had pronounced effects upon desertification, activities of man during the Holocene have had the most pronounced impacts to induce desertification in the most 10 thousand years. Dry land occupies nearly half of Earth's land area, home to a third of the human population in 2000. Across the world, desertification affects the livelihoods of millions of people who rely on benefits that dry land ecosystems provide. The proximate causes of desertification are dominated by agricultural intensification. Unintended consequences of the so- called Green Revolution, begun in the 1970s has been massive overgrazing, monocropping, excessive tillage practices in agriculture that place soils more vulnerable to wind and surface runoff scouring, salt buildup of irrigated lands, over drafting of groundwater, utilization of lands unsuitable for arable practices and deforestation. Desertification is caused by a combination of social, political, economic, and natural factors which vary from region to another. Policies that can lead to an unsustainable use of resources and lack of infrastructure are major contributors to land degradation. Local adaptation and conservation practices can mitigate some losses of dry land services, but it will be difficult to reverse losses in term of biodiversity and in the provision of food and water which in linked to biodiversity. Desertification assessment has shifted from simple appraisals of inter annual movement of desert boundaries to complex multivariate field surveys, to practical methodologies based on indicators of ecosystem functioning, such as rain use efficiency. Future challenges for properly assessing desertification are the lack of reference situations against which actual desertification could be compared, and the difficulties that appear when desertification operates through structural rather than functional ecosystem change. The exceptional growth of remote sensing tools and the extraordinary development of ecosystem ecology during the last two decades represent a unique opportunity to properly assess desertification all over arid the arid and semiarid world at virtually any reasonable spatial scale.},

Abstract = {Nutrient management is an essential part of watershed planning worldwide to protect water resources from both widespread landscape inputs of nutrients (N and P) and point source emissions. To provide information to regional watershed planners and better understand nutrient sources, we developed the Spatially Explicit Nutrient Source Estimate Map (SENSEmap) to quantify individual sources of N and P at their entry points in the landscape. We modeled seven sources of N and six sources of P across the U.S. Great Lakes Basin at 30-m resolution: atmospheric deposition, septic systems, chemical nonagricultural fertilizer, chemical agricultural fertilizer, manure, nitrogen fixation, and point sources. By modeling these sources, we provide a more detailed view of nutrient inputs to the landscape beyond what would be possible from land use alone. We found that 71\% and 88\% of N and P, respectively, came from agricultural sources. The nature of agricultural nutrient inputs varied significantly across the basin, as relative contributions of chemical agricultural fertilizers, manure, and N fixation changed according to diverse land use practices regionally. We then applied k-means cluster analysis and identified nine Nutrient Input Landscapes (NILs) with N and P source characteristics, grouped into intensive agricultural, urban, and rural landscapes. These NILs can offer insights into landscape variability that land use data alone cannot; within agricultural NILs, application of chemical fertilizer and manure varied greatly, but land uses were similar. These NILs can provide a framework for broadly categorizing watersheds that may prove useful to both ecological and management practices. Plain Language Summary Although plants need nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) for growth, the widespread use of nutrients to boost crop growth has led to serious water quality problems worldwide. Excess nutrients in water bodies disrupt ecosystem balance, allowing intense algae growth, sometimes creating harmful algal blooms that pose threats to human and aquatic life. In addition to using nutrients for crops in the form of chemical fertilizers and manure, other important sources include wastewater treatment plants, septic tanks, lawn fertilizers, and nutrients dissolved in rainfall or bound to settling dust. In order for managers and conservationists to better manage excess nutrients, nutrient ``budgets{''} are often developed for nutrient inflows and outflows to provide a foundation for decision making. In this study, we developed high-resolution maps of nutrient sources across the U.S. Great Lakes Basin as a tool for managers and scientists. These maps, collectively named SENSEmap (Spatially Explicit Nutrient Source Estimate map), integrate data from public databases, scientific publications, and satellite imagery to estimate inputs from seven nutrient sources across portions of eight states. We have analyzed these maps, summing nutrients across small-to-medium watersheds commonly used for management decisions, to gain a broader understanding of nutrient dynamics across the Great Lakes Basin. Key Points We modeled seven sources of N and P inputs at 30-m resolution across the U.S. Great Lakes Basin We identified nine distinct Nutrient Input Landscapes with unique nutrient source characteristics Land use among Nutrient Input Landscapes was similar, suggesting that land use alone does not capture nutrient source dynamics},

Title = {Near-reef and nearshore tropical cyclone wave climate in the Great Barrier Reef with and without reef structure},
Journal = {COASTAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {157},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) coral coverage is in rapid decline from severe and sustained pressures from lagoon water quality, crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), coral bleaching, tropical cyclones, pollution and diseases. The two recent GBR coral bleaching events (2016-2017) lead to Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) shifting their focus from passive management to active intervention (Great Barrier Reef Blueprint for resilience by GBRMPA). These active interventions, potentially able to increase GBR resilience, as there are reefs that, due to their physical location relative to all other reefs, river and estuary entrances, ocean currents, have favourable coral growth conditions. To undertake such interventions, various information is required including tropical cyclone wave climates. This paper develops tropical cyclone wave climates for the entire GBR. These wave climates were developed by simulating several thousand synthetic cyclones derived from the ``HadGEM{''} general circulation model with RCP8.5 climate change scenario. The synthetic cyclones adopted herein include the following climate changes assessed by comparing averages of key forcing parameters between 1950 to 1999 and 2050 to 2099. Their average arrival rate increases from 2.25 to 2.41 cyclones/year and their average maximum wind speed increases from 24 to 28 m/s. Their average radius to maximum winds remains constant at 51 km. Two key challenges were resolved, namely, long runtimes and large files (600 m grid increment covering 1800 km by 280 km). Runtimes were reduced by excluding cyclones where their wind speeds over the entire event never exceeded 10 m/s within GBR itself or within 100 km of the GBR over water. Maximum wave heights were compared with an extended fetch empirical expression, which was based on satellite data of tropical cyclones in open waters, when cyclones were outside the GBR lagoon. These comparisons indicate that predicted wave heights have a lower bias using default wave generation parameters when compared with the extended fetch empirical expression. Prediction uncertainty was estimated at no more than 10\% from various cyclonic windfield models. The existing GBR reefs reduce nearshore wave or runup height by between 1.5 and 2 times compared to the no reef case. The reduction in wave or runup height was found to be minimal for 1 m sea level rise. These two findings indicate that there is more flooding potential from coral removal than SLR within the GBR lagoon.},

Title = {Undamming the Douro River Catchment: A Stepwise Approach for Prioritizing Dam Removal},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dams provide water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation benefits, but also harm native species by altering the natural flow regime, and degrading the aquatic and riparian habitats. In the present study, which comprised the Douro River basin located in the North of Portugal, the cost-benefit assessment of dams was based upon a balance between the touristic benefits of a dammed Douro, and the ecological benefits of less fragmented Douro sub-catchments. Focused on four sub-catchments (Sabor, Tamega, Coa and Corgo), a probabilistic stream connectivity model was developed and implemented to recommend priorities for dam removal, where this action could significantly improve the movement of potadromous fish species along the local streams. The proposed model accounts for fish movement across the dam or weir (permeability), which is a novel issue in connectivity models. However, before any final recommendation on the fate of a dam or weir, the connectivity results will be balanced with other important socio-economic interests. While implementing the connectivity model, an inventory of barriers (dams and weirs) was accomplished through an observation of satellite images. Besides identification and location of any obstacles, the inventory comprised the compilation of data on surrounding land use, reservoir water use, characteristics of the riparian gallery, and permeability conditions for fish, among others. All this information was stored in a geospatial dataset that also included geographical information on the sub-catchment drainage network. The linear (drainage network) and point (barriers) source data were processed in a computer program that provided or returned numbers for inter-barrier stream lengths (habitat), and the barrier permeability. These numbers were finally used in the same computer program to calculate a habitat connector index, and a link improvement index, used to prioritize dam removal based upon structural connectivity criteria. The results showed that habitat patch connectivity in the Sabor, Tamega and Coa sub-catchments is not dramatically affected by the installed obstacles, because most link improvement values were generally low. For the opposite reason, in the Corgo sub-catchment, obstacles may constitute a relatively higher limitation to connectivity, and in this case the removal of eight obstacles could significantly improve this connectivity. Using the probabilistic model of structural connectivity, it was possible to elaborate a preliminary selection of dams/weirs that critically limit stream connectivity, and that will be the focus of field hydraulic characterization to precisely determine fish movement along the associated river stretches. Future work will also include the implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for dam removal or mitigation of the critical structures, as well to define exclusion areas for additional obstacles.},

Abstract = {We present the instrumentation and products of the NASA Plankton Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission relevant to air quality management. Since PACE will launch in the 2022 to 2023 timeframe, we discuss several activities in anticipation of a robust air quality applications program using PACE products. Products from the PACE ocean color imager and two multiangle polarimeters will be used synergistically to retrieve properties relevant to air quality applications. These instruments provide high spectral and spatial resolution measurements used to derive key properties of aerosols and clouds including effective particle radii, particle shapes, aerosol and cloud optical depths, refractive indices and single scattering albedos, all of which are critical for characterizing airmasses for managing air quality, hazardous episodes of wildfire and volcanic emissions, and long range transport of pollution. Because of the number of products with potential societal benefits, the PACE mission is highly pertinent to NASA's Applied Sciences Program's efforts to promote, discover, and demonstrate innovative, practical, and sustainable uses of the Earth observations. We discuss plans to support these efforts by establishing a prelaunch early adopter program and outline communication strategies to engage the air quality user community. (C) The Authors.

Title = {Strategic Planning and Management Model for the Regeneration of Historic Urban Landscapes: The Case of Historic Center of Novi Pazar in Serbia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to identify the role of strategic planning as a sustainable tool for regulating both the protection and development of historic urban landscapes, as well as developing an adequate and effective strategic model and management instruments for implementation. The role and importance of strategic planning are examined in the context of global transformative actions in the urban governance of community and private sector engagement and sustainable development on the local level. We argue that a specific-tailor-made-integrated strategic urban planning approach could be a useful model, both for development and urban regeneration and for the preservation of protected valuable historic urban landscapes, thus contributing to a sustainable urban revival of wider surrounding territories including cultural, social and economic development. We stand on the position that the sustainable approach to the protection and revitalization of the historic urban landscapes has to be in line with the acknowledgment of specific local community values, contemporary needs, their involvement, and, eventually, their satisfaction. The case study method was based on the example of a protected historic center of Novi Pazar in Serbia to test the possibilities of applying strategic planning model and management for the implementation tailored to the local context. Eventually, the scenario method was applied to test the possibilities of a simulation of the strategic planning model and management instruments for a protected historic center. We found that the appropriate combination and utilization of regulatory, economic and informational management instruments have to be in place in the specific context. We conclude and draw out theoretical and practical remarks from our research that integrated strategic urban planning model should consider the logic and the functioning of the competitive real estate markets, and the sustainable environmental, economic and social effects, potentials and benefits for the locality where they originate, in order to be utilized as the new generative value both for the protection and for the revival of historic city centers. The paper develops a conceptual strategic planning and management model for the regeneration of historic urban landscapes that capture the physical, environmental, economic, and social effects and indicators of a given space. Based on this input, an adequate initial stage of the conceptual strategy by the authors of the paper was developed for the regeneration of the historic urban city center.},

Title = {The effects of new energy vehicle subsidies on air quality: Evidence from China},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {120},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Automobile exhaust emissions cause detrimental effect to human health by polluting air. The promotion of new energy vehicles (NEVs) to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions for human health has become an important tool to fight against air pollution. This paper examines the causal relationship between the NEV subsidies in China and air quality through a two-way fixed effects model and a theoretical model. Combining data on staggered prefecture-level city implementation of the subsidies with remote-sensing daily PM2.5 concentration data, we show that the subsidies for NEVs in China significantly improved air quality. The subsidy of NEVs in the private sector (EVPV) reduced PM2.5 concentration by 3\% for the current year and 3.2\% two years after. In particular, the effect of the EVPV implemented two years after increases by 5.7\% with an additional 10,000 people, in-creases by 3.1\% with an additional million civilian cars, increases by 0.3\% with another one key corporation related to NEVs existed in the city, and in medium city, large city, megacity and megalopolis is significantly positive on air quality as compared with that in small city. In addition, the EVPV implemented for the current year and two years after reduce PM2.5 concentration by an additional 1.6\% and 3.4\% if air quality worsens by 25\% in the city, respectively. The subsidy of NEVs in the public sector (EVPB) increased PM2.5 concentration by 4.3\% for the one-year lead and reduced PM2.5 concentration by 5\% for the current year of the policy imple-mentation. The year before implementation of the EVPB significantly increases PM2.5 concentration in medium city, large city and megacity and the EVPB implemented for the current year reduces PM2.5 concentration by an additional 3.2\% if air quality worsens by 25\% in the city. Driving and purchasing restrictions have significant impact on the causal relationship of the EVPB on air quality. Our results remain robust through a series of robustness tests. By developing a theoretical model, we analyze the effect of subsidy policy on air quality as a supplement for empirical results and compare the optimal subsidy intensities for NEVs from the perspectives of consumer surplus, emissions and social welfare. The results indicate that the cost of subsidy policies is lower at the initial stage of the promotion of NEVs, while when consumers begin to accept NEVs widely, the cost of the subsidy policies will increase accordingly.},

Title = {Geospatial information needs for informal settlement upgrading - A review},
Journal = {HABITAT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {122},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Accurate, current and complete information is indispensable for any effective intervention to upgrade a slum or informal settlement. Our involvement in supporting informal settlement upgrades with geospatial information prompted us to investigate what we could learn from literature to improve the collection and representation of geospatial information for such projects. For this paper, we systematically reviewed literature about informal settlement upgrading interventions for which geospatial information was used. We classified the geospatial information into three categories - physical, socio-economic, and boundaries - based on the phenomena they described, and categorized the methods of data acquisition. The results show that most studies collect geospatial information that enumerates and measures empirically observable characteristics (e.g, structures, infrastructure, utility services, mobility network, land description) and characteristics of occupants of informal settlements (e.g., socio-economic status). Fewer studies collected geospatial information about social networks and social ties. Data collection methods ranged from primary sources such as paper-based surveys, handheld/mobile GPS devices, vehicle-mounted cameras, etc., to secondary sources such as spaceborne, airborne and web-based platforms. Few studies made use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), despite their recent popularity as source of base maps, but we expect this to change in the near future. The results can be used to inform data collection strategies for informal settlement upgrades. Policy makers and other stakeholders involved in informal settlement upgrades can benefit from a single source of knowledge about such information.},

Title = {Long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft systems (LE-RPAS) support for humanitarian logistic operations The current position and the proposed way ahead},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMANITARIAN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-25},
Abstract = {Purpose - While the use of long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft systems (LE-RPAS) is frequently associated with military operations, their core capabilities of long-range, low-cost and high-quality optics and communications systems have considerable potential benefit in supporting the work of humanitarian logisticians. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to demonstrate how LE-RPAS could be used to improve the logistic response to a rapid onset disaster. Design/methodology/approach - Using the response to the Cyclone Pam that struck Vanuatu in March 2015 as an example, this paper provides an overview of how LE-RPAS could be used to support the post-disaster needs assessment and subsequent response processes. In addition, it provides a high-level route map to develop the people, process and technology requirements that would support the operational deployment of the LE-RPAS capabilities. Findings - On the basis of the analysis of the published literature and the resultant assessment of the benefits of LE-RPAS to support humanitarian logistic (HL) operations, it is concluded that a formal `` proof of concept{''} trial should be undertaken, and the results be made available to the humanitarian community. Research limitations/implications - This paper is conceptual in nature, but has been developed through an analysis of the literature relating to remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) and HLs. A route map through which the paper's conclusions can be validated is also offered. Practical implications - LE-RPAS have great potential to provide a swifter understanding of the impact of a disaster, particularly those where the location is remote from the main centres of population. This would allow the affected country's National Disaster Management Organisation, together with those of supporting countries, to react more efficiently and effectively. In particular, it would allow a swifter transition from a ``guess-based{''} push approach to one that more accurately reflects the disaster's impact -i. e. a pull-based logistic response. Social implications - Given the military genesis of RPAS, it will be important to ensure that those engaged in their operation are sensitive to the implications of this. In particular, it will be essential to ensure that any humanitarian operations involving RPAS are undertaken in an ethical way that respects, for example, the privacy and safety of the affected population. Originality/value - While there is some emerging discussion on the humanitarian-related use of RPAS in the literature, this generally reflects the operation of small aircraft with limited range and payload capabilities. Useful though such RPAS unquestionably are, this paper expands the discussion of how such systems can support the humanitarian logistician by considering the benefits and challenges of operating long- endurance aircraft.},

Title = {A novel outdoor thermal comfort simulation model for heritage environments (OTC-SM-HE): Verify the effectiveness in Gulangyu, China},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {242},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The study of outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) for heritage environments can offer essential guidance for the articulation of multiple values of cultural heritage and the sustainable development of traditional settlements. However, previous study methods often fail to capture the complexity and diversity of heritage environments completely. This study proposes a novel outdoor thermal comfort simulation model for heritage environments (OTC-SM-HE) based on 3D real scene modeling technology and universal thermal climate index (UTCI). The effectiveness of the model is verified by comparing it with field test data in Gulangyu Island. The results show that: 1) UTCI are calculated by OTC-SM-HE and field testing showed high proximity started at 14:00 or 15:00 in the same space on different dates, respectively. 2) The mean error is 2.02 degrees C of UTCI in the same period and space, and the mean d-index of validation of models is 0.735.3) The similarity of trend duration is 85\% in field test time. Thus, OTC-SM-HE can be shown to be effective in terms of response spatial characteristics, numerical values and variation trends. The establishment of OTC-SM-HE aims to simulate and evaluate the effects of meteorological conditions, shading facilities, and greening measures on the OTC of visitors and residents in different heritage environments. It provides a scientific basis and optimization recommendations for the sustainable management of heritage environments.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity assessment is constitutive in establishing conservation priorities and outcomes, and geodiversity complements species richness as a surrogate in the absence of species data, improves statistical modelling and can facilitate prediction of species distribution and abundance. Yet, geodiversity is frequently excluded, and biodiversity prioritised in conservation endeavours such as ecosystem-based management. Therefore, combined geodiversity and biodiversity assessment approaches present practical benefits to conservation such as improved collaboration between biologists and geoscientists, efficacious indicators of conservation value, and abatement of biodiversity partialities and wider inclusion of geodiversity in conservation literature. This study scientometrically analysed 240 biodiversity assessment publications to investigate geodiversity inclusiveness, methodological trends, geographic trends, environment-type trends and future directions in biodiversity assessment methods. Results showed these species richness articles frequently included geodiversity-relevant terms such as hydrological, soil, geological and geomorphological components, but the all-encompassing `geodiversity' term was absent entirely. Geographic trends showed many potential economic, social, cultural and political factors influencing geodiversity inclusiveness in biodiversity assessment. For example, Australia's relatively resource exploitative approach to geology and early involvement in the inception of the geodiversity concept could explain the high frequency of geological-related terms in Australian biodiversity assessments. Methodological trends showed dominance by field-based biodiversity assessments such as trapping methods, followed transects, quadrats, net methods and observations. Given the specific sample size of literature analysed, inferences from this study relate only to biodiversity assessment methods and not biodiversity discourse in its entirety. Subsequent research could investigate specific factors, such as social, economic or political, and their influence on geodiversity inclusiveness in biodiversity assessment methods.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach based on the differential search (DS) algorithm integrated with the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) winglet design. Design/methodology/approach The winglet design of UAV, which was produced at Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Erciyes University, was redesigned using artificial intelligence techniques. This approach proposed for winglet redesign is based on the integration of ANFIS into the DS algorithm. For this purpose, the cant angle (c), the twist angle (t) and taper ratio (lambda) of winglet are selected as input parameters; the maximum value of lift/drag ratio (E-max) is selected as the output parameter for ANFIS. For the selected input and output parameters, the optimum ANFIS parameters are determined by the DS algorithm. Then the objective function based on optimum ANFIS structure is integrated with the DS algorithm. With this integration, the input parameters for the E-max value are obtained by the DS algorithm. That is, the DS algorithm is used to obtain both the optimization of the ANFIS structure and the necessary parameters for the winglet design. Thus, the UAV was reshaped and the maximum value of lift/drag ratio was calculated based on new design. Findings Considerable improvements on the max E are obtained through winglet redesign on morphing UAVs with artificial intelligence techniques. Social implications The application of artificial intelligence methods could be used in designing more efficient aircrafts. Originality/value The study provides a new and efficient method that saves time and reduces cost in redesigning UAV winglets.},

Title = {A fuzzy-based trust model for flying ad hoc networks (FANETs)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles has significantly increased for forming an ad hoc network owing to their ability to perform in exciting environment such as armed attacks, border surveillance, disaster management, rescue operation, and transportation. Such types of ad hoc networks are popularly known as flying ad hoc networks (FANETs). The FANET nodes have 2 prominent characteristicscollaboration and cooperation. Trust plays an important role in predicting the behavior of such nodes. Researchers have proposed various methods (direct and indirect) for calculation of the trust value of a given node in ad hoc networks, especially in mobile ad hoc networks and vehicular ad hoc networks. The major characteristic that differentiates a FANET from other ad hoc networks is the velocity of the node; as a result, there are frequent losses in connection and topology change. Therefore, the existing methods of trust calculation are not efficient and effective. In this paper, a fuzzy-based novel trust model has been proposed to handle the behavioral uncertainty of FANET nodes. Nodes are classified using a multicriteria fuzzy classification method based on node's behavior and performance in the fuzzy and complex environment. Quality of service and social parameter (recommendation) are considered for evaluating the trust value of each node to segregate the selfish and malicious nodes. With the node classification, FANET nodes are rewarded or punished to transform node behavior into a trust value. Compared with the existing trust techniques, the simulation results show that the proposed model has better adaptability, accuracy, and performance in FANETs.},

Title = {Sentinel-3 OLCI observations of Chinese lake turbidity using machine learning algorithms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {622},
Number = {A},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Turbidity has a substantial effect on light propagation in water and is an optical indicator for monitoring water quality. The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) installed in the Sentinel-3 satellite could help to monitor turbidity variations due to its narrow spectral bandwidth and high revisit time. This makes us develop suitable turbidity algorithms for mapping the dynamics of lake turbidity using OLCI imagery. In this study, a total of 1081 samples were collected from 73 typical lakes across China during 2017-2022. Here, we developed and proposed applicable turbidity algorithms i.e., SR (simple regression), PLSR (partial least squares regression), SVR (support vector regression), BP (backpropagation neural network), KNN (K-nearest neighbor), RF (random forest), and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting), which integrate a broad scale dataset of turbidity ranging from 0.15 NTU to 262.57 NTU using OLCI imagery. The performance results of developed turbidity algorithms demonstrated that RF obtained performed best with good agreements of measured-and derived-fitting (validation dataset: R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 54.32\%, RMSE = 12.65 NTU). This allowed us to estimate turbidity concentration in Chinese lakes with a surface area>20 km2. The averaged turbidity level of lake groups in five lake regions was inves-tigated with a decreased tendency as Northeast Plain Lake Region (NPL, 63.31 NTU) > Eastern Plain Lake Region (EPL, 58.30 NTU) > Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Lake Region (IMXL, 16.64 NTU) > Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau Lake Region (YGPL, 11.63 NTU) > Tibetan Plateau Lake Region (TPL, 7.05 NTU). Further, we analyze the distribu-tions of lake turbidity considering different land use types, and the results showed a decreasing tendency as cropland (56.97 NTU) > barren land (11.22 NTU) > grassland (8.06 NTU) > forest (4.71 NTU). Our results demonstrated and highlighted the quantification of lake turbidity concentrations using OLCI imagery and the stability of the RF algorithm, which can generate turbidity data for large-scale monitoring and decision-making related to environmental protection.},

Abstract = {Purpose Delivery management of perishable products such as blood in a supply chain is a considerable issue such that the last-mile delivery, which refers to deliver goods to the end user as fast as possible takes into account as one of the most important, expensive and, polluting segments in the entire supply chain. Regardless of economic challenges, the last-mile delivery faces social and environmental barriers to continuing operations while complying with environmental and social standards, therefore incorporating sustainability into last-mile logistic strategy is no longer an option but rather a necessity. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to consider a last-mile delivery in a blood supply chain in terms of using appropriate technologies such as drones to assess sustainability. Design/methodology/approach The authors discuss the impact of drone technology on last-mile delivery and its importance in achieving sustainability. They focus on the effect of using drones on CO2 emission, costs and social benefits by proposing a multi-objective mathematical model to assess sustainability in the last-mile delivery. A preemptive fuzzy goal programming approach to solve the model and measure the achievement degree of sustainability is conducted by using a numerical example to show the capability and usefulness of the suggested model, solution approach and, impact of drone technology in achieving all three aspects of sustainability. Findings The findings illustrate the achievement degree of sustainability in the delivery of blood based on locating distribution centers and allocating drones. Moreover, a comparison between drones and conventional vehicles is carried out to show the preference of using drones in reaching sustainability. A sensitivity analysis on aspects of sustainability and specifications of drone technology is conducted for validating the obtained results and distinguishing the most dominant aspect and parameters in enhancing the achievement degree of sustainability. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, no research has considered the assessment of sustainability in the last-mile delivery of blood supply chain with a focus on drone technology.},

Abstract = {Increased exposure to natural hazards in combination with limited preparedness and risk reduction leads to a rapidly growing number of major disasters and loss of property and human lives. The concept of the risk management cycle with the four phases of mitigation and preparedness, early warning, response, and recovery captures the steps necessary to reduce the number and scale of disasters. In many regions, geohazards dominate the spectrum of natural hazards. Understanding the associated processes and gaining a comprehensive knowledge of the location and characteristics of these hazards is pivotal for informed risk management. Over the past few years, initial steps have been taken by members of the former Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership (IGOS-P) Geohazards Theme to make progress towards a Geohazards Community of Practice (GHCP) for the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). A recommendation of the 3rd International Workshop on Geohazards held in 2007 led to the establishment of the Supersite Initiative, which has the goal to ensure for a small number of supersites access to comprehensive data for research related to geohazards. This initiative has established a web page where relevant data are available for a number of globally distributed sites. The GHCP has developed a draft roadmap, which lies the ground for utilizing the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) in support of all phases of the risk management cycle. Although the roadmap focuses on the risk management cycle as it applies to geohazards, it is to a large extent generic and applicable to all hazards considered in the frame of the Societal Benefit Area (SBA) ``Disasters{''} of GEO.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study virtual resistance towards the introduction of Norway's first professional eSport league in the category of sport video games (SVGs), Eserien - the professional FIFA league and its inclusion in the Norwegian Football Federation. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative content analysis of texts published from the first season of Eserien was launched (December 2018) and during the first season of Eserien (April 2019 to December 2019) in Norwegian online spaces. Based on this approach, a total of 23 texts were subjected to a qualitative content analysis. The theoretical framework for the analysis of the material is Guttmann's (1978/2004) characteristics of modern sport and processes of sportification, as well as conceptualizations of the sport-health ideology in national and international sport policies today. Findings The arguments made against the inclusion of the professional FIFA league Eserien as part of the Norwegian Football Federation revolves around three main themes: (1) eSport as something unhealthy and inactive, (2) issues of cheating and match fixing in professional eSports and (3) threats professionalized eSport poses for traditional football clubs and players in terms of securing sponsorship and gaining media attention. Research limitations/implications A limitation is the small sample size consisting of data from the first season of the first professional FIFA league organized by a Norwegian governing sport body. More research is needed to support the results found here, and readers should be careful to transfer the findings from this study to other sporting contexts. Originality/value This study is an empirical exploration of resistance towards eSport expressed by traditional sport fans. These insights expand on existing sport management research on spectators, commercialization and professionalization of eSport.},

Title = {Investigating geometrical characteristics of collapsed pipes and the changing role of driving factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {312},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Determination of the amount (i.e., area and volume) of soil losses due to erosional landforms, especially collapsed pipes, plays a considerable role in different decision-making approaches. Further, mapping the spatial distribution and predicting the volumetric and areal losses of collapsed pipes (CPs) are essential for supporting ecosystem health. The study was conducted in relation to the area and volume of CPs and their related cova-riables. It focused on the estimation of soil losses due to collapsed pipes using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images as well as field covariates at the Chatal Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran. A total of 481 soil samples were collected from homogeneous units with an area of approximately 1,410 ha. The potential relationship between the area/volume of collapsed pipes and land use, several topographic attributes (i.e., altitude, slope, and aspect), and soil properties, including soil stability, soil organic matter, clay, silt, and sand contents were analyzed using five distance-based methods (i.e., kernel density (KD), average nearest neighbor (ANN), spatial autocorrelation, hotspot analysis (HSA), and ordinary least square (OLS) analysis. The average nearest neighbor (Ratio = 0.12, Z score =-20.30, p-value < 0.05) and Moran space solidarity (Moran index = 0.258, Z score = 5.50, p-value < 0.05) showed the cluster distribution of area and volume of CPs. Hot spots and cold spots in the southwestern part of the study area were identified using KD and HSA. The relationship between existing in-dependent and dependent variables (area of CPs) using regression analysis of OLS showed that slope and aggregate stability (> 2.5 standard deviation) had the highest positive relationship with the dependent variable. Regarding the volume of CPs, land use (especially agricultural lands) had the strongest relationship with the dependent variable. Thus, geometrical characteristics of collapsed pipes can be applied as a quantitative indi-cator for the identification of hotspot zones (hazardous areas), land use planning, and erosion hazard mitigation. However, more studies are required to measure geometrical characteristics of soil landforms.},

Abstract = {Landscapes bear witness to past and present natural and societal processes influencing the environment and human livelihoods. By analysing landscape change at different spatial scales over time the effects on the environment and human livelihoods of various external and internal driving forces of change can be studied. This paper presents such an analysis of miombo woodland surrounding the Mkata plains in central Tanzania. The rich natural landscape diversity of the study area in combination with its historical and political development makes it an ideal observation ground for this kind of study. The paper focuses on long-term physical and biological changes, mainly based on satellite information but also on field studies and a review of documents and literature. The miombo woodlands are highly dynamic semi-arid ecosystems found on a number of nutrient-poor soil groups. Most of the woodlands are related to an old, low-relief geomorphology of erosion surfaces with relatively deep and leached soils, or to a lesser extent also on escarpments and steep Inselberg slopes with poor soils. Each period in the past has cast its footprints on the landscape development and its potential for a sustainable future use. On a regional level there has been a continual decrease in forest area overtime. Expansion of agriculture around planned villages, implemented during the 1970s, in some cases equals the loss of forest area (Mikumi-Ulaya), whilst in other areas (Kitulangalo), the pre-independence loss of woodland was small; the agricultural area was almost the same during the period 1975-1999, despite the fact that forests have been lost at an almost constant rate over the same period. Illegal logging and charcoal production are likely causes because of the proximity to the main highway running through the area. Contrasting to the general regional pattern are the conditions in a traditional village (Ihombwe), with low immigration of people and a maintained knowledge of the resource potential of the forest with regards to edible plants and animals. In this area the local community has control of the forest resources in a Forest Reserve, within which the woody vegetation has increased in spite of an expansion of agriculture on other types of village land. The mapping procedure has shown that factors such as access to transport and lack of local control have caused greater deforestation of certain areas than during the colonial period. Planned villages have furthermore continued to expand over forest areas well after their implementation, rapidly increasing the landscape fragmentation. One possible way to maintain landscape and biodiversity values is by the sustainable use of traditional resources, based on local knowledge of their management as illustrated by the little change observed in the traditionally used area.},

Title = {Winter cover crops in Dutch maize fields: Variability in quality and its drivers assessed from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Planting a cover crop between the main cropping seasons is an agricultural management measure with multiple potential benefits for sustainable food production. In the maize production system of the Netherlands, an effective establishment of a winter cover crop is important for reducing nitrogen leaching to groundwater. Cover crop establishment after maize cultivation is obliged by law for sandy soils and consequently implemented on nearly all maize fields, but the winter-time vegetative ground cover varies significantly between fields. The objectives of this study are to assess the variability in winter vegetative cover and evaluate to what extent this variability can be explained by the timing of cover crop establishment and weather conditions in two growing seasons (2017-2018). We used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to construct NDVI time series for fields known to be cultivated with maize within the province of Overijssel. We fitted piecewise logistic functions to the time series in order to estimate cover crop sowing date and retrieve the fitted NDVI value for 1 December (NDVIDec). We used NDVIDec to represent the quality of cover crop establishment at the start of the winter season. The Sentinel-2 estimated sowing dates compared reasonably with ground reference data for eight fields (RMSE = 6.6 days). The two analysed years differed considerably, with 2018 being much drier and warmer during summer. This drought resulted in an earlier estimated cover crop sowing date (on average 19 days) and an NDVIDec value that was 0.2 higher than in 2017. Combining both years and all fields, we found that Sentinel-2 retrieved sowing dates could explain 55\% of the NDVIDec variability. This corresponded to a positive relationship (R-2 = 0.50) between NDVIDec and the cumulative growing degree days (GDD) between sowing date and 1 December until reaching 400 GDD. Based on cumulative GDD derived from two weather stations within Overijssel, we found that on average for the past three decades a sowing date of 19 September ( +/- 7 days) allowed to attain these 400 GDD; this provides support for the current legislation that states that from 2019 onwards a cover crop should be sown before 1 October. To meet this deadline, while simultaneously ascertaining a harvest-ready main crop, in practice implies that undersowing of the cover crop during spring will gain importance. Our results show that Sentinel-2 NDVI time series can assess the effectiveness and timing of cover crop growth for small agricultural fields, and as such has potential to inform regulatory frameworks as well as farmers with actionable information that may help to reduce nitrogen leaching.},

Abstract = {Global aquaculture has grown at a rate of 8.7\% per year since 1970. Particularly along the coasts of tropical Asia, aquaculture ponds have expanded rapidly at the expense of natural wetlands. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the extent and production process of brackish-water pond aquaculture at the NE coast of Hainan, tropical China, (ii) to quantify effluent and organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus export from shrimp and fish ponds and (iii) to trace their effect on the water quality in adjacent estuarine and nearshore coastal waters harboring seagrass meadows and coral reefs. During two expeditions in 2008 and 2009, we determined dissolved inorganic nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), chlorophyll a (chl a) and particulate organic matter (POM) in aquaculture ponds, drainage channels and coastal waters in three areas varying in extent of aquaculture ponds. From the analysis of satellite images we calculated a total of 39.6 km(2) covered by shrimp and fish ponds in the study area. According to pond owners, there is no standardized production pattern for feeding management and water exchange. Nutrient and suspended matter concentrations were high in aquaculture ponds and drainage channels, but varied considerably. The calculated annual export of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and particulate nitrogen (PN) from pond aquaculture into coastal waters was 612 and 680 t yr(-1), respectively. High concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), phosphate and chl a at the majority of the coastal stations point at eutrophication of coastal waters, especially close to shore. Coastal eutrophication driven by the introduction of untreated aquaculture effluents may be especially harmful in back-reef areas, where estuarine retention and mixing with open ocean water is restricted thus threatening seagrasses and corals.

Title = {Coupling large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling: Toward a better comprehension of watershed-shallow lake processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Volume = {564},

Abstract = {Changes in hydrological processes in large watersheds may heavily impact the dynamics of downstream aquatic ecosystems such as lakes and reservoirs. In general, simple approaches that neglect the spatial heterogeneity of watersheds impede understanding of the many processes occurring in these downstream aquatic ecosystems. In most cases, observed river discharges are used as the boundary condition for lake/reservoir modeling, which limits analyses of different situations and of areas that are ungauged or water bodies with little data available. Therefore, coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models seems to be a promising approach to allow one to understand how catchment features (e.g., land use, topography) and river discharges impact the dynamic patterns, including local circulation patterns, water levels and water quality in large water bodies in response to basin-wide forcing factors. In this study, we used a complex, spatially explicit, integrated approach to assess the hydrological responses to external forcing factors such as wind and river discharges, in the hydrodynamics of a large shallow subtropical lake. A large-scale integrated system composed of several sub-watersheds and a lake was analyzed by coupling a large-scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model. Our findings indicated that (i) the integrated model improved the capacity for representing the spatial and temporal variability of lake water-surface levels; (ii) the main hydrodynamic processes (water levels and flow structure) are controlled on a seasonal scale (months) by the river discharges, and on a short time scale (days) by wind influence (intensity and direction); and (iii) the modeling strategy allowed evaluation of anthropogenic stressors such as irrigation withdrawals on lake levels. This approach is an attempt to develop a physically based management model to simulate complex systems as a whole, allowing one to understand the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes and water levels, and accounting for internal (e.g., recirculation, horizontal mixing) and external factors (e.g., anthropogenic stressors, irrigation).},

Title = {Mapping risk factors to climate change impacts using traditional ecological knowledge to support adaptation planning with a Native American Tribe in Louisiana},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {301},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Indigenous communities are often on the front-lines of climate change, and for tribes such as the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe (PACIT) that make their homes and livelihoods in the dynamic landscapes of Coastal Louisiana (USA), sea-level rise, subsidence, and land loss are very real reminders of why they must continue to hone their adaptive capacity that has evolved over many generations and continues to evolve as the pace of change quickens. PACIT members have an inherited wisdom about their surrounding environment and continue to build on that body of observational knowledge that is passed from generation to generation to sustain themselves in this dynamic landscape. This knowledge is woven through their culture and is sometimes referred to as tradi-tional ecological knowledge (TEK). The PACIT and other Indigenous communities around the world are using creative strategies to adapt to the impacts of climate change that include partnering with researchers to combine their TEK with science in approaches to enhance strategies dealing with climate change impacts, mitigation, and adaptation. Tribes and other Indigenous communities often have a strong connection to place that helps to inspire innovative ideas to promote greater sustainability of vulnerable ecosystems and the communities that depend on them, but not the institutional support to implement them. Overcoming this barrier requires a better understanding of their perception of the issues and what they prioritize in sustaining their cultures and the ecosystems on which they depend. Better inclusion of their knowledge into applied research is necessary to support these communities in their efforts to make sure their knowledge is recognized, understood, and valued in environmental management applications. The primary goal for this study was to develop a decision-support tool that aids the PACIT in assessing local ecological change and associated risks to the Tribe's resilience. Using remote sensing datasets and geographic information systems (GIS) processes to represent aspects of the Tribe's TEK to achieve this goal, we developed methods for producing interactive maps that reflect local perceptions of landscape features within the Tribe's ecosystem-dependent livelihood base that contribute most to the com-munity's physical vulnerability to coastal hazards. This case study is offered to consider how Indigenous com-munities like the PACIT are shaping their own coastal hazards mitigation planning efforts in line with their unique needs, cultural practices, and values. The results of this study can provide relevant insight to applied environmental scientists and others working with Indigenous communities that are facing similar circumstances around the world.},

Abstract = {The abandonment of inhabited places is a phenomenon that concerns many countries worldwide and Italy particularly where a large number of deserted settlements are hosted. Many are the factors driving and conditioning the abandonment of a site, such as natural extreme events (e.g. earthquakes, landslides, and floods) and/or human (not) actions. Once the site is abandoned, the built-up area experiences a progressive physical decay so posing problems about the policies to be adopted to manage and maintain the buildings (or their ruins). That being stated, the article proposes an integrated methodological approach to analyse both the natural/human factors causing the abandonment of settlements and conservation state of deserted places over time. To test the methodology, we considered the old town of Craco (Basilicata, Southern Italy) as a case study. That ``ghost town{''}, whose fascinating urban and natural landscapes have been the set of numerous international films, was gradually transferred to other two places since the 1960s due to the landslides that have affected the site over the centuries. Three were the explicit key aims of the research. The first was to scrutinise the activations/reactivations of the landslides jointly with their effects on the built environment so to critical go over the actions put into the field by the institutions to mitigate the hydrogeological risk. The second was to examine whether and how the landslide occurrences conditioned the urban growth of the Craco over time. The third was to investigate in relation to the vegetation growth in the Craco downtown over the last 15 years or so, to infer clues on future decay trends and conservation strategies of the built environment. The purposes were reached considering a geological-geomorphological, historical, and remote-sensing approach. In detail, the first goal was met (re)considering a cross-correlated analysis, in diachronic key, of edited/unedited archive sources with geological/geomorphological perspectives. The second was followed up performing the analysis of the Craco urban growth over the centuries and correlating it with the history of landslide occurrences. The third target was pursued by means of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series obtained from Landsat TM and Sentinel 2 data along with HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) colour system techniques applied to multi-date Google Earth photos. From the perspective angle, the results of this research can contribute to setup proper resilience strategies for sites subject to hydrogeological hazard similar to that affects Craco, thus helping to identify conservation plans as well as enhancement policies of ``ghost towns{''}.},

Title = {Is there a relationship between human population distribution and land surface temperature? Global perspective in areas with different climatic classifications},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Whether pessimistic believing that overpopulation is the ultimate cause of many environmental problems or optimistic arguing for social justice and technological development, studying human population dynamics and their impacts on the environment is an important and ongoing field of study. This type of research should take advantage of the many benefits offered by indirect remote sensing, geographic information systems, and other related disciplines data that are based on relationships developed at the field. Nevertheless, many facets of the subject including the relationship between human population distribution (HPD) and land surface temperature (LST) in areas that have different climatic classifications are still lacking attention. Hence, this study focused on bridging this gap in order to provide supporting scientific evidence for planners and decision makers all over the globe. Four areas that represent the four main populated climate zones were randomly selected. They are: (1) ElSalvador for equatorial climate, (2) Kuwait for arid climate, (3) Lebanon for warm temperate climate, and (4) New Hampshire for boreal climate. For the years 2001, 2009, and 2017 for the four areas, HPD data were obtained from LandScan project while LST data were derived from MOD11C3 product. An integrated framework approach was implemented. This approach included: (1) basic descriptive non-spatial statistics, (2) spatial Global Moran's I Index and Anselin Local Moran's I Index, (3) non-spatial Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and (4) spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM) regressions. It has been observed that the strength and direction of the relationship between HPD and LST do not vary from time to time but vary from climate zone to another. The strongest relationship can be found in boreal climates, followed by warm temperate climates, and then arid and equatorial climates. In boreal, warm temperate, and equatorial climates the relationship is positive while in arid climates the relationship is negative providing indirect supporting evidence for the inversion of surface urban heat islands phenomenon in arid climates. Furthermore, it has been noticed that the relationship between HPD and LST is highly spatially dependent regardless the time and climate zone where some type of spatial diffusion or spillover processes might be present. Still, it is clear that this relationship is complex and not amenable to direct explanation and needs further investigation in order to be explained.},

Abstract = {The Group on Earth Observation (GEO) Model Web initiative utilizes a Model as a Service approach to increase model access and sharing. It relies on gradual, organic growth leading towards dynamic webs of interacting models, analogous to the World Wide Web. The long term vision is for a consultative infrastructure that can help address ``what if{''} and other questions that decision makers and other users have. Four basic principles underlie the Model Web: open access, minimal barriers to entry, service-driven, and scalability; any implementation approach meeting these principles will be a step towards the long term vision. Implementing a Model Web encounters a number of technical challenges, including information modelling, minimizing interoperability agreements, performance, and long term access, each of which has its own implications. For example, a clear information model is essential for accommodating the different resources published in the Model Web (model engines, model services, etc.), and a flexible architecture, capable of integrating different existing distributed computing infrastructures, is required to address the performance requirements. Architectural solutions, in keeping with the Model Web principles, exist for each of these technical challenges. There are also a variety of other key challenges, including difficulties in making models interoperable; calibration and validation; and social, cultural, and institutional constraints. Although the long term vision of a consultative infrastructure is clearly an ambitious goal, even small steps towards that vision provide immediate benefits. A variety of activities are now in progress that are beginning to take those steps. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Monitoring and control of water-ecological space in the Dongting Lake region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {The territorial spatial planning in the new era strengthens the control of different functional spaces and emphasizes integrated and coordinated development of each functional space. Therefore, it is important to monitor the ``structure-function{''} characteristics of water-ecological space based on the context of territorial spatial planning and develop a management and control framework. Based on land use and social statistics, and with the help of ArcGIS analysis, this paper examined the structure and function of the water-ecological space in the Dongting Lake study for 2010, 2015, and 2020, generating a control framework and proposing key initiatives. The main results are as follows: 1) The overall scale of the water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study is over 7,300 km(2). Water bodies had the largest share, followed by coastal terrestrial areas, while the land-water ecotone was the smallest. There was a small decrease in the water ecological space during the study period. Yueyang had the largest overall scale of water ecological space, while Linli had the smallest. 2) The comprehensive function of water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study was about 0.4000, increasing somewhat during the study period. Among the units, the comprehensive function value was highest in Yuanjiang City, while Jincheng City had the lowest. 3) From the structural elements of water ecological space, scientific planning of functional zoning of water ecological space should be carried out and combined with the delineation of ``three zones and three lines.{''} Key initiatives such as multi-scale and multi-level planning and control, use control and access restrictions, determination of water ecological space ownership, pollution control and accountability, and comprehensive water ecological treatment and restoration should be promoted.},

Title = {Impact, efficiency, inequality, and injustice of urban air pollution: variability by emission location},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Reducing exposure to air pollution is an important goal for many local and national governments. Disparities in air pollution exposure by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class are well documented; reducing these disparities is another important policy target. Meeting both goals requires tools to evaluate how emission reduction options affect average exposures and exposure disparities. Here, we consider the role of emission location in implementing control strategies, and investigate the effect of two practical, space-based approaches-low-emission zones and truck rerouting-on diesel particle levels in Southern California. We employ Eulerian grid modeling to explore the impact that emission location has on four outcomes important to policymakers: total pollution exposure, exposure efficiency (i.e. exposure impact per unit emission), exposure inequality (i.e. deviations from exposure being equally distributed across the population; unequal exposure among individuals), and exposure injustice (i.e. associations between exposure and demographic attributes such as race or ethnicity; unequal exposure among groups). Our results highlight potential trade-offs (e.g. an increase in equality but reduction in justice for interventions in some locations) as well as opportunities for `win-win' solutions (locations for which emission reductions would reduce all four target outcomes). We find that a simple, straightforward approach-reducing emissions in neighborhoods with a high proportion of minority residents-may or may not yield the strongest benefits to environmental justice; the reason is that the straightforward approach fails to account for meteorology and where pollution travels after being emitted. In short, we demonstrate an approach that can be used to identify areas in which emissions reductions would have high efficiency and would also result in disproportionately large reductions to average exposure, exposure inequality, and exposure injustice. The approach presented here could be used to design and prioritize local or national emission reduction efforts.},

Abstract = {Malaria risk factor assessment is a critical step in determining cost-effective intervention strategies and operational plans in a regional setting. We develop a multi-indicator multistep approach to model the malaria risks at the population level in western Kenya. We used a combination of cross-sectional seasonal malaria infection prevalence, vector density, and cohort surveillance of malaria incidence at the village level to classify villages into malaria risk groups through unsupervised classification. Generalized boosted multinomial logistics regression analysis was performed to determine village-level risk factors using environmental, biological, socioeconomic, and climatic features. Thirty-six villages in western Kenya were first classified into two to five operational groups based on different combinations of malaria risk indicators. Risk assessment indicated that altitude accounted for 45-65\% of all importance value relative to all other factors; all other variable importance values were < 6\% in all models. After adjusting by altitude, villages were classified into three groups within distinct geographic areas regardless of the combination of risk indicators. Risk analysis based on altitude-adjusted classification indicated that factors related to larval habitat abundance accounted for 63\% of all importance value, followed by geographic features related to the ponding effect (17\%), vegetation cover or greenness (15\%), and the number of bed nets combined with February temperature (5\%). These results suggest that altitude is the intrinsic factor in determining malaria transmission risk in western Kenya. Malaria vector larval habitat management, such as habitat reduction and larviciding, may be an important supplement to the current first-line vector control tools in the study area.},

Abstract = {Multiple models, data services, sensor networks and other information tools are being embedded within complex and sometimes distributed architectures known as information platforms. These information platforms are increasingly being used to model multi-faceted environmental phenomena with one example being the eReefs project which will generate a near real-time view of lagoon water quality for the Great Barrier Reef. Not only may they involve many subsystems which must interoperate but they need to be able to evolve over time as new computational elements, sensor resources, models and datasets become available or cease to exist - for example a satellite's life ending. To cater for both interoperability and evolution, system design must enable Use Cases - certain system behaviour - beyond those typically expected by end users such as data discovery and use. Use Cases for system maintenance, new subsystem addition, subsystem deprecation and overall information platform augmentation must be envisaged, articulated and catered for. For institutionally distributed information platforms such as eReefs, overall management and governance Use Cases are also of particular importance. The Water Resources Observation Network's Reference Model (WRON-RM) provides the primary design framework for eReefs and it specifies six categories of Use Cases relevant to information platforms such as eReefs which were: 1. End User - processes of accessing information from an information platform 2. Data Provision - processes of contributing data to an information platform 3. Functionality Provision - processes of contributing data processing services 4. Enablement and Governance - processes of controlling various components 5. Cross-business Domain Integration - processes enabling integration with external systems 6. System Maintenance - processes associated with maintaining an information platform The WRON-RM is both incomplete and untested with its preface stating: ``It was recognised that Use Cases described in the document did not fully reflect the WRON and that the true Use Cases for the WRON were not well understood. As such, considerable work was going to be necessary to discover, describe and analyse these Use Cases in order to understand their impact on the requirements of the WRON.{''} This paper details how, by designing eReefs, some of that required work has taken place and how through building a concrete implementation of the WRON-RM, the extent to which the categorisation of Use Cases has helped the project. Specifically we relate: how Use Cases received from stakeholders, including most subsystem designers, fitted into the six Use Case categories; how the information platform's Scoping Study (Car et. al., 2012) attempted to express Use Cases in all 6 categories; additions and modifications that have been made to these categories as functional requirements of eReefs have become clearer; specific Use Case examples from each generic category - the WRON-RM's six and additions and finally best practice methods regarding requirements gathering and stakeholder engagement for future information platforms attempting to provider similar functionality to eReefs.},

Title = {Impact of Rainfall Variability and Land Use Change on River Discharge in South Cameroon},

Abstract = {Climate change, variability and anthropogenic forcings such as land use change are the main forcings of river discharge variability. However, an understanding of their simultaneous impacts on river discharge remains limited in some parts of the world. To shed light on this issue, the objective of this article is to investigate the effects of rainfall variability and land use change on river discharge in the Nyong basin (at Olama and Mbalmayo gauging stations) and some of its sub-basins (So'o and Mefou) over the long period 1950-2018. To achieve this goal, hydro-meteorological data of the Nyong basin and sub-basins were analyzed using the Pettitt test. Likewise, land use changes in the basin and sub-basins were also analyzed using supervised classifications of Landsat satellite images of the basins at different periods (1973, 2000 and 2018). On the annual scale, rainfall has decreased statistically over the studied basins. In the large basins (Olama and Mbalmayo), this decrease in rainfall is synchronous with that of discharges, while it is concomitant with an increase in the Mefou (small basin). After the ruptures within time series identified in the annual modules, the extreme discharges (maximum and minimum) decreased in Olama; in Mbalmayo, the maximum discharges remained stable while the minimum discharges decreased. On the other hand, the maximum and minimum discharges have significantly increased in the Mefou. The stability of maximum discharges at Mbalmayo and the increase in extremes on the Mefou in a context where the precipitation that generates the discharge has decreased can be attributed to land use change. These changes are essentially marked by an increase in impervious areas and a reduction in forest cover. On the seasonal scale, the impact of precipitation in the dry season is visible on the flows of the rainy seasons that follow them on the large basins (Olama and Mbalmayo). Between the decades 1970-1990 and 2000-2010, there was respectively a significant increase, then a decrease in summer precipitation, which impacted the autumn discharges in the same direction. Conversely, between the same intervals, there was a significant decrease, then a slight increase in winter precipitation. The impact of winter precipitation on the spring discharge is more visible during the first period only (1970-1990). During the second period, winter precipitation seems to have more of an impact on the runoff for the same season. In the Mefou sub-basin, the precipitation plays an essentially amplifying role in the increase in discharge in the seasons during which they occur. Those having experienced an increase, or a maintenance of precipitation (summer and spring) recorded the most significant increases in discharges. These results could be useful for long-term planning on the demand and use of water, as well as flood management in the basins},

Abstract = {Landslide susceptibility (LSI) modeling of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya is performed by integrating 28 causative factors on C-28(28) combinations on Geographical Information System (GIS) following analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based multicriteria decision protocol, logistic regression (LR)-based multivariate technique, machine learning data-driven random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods wherein the terrain is classified into `None' (with: 0.0 < LSI <= 0.17), `Low' (with: 0.17 < LSI <= 0.34), `Moderate' (with: 0.34 < LSI <= 0.51), `High' (with: 0.51 < LSI <= 0.68),'Very High' (with: 0.68 < LSI <= 0.85) and `Severe' (with: 0.85 < LSI <= 1.00) susceptible zones as validated through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing comparison with the 30\% landslide inventory test data. The best integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of 0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like population density, number of households, building types, building height and building density has demarketed approximately 21\% of the region under `Very High' to `Severe' socioeconomic risk zone while about 36\% area are classified under `Very High' to `Severe' structural risk zone as implicated by devastating landslide hazards in the region. Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in the `Very High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones wherein near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the `Low to Moderate' landslide susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the `High' landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the `Very High to Severe' landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s(2) and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the `High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper explores the domain of the symbolic imaginary to comprehend the mechanisms and effects of neoliberal deregulation (anomie) and reckless capital accumulation within and external to the US imperial core with special emphasis on the war on terror, the figure of the suicide bomber, and the internal manifestations of social liquidation in the appearance of the rampage shooter. The concept of the piacular developed by Durkheim is expanded to demonstrate the contrast between the ``variable{''} or human forms of terror with ``constant{''} or mechanized form of the piacular as it appears in the form of the unmanned aerial vehicle or drone. The apparently disconnected image of the drone flying around up there somewhere in the clouds is intimately connected with seemingly unrelated phenomenon of mass murdering martyrs and fanatics down here on the ground. Lastly, the prospects for an anti-drone movement are touched upon and suggested as a fulcrum point from which to ``touch{''} the synthetic point where terror, rampage, and revenge unify. Methodology/approach - Unique to this paper is the development of a dialectical, formal, conceptual ``geometry{''} rooted in Durkheim's classic analysis of suicide for disclosing the hidden analogs obtaining in the relationship between suicide bombings and rampage shootings and their conceptual fusion in the form of the unmanned aerial vehicle or drone. Findings - Capitalism linked to global defense and security operations produces its own terrifying nemeses as both causes and effects. Rather than something that has to be defeated, terror is an enemy that cannot be defeated but neither can it prevail against an empire. Likewise, the rampage shooter is not merely an individual in need of psychiatric care but a product of domestic policies that sacrifice everything for security and war. These two figures are ``mirror opposites{''} or speculative doubles of one another, which when we attempt to comprehend the image of the seemingly unrelated drone machine what were find is the unexpected synthesis of the twin logics of terror and rampage at work in the sky. Social implications - If people hope to live in a society ruled democratically rather than imperial subjects they must know where to apply moral and political leverage. Suicidal bombers and lone shooters are definite problems, but focusing on the defects of individuals diverts the critical gaze from the larger problem of foreign policy, domestic austerity, and, perhaps, the war on the drone represents a unique opening within the aggregate system to push back against the abstract, imperial system of global and domestic hegemony. Originality/value - This paper represents a new and unique synthesis of Durkheimian and interpretive sociologies with various strands of critical social theory providing new optics for the analysis of international terrorism, domestic mass murders, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the wars on terror.},

Abstract = {Land-use decisions are usually made on the basis of a variety of criteria. While it is common practice to integrate economic, ecological and social (triple bottom line) criteria, explicit geoscientific factors are relatively rarely considered. If a planned land use involves an interaction with the geosphere, geoscientific aspects should be playing a more important role in the process. With the objective to facilitate a sustainable land-use decision-making a research project was initiated. The area around the city of Zaragoza, in the Ebro Basin of northern Spain, was chosen due to its high degree of industrialisation and urbanization. The area is exposed to several geohazards (e.g., sinkholes and erosion) that may have significant negative effects on current and future land uses. Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies are used to process the complex geoscientific information. Further GIS analysis comprised the creation of an erosion susceptibility map that follows the ITC (International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation) system of terrain analysis. The agricultural capability of the soil was determined using the Microleis System. We identify geomorphologic units that show high susceptibility to erosion and high agricultural potential and suggest a method to implement this information in a land-use planning process. Degraded slopes developed upon Tertiary rocks show the highest susceptibility to erosion and low values of agricultural capability, whereas the flat valley bottoms and irrigated flood plains have the highest values of agricultural capability.

Title = {SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF LAND USE/LAND COVER AND TIMBER CARBON STORAGE: A CASE STUDY FROM BULANIKDERE, TURKEY},
Booktitle = {GEOINFORMATICS FOR NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {215-247},
Abstract = {Land use/land cover change (LULCC) is regarded as the most important variable of global change affecting ecological systems with an impact on natural resources including soil and water quality, global climatic system and biodiversity. Quantification of landscape patterns through various landscape metrics can be used to describe whether the landscape pattern is changing and how, and this information may then be used to evaluate alternative ecosystem management activities and environmental conservation strategies. To analyze the spatial and temporal pattern of land use/land cover change in a forest planning unit, Bulanikdere, northwestern corner of Turkey, was selected as a case study area. The main data used in this research are forest cover type maps at 1/25 000 scale for years 1985 and 2003, their inventory data, two Landsat satellite image acquired for the years 1987 (TM), and 2000 (ETM+). Landsat TM (1987) and Landsat ETM+ (2000). The spatial and temporal analysis of the forest structure was carried out in a systematic process. First of all, the stand type maps 1985 and 2003 were digitized, rectified and the spatial database was build with ArcGIS 8.3 (TM). Second, Landsat TM and ETM+ images of 1987 and 2000 were rectified and classified to create land use/land cover type maps. Third, spatial and temporal land use/land cover changes as well as transition of cover types were analyzed with GIS. Fourth, the fragmentation of the areas was evaluated with FRAGSTATS (TM). Last, spatially explicit estimates of the carbon storage (aboveground and belowground) was determined and mapped with GIS according to inventory data for years 1985 and 2003. When both approaches were evaluated together, between 1985 and 2003 years, forest areas decreased from 7432.9 ha to 7351.5 ha according to stand type maps from management plans. On the contrary, between 1987 and 2000 years, forest areas increased from 7049,4 ha to 7456,7 ha according to land cover type maps from the classified images of Landsat TM and ETM+. During the whole study period, the average annual deforestation rate based on stand type map was 5 ha year(-1), equivalent to 0.06\% year(-1) using the compound-interest-rate formula. Landscape analysis indicate that the forest landscape has been gradually fragmented and thus subjected to susceptibility of the area to further abrupt changes ill the future. It was estimated that forest ecosystems in Bulanikdere forest planning unit contain 304 264.3 tons of carbon above and below the ground according to the methodology used in this article in 1985. Though 263 895.9 tons of whole carbon storages in forest ecosystem are aboveground, the rest (40 368.4 tons) are belowground. However, it was estimated that forest ecosystems contain 510 030.1 tons of carbon with 443 032.5 tons aboveground and 66 997.6 tons of carbon belowground in 2003. As shown, carbon storages increased 205 765.8 tons during an 18 year period. There were apparent trends in the temporal structure of forest landscape, some of which may issue from unregulated management activities, social conflict and demographic movement. The study revealed that it is important to understand both spatial and temporal changes of land use/land cover and their effects on landscape pattern to release the implications for landscape planning and ecosystem management.},

Abstract = {Monitoring ecological indicators is important for assessing impacts of human activities on ecosystems. A means of identifying and applying appropriate indicators is a prerequisite for: environmental assessment; better assessment and understanding of ecosystem health; elucidation of biogeochemical trends; and more accurate predictions of future responses to global change, particularly those due to anthropogenic disturbance. The challenge is to derive meaningful indicators of change that capture the complexities of ecosystems yet can be monitored consistently over large areas and across time. In this study, methods for monitoring indicators of land cover (LC) and forest change were developed using multi-sensor Landsat imagery. Mapping and updating procedures were applied to the Humber River Basin (HRB) in Newfoundland and Labrador, one of four test sites in Canada selected for testing the development of national-scale methods. Procedures involved unsupervised clustering and labeling of baseline imagery, followed by image-to-image spectral clustering to derive binary change masks within which new LC types were classified for non-baseline imagery. Updated maps were compatible with the baseline map and reflected change in LC for three time periods: 1976-1990, 1990-2001, and 2001-2007. From the LC products, several change indicators were quantified including: forest depletion, forest regeneration, forest change, net forest change, and annual rates of change. The procedures were validated using field plots to assess the accuracy of the 2007 LC product (74.2\% for 10 LC classes) and change classes observed from 2001 to 2007 (87.8\% for four change classes: depletion, regeneration, non-treed class no change, and treed class no change). Methods were considered to be highly efficient and operationally feasible over large areas spanning multiple Landsat scenes. Specific results for the test site provided trend information supporting land and resource management in the HRB region. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {PurposeConnecting autonomous drones to ground operations and services is a prerequisite for the adoption of scalable and sustainable drone services in the built environment. Despite the rapid advance in the field of autonomous drones, the development of ground infrastructure has received less attention. Contemporary airport design offers potential solutions for the infrastructure serving autonomous drone services. To that end, this paper aims to construct a framework for connecting air and ground operations for autonomous drone services. Furthermore, the paper defines the minimum facilities needed to support unmanned aerial vehicles for autonomous logistics and the collection of aerial data. Design/methodology/approachThe paper reviews the state-of-the-art in airport design literature as the basis for analysing the guidelines of manned aviation applicable to the development of ground infrastructure for autonomous drone services. Socio-technical system analysis was used for identifying the service needs of drones. FindingsThe key findings are functional modularity based on the principles of airport design applies to micro-airports and modular service functions can be connected efficiently with an autonomous ground handling system in a sustainable manner addressing the concerns on maintenance, reliability and lifecycle. Research limitations/implicationsAs the study was limited to the airport design literature findings, the evolution of solutions may provide features supporting deviating approaches. The role of autonomy and cloud-based service processes are quintessentially different from the conventional airport design and are likely to impact real-life solutions as the area of future research. Practical implicationsThe findings of this study provided a framework for establishing the connection between the airside and the landside for the operations of autonomous aerial services. The lack of such framework and ground infrastructure has hindered the large-scale adoption and easy-to-use solutions for sustainable logistics and aerial data collection for decision-making in the built environment. Social implicationsThe evolution of future autonomous aerial services should be accessible to all users, ``democratising{''} the use of drones. The data collected by drones should comply with the privacy-preserving use of the data. The proposed ground infrastructure can contribute to offloading, storing and handling aerial data to support drone services' acceptability. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, the paper describes the first design framework for creating a design concept for a modular and autonomous micro-airport system for unmanned aviation based on the applied functions of full-size conventional airports.},

Abstract = {Transformation is a total transition process from a form into a new figure which can be interpreted as the final stage of a process where space and time become greatly affect the changes to the ultimate stage. Changes are done by giving the response of the influence of external and internal elements that will lead to a change of shape that has been known previously. The title of ``education city{''} to the city of Bandung past of history of its establishment. Education in Bandung began to show its development since the establishment of Hollandsch Inlandsche Kweekschool, shortened into HIK48, on May 13, 1868. It was established by some important figures, among others, were R. H. Muhammad Musa. Meanwhile, higher education began to grow since the establishment of Technische Hoogeschool (abbreviated as THS) in 1920 as part of the Ethical Policy of the Dutch Government to its colony. So since then, the life of higher education in the city of Bandung continues to grow and increase. THS is a forerunner to the birth of Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB now). The purpose of this study is to establish the theory that can explain how the transformation of urban space in Balubur Tamansari in Bandung City, so it can be seen adjusting the physical setting of the region as the city's identity. The research method used was a qualitative grounded theory research method, the approach is focused on the discrete phenomenon in the field in order to disclose the meaning of the background of the city region space. This phenomenon was appointed through a process of snowball sampling. The process of data collection, analysis and theory building will be done at the same time in a period of time and iterative of process. This research generates knowledge building based on the knitting of the value system, the activity of perpetrator and physical setting in the region.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider the evolution of quantitative accounting of social indicators for measuring societal progress and sustainable development, with particular reference to economic analysis and social indicators. We examine the use of the System of National Accounts and introduce the concept of using input-output analysis for the development of social indicators. The use of satellite accounts for input-output analysis of environmental impacts and the development of environmental footprints has been well documented. The novelty of this paper is the use of a methodology frequently used to develop environmental indicators to quantify social impacts and to further the development of social footprints. We provide a case study of the use of social satellite accounts for labour, using multi-regional input-output analysis to develop a global inequality footprint for labour embodied in trade, and argue the case for the development of a system of social economic accounts, similar to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 2012. This work contributes to the development of social valuation metrics as a means for measuring societal progress and developing sustainability indicators for use in management and decision-making.},

Title = {Coral assemblages are structured along a turbidity gradient on the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico, Veracruz},

Abstract = {Corals on the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico have evolved on a terrigenous shallow continental shelf under the influence of several natural river systems. As a result, water turbidity on these reefs can be high, with visibility as low as < 1 m, depending on reef location and season. Using a presence-absence species database from field surveys, literature search, and satellite data on sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a, the coral species composition and environmental variables were analyzed for the three main reef systems of the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Completeness of the data set was assessed using species accumulation curves and non-parametric estimators of species richness. Differences in coral assemblages' composition between the reef systems were investigated using univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (nMDS, ANOSIM, SIMPER) analyses and the relationship between the assemblages and environmental data was assessed.using a forward selection process in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to eliminate non-significant environmental variables. The northern and central Veracruz reef systems share a similar number of coral species (p=0.78 mult. comp.) and both showed higher species richness than the southern system (p < 0.001 mult. comp.). In terms of the assemblages' structure, significant differences were found (ANOSIM R=0.3, p=0.001) with larger average dissimilitude between north-south (75.4\% SIMPER) and central-south (74.2\%) than north-central (27\%) comparisons. Only environmental variables related to water turbidity and productivity were significant on the final CCA configuration, which showed a gradient of increasing turbidity from north to south. Reef geomorphology and the effect of turbidity help explain differences in coral assemblages' composition. More studies are necessary to establish if turbidity could function as a refuge for future environmental stress. Each Veracruz reef system is at the same time unique and shares a pool of coral species. To protect these ecosystems it is necessary to effectively manage water quality and consider coral diversity on the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.},

Abstract = {IMproving PRedictions and management of hydrological EXtremes (IMPREX) was a European Union Horizon 2020 project that ran from September 2015 to September 2019. IMPREX aimed to improve society's ability to anticipate and respond to future extreme hydrological events in Europe across a variety of uses in the water-related sectors (flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, agriculture, navigation, hydropower and water supply utilities). Through the engagement with stakeholders and continuous feedback between model outputs and water applications, progress was achieved in better understanding the way hydrological predictions can be useful to (and operationally incorporated into) problem-solving in the water sector. The work and discussions carried out during the project nurtured further reflections toward a common vision for hydrological prediction. In this article, we summarized the main findings of the IMPREX project within a broader overview of hydrological prediction, providing a vision for improving such predictions. In so doing, we first presented a synopsis of hydrological and weather forecasting, with a focus on medium-range to seasonal scales of prediction for increased preparedness. Second, the lessons learned from IMPREX were discussed. The key findings were the gaps highlighted in the global observing system of the hydrological cycle, the degree of accuracy of hydrological models and the techniques of post-processing to correct biases, the origin of seasonal hydrological skill in Europe and user requirements of hydrometeorological forecasts to ensure their appropriate use in decision-making models and practices. Last, a vision for how to improve these forecast systems/products in the future was expounded, including advancing numerical weather and hydrological models, improved earth monitoring and more frequent interaction between forecasters and users to tailor the forecasts to applications. We conclude that if these improvements can be implemented in the coming years, earth system and hydrological modelling will become more skillful, thus leading to socioeconomic benefits for the citizens of Europe and beyond.},

Abstract = {Land degradation (LD) is one of the most catastrophic outcomes of long-lasting drought events and anthropogenic activities. Assessing climate and human-induced impacts on land can provide information for decision makers to mitigate the effects of these phenomena. The Northeastern region of Brazil (NEB) is the most populous dryland on the planet, making it a highly vulnerable ecosystem especially when considering the lingering drought that started in 2012. The present work consisted of detecting trends in biomass {[}leaf area index (LAI)] anomalies as indicators of LD in NEB. We also assessed how the loss of vegetation impacts the LD cycle, by measuring trends in albedo and evapotranspiration (ET). LAI, albedo and ET data were derived from MODIS sensors at 8-day temporal and 500 m spatial resolutions. For precipitation anomalies, we relied on CHIRPS-v2 10-day temporal at 5 km spatial resolution data. For detecting trends, we applied the Theil-Sen slope analysis on time series of MODIS LAI, albedo and ET images. Trend analysis was performed for the periods ranging from 2002-2012 (no severe droughts) to 2002-2016 (including the last drought). LAI trends were more pronounced and had a stronger signal than ET and albedo, therefore, LAI was our choice for mapping LD. The first analysis highlighted the human-induced LD prone areas whereas the last detected drought-induced LD prone areas. Considering only the trending areas, which was about 23.4\% of the total, 4.5\% of this area has undergone human-induced degradation whereas drought was responsible for 73\%, although, not mutually exclusive. As reported in the literature and official data, grazing intensification might be a factor driving human-induced degradation. We noticed that the range of variation of LAI is narrow and even narrower for albedo, which demonstrates that land surface response is more influenced by soil reflectivity rather than the characteristic sparse vegetation coverage (LAI ranging from 0.04 to 0.4 in the Caatinga biome), which can barely alter albedo. Finally, the effects of LD on ET anomalies were assessed by Granger causality and impulse-response analyses as means to link land surface feature changes to the hydrological cycle. Albedo had a slightly weaker impulse than LAI on ET whereas precipitation played a major role. These relations are site-specific and, land surface features (biomass and albedo) showed to have a more substantial influence on ET in severely degraded areas. We concluded that drought led to trends indicating LD prone areas in NEB and the degradation cycle has positive feedback derived from ET reduction resulting in an increased net moisture deficit, although the latter statement has yet to be further investigated. The study warns of the desertification risk that NEB is facing and the need for the authorities to take action to mitigate degradation and drought effects on both traditionally surveyed (desertification nuclei) and newfound LD prone areas. We also highlight the limitation of confirming LD, as to date there is no post-drought data available and, lessons learned from the Sahel case make us cautious about claiming that an area is in fact degraded.},

Title = {Waking the Sleeping Giant: Agricultural intensification, extensification or stagnation in Mali's Guinea Savannah},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {58-70},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The World Bank argued that West Africa's Guinea Savannah zone forms part of ``Africa's Sleeping Giant,{''}where increases in agricultural production could be an engine of economic growth, through expansion of cultivated land in sparsely populated areas. The district of Bougouni, in southern Mali, falls within this zone. We used multiple data sources including a panel survey, remote sensing-based land cover classification, population data, and farmer focus group discussions, to investigate whether the area is following a commonly-described pathway of agricultural intensification due to increasing land scarcity. We then used our understanding of historical change to explore plausible future pathways. Bougouni forms part of the expansion zone of the CMDT, which since the mid-1980s has provided support for intensive agricultural systems of cotton-maize rotations with animal traction and use of mineral fertilizer. In the period of the panel survey (1994-2012), cropped land at household level was correlated with household size: households with less than one full team of draft oxen cultivated 0.50 ha/family member, while households with two or more teams cultivated 0.82 ha/family member (R-2 > 0.8). At the village level, cropped land increases varied with the amount of remaining available land and the importance of off-farm income. We see some intensification in maize and cotton, and corresponding improvements in food self-sufficiency. However, despite increasing fertilizer use, average maize and cotton yields remain around 1600 and 900 kg/ha respectively, well below national averages. Other crops are still grown in outfields relying on long fallows with limited nutrient inputs. Thus rather than either intensification or extensification the agricultural situation may be best described as stagnation. This may be due to limited incentives to invest in agriculture when compared to opportunities such as gold mining or small businesses, which (in 2012) contribute at least 25\% of household income to ten out of 29 households. In future, cropland expansion will likely continue, which could lead to increased conflict between farmers and transhumant herders, and could lead to increased inequality at village level. Factors mitigating the tendency to land expansion include opportunities for off-farm income and migration, or market opportunities and capacity to produce high-value crops such as mango, cashew, or vegetables. This could preserve some remaining savannah area for grazing use and conservation purposes. Understanding household livelihood systems as part of a network of complex social and ecological factors allows the identification and exploration of multiple viable pathways towards desirable futures.

Title = {Intricacies of medical drones in healthcare delivery: Implications for Africa},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, can play a critical role in delivering health care. In this paper, we reviewed the literature to ascertain (1) the various medical supplies delivered by drones, (2) the challenges to the successful use of medical drones and (3) the potential benefits of medical drones. Implications for the African context is then provided. In achieving this objective, we employed a systematic literature review methodology and defined search strings, searched for relevant literature from PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases following a review protocol. The snowball technique was similarly used to search for other papers as well. A total of 17 out of 69 papers were included in the review after screening and applying a quality appraisal criterion. The results indicate that blood, AEDs, drugs, vaccines, and laboratory test samples etc were identified as part of the medical supplies aerially delivered by drones. Regulations, cost, misuse (evasion of people's privacy) and psychological effect on people who experienced drones used for bombing are part of the challenges that could result from using the technology for delivery of medical supplies. The benefits derived from drones range from reducing response times during health emergencies thus helping to save more lives, to being environmentally friendly as the CO2 emissions levels are lower than conventional delivery by trucks and cars. In conclusion, drone technology has opened a new phase for the health sector and to sustain this technological innovation in Africa, there is the need for inclusive innovation to make drones safer and acceptable. This could be achieved by developing the needed policy framework with the regulators, providing other health resources to complement the use of drones, embarking on sensitizations on the usefulness of drones through cultural underpinnings of rural communities about drones and training the needed health personnel to handle dispatches of medical supplies with drones.},

Title = {AIRBORNE LIDAR IN SUPPORT OF COASTAL MAPPING AND HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING},
Booktitle = {GEOMATIC SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {175-195},
Abstract = {Tidal zones are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. They play a number of keys roles with respect to the fauna and flora they host by recycling organic matter, and also by providing spawning, hatching and feeding grounds for marine species as well as birds. However they are being strongly impacted by human activities while their social value to mankind is not fully acknowledged. The last two severe oil spills that affected the coastal zone of France (Erika, Prestige) aroused a renewed interest for the coastal zone. This trend was supported by strong incentives by European regulations, namely the Habitats and Water framework directives. This new situation revealed a dramatic lack of knowledge of our tidal areas. Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that uses the return time of backscattered laser light to measure ground elevation with high efficiency and accuracy. The geometry of the airborne system is very precisely controlled by a GPS and an inertial navigation system. The rate of coverage is up to 40 km(2) per hour and the dot density reaches more than one per m(2). Horizontal and vertical accuracies are respectively about 30 cm and 15 cm on bare ground. Over the last few years, the use of LIDAR has become more common in integrated coastal zone management. Detailed mapping of the elevation of tidal areas has brought about advances in many applications, among which: - Hydrodynamic modelling, which is based on fine knowledge of the bathymetry. Modelling is an essential tool to simulate the dispersion and fate of contaminants run off from watersheds into the coastal zone or to assess the trophic capacity of coastal waters with respect to shellfish farming. Modelling can also be used to model sediment removal, transport and deposition. Several LIDAR surveys have recently been carried out in various sites of the French coast where hydrodynamic models using cell size in the range of 30m are operational such as Mont Saint Michel and Morbihan bays. - Tidal habitats mapping needs detailed knowledge of both the relief and facies. Since 2004, the French benthic monitoring network Rebent has been dealing with the detailed inventory of a network of coastal sites. By jointly interpreting elevation data from LIDAR and airborne ortho-imagery with the help of ground truth data, maps were produced describing sediment facies and habitat units to a high level of detail. Combined with a tidal model, a LIDAR terrain model also yields the flooding frequency, a key driver to the presence of sea weed belts or salt marsh vegetation. - Coastal morpho-dynamics are concerned with understanding coastline and seashore changes under natural or human pressure. Natural events include storm surges or sea level rise, while human impact can be from coastal developments or aggregate extraction but also from bio-deposition in shellfish fanning areas. Repeated LIDAR surveys would allow monitoring the rate of erosion/deposition on our coasts, hence providing help to risk management.},

Title = {Optimization of an extended H-infinity controller for unmanned helicopter control using Multiobjective Differential Evolution (MODE)},
Journal = {AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {87},
Number = {4},
Pages = {330-344},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a multiobjective differential evolution (MODE)-based extended H-infinity controller for autonomous helicopter control. Design/methodology/approach - Development of a MATLAB-based MODE suitable for controller synthesis. Formulate the H-infinity control scheme as an extended H-infinity loop shaping design procedure (H-infinity-LSDP) with incorporation of v-gap metric for robustness to parametric variation. Then apply the MODE-based algorithm to optimize the weighting function of the control problem formulation for optimal performance. Findings - The proposed optimized H-infinity control was able to yield set of Pareto-controller candidates with optimal compromise between conflicting stability and time-domain performances required in autonomous helicopter deployment. The result of performance evaluation shows robustness to parameter variation of up to 20 per cent variation in nominal values, and in addition provides satisfactory disturbance rejection to wind disturbance in all the three axes. Research limitations/implications - The formulated H-infinity controller is limited to hovering and low speed flight envelope. The optimization is focused on weighting function parameters for a given fixed weighting function structure. This thus requires a priori selection of weighting structures. Practical implications - The proposed MODE-infinity controller algorithm is expected to ease the design and deployment of the robust controller in autonomous helicopter application especially for practicing engineer with little experience in advance control parameters tuning. Also, it is expected to reduce the design cycle involved in autonomous helicopter development. In addition, the synthesized robust controller will provide effective hovering/low speed autonomous helicopter flight control required in many civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Social implications - The research will facilitate the deployment of low-cost, small-scale autonomous helicopter in various civilian applications. Originality/value - The research addresses the challenges involved in selection of weighting function parameters for H-infinity control synthesis to satisfy conflicting stability and time-domain objectives. The problem of population initialization and objectives function computation in the conventional MODE algorithm are addressed to ensure suitability of the optimization algorithm in the formulated H-infinity controller synthesis.},

Title = {Neural network based redesign of morphing UAV for simultaneous improvement of roll stability and maximum lift/drag ratio},
Journal = {AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Purpose The aim of this paper is to redesign of morphing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using neural network for simultaneous improvement of roll stability coefficient and maximum lift/drag ratio. Design/methodology/approach Redesign of a morphing our UAV manufactured in Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Erciyes University is performed with using artificial intelligence techniques. For this purpose, an objective function based on artificial neural network (ANN) is obtained to get optimum values of roll stability coefficient (C-l) and maximum lift/drag ratio (E-max). The aim here is to save time and obtain satisfactory errors in the optimization process in which the ANN trained with the selected data is used as the objective function. First, dihedral angle () and taper ratio () are selected as input parameters, C{*}(l) and E-max are selected as output parameters for ANN. Then, ANN is trained with selected input and output data sets. Training of the ANN is possible by adjusting ANN weights. Here, ANN weights are adjusted with artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. After adjusting process, the objective function based on ANN is optimized with ABC algorithm to get better C-l and E-max, i.e. the ABC algorithm is used for two different purposes. Findings By using artificial intelligence methods for redesigning of morphing UAV, the objective function consisting of C{*}(l) and E-max is maximized. Research limitations/implications It takes quite a long time for E-max data to be obtained realistically by using the computational fluid dynamics approach. Practical implications Neural network incorporation with the optimization method idea is beneficial for improving C-l and E-max. By using this approach, low cost, time saving and practicality in applications are achieved. Social implications This method based on artificial intelligence methods can be useful for better aircraft design and production. Originality/value It is creating a novel method in order to redesign of morphing UAV and improving UAV performance.},

Title = {The Role of UAS-GIS in Digital Era Governance. A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) technologies, also known as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) and GIS (Geographic Information System) are recognised for the value of the results that can be achieved by their combined use. However, their use and the results achieved are rarely framed within the context of Digital Era Governance (DEG), an undertaking that would significantly reduce the capabilities of knowledge transfer from the academic and/or private environment to the public domain. The purpose of this study was to highlight, by a bibliometric analysis, the areas of proposed use of this team of tools and the extent to which these can enter the sphere of interest of public administrations, especially local ones. From a methodological point of view, based on the 439 articles filtered from the Web of Science database where UAS/UAV and GIS technologies were used, several bibliometric analyses have emerged. VOSviewer and R (Bibliometrix tool) were used to conduct the bibliometric analyses. Most scientific publications that used UAV technology as a working tool have predominant applicability in photogrammetry, while GIS applications are found in publications dedicated to image processing, landslides, and cultural and archaeological heritage. We point out that from the point of view of international cooperation, at the level of institutions or countries, certain international organisations from the USA, China, and the central and northern European states have a high interest in this topic, and a low cooperation between academia and public administration is exhibited. The conclusion is represented by the apparent lack of framing of the results of UAS-GIS technologies usage into wider and more topical contexts, such as digital era governance, and also a reduced applicability of the research results.</p>},

Title = {High-frequency time series comparison of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites for mapping open and vegetated water across the United States (2017-2021)},

Volume = {288},

Abstract = {Frequent observations of surface water at fine spatial scales will provide critical data to support the management of aquatic habitat, flood risk and water quality. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites can provide such observations, but algorithms are still needed that perform well across diverse climate and vegetation conditions. We developed surface inundation algorithms for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively, at 12 sites across the conterminous United States (CONUS), covering a total of >536,000 km2 and representing diverse hydrologic and vegetation landscapes. Each scene in the 5-year (2017-2021) time series was classified into open water, vegetated water, and non-water at 20 m resolution using variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as variables derived from topographic and weather datasets. The Sentinel-1 algorithm was developed distinct from the Sentinel-2 model to explore if and where the two time series could potentially be integrated into a single highfrequency time series. Within each model, open water and vegetated water (vegetated palustrine, lacustrine, and riverine wetlands) classes were mapped. The models were validated using imagery from WorldView and PlanetScope. Classification accuracy for open water was high across the 5-year period, with an omission and commission error of only 3.1\% and 0.9\% for the Sentinel-1 algorithm and 3.1\% and 0.5\% for the Sentinel-2 algorithm, respectively. Vegetated water accuracy was lower, as expected given that the class represents mixed pixels. The Sentinel-2 algorithm showed higher accuracy (10.7\% omission and 7.9\% commission error) relative to the Sentinel-1 algorithm (28.4\% omission and 16.0\% commission error). Patterns over time in the proportion of area mapped as open or vegetated water by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithms were charted and correlated for a subset of all 12 sites. Our results showed that the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithm open water time series can be integrated at all 12 sites to improve the temporal resolution, but sensor-specific differences, such as sensitivity to vegetation structure versus pixel color, complicate the data integration for mixed-pixel, vegetated water. The methods developed here provide inundation at 5-day (Sentinel-2 algorithm) and 12-day (Sentinel-1 algorithm) time steps to improve our understanding of the short- and long-term response of surface water to climate and land use drivers in different ecoregions.},

Abstract = {While educators teach their students about decision making in complex environments, managers have to deal with the complexity of large projects on a daily basis. To make better decisions it is assumed, that the latter would benefit from better understanding of complex phenomena, as do students as the professionals of the future. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of the use of simulation games for learning skills at the University. The conjecture is that complex adaptive systems can be simulated by games, in which players are able to experience the system workings, and retrieve more insight in their complex behaviour as a result. In this case we refer to its demonstration in virtual environments in 3D space representing the reality and simulating learning environments. These tools are being used in the development of the project Simul@: ``Evaluation of a Simulation Technological Environments for the Learning of Transversal Competences at University{''} (ref. EDU2008-01479); Simul@ is a research project oriented to develop transversal competences of university students. The main aim of this project is to prove the efficiency of the technological environments based on simulations in work-related environments in the learning of transversal competences at University (concretely self-management, and Teamwork) and it is for this reason that experimentation with learning spaces based on technological tools of simulation becomes essential. We are using virtual world as experimental training environment. Virtual world based games are goal oriented and take place within limitations of the rules of the game. The social aspect supports game play although there are ``serious games{''} where the focus is on learning and collaboration. In addition to this, when the use of the virtual world is a new experience for the students, the virtual world constitutes a collaborative learning activity that contributes to socialisation between students. The experimentation with these spaces and tools for simulation will allow students to improve competences and construct knowledge. The information generated in the process will contrast and account for their efficiency in the acquisition of transversal competences. It also seeks to explore the affordances of this kind of 3D virtual world and examine ways in which students practise their future work in a simulated environment. Based on this study, we will present indications of learning and conclusions on how simulation games can provide insights in transversal competences and be used to educate both students and professionals.},

Title = {Societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in European Seas},

Abstract = {Society's needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Promise and Paradox: Why Improved Knowledge of Plate Tectonics Has Not Yielded Correspondingly Better Earthquake Hazard Maps},
Booktitle = {PLATE BOUNDARIES AND NATURAL HAZARDS},
Series = {Geophysical Monograph Book Series},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {219},
Pages = {123-148},
Abstract = {The discovery of plate tectonics in the 1960s offered the promise of a physical foundation for earthquake hazard assessment. The relative motion of tectonic plates concentrates stress along plate boundaries, where most earthquakes occur. Steady plate motions load plate boundary faults at constant rates, leading to cycles of stress buildup and release. Hence it seemed reasonable to expect quasi-periodicity in the recurrence time of large earthquakes, so if some segments of the plate boundary faults have not produced a large earthquake in the recent past, they are ``seismic gaps{''} where a quake is due or overdue. In subsequent years, knowledge of the geometry and rates of plate motions has improved dramatically, in part due to the advent of space-based geodesy and recognition that many plate boundaries are diffuse zones. Similarly, advances in seismological data and methods provide much more information about what happens in large earthquakes. Paradoxically, even given all this knowledge, reliably assessing earthquake hazards remains difficult. Although earthquake hazard maps often do a good job of describing what occurs, in other cases large earthquakes occur in unexpected places and/or produce greater-than-expected shaking. The locations, times, and magnitude of large earthquakes turn out to be highly variable. Some of the variability can be addressed by using longer time series and knowledge of plate motions, but some reflects not-yet-understood and likely chaotic behavior. As a result, some key parameters required for earthquake hazard maps are poorly known, unknown, or unknowable. Although maps may be improved by better estimating some parameters, the fact that others cannot be much better estimated limits how good maps can be. Hence, in addition to trying to better assess hazards with new data and models, we can do better by recognizing and communicating the uncertainties involved. Agreed methods can be developed to assess how well a map performed, whether one map performed better than another, and when and how to update maps. Mitigation policies can be developed by considering the costs and benefits of various strategies, to yield sensible policies given the unavoidable uncertainties in hazard estimates. Thus, although from a scientific standpoint hazard maps can be viewed as half-empty glasses that we hope to fill somewhat further, from a societal view these maps can be viewed as glasses already half full.},

Title = {A systematic literature review on the main factors for public acceptance of drones},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Drones have become usual among the civilian population and are enabling cities to be more interconnected and intelligent. However, few studies about the public's opinion on drones have been conducted and those are usually particular for a certain country or region. Knowledge of public opinion is crucial for guiding government policies, particularly on new technologies. This work aims to conduct a systematic review to identify the civilian public attitude toward drones and to assess the main factors that influence opinion. A total of 30 studies were included in the review, analyzing public opinion regarding drones in 15 countries. The review shows that public opinion is influenced by socio-cultural aspects, the main perceived risks and the main expected benefits. Sociocultural factors were related to demographic aspects, such as geographic location, technological expertise, and familiarity with drone-related terminology. The main perceived risks included drone misuse, privacy disrespect, malfunction, damage, safety, noise and legal liability. The main expected benefits, such as application flexibility, emergency response and monitoring, cost reduction and safety, are also described. This review may orient future qualitative and quantitative research on public acceptance of drones and guide researchers and decision makers on drone use by describing the influencing factors on the population's perceived benefits and risks.},

Abstract = {India is looking for rejuvenating its sagging agricultural production and productivity by integrating high technology space inputs for both irrigated and rainfed areas. The Earth Observations (EO) products today serve as major inputs to policy, planning and targeted interventions, contributing to building social capitals, natural resources assets and environmental gains on the long-term basis. The benefits are mostly indirect and often difficult to quantify in terms of money. The cost benefit analysis of EO products is therefore an involved exercise and not many examples exist globally. The present paper, taking into account major national as well as some local level agriprojects in India, highlights the criticality of EO products in terms of their short-term as well as long-term economic and social values. Three aspects viz., catalytic, timeliness and enabling have been analyzed to visualize the role of EO products in a holistic fashion. In the catalytic role, EO inputs have been found to play a role in the successful implementation of major natural resources development projects. The cost of EO inputs may be of less than 2-5\% to the total cost of the development projects, but the nature of such inputs are critical and catalytic. For example, a major project on reclamation of around 0.6 Mha sodic soils in Indo-Gangetic Plans costs US\$89 million where EO products costs less than 2\%; but demonstrates their catalytic roles in terms of identification, monitoring and evaluation and as inputs to mid-course corrections. The second aspect is timeliness in terms of opportunity cost. In India, Forecasting Agricultural Output Using Space-borne, Agro-meteorological and Land Observations (FASAL) project is carried out for in-season multiple crop production forecasting in support of strategic decision on trade, price and procurements. In the past, timely forecasts from FASAL have been found to be accurate and helpful for the country to plan many of its activities, including taking early decisions on wheat import to meet the shortfalls. The enabling role EO products have been demonstrated in several projects especially those related to building physical and social infrastructure and also natural resources assets building. The cost effective role EO has played in the watershed development planning and implementation in India, including improving the livelihoods as well as natural resources assets building, is one success story worth emulating in many developing countries. The most important aspect, however, is how the information is put to use for decision making and actual ground level implementation. The paper attempts to provide a glimpse of these aspects in a coherent fashion. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper will discuss the role of small entrepreneurial companies and business to business (B2B) collaborations to advance the circular economy (CE). The authors will share insights from a U.S.-based research project that examined the drivers, barriers and opportunities for advancing waste repurposing and product reuse/remanufacturing. Many large companies fail to incorporate CE principles into their business strategy due to costs, logistical hurdles and lack of mandates. This presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models to fill the gap and provide critical links for corporations in reverse supply chains while creating new business opportunities with social benefits. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on empirical study of six large corporations with zero waste goals and six entrepreneurs focused on product reuse/remanufacturing or waste repurposing. Some of the participating companies include Dell Technologies, Raytheon, Waste Management, First Solar, Circular Blu, and Seeding Labs. Data was collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with senior managers or founders. The study employs a theoretical model for developing a life cycle management strategy proposed by Sanchez et. al. (2004) and the circular business canvas model (Levandowski, 2016), wherein the authors analyze the emerging drivers, current barriers and future opportunities for business to advance the CE. Findings: The study found that despite the lack of federal regulations in the U.S. a growing number of companies are forming partnerships to reduce waste and advance product reuse or remanufacturing. Key drivers for such trends include customer demands, corporate sustainability commitments and state-level mandates. Technology also plays a critical role in reducing transaction costs and supporting social-marketing strategies and partnerships. Research/practical implications: The study contributes to the research on the relationship between entrepreneurial innovation and the development of CE principles within corporate supply chains, a field that is still in its infant stage (Heshmati, 2015). The study offers valuable lessons for entrepreneurs interested in developing viable business models around product reuse, remanufacturing or waste repurposing. Future research should consider comparing B2B collaborations in the U.S. and Europe to analyze the similarities and differences in business strategies for advancing the CE. Originality/value: This paper provides insights into a field that is still greatly underdeveloped - the role of environmental entrepreneurs entering a new market space based on collaborations with large corporations to advance product reuse/remanufacturing or waste repurposing that promote the circular economy.},

Title = {Towards an operational irrigation management system for Sweden with a water-food-energy nexus perspective},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {271},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The 2018 drought in Sweden prompted questions about climate-adaptation and -mitigation measures - especially in the agricultural sector, which suffered the most. This study applies a water-food-energy nexus modelling framework to evaluate drought impacts on irrigation and agriculture in Sweden using 2018 and 2019 as case studies. A previous water-food-energy nexus model was updated to facilitate an investigation of the benefits of data-driven irrigation scheduling as compared to existing irrigation guidelines. Moreover, the benefits of assimilating earth observation data in the crop model have been explored. The assimilation of leaf area index data from the Copernicus Global Land Service improves the crop yield estimation as compared to default crop model parameters. The results show that the irrigation water productivities of the proposed model are measurably improved compared to conventional and static irrigation guidelines for both 2018 and 2019. This is mostly due to the advantage of the proposed model in providing evapotranspiration in cultural condition (ETc)-driven guidelines by using spatially explicit data generated by mesoscale models from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. During the drought year 2018, the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to irrigation scenarios based on conventional irrigation guidelines. Nevertheless, the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10\% and 60\% as compared to conventional irrigation scenarios. During a normal year, the proposed irrigation management system leads to significant water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines. The modelling results show that temperature stress during the 2018 drought also played a key role in reducing crop yields, with yield reductions of up to 30\%. From a water-food-energy nexus, this motivates the implementation of new technologies to reduce water and temperature stress to mitigate likely negative effects of climate change and extremes. By using an open-source package for Google Earth (R), a demonstrator of cost-effective visualization platform is developed for helping farmers, and water- and energy-management agencies to better understand the connections between water and energy use, and food production. This can be significant, especially during the occurrence of extreme events, but also to adapt to the negative effects on agricultural production of climate changes.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use an ABC algorithm to improve the thrust-torque ratio of a rotating-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) model. Design/methodology/approach The design of UAVs, such as aircraft, drones, helicopters, has become one of the popular engineering areas with the development of technology. This study aims to improve the value of thrust-torque ratio of an unmanned helicopter. For this purpose, an unmanned helicopter was built at the Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Erciyes University. The maximum thrust-torque ratio was calculated considering the blade length, blade chord width, blade mass density and blade twist angle. For calculation, artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was used. By using ABC algorithm, the maximum thrust-torque ratio was obtained against the optimum input values. For this purpose, a model with four inputs and a single output is formed. In the generated system model, optimum thrust-torque ratio was calculated by changing the input values used in the +/- 5\% range. As a result of this study, approximately 31\% improvement was achieved. According to these results, the proposed approach will provide convenience to the designers in the design of the rotating-wing UAV. Findings According to these results, approximately 31\% improvement was achieved, and the proposed approach will provide convenience to the designers in the design of the rotating-wing UAV. Research limitations/implications It takes a long time to obtain the optimum thrust-torque ratio value through the ABC algorithm method. Practical implications Using ABC algorithm provides to improve the value of thrust-torque ratio of an unmanned helicopter. With this algorithm, unmanned helicopter flies more than ever. Thus, the presented method based on the ABC algorithm is more efficient. Social implications The application of the ABC algorithm method can be used effectively to calculate the thrust-torque ratio in UAV. Originality/value Providing an original and penetrating a method that saves time and reduces the cost to improve the value of thrust-torque ratio of an unmanned helicopter.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution has brought a strong focus on public health and environmental quality in China because of its adverse effects. To evaluate the effect of technological and social development on environmental quality in China, it's in urgent need of understanding the long-term spatiotemporal trend of PM2.5 concentrations. In this paper, satellite-derived annual mean PM2.5 estimates (1998-2016) were validated using groundbased PM2.5 measurements (2015-2016) and then used for spatiotemporal trend analysis. The results indicated that national mean PM2.5 concentrations in China increased primarily before 2008, and then decreased. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration is high level in the east and while low in the west of Heihe-Tengchong Line in China. Our findings provided a profound understanding of PM2.5 variations and affirmed the effectiveness of implemented measures of reducing PM2.5 loadings in China, offering important reference data for relevant policy making of air pollution prevention in the future.},

Abstract = {Dams are essential structures in the growth of a region due to their ability to store large amounts of water and manage it for different social activities, mainly for human consumption. The study of the structural behavior of dams during their useful life is a fundamental factor for their safety. In terms of structural monitoring, classic terrestrial techniques are usually costly and require much time. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology through the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique has been widely applied to measure millimeter displacements of a dam crest. In this context, this paper presents an investigation about the structural monitoring of the crest of the Sanalona dam in Mexico, applying two geodetic satellite techniques and mathematical modeling to extract the risk of the dam-reservoir system. The applicability of the InSAR technique for monitoring radial displacements in dams is evaluated and compared with both GPS systems and an analytical model based on the finite element method (FEM). The radial displacements of the Sanalona dam follow a seasonal pattern derived from the reservoir level, reaching maximum radial magnitudes close to 13 mm in November when the rainy season ends. GPS recorded and FEM simulated maximum displacements of 7.3 and 6.7 mm, respectively. InSAR derived radial displacements, and the reservoir water level presented a high similarity with a correlation index equal to 0.8. In addition, it was found that the Sanalona dam presents the greatest deformation in the central zone of the crest. On the other hand, based on the reliability analysis, the probability of failure values lower than 8.3 x 10(-2) was obtained when the reservoir level was maximum, which means that the radial displacements did not exceed the limit states of the dam-reservoir system in the evaluated period. Finally, the extracted values of the probability of failure demonstrated that the Sanalona dam does not represent a considerable risk to society.},

Abstract = {Sustainability is an emerging concept in product chains and integrates environmental, social, and economic aspects during the product's life cycle. Recently, the demand for environmental quality has required information about the products' life cycle. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) includes the inventory analysis, where the inputs, outputs and feedback mechanisms of matter and energy for each phase of the product life cycle are systematized, and the Life Cycle Impact Assessment, when the environmental impacts potentials are calculated. A powerful tool to describe the history, use, and location of a product is called geotraceability. This paper presents an environmental life cycle management for storing and retrieving product life cycle data within a food chain (tracing), as well as following the location of the product in real time (tracking), particularly for recall operations in case of a crisis. Information about inputs and outputs can be structured and integrated through LCA. Geographic information can be obtained from satellite imagery and positioning systems. The development and integration of these tools will add value to products and enhance food safety to consumers, as well as the environmental quality within the production area, fostering environmental sustainability to the product life cycle.},

Title = {Mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of alkaline lake sediments to trace origin, depositional processes, and anthropogenic impacts: Inle Lake (Southern Shan State, Myanmar)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {79},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Southeast Asia contains a major portion of wetland areas of international significance, but only 14\% of these wetlands are under protection. Inle Lake is the second largest freshwater body in Myanmar and the most important for its environmental, economic, and agricultural values. However, the lake is seriously threatened by anthropic activities as they are dramatically decreasing its open water surface. While water-quality studies have assessed the presence of nutrients and contaminants, little is known about the sediment quality. Therefore, the overall objective of the present study was to analyse the natural sedimentation patterns and the anthropogenic disturbances in this lake. To this end, both grab and core sediments were investigated by combining mineralogical, morphological, and geochemical analyses, and their composition was compared to the composition of rocks and soil from the watershed. Mineralogical data indicate that sediment samples collected at or near the main inflow, and at the outflow show a lower abundance (about 43\%) of calcite, which generally increases with depth in sediment cores, reaching more than 90\% in the centre of the lake. Lower calcite contents correspond to higher percentages of other minerals. These findings allow us to clearly distinguish the allogenic (quartz, mica/illite, kaolinite, and detrital calcite) from the endogenic (mostly calcite) minerals, as confirmed by the soil and rock mineralogy. The origin of the mineral contents at the different sites is further supported by the observation of the grain morphology and composition. The most abundant metal in the lake sediments is Ca, in agreement with the high calcite content. Following in order of abundance are Al, Fe, and K, which are connected to the detrital input to the lake. In the rock and soil samples, the most abundant trace element is Mn, which is significantly correlated with many other trace elements (e.g., Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, V, Zn, and As), suggesting their common lithogenic origin. Similarly, in the lake sediments, the trace elements Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn, and As display fairly homogenous concentration ranges, in the order of tens of ppm, and are strongly correlated with the detrital minerals (mica, kaolinite, and quartz) and negatively correlated with the calcite content. The mineralogical and elemental distribution in the lakebed area and with depth in the sediment cores allowed us to identify the increased soil and bedrock erosion as a major anthropogenic impact to the lake. The sedimentation disturbance is especially evident at the main inflow, the Nanlit stream, which has caused the development of a large alluvial fan, visible in satellite images. This large sediment input is likely to have accelerated the decrease in open water surface and in depth of this shallow lake. Additionally, when the measured concentrations of Potentially Toxic Elements were compared to consensus-based Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), it was shown that As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn often exceeded the threshold effect concentration (TEC), and that Cr, Ni, and Pb sometimes exceeded the probable effect concentration (PEC). On the other hand, Enrichment Factors (EFs), calculated with respect to soils of the watershed, showed minimal enrichment and indicated that the potential toxicity effect was primarily a result of detrital sedimentation outpacing carbonate sedimentation. Sediment characterisation allowed us to obtain a better understanding of lake dynamics and environmental impacts, which is fundamental in achieving effective management and maintenance of the ecological character of Inle Lake, in line with the objective set by the Ramsar Convention for wetlands of international relevance.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the problem of student engagement in the modern educational space. Based on the analysis of the works of Russian and foreign authors, it is shown that engagement is considered as a process, as condition, as a mechanism, as a situation, as an investment of time and energy in the performed activity. There are also various approaches to understanding the structure of engagement, its types, forms, levels, indicators and diagnostic criteria. The most studied is the behavioral side of engagement, the least studied are the mechanisms of the formation of involvement and its management. The authors proposed a systemic anthropological psychology as a methodological basis for the study of student engagement, the foundations of which were laid in the works of Tomsk scientists (V.E. Klochko, E.V. Galazhinsky, O.M. Krasnoryadtseva, O.V. Lukyanov). In this vein, the concordance between the person and the environment is considered as the main mechanism for the formation of engagement. The measure of compliance is the ``resource of engagement{''} of a person, which includes instrumental and value and meaning characteristics. The instrumental component includes various aspects of self- regulation of activity in a changing environment, the value and meaning component is the value and meaning dimension of the objective conditions of activity. The resource of engagement determines the fundamental possibility of including a person in an environment with specific characteristics. The authors conducted an empirical study of the ``resource of engagement{''} of students of two large universities in the Russian Far East; the sample consisted of 498 people. As a result of the factor analysis of the data, the dimensions of the concordance between the student and the educational environment were identified. These are subjective disorganization of activity (impossibility of performing activities in an environment with the specific parameters); flexibility and readiness for change (orientation towards activities in a changing environment); willingness to take responsibility (focus on own forces and resources); result orientation (experience of pleasure in achieving specific results); willingness to work in conditions of uncertainty; selfishness (self-dependence and focus on gaining benefits); focus on the labor process (without taking into account its goals and working conditions). For each option, the directions of psychological assistance aimed at increasing the academic and social involvement of students in the educational space are determined.},

Abstract = {Governments must keep agricultural systems free of pests that threaten agricultural production and international trade. Biosecurity surveillance already makes use of a wide range of technologies, such as insect traps and lures, geographic information systems, and diagnostic biochemical tests. The rise of cheap and usable surveillance technologies such as remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) presents value conflicts not addressed in international biosurveillance guidelines. The costs of keeping agriculture pest-free include privacy violations and reduced autonomy for farmers. We argue that physical and digital privacy in the age of ubiquitous aerial and ground surveillance is a natural right to allow people to function freely on their land. Surveillance methods must be co-created and justified through using ethically defensible processes such as discourse theory, value-centred design and responsible innovation to forge a cooperative social contract between diverse stakeholders. We propose an ethical framework for biosurveillance activities that balances the collective benefits for food security with individual privacy: (1) establish the boundaries of a biosurveillance social contract; (2) justify surveillance operations for the farmers, researchers, industry, the public and regulators; (3) give decision makers a reasonable measure of control over their personal and agricultural data; and (4) choose surveillance methodologies that give the appropriate information. The benefits of incorporating an ethical framework for responsible biosurveillance innovation include increased participation and accumulated trust over time. Long term trust and cooperation will support food security, producing higher quality data overall and mitigating against anticipated information gaps that may emerge due to disrespecting landholder rights.},

Title = {FCTM: A Novel Fuzzy Classification Trust Model for Enhancing Reliability in Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs)},
Journal = {AD HOC \& SENSOR WIRELESS NETWORKS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Worldwide researchers have immensely contributed in the area of ad hoc networks. Lately, there is an extension to these networks, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a mobile network node(s), popularly known as Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs). The foremost ability -fly, of these networks makes them viable for tactical as well as civilian operations. Looking into their characteristics, environment, and applications, security is an essential aspect. During the mission, the nodes collaborate and cooperate. Therefore, trust among the nodes (UAVs) is essential. In this paper, a fuzzy classification trust model (FCTM) for FANETs is presented. The node classification is proposed based on node's behavior and performance in the network. Further, Quality of Service (QoS) and social parameters are used for evaluating the trust value of each node to segregate the selfish and malicious nodes. A decay function is also considered to replicate the real-world behavior of the UAVs. With the help of experiments, the best trust aggregation weights between QoS and social parameters are identified to classify the network nodes. Also, the classification accuracy of the proposed model is demonstrated. Results indicate that the proposed model, FCTM performs better than existing trust models, COI-HiTrust and AFStrust, in a highly dynamic environment for FANETs.},

Title = {The role of the state in the decline of public space - a historical perspective},
Journal = {TER ES TARSADALOM},

Abstract = {According to Mike Davis, the militarisation of urban space is a process that builds a city wound securitisation, leading to an urban space made exclusive through surveillance and disciplining strutegies. The end or decline of public space is described as the result of such militarisation processes by critical theorists who linked it to capitalist, neoliberal city governance. Thus understood, urban space is formed by capital to achieve an economically more competitive city leading to the displacement of the poor and homeless. As a result, public space ceases to exist as the epitome o f democracy, as a place where different social groups can mingle and voice their discontent. While such processes of militarisation increasingly characterise the urban spaces of Budapest, too, it is not necessarily the case that the discourse on the ``decline{''} or ``end of public space{''} also applies to Budapest when it is analysed from a local and historical perspective. In addition, the question arises as to whether there has ever actually been a more democratic public space in Budapest. This article focuses on the changing role of the state through its interpretation of the meaning and use of public space, starting from Lefebvre's argument that power is mediated through space. In addition to Lefebvre's theories on the production of space, this study is informed by Susan Gal's paper on the semiotics of public/private distinction, as it is helpful for a deeper understanding of the relationship between the state and public space. Based on feminist theory, Gal argues that the difference between public and private is ideologically defined. Therefore, the relation between public and private cannot alone describe society, it rather acts as a tool for argument or discussion of value systems. The aim is to understand from a historical perspective the decline of public space and the militarisation of urban space as discussed by critical theorists in the case of Budapest. For such urban tendencies should be seen not only with regard to capital(ism) but also in the context of (central and local) governments. The basis is provided by analyses of both the minutes of the Budapest Metropolitan Council of 1978 and archive footage (news and advertisements) from the 1960s to the 1970s. The article concludes that although the militarisation of urban space described by Davis also characterises Budapest, especially since the 2000s, the author's historical research suggests that in the case of Budapest the lack of democratic public space has a longer history than neoliberal urban planning, rooted in the period ofstate socialism when other policies of exclusion privileged certain social groups.},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems are our priceless natural resource and are a key component of the global carbon budget. Forest fires can be a hazard to the viability and sustainable management of forests with consequences for natural and cultural environments, economies, and the life quality of local and regional populations. Thus, the selection of strategies to manage forest fires, while considering both functional and economic efficiency, is of primary importance. The use of decision support systems (DSSs) by managers of forest fires has rapidly increased. This has strengthened capacity to prevent and suppress forest fires while protecting human lives and property. DSSs are a tool that can benefit incident management and decision making and policy, especially for emergencies such as natural disasters. In this study we reviewed state-of-the-art DSSs that use: database management systems and mathematical/economic algorithms for spatial optimization of firefighting forces; forest fire simulators and satellite technology for immediate detection and prediction of evolution of forest fires; GIS platforms that incorporate several tools to manipulate, process and analyze geographic data and develop strategic and operational plans.},

Abstract = {Assess the state of public green areas, their importance and influence on environmental quality and living in urban centers is an arduous task considering the conceptual and scientific regarding quantification and data analysis methods divergence. In this study, we aimed to determine two indicators of public green areas relative to the percentage of public green areas (PPGA) and the public green areas index (PGAI) in the urban area of Sao Carlos, SP. The study area was organized into administrative regions (ARs), using satellite images, topographical maps of 1:10,000 Geographic and Cartographic Institute (1990) and data provided by the Municipality of Sao Carlos. The results show that public green areas comprise 6.55\% of the municipality, with a public green areas index (PGAI) of 18.85 m(2)/inhabitant, indicating good urban environmental quality when compared to rates of 15 m(2)/capita for public green areas for recreation, suggested by the Brazilian Society of Urban Forestry. The differences between the administrative regions are concern with situations from 4.16 to 36.30 m(2)/inhabitant. In this context, it is recommend specific public policies and popular participation in the process of continuous improvement for increasing public green areas in the less favored regions. The Genebrino method applied to indicators of public green areas (GPGA - amount of public green areas divided by population density), showed a commendable goal above 40\% for urban environmental quality.},

Abstract = {Serious attempts have been made to manage the highly populated Indian coast during the last 25 years in terms of regulating the activities and managing disasters. This has lead to formulation of various policies to maintain environmental quality and sustainably manage the coastal resources. Basically, the coastal zone needs to address the demands of all the stakeholders starting from traditional local communities, administrators, to academic researchers etc. India has faced tremendous challenges in implementing regulatory measures like Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) issued in 1991 by demarcating countries coast in to four different zones with provisions and prohibitions for various activities. The concept of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been taken with the support of spatial decision-support tools derived from satellite data including national programmes on inter-sectoral approaches towards ICZM. 2004 onwards a series of disasters have reminded the necessity of having regulatory measures through implementable approaches. Subsequently, the CRZ 2011 notification has been a new addition to the list of policies using bottom-up approach as a good governance tool. The country has strengthened its potential in coastal management, disaster management and several community based field projects to enhance participation of stakeholders. This paper is aimed to critically review the processes that are made during the last two decades including the future challenges towards sustainable management of coastal zone with special emphasis on the three coastal areas from eastern, western and southern coast of India.},

Abstract = {The study has focused on portraying the spatio-temporal changes in land use pattern from 2011 to 2019 and has tried to assess the environmental quality index (EQI) based on the classified images of Chandernagore Municipal Corporation (CMC). To conduct the present research, satellite imageries of IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV Mx (November 2011) and Sentinel-2A (November 2019) have been used. Supervised image classification approach with maximum likelihood classification has been adopted for the generation of land use maps. A total of 404 sample verification points has been taken to assess the accuracy of land use classification in both cases. The verification points have been selected by purposive random sampling method throughout the images. An initial statistical analysis and detailed principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to construct the EQI for the study region. This was followed by a spatial mapping and analysis to provide a better understanding of the status of the environmental quality to the planners and policy-makers. Results reveal the consistent increase in area under built-up (+ 14\%) and brick kiln/industry (81\%) and continuous decrease in orchard (- 10\%), forest (- 10\%) and open space (- 21\%). The overall classification accuracy was found 90.10\% (2011) and 93.32\% (2019). The total Kappa coefficient is quite satisfactory for 2011 (0.86) and is almost perfect in 2019 (0.91). With more than 85\% explanation within first three components in PCA (2011 and 2019, eigenvalue > 1), the EQI map is clearly portraying that the western part of CMC is still breathing in fresh air with better environmental quality but the recent phase of expansion and process of urban sprawl has evidently swallowed up the expensive land in eastern part of the city and gradually spreading towards the west.},

Title = {An intelligent hot-desking model harnessing the power of occupancy sensing data},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {13-14, SI},
Pages = {766-786},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model to harness occupancy sensing in a commercial hot-desking environment. Hot-desking is a method of office resource management designed to reduce the real estate costs of professional practices. However, the shortcoming is often in the suitability and appropriateness of allocated work environments. The Internet of Things could produce new data sets in the office at a resolution, speed and validity of which that they could be factored into desk-allocation, distributing seats based on appropriate noise levels, stay length, equipment requirements, previous presence and proximity to others working on the same project, among many others. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilises primary data from a commercial office environment in Central London (numerical building system data and semi-structured interviews) to feed a discrete events simulator. To test the hypothesis, the authors look at the potential for intelligent hot-desking to use ``work type{''} data to improve the distribution of individuals in the office, increasing productivity through the creation of positive ``work type environments{''} - where those working on specific tasks perform better when grouped with others doing the same task. The simulation runs for a typical work day, and the authors compare the intelligent hot-desking arrangement to a base case. Findings - The study shows that sensor data can be used for desk allocation in a hot-desking environment utilising activity-based working, with results that outweigh the costs of occupancy detection. The authors are not only able to optimise desk utilisation based on quality occupancy data but also demonstrate how overall productivity increases as individuals are allocated desks of their preference as much as possible among other enabling optimisations that can be applied. Moreover, the authors explore how an increase in occupancy data collection in the private sector could have key advantages for the business as an organization and the city as a whole. Research limitations/implications - The research explores only one possible incarnation of intelligent hot-desking, and the authors presume that all data have already been collected, and while not insurmountable, they do not discuss the technical or cultural difficulties to this end. Furthermore, final examination of the productivity benefit - because of the difficulty in defining and measuring the concept - is exploratory rather than definitive. This research suggests that not only human-centric smart building research should be prioritised over energy or space-based themes but also large-scale private sector collection of occupancy data may be imminent, and its potential should be examined. Practical implications - Findings strongly suggest that the hot-desking may cost more in lost productivity than it gains in reduced rental costs and as such many commercial offices should revaluate the transition, particularly with a view to facilitate intelligent hot-desking. Companies should begin to think strategically about the wider benefits of collecting occupancy data across their real estate portfolio, rather than reviewing use cases in silos. Finally, cities should consider scenarios of widespread collection of occupancy data in the private sector, examining the value these data have to city systems such as transport, and how the city might procure it for these ends. Social implications - This paper raises positive and negative social concerns. The value in occupancy data suggested herein, bringing with it the implication it should be collected en mass, has a noted concern that this brings privacy concerns. As such, policy and regulation should heed that current standards should be reviewed to ensure they are sufficient to protect those in offices from being unfairly discriminated, spied or exploited through occupancy data. However, the improved use of occupancy data improving workplaces could indeed make them more enjoyable places to work, and have the potential to become a staple in company's corporate social responsibility policies. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for better understanding the specific uses of occupancy data in the smart building mantra. Several sources suggest the current research focus on energy and rental costs is misguided when the holistic cost of an office is considered, and concepts related to staff although less understood - may have an order of magnitude bigger impact. This research supports this hypothesis through the example of intelligent hot-desking. The value of this paper lies in redirecting industry and research towards the considering occupancy data in smart building uses cases including - but not limited to-intelligent hot-desking.},

Abstract = {In 1988 and 1992, personnel with the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico chemically treated a large grassland area for mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). The treatments were successful in defoliating nearly 100\% of the mesquite plants present. Since treatment, plant recovery and invasion has resulted in current mesquite densities of about 2\% cover. We assessed vegetation index information derived from meteorological satellite imagery recorded over seven growing seasons (1987-1993). The data were used to track the photosynthetic activity of mesquite canopy from pre-treatment through both treatments. Differences in seasonal landscape greenness characteristics derived by analysis of the satellite data show the effect of the chemical treatment, as well as the recovery of the mesquite. This research demonstrates the potential utility of satellite derived information in assessing vegetation response to implementation of range management strategies.

Abstract = {Eco-environmental change prediction models are important decision tools for policy makers, as they help to quantify environmental sensitivity and to understand the relationship between human activities and environmental quality. Thus. this paper aims to analyze eco-environmental changes in Monteiro County, a semi-arid zone within northeastern Brazil between 1987 and 2010, by means of satellite images, geographic information system and global positioning system techniques, topographic map, climatic data and soil maps, as well as field survey. The resulting outputs were evaluated for their ability to accurately predict the most sensitive and least sensitive areas. The results showed that land cover changes have modified the environment in general and the land degradation and low soil loss processes were identified. The mean soil loss decreased from 9.67 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1987 to 2.67 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2010, as an effect of vegetation gain and particularly the conversion of thousands of square kilometers of Tropophile caatinga middle slope and barren land into Tropophile caatinga plain and Tropophile caatinga high strand. Thus, this study provides insight on territorial ordering and management of environmental services with a regional perspective.},

Abstract = {The Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) provides an international forum for the exchange of technical information on geostationary and polar-orbiting meteorological satellite systems. In 2013, the CMGS established the Socioeconomic Benefits Tiger Team (SETT) to develop a credible methodology and common terminology for articulating the socioeconomic benefits of satellite observing systems, and to explore the most effective ways to communicate the benefits to decision makers and stakeholders. As part of its first years' activities, the SETT gathered examples of socioeconomic studies across all member organizations. This article describes key elements of these studies, and identified eight key themes that are presented. We welcome additional collaborations to identify opportunities to incorporate socioeconomic best practices, integrate these into additional or subsequent phases of work on new instruments and satellites, and develop recommendations for the way forward for the broader meteorological community.},

Abstract = {Presenting to the fracture clinic carries economic, social and societal consequences. The virtual fracture clinic (VFC) has proven to be a safe, patient-focused, cost-effective means of delivering trauma care, whilst reducing unnecessary clinic attendances. Within our institution, a Satellite VFC was established, so as to accommodate an offsite referring emergency department. The VFC database was accessed to identify the first 500 patients who were referred to the Satellite VFC. The decision made for each patient, the rate of returns to the clinic, and the rate of referrals requiring surgical intervention, following discussion at the VFC, ,were identified. A cost analysis and cost comparison was carried out between the Satellite VFC and the traditional ``face to face{''} fracture clinic. There were 500 patients referred to the Satellite VFC within the study period. Of such patients, 288 (58\%) were discharged directly following review at the Satellite VFC, 141 patients (28\%) were referred to physiotherapy, 50 (10\%) were redirected to the trauma clinic, 11 (2\%) were sent directly to hand therapy, and 10 (2\%) were sent to the ED review clinic. Patients who returned to the fracture clinic accounted for 3.8\% of all referrals, and 0.2\% of all referrals necessitated surgical intervention. This pilot initiative saved the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group over (sic)50,000. The Satellite VFC is the first of its kind in the literature. Rural communities worldwide would benefit from remote orthopaedic management of suitable fracture patterns. The true value of the Satellite VFC process comes from its use of robust patient care pathways, rationalising resource use and minimising patient travel, whilst demonstrating reliable outcomes and promoting safety.

Title = {Priorities in national space strategies and governance of the member states of the European Space Agency},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},

Volume = {117},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The European Space Agency (ESA) has twenty Member States with a variety of strategic priorities and governance structures regarding their space activities. A number of countries engage in space activities exclusively though ESA, while others have also their own national space programme. Some consider ESA as their prime space agency and others have additionally their own national agency with respective programmes. The main objective of this paper is to provide an up-to date overview and a holistic assessment of strategic priorities and the national space governance structures in 20 ESA Member States. This analysis and assessment has been conducted by analysing the Member States public documents, information provided at ESA workshop on this topic and though unstructured interviews. The paper is structured to include two main elements: priorities and trends in national space strategies and space governance in ESA Member States. The first part of this paper focuses on the content and analysis of the national space strategies and indicates the main priorities and trends in Member States. The priorities are categorised with regards to technology domains, the role of space in the areas of sustainability and the motivators that boost engagement in space. These vary from one Member State to another and include with different levels of engagement in technology domains amongst others: science and exploration, navigation, Earth observation, human space flight, launchers, telecommunications, and integrated applications. Member States allocate a different role of space as enabling tool adding to the advancement of sustainability areas including: security, resources, environment and climate change, transport and communication, energy, and knowledge and education. The motivators motivating reasoning which enhances or hinders space engagement also differs. The motivators identified are industrial competitiveness, job creation, technology development and transfer, social benefits, international cooperation, and European nondependence. The second part of the paper provides a categorisation of national space governance structures in ESA Member States. Different governance models are identified depending on the responsible ministries for space for a number of space related organisations and ESA. In the case of ESA, these can typically vary from the more traditional ministry of science and/or education, the ministry of industry and/or innovation to the more recent ones being the ministry of economy and the ministry of transport. Recognising the transverse nature of space and its potential as a tool for a number of policies like agriculture, environment, maritime, disaster management, etc., other ministries are more and more getting involved in space activities. The development and implementation of the space strategy and policy of a Member State is realised though the engagement of an implementing entity. The type, role and activity vary from Member State to Member State. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the experiences of mature students at a satellite campus of an English higher education institution. Twenty students over age 25 who fit various widening participation criteria were interviewed at four points during their first two years of bachelor's level study at a higher education (HE) centre in an area underserved by HE. Three aspects (familial, aspirational and social capital) of Yosso's model of community cultural wealth emerged as assets supporting students' success. Staying in their home communities allowed them to benefit from family and community networks, and their aspirations for their children fuelled their motivation. The study extends critical race theory to mature mostly white working-class students in English HE, contributing to policy debates about the role of satellite centres in supporting widening participation agendas. HEIs need to consider the capitals that mature students bring with them to their studies and how those support persistence.},

Title = {Data Offloading in UAV-Assisted Multi-Access Edge Computing Systems: A Resource-Based Pricing and User Risk-Awareness Approach},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) systems have emerged recently as a flexible and dynamic computing environment, providing task offloading service to the users. In order for such a paradigm to be viable, the operator of a UAV-mounted MEC server should enjoy some form of profit by offering its computing capabilities to the end users. To deal with this issue in this paper, we apply a usage-based pricing policy for allowing the exploitation of the servers' computing resources. The proposed pricing mechanism implicitly introduces a more social behavior to the users with respect to competing for the UAV-mounted MEC servers' computation resources. In order to properly model the users' risk-aware behavior within the overall data offloading decision-making process the principles of Prospect Theory are adopted, while the exploitation of the available computation resources is considered based on the theory of the Tragedy of the Commons. Initially, the user's prospect-theoretic utility function is formulated by quantifying the user's risk seeking and loss aversion behavior, while taking into account the pricing mechanism. Accordingly, the users' pricing and risk-aware data offloading problem is formulated as a distributed maximization problem of each user's expected prospect-theoretic utility function and addressed as a non-cooperative game among the users. The existence of a Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) for the formulated non-cooperative game is shown based on the theory of submodular games. An iterative and distributed algorithm is introduced which converges to the PNE, following the learning rule of the best response dynamics. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is achieved via modeling and simulation, and detailed numerical results are presented highlighting its key operation features and benefits.},

Title = {Examining the value of satellite data in halting transmission of polio in Nigeria: A socioeconomic analysis},
Journal = {DATA \& POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Abstract = {In 2014, Nigeria halted transmission of wild poliovirus for the first time in its history. A critical enabling component in this historic achievement was the use of satellite data to produce more accurate maps and population estimates used in planning and implementing vaccination campaigns. This article employs a value-of-information approach to estimate the net socioeconomic benefits associated with this use of satellite data. We calculate the increase in the likelihood of halting transmission of polio associated with the use of satellite-based information compared to traditional data sources, and we consider the benefits associated with savings to the healthcare system as well as health benefits. Using a conservative approach focused on just 1 year of benefits, we estimate net socioeconomic benefits of between \$46.0 million and \$153.9 million. In addition to these quantified benefits, we also recognize qualitative benefits associated with improving human health, reaching marginalized communities, and building capacity among local populations. We also explore the substantial benefits associated with follow-on projects that have made use of the satellite-based data products and methodologies originally developed for the Nigeria polio eradication effort.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to optimize the simultaneous flight performance of a hexarotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by using simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (i.e. SPSA), deep neural network and proportional integral derivative (i.e. PID) according to varying arm length (i.e. morphing). Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, proper PID gain coefficients and morphing ratio were obtained using the stochastic optimization method, also known as SPSA to maximize flight efficiency. Because it is difficult to establish an analytical connection between the morphing ratio and hexarotor moments of inertia, the deep neural network was used to obtain the moments of inertia according to the morphing ratio. By using SPSA and deep neural network, the best performance indexes were obtained and both longitudinal and lateral flight simulations were performed with the obtained data. FindingsWith SPSA, the best PID coefficients and morphing ratio are obtained for both longitudinal and lateral flight. Because the hexarotor solid body model changes according to the morphing ratio, the moment of inertia values used in the simulations also change. According to the morphing ratio, the moment of inertia values was obtained with the deep neural network over a created data set. Research limitations/implicationsIt takes a long time to obtain the morphing ratio suitable for the hexarotor model and the PID gain coefficients suitable for this morphing ratio. However, this situation can be overcome with the proposed SPSA. In addition, it takes a long time to obtain the appropriate moments of inertia according to the morphing ratio. However, in this case, it was overcome using the deep neural network. Practical implicationsDetermining the morphing ratio and PID gain coefficients using the optimization method, as well as determining the moments of inertia using the deep neural network, is very useful as it can increase the efficiency of hexarotor flight and flight efficiently with different arm lengths. With the proposed method, the hexarotor design performance criteria (i.e. rise time, settling time and overshoot) values were significantly improved compared to similar studies. Social implicationsDetermining the hexarotor flight parameters using SPSA and deep neural network provides advantages in terms of time, cost and applicability. Originality/valueThe hexarotor flight efficiency is improved with the proposed SPSA and deep neural network approaches. In addition, the desired flight parameters can be obtained more quickly and reliably with the proposed approaches. The design performance criteria were also improved, enabling the hexarotor UAV to follow the given trajectory in the best way and providing convenience for end users. SPSA was preferred because it converged faster than other methods. While other methods perform 2n operations per iteration, SPSA only performs two operations. To obtain the moment of inertia, many physical parameter values of the UAV are required in the existing methods. In the proposed method, by creating a date set, only arm length and moment of inertia were estimated without the need to obtain physical parameters with the deep neural network structure.},

Abstract = {A Geographic Information System (GIS) is defined as a computer based tool useful for capturing, storing, retrieving and manipulating, displaying and querying both spatial and non-spatial data about given areas to generate various planning scenarios for decision making. On the other hand, an Urban Management Information System (UMIS) is an economic resource that can benefit decision makers in the planning, development, and management of urban projects and resources using statistical data such as social, economic, demographic, housing and health data. Since Internet technology reduces the cost of data management and information distribution to mass usages as in UMIS, web based systems are mostly used for a UMIS applications throughout the world. Nowadays, the number of satellite cities is rapidly increasing in Turkey, especially in Istanbul. A satellite city for Istanbul can be defined as a mini city established outside Istanbul that has its own shopping centers, schools, social clubs, cinemas, restaurants, etc. Though it is not a municipality by itself, it needs to conform to the requirements of both the municipality it belongs to and its management. In this study, a prototype web-GIS based UMIS is developed for satellite cities. The system integrates the digital base map and statistical data of a satellite city that can be input through a user-interface and offers a variety of querying and reporting options. The developed system is tested for one satellite city in Istanbul and the results showed that it is promising as a starting system for other similar applications.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) has become increasingly important for sustainable management of the natural resources to overcome the problems of haphazard development, deteriorating environmental quality, loss of fertile agricultural lands and destruction of wetlands. Comparable to the areas located at the northern part of the Nile Delta, EL-Manzala Lake and its surroundings are continuously subjected to numerous threats. These threats include converting parts of the lake into other land uses such as the fish ponds located to the south and south-east of the lake. The lake water is also subjected to pollution from the inflow of agriculture drainage water. Hence, the necessity arises to have a permanent monitoring strategy for this area to enable decision makers to develop plans to overcome these threats. The aim of this work is to develop a hybrid method that integrates decision trees (DT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to increase the accuracy of classification in a selected area covering El-Manzala Lake and its surrounding. In this study, the DT was designed first in a manner that the classes can be separated and the DT results are then input into an ANN. Two satellites data were integrated as the input of the classification. The data included the reflectance of the Sentinel 2 satellite bands from the blue to the shortwave bands (discarding the red edge bands), and the emission of the thermal bands of the Landsat 8 satellite. The images of both satellites were acquired at the same date. Moreover, theses data were used in the format of band ratios and specific principal component analysis (PCAs). Utilizing this approach the overall accuracy of the classification could reach 98.6\% while it could only reach 70.2 \% when processing the data using the DT only and has been lower using ANN.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},

Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Regular censuses are fundamental for the management of animal populations but, are logistically challenging for species living in remote regions. The advent of readily accessible, high resolution satellite images of earth mean that it is possible to resolve relatively small (0.6 m) objects, sufficient to discern large animals. To illustrate how these advances can be used to count animals in remote regions, individual elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) were counted using satellite imagery. We used an image taken on 10/10/2011 to count elephant seals (n = 1790 +/- 306 (95\%CL)) on the isthmus of Macquarie Island, an estimate which overlapped with concurrent ground counts (n = 1991). The number of individuals per harem estimated using the two approaches were highly correlated, with a slope close to one and the estimated intercept also encompassing zero. This proof of concept opens the way for satellites to be used as a standard censusing technique for inaccessible and cryptically coloured species. Quantifying the population trends of higher order predators provides an especially informative and tractable indicator of ecosystem health.},

Title = {Fine-scale mapping of urban malaria exposure under data scarcity: an approach centred on vector ecology},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},

Abstract = {BackgroundAlthough malaria transmission has experienced an overall decline in sub-Saharan Africa, urban malaria is now considered an emerging health issue due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanization and the adaptation of vectors to urban environments. Fine-scale hazard and exposure maps are required to support evidence-based policies and targeted interventions, but data-driven predictive spatial modelling is hindered by gaps in epidemiological and entomological data. A knowledge-based geospatial framework is proposed for mapping the heterogeneity of urban malaria hazard and exposure under data scarcity. It builds on proven geospatial methods, implements open-source algorithms, and relies heavily on vector ecology knowledge and the involvement of local experts.MethodsA workflow for producing fine-scale maps was systematized, and most processing steps were automated. The method was evaluated through its application to the metropolitan area of Dakar, Senegal, where urban transmission has long been confirmed. Urban malaria exposure was defined as the contact risk between adult Anopheles vectors (the hazard) and urban population and accounted for socioeconomic vulnerability by including the dimension of urban deprivation that is reflected in the morphology of the built-up fabric. Larval habitat suitability was mapped through a deductive geospatial approach involving the participation of experts with a strong background in vector ecology and validated with existing geolocated entomological data. Adult vector habitat suitability was derived through a similar process, based on dispersal from suitable breeding site locations. The resulting hazard map was combined with a population density map to generate a gridded urban malaria exposure map at a spatial resolution of 100 m.ResultsThe identification of key criteria influencing vector habitat suitability, their translation into geospatial layers, and the assessment of their relative importance are major outcomes of the study that can serve as a basis for replication in other sub-Saharan African cities. Quantitative validation of the larval habitat suitability map demonstrates the reliable performance of the deductive approach, and the added value of including local vector ecology experts in the process. The patterns displayed in the hazard and exposure maps reflect the high degree of heterogeneity that exists throughout the city of Dakar and its suburbs, due not only to the influence of environmental factors, but also to urban deprivation.ConclusionsThis study is an effort to bring geospatial research output closer to effective support tools for local stakeholders and decision makers. Its major contributions are the identification of a broad set of criteria related to vector ecology and the systematization of the workflow for producing fine-scale maps. In a context of epidemiological and entomological data scarcity, vector ecology knowledge is key for mapping urban malaria exposure. An application of the framework to Dakar showed its potential in this regard. Fine-grained heterogeneity was revealed by the output maps, and besides the influence of environmental factors, the strong links between urban malaria and deprivation were also highlighted.},

Abstract = {Sweeping across Bangladesh and India, the Sundarbans forest is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest. Although the human population density is high at the edge, Sundarbans has not encountered significant areal transformation in the last four decades. However, we argue that forest degradation can occur discontinuously within the forest without alteration of the entire forest area. In this paper, we used MODIS land products to compare the spatiotemporal ecological dynamics of the Bangladesh and Indian part of this mangrove forest between 2000 and 2010. We used the following 5 ecological parameters for our analysis: the Percent Tree Cover (PTC), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Evapotranspiration (ET). Our pixel-based time-series trend analysis for each MODIS image stack, using an ordinary least square (OLS) regression method, showed that forest degradation is happening in fragmented parcels within the forest. The degradation rate is comparatively higher in the Bangladesh part than in the Indian part of Sundarbans. Compartments 8, 10, 12, and 15 in the Bangladesh part, in particular, show high degradation, while compartment 48 and the southern edge of 45 show slight increases in PTC or EVI. Forest degradation in the Indian part of the forest is evident in the National Park and Reserve Forest blocks; however, no substantial degradation is evident in the western section. We have identified certain anthropogenic stressors (i.e., oil pollution, shrimp farming) and natural stressors (i.e., increased salinity, cyclones, forest fire) which might be responsible for the observed degradation. We have provided sustainable planning options and policy transformation alternatives for those areas under pressure from these stressors. We anticipate that our analysis of forest degradation will help management agencies, conservators, and policy makers achieve better management of this world's largest mangrove forest for a sustainable future.

Abstract = {Crop production is a complex system of integrated physical, chemical, and biological processes managed under increasing economic and political constraints. Modem production systems employ computer and satellite technology to manage controllable factors on a site-specific basis. Fields are subdivided into management zones, defined by differences in physical and chemical characteristics that can be measured and managed to make more efficient use of available resources. To be competitive, each producer must attempt to optimize---and even maximize---yield. Yet in the aggregate, increased production can depress prices and profitability. Attempts to increase production are often cited as sources of environmental problems, but increasing productivity is a major strategy to protect environmental quality. Site-specific management may provide solutions to these paradoxes.},

Abstract = {The effective management of the water related resources-environment-disasters system (or as traditionally and professionally so called as hydrological system) is one of the vital subjects for social and economic development and people's living and wealth. It's an essential solution for water related issues to comprehensively manage the system on the base of natural drainage basin by starting from the rainfall-runoff simulating, routing and forecasting, and exploring the physical mechanism and system control measurements. Watershed-based rainfall-runoff model and routing model are always the research highlights in the field of hydrology as well as environmental sciences and calamity. With the development of geographical information system (GIS), remote sensing, the theory of computing analysis and GPS-meteorology, more powerful tools can be used to perform watershed spatial data obtaining, storing, processing and analysis and distributed hydrological model has been attracting more and more attention from both engineering and academic communities. In the meantime, Cellular Automata as an inherent distributed computer might be integrated with distributed hydrological model, which may create a new way to improve watershed hydrological model development. Based on the analysis of the general disciplinarian and the particularity for the application of Cellular Automata in geography and hydrology respectively, according to the basic principle of hydrological model and Cellular Automata, a watershed routing model based on GIS and Cellular Automata, HydroCA is proposed in this paper. The local updating rule is the core of HydroCA, and is also the key in the process of uniting cellular automata with distributed hydrology models. The local rules are close interrelated to the model precision. The key of establishment of local rules in HydroCA is to determine flow direction and flux arrangement among the site and sites in the neighborhood. And the rules should be applied in whole the lattice space. Flow direction of the site determines flow lines and flow distribution among its Moore neighborhood. For the moment, usual methods to determine flow direction, are single steepest descent flow direction method, multiple flow direction algorithm, resultant vector methods and etc. Inputs of the model is divided into two classes, one includes core variables of lattice site, the other consists of assistant variables including DEM, topographic index(TOPMODEL), water supply ratio, M and etc. Core variables are computed using runoff production model. As for assistant variables, DEM is provided by geographic information system software and the other variables are calculated by special modules. Local rules are based on multiple flow direction algorithm, and Runoff flow course is the Output. A simulation software platform, Hydro CA, by combining the HydroCA model for runoff routing with TOPMODEL / SCS model for rainfall-runoff simulation operated on the watershed DEM with 100x100m grid size was developed and used to simulate runoff process from 1 April 1998 to 31 August 1998 in the study area LeAnhe Watershed in the northeast of JiangXi Province, China. The results of the simulation prove that the precision of TOPMODEL simulation can be improved by using HydroCA routing model from 64.7\% to 71.0\%, while the precision of combining SCS simulation with HydroCA routing is slightly worse than that of combining SCS simulation with Unit Hydrograph routing (from 54.7\% to 57.5\%). It is shown that HydroCA model is feasible to simulate the watershed runoff routing. Cellular Automata model will contribute to the distributed watershed hydrological model research and development by providing a new method in calculating runoff forming and converging. It can simulate routing process depending on a mechanism from bottom to top or from local to global in the research area compositing the movement of water of the land-slope and channel. The runoff routing model on the basis of cellular automata is calculated in distributed way considering heterogeneity in both space and time. Therefore, a task left for us is to build a reliable distributed runoff generation model, which can provide the values of water condition variables as the temporal values for all cells in the lattice space during time intervals.},

Abstract = {Ecologists and conservationists need accurate and replicable tools for monitoring wetland conditions in order to develop and implement adaptive management strategies efficiently. The Rhone Delta (Camargue) in southern France encloses 9200 ha of fragmented reed marshes actively managed for reed harvesting, waterfowl hunting or cattle grazing, and holding significant numbers of vulnerable European birds. We used multi-season SPOT-5 data in conjunction with ground survey to assess the predictive power of satellite imagery in modelling indicators of reed structure (height, diameter, density and cover of green/dry stems) relevant to ecosystem management and bird ecology. All indicators could be predicted accurately with a combination of bands (SWIR, NIR) and indices (SAVI, OSAVI, NDWI, DVI, DVW, MSI) issued from scenes of March, June, July, September or December and subtraction between these. All models were robust when validated with an independent set of satellite and field data. The high spatial resolution of SPOT-5 scenes (pixel of 10 x 10 m) permits the monitoring of detailed attributes characterizing the reed ecosystem across a large spatial extent, providing a scientifically-based, replicable tool for managers, stakeholders and decision-makers to follow wetland conditions in the short and long-term. Combined with models on the ecological requirements of vulnerable bird species, these tools can provide maps of potential species ranges at spatial extents that are relevant to ecosystem functioning and bird populations.

Abstract = {The application of satellite precipitation estimates from NASA's Global Precipitation Measure-ment (GPM) Mission for decision-making has been a focus for the mission since launch. As a result, GPM data have enabled a range of applications that address societal needs, including water resource management, crop forecasting, ecological monitoring, disaster response, public health, aviation, weather forecasting, and climate modeling, among others. GPM applications activities have continued to focus on user engagement through in person trainings and interviews, work-shops, webinars, and educational outreach activities. The goals of these efforts are to synthesize community data needs in order to effectively support and enable decision-making across agencies, academia and the global community. While these efforts have helped the GPM mission establish a large stakeholder community that encompasses federal and state partners, academic institutions, and private and nonprofit companies, there remains difficulties associated with accessing, pro-cessing, and applying the data to support or enable applications. In this article, we present GPM applications strategies and approaches used to enhance the applications value of GPM data, and most importantly, demonstrate how these efforts have and can inform different decision-making contexts. This work also provides a discussion on key lessons learned from the user community and how this information can be utilized to help better support and shape applications ap-proaches for future NASA Earth Science missions.},

Abstract = {Any emergent technology in history has raised an initial rejection by part of the society. Added to the several problems that the non-mature technology may have, the lack of any previous experience about side effects and the humans psychological fear to the unknown play an important influence in its acceptance. As drones bring up high social and economical expectations due to their capabilities and bussiness applications, the social acceptance is key to the complete development of drone technology's potential. Experts believe that social acceptance is ruled by a balance between beneficial usages and inconvenient issues regarding the technology. This balance in the aeronautical sector is also conditioned by the strict safety policies and regulations of the airspace and the current airspace users. To analyse this balance situation in actual and future environments, regarding drone technology, different use cases will be presented. These use cases have been proposed and analysed by different stakeholders from the U-space community network, a network of airspace and drone stakeholders who participated in the context of the SESAR CORUS1 project. The purpose of this paper is to analyse some of these use cases by obtaining responses from different stakeholders point of view using a survey in order to see how economical, safety and political aspects are balanced in each one of the cases. From the survey responses we will perform an analysis by means of three different acceptance indicators, one for each aspect commented. Main results and conclusions point out that the economical indicator is, in general, positive, especially for the low cost payload use cases. In contrast the economical indicator is close to neutral for city transport and airports use cases, which leads to propose some economical promotion action may be needed to make them a reality. For the safety indicator we observe that they are close to negative values as use case complexity increases. Thus we can conclude that some of the proposed missions start affecting the current levels of safety. Finally, the political indicator is mostly neutral, with some positive trends for scenarios related with inspection tasks or done in non-populated areas.},

Abstract = {This study aims to present an efficient methodology for land use optimization based on minimization of runoff and sediment and maximization of economic benefits, occupational opportunities, and land use suitability in the Tilabad watershed in northeast of Iran. The land use map of the area was prepared using the Landsat satellite images and field surveys. The amounts of runoff and sediment were estimated via SWAT model. The TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was applied on the results of the multiobjective optimization (MOO) based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to choose the final optimal solution among the Pareto solutions front generated by MOO. The results indicated that the area of agriculture and rangelands should decrease, and the area of forests should increase to achieve the defined objectives. Overall, results indicated that integration of MOO and MCDM provides an efficient procedure for land use optimization in a complex watershed. Recommendations for Resource Managers The optimization of land use allocation across a complex watershed requires the combined application of several models and techniques to achieve a sustainable decision-making process. By optimization of land use patterns according to the final solution, the surface runoff and sediment load of the watershed will decline, while the economic profit and land use suitability will improve. Despite using a maximization objective function, the land-based job opportunities might decrease across a watershed by optimization of land use allocation, but this can be considered as an opportunity for provision of manpower to other socioeconomic sectors.},

Abstract = {This paper traces the way in which the European Commission has framed and reframed the issue of EU satellite navigation over 20 years. It investigates how the EU's agenda-setter has `talked about' space policy, with a particular focus on Galileo, and how its own institutional discourse - as revealed in its communications throughout the agenda-setting stage of Galileo's `definition' phase - evolved in the 1990s through the use of `frame sets'. In so doing, it illustrates the ways in which, over time, the EU's executive has `projected' the issue of independent satellite navigation capabilities as being politically and economically desirable for Europe, and has sought to persuade decision makers of its cross-policy relevance and potential economic, social and security benefits. The article deconstructs official documents and engages in a close-up analysis of policy formulation, to identify nascent, evolving and mature frames in the definition of Galileo.

Abstract = {Benefiting from the development of satellite on-board processing capability, the orbital computing can be realized by deploying edge computing servers on satellites to reduce the task processing latency. However, edge computing based on geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) or low-Earth orbit (LEO) alone can hardly meet the latency requirements of Satellite-assisted Internet of Things (SIoT) services. Moreover, the uneven distribution of tasks generated by SIoT devices will also cause the load unbalancing among different satellites. In this article, hybrid GEO-LEO SIoT networks is investigated with joint computing and communication resource allocation. To tackle the load unbalancing problem, tasks generated by SIoT devices can be processed by collaborative LEO satellites or forwarded to gateways on ground via GEO satellite. Thus, the joint task offloading, communication and computing resources allocation for the hybrid SIoT network can be formulated as a mixed integer dynamic programming problem with satellites-ground cooperation and intersatellite cooperation via the intersatellite links. Then, an intelligent task offloading and multidimensional resources allocation algorithm (TOMRA) is proposed to minimize the latency of task offloading and processing. First, a method base on deep reinforcement learning is utilized to solve the subproblem of task offloading and channel allocation. And then, convex optimization is adopted to solve the subproblem of computing resource allocation under fixed offloading and channel allocation decisions. Simulation results show that the proposed TOMRA can achieve better performance than the reference schemes.},

Pages = {192-204},
Abstract = {Purpose - Surface hydrology studies are becoming more important for environmentalists and design engineers in arid regions where climate elements, particularly rainfall, are severe, sporadic and difficult to forecast. The main purpose of this study is to analyse elements of surface hydrology in the northwest of Riyadh City as part of environmental quality characterization for urban development. Design/methodology/approach - The study area lies within a typical arid zone in the Arabian desert, and forms an integral part of Riyadh City extension. Field observations, collection and analyses of meteorological data, identification and analyses of the drainage network were the main approaches used in this study. The study made use of SPOT 4 satellite images, published topographic maps and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Shuttle Radar (SRTM). Findings - Drainage analyses show four sub-dendritic systems in northwest Riyadh. The study area lies within the middle sub-catchment with a total area of 11-5 km(2). Average annual rainfall is 125 mm. It occurs in the months of November-February with a standard deviation of 17-25.5 for monthly rainfall and a standard deviation of 3.2-8.8 for maximum daily rainfall. Annual relative humidity is 34.4 percent, annual solar radiation is 477 cal/cm(2) per day, prevailing wind direction is NE and N with an average speed of 5.1 km/hr, and average annual evaporation is 2910 mm. Runoff peak flow varies from 2.73-4.67 m(3)/sec. Practical implications - Planners, design engineers, decision makers can use these findings for urban environmental development. The results of this study can help to prepare safeguard settlements from any unforeseen events. Originality/value - The study indicates the importance of environmental quality chacterization for urban development.},

Abstract = {Floods are the most common and damaging natural disaster in Bangladesh, and the effects of floods on public health have increased significantly in recent decades, particularly among lower socioeconomic populations. Assessments of social vulnerability on flood-induced health outcomes typically focus on local to regional scales; a notable gap remains in comprehensive, large-scale assessments that may foster disaster management practices. In this study, socioeconomic, health, and coping capacity vulnerability and composite social-health vulnerability are assessed using both equal-weight and principal-component approaches using 26 indicators across Bangladesh. Results indicate that vulnerable zones exist in the northwest riverine areas, northeast floodplains, and southwest region, potentially affecting 42 million people (26 \% of the total population). Subsequently, the vulnerability measures are linked to flood forecast and satellite inundation information to evaluate their potential for predicting actual flood impact indices (distress, damage, disruption, and health) based on the immense August 2017 flood event. Overall, the forecast-based equally weighted vulnerability measures perform best. Specifically, socioeconomic and coping capacity vulnerability measures strongly align with the distress, disruption, and health impact records observed. Additionally, the forecast-based composite social-health vulnerability index also correlates well with the impact indices, illustrating its utility in identifying predominantly vulnerable regions. These findings suggest the benefits and practicality of this approach to assess both thematic and comprehensive spatial vulnerabilities, with the potential to support targeted and coordinated public disaster management and health practices.},

Title = {Carrying capacity as tool for beach economic value assessment (case studies of Italian beaches)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {189},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This study developed a new integrated assessment method for sandy beaches, using three recreational Italian beaches as case study, with the purpose of obtaining their economic value. The method was based on a geomorphological assessment of the beaches and a carrying capacity evaluation; an economic analysis through the elicitation of the willingness to pay (WTP); a social assessment of beachgoers' attitude and opinion. For the selected beaches, which differed for typology, location, shape, level of urbanization and tourism, we identified the available surfaces for recreational uses trough the observation of satellite images. WTP results indicate that respondents would be willing to pay a contribution from 9 to 15(sic) per season. WTP is principally positive correlated with some variables like beach frequentation, residence in the localities, available services on the beach. The value of the selected beaches was calculated multiplying the sustainable carrying capacity of each site with their related maximum WTP. It was found that the values of the beaches varied from more than 50M(sic)/season at a popular urban beach to 1M(sic)/season at a remote natural beach. The comparison of beach valuation and investments made by managers of the beaches show a gap. Therefore, the huge non-market value of these beaches might need decision-makers to guarantee continuous beach restoration measures.},

Abstract = {1. Animal-borne telemetry has revolutionized our ability to study animal movement, species physiology, demography and social structures, changing environments and the threats that animals are experiencing. While there will always be a need for basic ecological research and discovery, the current conservation crisis demands we look more pragmatically at the data required to make informed management decisions. 2. Here, we define a framework that distinguishes how research using animal telemetry devices can influence conservation. We then discuss two critical questions which aim to directly connect telemetry-derived data to applied conservation decision-making: (i) Would my choice of action change if I had more data? (ii) Is the expected gain worth the money and time required to collect more data? 3. Policy implications. To answer questions about integrating telemetry-derived data with applied conservation, we suggest the use of value of information analysis to quantitatively assess the return-on-investment of animal telemetry-derived data for conservation decision-making.},

Abstract = {On 22 March 2020, a complete lockdown in India to avoid the COVID-19 outbreak had first been declared, and the lockdown was extended for 21 days in the first process on 24 March 2020. Mostly during the complete lockout, several of the causes of low air quality in India were shut down. This article uses land and satellite measurements to examine AQ, particulate matter-PM2.5, AQI (Air Quality Index), and troposphere Nitrogen Dioxide across India. When comparing the lockout duration in 2020 to a certain period in 2019, a marked decrease in PM2.5 and AQI (Air Quality Index) was witnessed over metro cities and a decreasing pattern in troposphere NO2 intensity. Over the complete lockout time, environmental quality increased greatly, providing valuable insights to city administrations while they formulate laws and policies to increase air quality.},

Title = {New technologies in cultural institutions: theory, evidence and policy implications},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-222},
Abstract = {Publicly-funded cultural institutions such as theatre companies, symphony orchestras, museums, libraries and so on are increasingly engaging with new technologies as a means of improving their operational efficiency and extending the range of ways in which they pursue their cultural missions. For example, opera companies are broadcasting performances by satellite to cinemas, and art museums are using the Internet to show virtual exhibitions. These developments have implications for funding authorities who need to update their policy approaches to encompass a range of new technological phenomena. This paper provides a framework for assessing technological innovation in cultural institutions, and discusses the ramifications of such a framework for cultural policy. The paper is illustrated using the results of a recent research project that evaluated the UK National Theatre's NT Live experiment and the Tate Gallery's use of a web-based exhibition as strategies to expand their audience reach.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out during the Covid19 pandemic that originated in the Republic of China at the end of 2019 and has spread throughout the world since then, taking official records of demographic, environmental and epidemiological information in El Salvador' with the aim of developing a quantitative and qualitative process that demonstrates the variations in cases of Covid19 contagion as a consequence of the pandemic, based on three factors, including the environmental variable; since this can be an agent that regulates the mobility of the pandemic vectors. In addition, the importance of the use of Geographic and Satellite Information Systems is demonstrated, which allow a more complete analysis of health problems at the national, regional and / or global level; above all in decision -making on public health policies, since the lack of knowledge for decision -making in the face of this new pandemic has been evidenced. The most substantial product of this research is a thematic map of the impact of the pandemic at the country level divided by municipalities, where it shows that the cities with the highest population density and the lowest environmental quality are those that have been most affected. Therefore, in the future it is necessary not to centralize all economic activity in a few places, in addition to the importance of the environments that exist in each municipality for the well-being of people. Finally, a statistical analysis is carried out through the decision tree that supports the aforementioned.},

Abstract = {The soon-to-be allocated 5G mobile technology using a 3.5 GHz frequency band has posed challenges because the spectrum of 3.5 GHz has utilized satellite services. By examining the case of Indonesia, this paper aims to investigate the social and economic aspects of two scenarios, i.e., implementing 5G using 3.5 GHz or retaining the use of the satellite for 3.5 GHz. The technological management method developed by Kano Models was used to assess the social aspect, and the net benefit was calculated to assess the economic aspect. The findings indicated that most existing services offered via satellite are in the attractive category, meaning that if such satellite services are eliminated, the market will not change significantly; however, implementing 5G at the frequency of 3.5 GHz would increase economic value due to the much higher license fee paid by the operators to the government.},

Title = {Integrated modelling techniques to implication of demographic change and urban expansion dynamics on water demand management of developing city in Lake Hawassa Watershed, Ethiopia},

Abstract = {Hawassa is a rapidly developing city in the Lake Hawassa watershed of Ethiopia that is a continuous change in the face of an urban environment. The urban development has been increasing the challenge to maintain urban services and surrounding environmental quality. These exert a new challenge to the growing gap between urban water demand and supply balance. Correlating urban growth and water demand to a rapidly growing population remains imperative to adaptive urban planning and decision-making. This study quantified urban development with demographic change and urban expansion dynamics. The population statistics and satellite imageries of historical years 1991-2021 and projections to the year 2051 were analysed using the exponential increase model and geospatial techniques. Multiple empirical modelling approaches were employed to link urban water demand with the explanatory variable. The study findings revealed the projected urban population reach more than one million and 79.2\% of urbanization by 2051. With the current trend of 8.9\% built-up growth rate, urban area will cover 73.6 km(2) (45.9\%) for the predicted period. The demographic variables and the sprawl of urban expansion jointly influence the water demand with statistically significant (f = 0.000, at alpha = 0.05) association. An increase in urban water use efficiency also reduces the water demand by increasing the availability of water supplies. Thus, the proposed model can be applied to reset the emerging relationship between the explanatory variables and water demand management. A detailed consideration of the spatially explicit effect on access to and optimization of the urban water supply system is vital to a local-specific solution. Integrating urban land planning with water demand management, therefore, has the potential to minimize the need to construct additional water supply infrastructure and cheer a sustainable urban environment.},

Abstract = {Defined as the connection between media and communities, localism has been a cornerstone of U.S. broadcasting policy since the late 1920s. Among other ways, the principle of localism has been advanced through Federal Communication Commission licensing rules favoring small radio and television stations that carry local news, sports, and other programming serving community needs and values. However, in recent years changes in federal policy coupled with the emergence of new broadcasting technologies such as enhanced cable and satellite-based television have profoundly altered the relationship between broadcasting and local communities. Increasingly, community-centered television content has been replaced with syndicated programming targeting a national audience. In this paper we examine socioeconomic factors most closely associated with over-the-air, pay-to-view cable, and satellite television broadcasting with the objective of uncovering how access to community-based programming can be characterized on the basis of socioeconomic factors and geographic location. Using the Nielsen Corporation's Designated Market Areas (DMAs), we identify hot and cold spots of reception by reception type and then use hierarchical clustering to identify geographic regions based on the relationship between select socioeconomic traits and the primary method used within households for receiving television signals.

Abstract = {Social justice has long been at the forefront of the core values of the social work profession. Social workers are charged to confront social injustices and advocate for social change. In 2014, there was a societal response across the United States to the deaths of two African-American men, Mike Brown and Eric Garner, and the decision to not indict the police officers who killed them. The collective reaction was reflective of a country unsettled by the criminal justice system's ongoing acceptance of structural discrimination. This article will focus on one university's social work faculty's collective response to the brutal killings of African-American men by police officers. With a main campus located in the suburbs and a satellite campus situated in a major city, the faculty felt compelled to guide students from both campuses through an understanding of what was happening locally and nationally by facilitating forums and programs to engage in dialog, not only in the classroom, but throughout the campus community. The concept of the living classroom is introduced and applied as a way to combat discrimination and advocate for social justice and human rights.},

Title = {Supply-side harm reduction strategies: Bolivia's experiment with social control},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {488-494},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Harm reduction approaches to drug control have almost exclusively focussed on consumers in northern countries. This article supports recent analysis that indicates that such policies also hold relevance for producer countries by drawing on recent policy innovations in Bolivia. When Evo Morales, the president of the national coca grower confederation, was elected the country's first indigenous president in 2005, he promised to fundamentally change 25 years of the U.S.-funded ``drug war{''} that had generated repeated human rights violations. The new policy, which implicitly incorporates harm reduction principles combined with respect for human rights, recognizes coca leaf's traditional use and cultural importance and relies on vigorous local organizations to implement a community-based programme called social control. Results to date indicate that Bolivia's social control experience has reduced violence in coca growing communities, ensured small farmers a subsistence income from coca and increased sovereignty, while making a modest contribution to containing expansion of coca cultivation. The programme has registered 50,000 farmers who are allowed to cultivate limited quantities of coca to supply traditional users and helped them gain secure title to their land. This registration is combined with satellite surveillance to guarantee that farmers do not exceed limits established by law. To date, the programme's reach is incomplete and coca is still diverted to the drug trade. Nonetheless, the approach may offer lessons for other drug producer countries, particularly where strong socio-political organizations are found in combination with closeknit communities holding shared cultural values.

Abstract = {Benefits of the next generation geostationary meteorological satellite observation (e.g., GEO-KOMPSAT-2A) are qualitatively and comprehensively described and discussed. Main beneficial phenomena for application can be listed as tropical cyclones (typhoon), high impact weather (heavy rainfall, lightning, and hail), ocean, air pollution (particulate matter), forest fire, fog, aircraft icing, volcanic eruption, and space weather. The next generation satellites with highly enhanced spatial and temporal resolution images, expanding channels, and basic and additional products are expected to create the new valuable benefits, including the contribution to the reduction of socioeconomic losses due to weather-related disasters. In particular, the new satellite observations are readily applicable to early warning and very-short time forecast application of hazardous weather phenomena, global climate change monitoring and adaptation, improvement of numerical weather forecast skill, and technical improvement of space weather monitoring and forecast. Several policy plans for expanding the application of the next generation satellite data are suggested.},

Title = {Impact of information technology on the earth sciences},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-319},
Abstract = {The earth sciences went through a major paradigm shift in the 1960s with the understanding that the earth's crust is composed of many crustal plates which are moving relative to each other. This new basic insight quickly led to the solution of many longstanding geological and geophysical problems. The new paradigm allowed earth scientists to construct models that could explain a host of geological phenomena front the formation of mineral deposits and oil and gas accumulations to the controls of earthquakes and volcanism. Information technologies, mainly the rapidly increasing power of mainframe computers allowed the building, testing, and stimulation of these often complex models. Data gathering techniques also improved with the development of, for example, digital reflection seismology which provided much clearer images of the earth's crust, well-logging techniques, and remote sensing of the earth's surface by imaging technologies carried on satellites. Newly available or rapidly developing information technologies are about to propel the earth sciences, especially, the applied earth sciences, into a new era. The component information technologies are now available to allow the earth sciences to move to a dynamic systems view of the world. Currently, available, three-dimensional reflection seismology techniques have resulted in remarkably clear images of portions of the earth's crust. Applied to oil and gas exploration, this has resulted in improved pictures of the structure and form, or architecture, of oil and gas reservoirs. However, with currently available technology we have, at best, only a static picture of the reservoir. Based upon this, geologists and petroleum engineers must infer the dynamics of fluid flow through the reservoir. Newly emerging four-dimensional seismic reflection technology techniques allow repeated imaging of the reservoir and the detection of fluid fronts, from which inferences can be made about the rates and direction of flow and fluid pathways. This is analogous to time-lapse photography, but the cost of such techniques means that the interval between surveys is very long and the inferences yield only quasi-dynamic information. Similar problems exist in understanding the current state and the dynamics of important aquifers which supply water to urban populations and also to active earthquake belts. The capability to understand these and other dynamic systems within the earth is a major challenge to earth scientists and their colleagues in related disciplines. Indeed, the nature of the problems is such that the solutions will not be found by earth scientists alone. Multidisciplinary approaches are needed and the information technologies will enable the sharing of models and concepts between disciplines. The key components of the information technologies that will enable this revolution range from sensor technologies through data management and computation to visualization technologies. Each of these components needs to be linked to the other so that we have a complete feedback from observation through modeling to knowledge building and decision making. Sensor technologies, particularly the rapid advance of fibre optic sensors, will allow the continuous monitoring of many processes within the earth. Recent tests by Chevron have demonstrated that fibre optic sensors can be deployed within oil wells and that the data gathered yields useful information on the changes occurring within the reservoir. In this particular rest, the data gathered was temperature data from a reservoir through which steam is being driven to flush out viscous oil. The temperature data yielded information on the speed of heating through the reservoir and the pathways through which the heat was dispersed. From this type of data we can begin to understand the dynamic behavior of the reservoir. Coupled with the available static models, geologists and engineers can better predict the response of the reservoir to various production schemes. Data gathering, data storage and manipulation/interrogation technologies either exist or are being developed which will allow the scientist and engineer to avoid data overload and focus on extracting information of value from the data. Without these technologies, we are in danger of being overwhelmed by data to the extent that we miss its information content. This is probably the greatest danger of the so-called information age. Visualization technology is very important to the earth sciences, which by their nature require geologists and geophysicists to be able to picture complex three- and even four-dimensional pictures. Previously, the only way to share these complex pictures was through simple two-dimensional charts. Visualization technologies are now advancing rapidly and three-dimensional pictures can be developed, manipulated, and shared between the various disciplines and cultures which now staff the multidisciplinary teams which are necessary to solve the many complex problems we are faced with. The next stage in visualization of complex earth structures is some type of virtual reality. Experiments conducted by Chevron's research staff have shown that it is possible to project complex images on to a plane surface and with the aid of special glasses viewers can see, manipulate and discuss the inferences of a three-dimensional image. Simulation and model building technologies are already very advanced because this is an area which progressed rapidly with the increasing capability of maining-frame computers and workstations. However, critical advances in both simulation technologies and the computational capability and speed of workstation have taken the application of simulation and modeling technology into the bands of the generalist. This is a very important development because it allows models to be built and processes to be simulated that give new insights and lead to intelligent and knowledgeable applications. The role of the specialist will change in this new world of dispersed and readily available technology. Application of this entire suite of information technologies to the understanding of both natural and culturally-induced processes within the earth's crust is the final prize. The complete cycle from data gathering through modeling to knowledge building and improved decisions allows the application of systems and control theory to processes within the earth's crust. This dynamic loop will drive a major paradigm shift in the earth sciences and greatly increase the value of their application and integration with other technical disciplines. The speed with which the vision becomes reality will rely not only on the provision of appropriately robust technology at economic prices but also on the ability of earth scientists and those from companion disciplines to grasp this opportunity and persuade society of the many economic, ecologic and cultural benefits of such an approach.

Abstract = {The expediency of transportation on the TRANS-Siberian railway is not in doubt for any of our contemporaries now, and its importance for development of Siberia and the Far East is quite obvious. However, this attitude to this transport artery was not formed immediately. Let us recall at least the fact that the Tomsk merchant class insisted that the road passed through Aleksandrovsk (now Novosibirsk). The decision of Tsar Alexander III on construction of the railway played crucial role. The built road contributed to the development of the cities through which it was laid. The situation with the decision on organization of the free movement from the mainland to Sakhalin seems to us similar to the one that was in front of laying of the line across Siberia. The issue will have to be addressed sooner or later. The laying of the highway to the island will give a powerful impetus to the social and economic development of the territories adjacent to the road and railway, which will pass through the bridge. In this article, we research specifics of climatic and hydrological factors that determine choice of type of hydraulic structures in the Nevelskogo Strait. The relevance of the research is dictated by the need for comprehensive review of the conditions that determine the choice of the Tatar Strait crossing line by the bridge. After taking into account the influence of geological and geomorphological factors, we turn our attention to climatic, weather and hydrological processes that will have a permanent impact on construction and operation. The aim of the research is to link together and analyze the data that characterize features of atmospheric and hydrosphere processes in narrow part of the Tatar Strait and conduct scientific research that will complement for engineering research and help identify based on simulation safest opening for construction of hydro-technical utilities that will connect opposite banks. Materials and methods. The materials for the study were cartographic materials, data of remote sensing of the Earth, information on climatic and weather conditions, data of hydrological, meteorological, Oceanographic observations, information obtained as a result of research works and engineering surveys in which the authors participated, as well as information from literary sources. Mapping in the geographic information environment allowed creating thematic maps reflecting the dynamics of hydrometeorological processes. The obtained information was used in construction of models of water circulation, formation and degradation of ice cover in the Nevelskoy Strait with the use of geoinformation technologies. The authors took a direct part in research of the leading line ``Novy{''} in 2001. As result of the research of the features of hydrometeorological conditions within the water area of the Nevelskogo Strait and its coasts, based on satellite monitoring data, observations at nearby weather stations, as well as confirmed by information obtained during engineering surveys, it was found that in area of the Nevelskoy Strait, adverse natural phenomena should be taken into account when choosing technical design solutions for selecting type of bridge or tunnel construction from mainland to Sakhalin. The spatial and temporal distribution of radiance in the area is due to astronomical reasons, decrease in duration of the sunshine in De-Kastri and Pogibi compared to Nikolaevsk-on-Amur is associated with frequent fogs that occur during atmospheric processes on border of land and sea. Extreme values of air temperature in Pogibi were registered at the Pogibi weather station - maximum of 27,3 degrees C and a minimum of -44,0 degrees C. Index of continentality is very high (amplitude - 71,3 degrees C), which can be explained by the influence of air masses removal from mainland in winter period. The important indicator for projecting - duration of frost-free period-ranges in Pogibi from 88 to 186 days (average - 137). Daily precipitation totals during warm period reached maximum values of 88 mm in October, 81 mm in August, and 78 mm in July. Snow cover in Pogibi lasts from 153 to 216 days. Winds of >= 30 m/s occur annually in spring and autumn, sometimes exceeding 40 m/s. Fogs in described area are observed throughout year. Snowstorms in strait and on its coastal are very common. Any increase in wind in winter is accompanied by blizzard transfer of snow. Thunderstorms occur 4-5 times a year. Dust storms are rare. Horizontal water circulation in the Northern part of strait is anticyclical in winter, and cyclonic circulation is active from May to September. In general, in spring water movement speed on surface is 2-7 cm/s and in summer it decreases to 1-4 cm/s. Changes in sea level in the Tatar Strait are in the range of 3,2-4,0 m. Duration of ice period at time moderate types of winters is 201 days. Collar ice in Pogibi in late March - early April averages 160 cm and varies from 119 to 190 cm depending on type of winter. Due to the strong tidal currents, the solid ice cover in channel of the middle part of strait is formed very rarely and on short time. The result of the increased ice cover dynamics is multiple layers of young ice up to 30 cm thick. Coastals in southern part of Strait are resistant to abrasion processes and practically do not collapse. The area enclosed between liding lines Lazarev cape - cape Pogibi in the North and cape South - cape Tyk - in the South has the most favorable conditions for the construction of bridge. Climatic and hydrological conditions throughout have relative similarity, which allowed us distinguish it when zoning as independent unit. The performed research allows us give an advantage to leading line ``Novy{''} (cape Nevelskogo - cape Lakh).},

Abstract = {A low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system has a range of missions delivering economic, environmental, and social benefits utilized by everyone almost every day. However, there exists a challenge for operational management of satellites in LEO because they are not accessible from a given point of earth at all times. In that case, a problem evolves that should be solved is to find a valid broadcasting pattern between satellites and ground stations. Nevertheless, being defined as the satellite broadcast scheduling (SBS) problem almost three decades ago, the few numbers of published studies on the problem used a restricted variety of solution approaches. The recent advances in information technology and tremendous undergoing change in the industrial automation entails handling the SBS problem more comprehensively and propose innovative solution approaches. This article proposes and evaluates three metaheuristic approaches for the SBS problem. A relaxation and decomposition approach is also proposed for generating tighter upper bounds to make justified performance evaluations. Besides the benchmark problems reported in the literature, new benchmark instances are generated and used in computational experiments. Results are evaluated to be promising and highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches.},

Title = {Review of ICESat and ICESat-2 literature to enhance applications discovery},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Altimeter data from the first-and second-generation NASA Ice, Cloud and land Elevation (ICESat) satellite missions has the potential to transform a variety of key applications through improved decision making such as ocean navigation, surface water monitoring, and wildland fuels assess-ments. Here we review the literature using ICESat and ICESat-2 data to identify applications -relevant literature, defined as research that can lead to the use of data products in decision -making, policy making or risk reduction activity for societal benefit. We used the scholarly database ProQuest to identify bibliographic citations which were likely to lead to applications and user communities of data from the ICESat and ICESat-2 satellite lidar missions. We use the network visualization software tool Quid to create visual representation of clusters according to the textual similarity of their abstracts. We then text mine the NASA Applied Sciences Project Portfolio website to identify applications-relevant keywords and use these in combination with Quid-generated terms to create subsets of the literature according to how likely it was to lead to an application. Visualizations generated using the Quid software are presented separately for both ICESat and ICESat-2. We found an overall increase in the number of applications-relevant pub-lications for ICESat-2 when comparing publications in the first four years after launch for both missions. This increase may be attributable to sustained efforts by the mission to reach out to the scientific and stakeholder communities during the pre-launch phase and to significant efforts by the mission to facilitate access to the data. However, our discovery of the literature also revealed a markedly low number of publications demonstrating actual applications of both ICESat and ICESat-2 data. We conclude that there is a need to cultivate a culture in academia that values linking science with use. We also identify multiple applications-relevant research where future applications efforts could focus.},

Pages = {282-300},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of female portrayal in advertisements on Palestinian female consumers' purchasing decisions. TV and online media were selected as the medium for the study. Specifically, the researchers examine the one-dimensional sexualized female portrayal in advertisements. Design/methodology/approach Culture is used as the lens through which the study examines the relationship between independent and dependent variables concerning the topic of this study. The study collected primary data from 395 Palestinian participants through a survey questionnaire. Findings The findings of the study revealed that there is a relationship between the independent variable (the sexualized female portrayal in foreign advertisements - advertisements originating in foreign countries) and the dependent variable (Palestinian female consumers' purchase decision). Additionally, the study found that the cultural differences between Palestine and other foreign countries have a negative impact on the Palestinian female consumers' perception of the product being advertised. Practical implications Although traditional marketing procedures would allow companies to filter and adapt particular adverts to suit various cultural, social and political environments, the advent of the open web and satellite TV channels extend the advertisements reach to audiences beyond their intended demographic. Originality/value This is the first study set in the Arab context (including Palestine) to explore the impact of sexualized female portrayal in advertisements on Palestinian female consumers' purchasing decision.},

Title = {Evaluating NOx emission inventories for regulatory air quality modeling using satellite and air quality model data},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of NOx emissions in the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ) State Implementation Plan (SIP) modeling inventories of the southeastern U.S. We used retrieved satellite tropospheric NO2 columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) together with NO2 columns from the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) to make top-down NOx emissions estimates using the mass balance method. Two different top -down NOx emissions estimates were developed using the KNMI DOMINO v2.0 and NASA SP2 retrievals of OMI NO2 columns. Differences in the top-down NOx emissions estimates made with these two operational products derived from the same OMI radiance data were sufficiently large that they could not be used to constrain the TCEQ NOx emissions in the southeast. The fact that the two available operational NO2 column retrievals give such different top-down NOx emissions results is important because these retrievals are increasingly being used to diagnose air quality problems and to inform efforts to solve them. These results reflect the fact that NO2 column retrievals are a blend of measurements and modeled data and should be used with caution in analyses that will inform policy development. This study illustrates both benefits and challenges of using satellite NO2 data for air quality management applications. Comparison with OMI NO2 columns pointed the way toward improvements in the CAMx simulation of the upper troposphere, but further refinement of both regional air quality models and the NO2 column retrievals is needed before the mass balance and other emission inversion methods can be used to successfully constrain NOx emission inventories used in U.S. regulatory modeling.

Abstract = {Satellite services benefit civil society by helping tackle challenges such as climate change, the digital divide, etc. They have the potential to deliver concrete benefits to European society through innovative services supporting economic, societal and environmental policies. Such benefits can trigger increased public support for space in Europe. However, this potential has yet to be achieved. This paper argues that technological bias, the diversity of interests and initiatives among stakeholders and their individual actions do not always serve their collective objective to ensure wide diffusion of satellite services. It draws on theories of diffusion of innovation and on its authors' participatory work with the space and the user communities and at their interface in an effort to help diffuse satellite services within civil society. One of the major causes of insufficient service diffusion is the weakness of the interface between the space and user communities; some of factors that currently contribute to this state of affairs are the space community's over-reliance on publicly financed, technical demonstration projects as solutions to service diffusion; insufficient coordination by public authorities of innovation policies and programmes with other public policies and objectives; and an insufficient integration of satellite services within users' culture, traditional tools and services. The discussion allows for conclusions to be drawn on how the system of stakeholders could function better in order for satellite services to be successfully diffused in Europe.

Title = {Conceptual design of a gliding UAV for bird strike prevention and observation},
Journal = {AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-75},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to create a conceptual design a bird-inspired unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can stay in the air for a long time while this design influences the species near the airport with predator appearance. To achieve that goal, reverse engineering methods took into account to find out optimal parameter, and effective bird species were examined to be taken as an example. Design/methodology/approach Design parameters were determined according to the behaviour of bird species in the region and their natural enemies. Dalaman airport where is located near the fresh water supplies and sea, was chosen as the area to run. To keep such birds away from the airport and to prevent potential incidents, information from animal behaviour studies is enormously important. According to Tinbergen, chicken and gees reacted to all short-necked birds because they thought they were predators. The entire method is based on information from these data, along with reverse engineering principles. Findings UAV can remain in the air for more than 5 min when the engine stops at an altitude of 200 m. Also, when the UAV loses altitude of 100 m, it can cover a distance of about 2 m with the 19.8-glide ratio. Moreover, 380 KV brushless electric motor can provide 5.2 kg thrust force with 17 x 8-inch folding propeller which means 1.3 thrust to weight ratio (T/W). This engine and propeller combination work up to 12 min at maximum power with 7000 mAh lipo-battery. The UAV can climb more than 40 min at 0.2 T/W ratio. Research limitations/implications While bird-inspired UAV trials have just begun, general ornithopter studies have taken smaller birds as their source because this is the limit of the flapping wing, one of the largest birds modelled in this study. Thus, it is inevitable the UAV influences other birds in the area. In addition, this bird's inherent flight behaviour, such as soaring, ridge lifting and gliding, will increase its credibility. Owing to size similarity with UAV systems, reverse engineering methods worked well in the design. Practical implications Some of the specialist try to fly trained falcon in airport as an alternative method. This study focussed on the design of a bird-inspired UAV by optimizing the glide performance, both for scare the other birds around the airport and for the observation of birds in the vicinity and for the identification of bird species. Social implications As this type of work has been proven to reduce the risk of bird strikes, the sense of flight safety on society will increase. Originality/value Researchers and companies generally work on flapping wing models for related subjects. However, these products are kind of model of the Falconiformes species which don't have too much influence on big birds. For this reason, the authors took account of Imperial eagle's specifications. These birds perform long soaring flights while seeking for prey like the glider design. So, the authors think it is a new approach for designing UAV for preventing bird-strike.},

Abstract = {Recent dramatic and deadly increases in global wildfire activity have increased attention on the causes of wildfires, their consequences, and how risk from wildfire might be mitigated. Here we bring together data on the changing risk and societal burden of wildfire in the United States. We estimate that nearly 50 million homes are currently in the wildland-urban interface in the United States, a number increasing by 1 million houses every 3 y. To illustrate how changes in wildfire activity might affect air pollution and related health outcomes, and how these linkages might guide future science and policy, we develop a statistical model that relates satellite-based fire and smoke data to information from pollution monitoring stations. Using the model, we estimate that wildfires have accounted for up to 25\% of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter <2.5 mu m) in recent years across the United States, and up to half in some Western regions, with spatial patterns in ambient smoke exposure that do not follow traditional socioeconomic pollution exposure gradients. We combine the model with stylized scenarios to show that fuel management interventions could have large health benefits and that future health impacts from climate-change-induced wildfire smoke could approach projected overall increases in temperature-related mortality from climate change-but that both estimates remain uncertain. We use model results to highlight important areas for future research and to draw lessons for policy.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the patterns and drivers of LULC dynamics in relation to the expansion of large-scale irrigated agriculture in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia from 1972 to 2016. Aerial photographs (1972), Landsat images (1980, 2000) and SPOT5 satellite images (2016) were analyzed using GIS tools to reveal LULC changes, and documentation, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were used to ascertain the biophysical and socioeconomic implications and drivers of these dynamics. The study revealed that cultivated and rural settlement land, and urban built-up areas had expanded at the expense of forestland, woodland, shrubland and grassland. While an increase in the production of cash crops had brought some benefits to smallholder farmers, such as access to irrigation and modern agricultural inputs and technologies, the unregulated conversion of natural vegetation to cultivated land resulted in a loss of biodiversity, deforestation, and reduction of pasture and firewood. We identified that significant LULC changes in the study area were caused by intersecting biophysical, economic, institutional, technological and demographic factors, which reinforced each other with varying magnitudes at different moments in time. These changes were underpinned by one key driver, that is, government agricultural policies that promoted investment in commercial agriculture for national and export markets. The study shows that understanding the complex interaction between the contributing factors and drivers of LULC change is crucial to inform decision-making and policies, in particular, by directing responses towards the underlying drivers of change rather than only the proximate causes.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a proposal for the creation of a project management model that incorporates the spatial sustainability within the design process of small satellites. The study includes the product life cycle within the sustainable design process. It will be possible to adopt current international efforts to deal with the problem of solid waste in space for each subsystem of the satellite platforms. The proposed model of the project management space enables planning, evaluation, control, execution and implementation, within the entire mission, strategy development and decision making, based on the principles of sustainability: economics, societal and environmental impact. There is a common acknowledgement that space technology development has thrown contamination beyond the borders of the earth, becoming lately a latent threat for several space activities. The creation of space debris is due to different causes such as the collision of solid objects in space, exploding fuel tanks, meteor impact, malfunctioning satellites and no recovery at the end of its useful life. There must be a balance between development space, as an enabler for countries that are making significant efforts to enter the space community, space missions and regulations; that can make costs unfeasible for several missions. Appropriate space policies and managerial models can help switching the perception of regulation as a barrier, rather than a technological enabler. Whereas the problem needs to be analyzed in a holistic way, the LEO orbit is the gateway for low cost mission and technology testing for micro satellites and smaller devices. Space agencies around the world are looking for solutions to mitigate and control waste found in Earth orbit especially in LEO, but it is very important to contemplate the space debris problem comprehensively. In Mexico, the recent creation of the Mexican Space Agency (AEM), gives us the opportunity to have direct involvement nationwide in generating research and development of space technology. This proposal will enable Mexico to develop capabilities that allow it to understand, analyze and propose project management practices to foster the adoption of a sustainable model for missions involving micro and smaller satellites. To accomplish that, initiatives from NASA, EADS, UN and other countries will be studied in order to develop an initial model to help management of the mission design process involving sustainable development criteria. In the specific case of Mexico, several initiatives will be launched, but it is necessary to adopt international standards for collaboration and development of space missions, involving international cooperation. The search for objective indicators for establishing the benefits that have been generated through the adoption of sustainable models is of paramount importance. Moreover, the assessment of the impact caused for the solid waste generation in space and their associated risks must be understood and incorporated in the design and life cycle process of space missions. The research will target indicators that will provide the features necessary for the generation of a comprehensive proposal based on the product life cycle sustainable management within the model space projects.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the changing international communications environment and explores the key elements of a new policy framework for the 21st Century. It addresses the issues related to changing markets, trade considerations, standards, regulatory changes and international institutions and law. The most important aspects will related to new international policy and regulatory frameworks and in particular to a new international code of ethics and behavior in the field of satellite communications. A new communications satellite policy framework requires systematically addressing the following points: Multi-lateral agreements at the nation State and the operating entity level Systematic means to access both private and public capital Meshing ITU regulations with regional and national policy guidelines including `'landing rights'' and national allocation procedures. Systematic approach to local partnerships Resolving the issue of the relative standing of various satellite systems (i.e. GEO, MEG, and LEO systems) Resolving the rights, duties, and priorities of satellite facility providers versus types of service providers. Beyond this policy framework and generalized legal infrastructure there is also another need. This is a need that arises from both increased globalism and competitive international markets. This is what might quite simply be called a `'code of reasonable conduct:'' To provide global and international communications services effectively and well in the 21st Century will require more than meeting minimum international legal requirements. A new `'code of conduct'' for global satellite communications will thus likely need to address: Privacy and surveillance Ethics of transborder data flow Censorship and moral values Cultural and linguistic sensitivity Freedom of the press and respect for journalistic standards As expanding global information and telecommunications systems grow and impact every aspect of modem life, the need for new international policy and especially new suitable standards of conduct in the field of satellite communications become ever more apparent and necessary.},

Pages = {213-227},
Abstract = {New media technologies are often met with political and public ambivalence, as they are perceived to threaten established activities, values and institutions, as well as bring progress and improve political, cultural and social life. Taking the Norwegian history of television as an empirical case study, this article relates to an international research agenda focusing on the cultural political debates in the early phases of broadcast media. The article is structured according to five key conjunctures where significant new media and technologies were introduced with corresponding political debates: the introduction of television (1940s-1950s), of colour television (1960s-1970s), of satellite, cable and commercial television (1980s), of digital distribution (1990s-2000s) and the expansion of television to new platforms (2000s). The article addresses the key arguments and dividing lines in these political debates, as well as the change in the perception of television when the medium is no longer new, but has become an integrated part of people's everyday life.},

Abstract = {Considering how individuals perceive landscape is important when undertaking land management decisions. However, understanding how the community perceives a landscape is complex involving their experiences in that landscape, their lived experiences and other socio-cultural processes. One of the key challenges to understanding perception is linking the landscape properties to what is experienced when individuals interact with the landscape. Increasingly the use of geospatial data offers a tool for understanding the landscape and perceptions. This study compares satellite estimates of land use with the perceptions of the inhabitants of Yungay, Chile. Viewshed analysis is used to reconcile the differences seen in the satellite image cover estimates and those of the participants. It was found that restricting the cover estimate to the visible landscape, provided similar estimates of cover to those made by the participants. This varied between demographic groups. With differences between participants living in urban and rural settings particularly evident.},

Abstract = {Forest resources in the drylands of Sudan are fluctuating in their tree cover and eco-functions. Reliable and timely information on their status is pivotal to address their socioeconomic and environmental benefits in the national environmental policy. Thus, this study aimed to develop an assessment and monitoring systems for their trees' cover, threats, and disturbances along with forests dependents' needs and activities in Wad Al-Bashir forest area with a view of establishing database for robust forests management plans and strategies. The study combines Ground-Based Survey (GBS), socioeconomic survey (structured questionnaire and key Informant interviews) and geo-special technique (satellite images for 1988, 2008 and 2018) as integrated methods for assessing and mapping the past and current forest conditions and disturbances. GBS results found and georeferenced sites of biotic and abiotic forest disturbances as well as man's detrimental activities like trees logging which have had affected trees' health and contributed to its degradation. The biotic threats were: invasive species (Acacia nubica), pest (Sinoxylon senegalensis) and climbers, while the effect of abiotic was mild like the wind effects. Social survey findings on the other hand, signposted the direct and indirect causes of deforestation and forest degradation. Direct causes were the conversion of forestland onto farmlands, illegal cutting and uncontrolled-grazing consecutively. Indirect causes were improper forest policy implementation, population growth, poverty and land tenure system. The geospatial technique showed considerable land use/land cover changes, where 2008 had considerable forest cover (72.2\%) compared with 1988 (63.8\%) and 2018 (58\%), and accordingly, 2018, encompasses vast farmland area than 1988 and 2008 accounting for 38, 25.9, and 6.1\% respectively. The study concluded that the effectiveness of using GBS, socioeconomic survey and geospatial technique as incorporated methods that could give a representation of all forests' related aspects in one scene as well as better understanding for the genuine status.},

Title = {Nighttime light satellite images reveal uneven socioeconomic development along China's land border},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {China shares its board with one developed and thirteen developing countries. A timely, precise, and efficient socioeconomic study of border regions is vital for evaluating political problems and identifying potential eco-nomic prospects. Usually, conventional socioeconomic statistical data suffer from significant time lags and un-equal statistical scales. This study utilized the random forest model to establish a connection between satellite -derived nighttime light data and the improved human development index (IHDI). The relationship was then applied to predict the IHDI, and differences in its strength, trend, and change pattern by bordering statistical units from 2000 to 2020 were evaluated. Our findings indicate that China's administrative units (AUCs) are more developed and have a greater development trend than their neighbors (AUNs). Except for the Tibet Autonomous Region, all AUCs are spatially more developed than AUNs, with the discrepancy widening between 2000 and 2020. Socioeconomic changes in AUCs predominantly exhibit a forward-leaping development pattern, which may be represented by a logarithmic (53\%) or sigmoid (22.6\%) function, whereas AUNs' socioeconomic changes exhibit either a late-leaping exponential (34.2\%) or static development (18.6\%) trend. The IHDI values in AUCs exhibit greater disparity as measured by the Theil index, than the AUNs, primarily due to the natural environ-ment, resource availability, and development policies. In less developed regions, harsh natural surroundings, temperatures, and scarce natural resources hinder socioeconomic growth.},

Title = {An energy-autonomous UAV swarm concept to support sea-rescue and maritime patrol missions in the Mediterranean sea},

Abstract = {Purpose For the crews and assets of the European Union's (EU's) Joint Operations available today, but a vast area in the Mediterranean Sea to monitor, detection of small boats and rafts in distress can take up to several days or even fail at all. This study aims to outline how an energy-autonomous swarm of Unmanned Aerial System can help to increase the monitored sea area while minimizing human resource demand. Design/methodology/approach A concept for an unattended swarm of solar powered, unmanned hydroplanes is proposed. A swarm operations concept, vehicle conceptual design and an initial vehicle sizing method is derived. A microscopic, multi-agent-based simulation model is developed. System characteristics and surveillance performance is investigated in this delimited environment number of vehicles scale. Parameter variations in insolation, overcast and system design are used to predict system characteristics. The results are finally used for a scale-up study on a macroscopic level. Findings Miniaturization of subsystems is found to be essential for energy balance, whereas power consumption of subsystems is identified to define minimum vehicle size. Seasonal variations of solar insolation are observed to dominate the available energy budget. Thus, swarm density and activity adaption to solar energy supply is found to be a key element to maintain continuous aerial surveillance. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted extra-occupationally. Resources were limited to the available range of literature, computational power number and time budget. Practical implications A proposal for a probable concept of operations, as well as vehicle preliminary design for an unmanned energy-autonomous, multi-vehicle system for maritime surveillance tasks, are presented and discussed. Indications on path planning, communication link and vehicle interaction scheme selection are given. Vehicle design drivers are identified and optimization of parameters with significant impact on the swarm system is shown. Social implications The proposed system can help to accelerate the detection of ships in distress, increasing the effectiveness of life-saving rescue missions. Originality/value For continuous surveillance of expanded mission theatres by small-sized vehicles of limited endurance, a novel, collaborative swarming approach applying in situ resource utilization is explored.},

Title = {Using the SLEUTH Urban Growth Model to Simulate Future Urban Expansion of the Isfahan Metropolitan Area, Iran},

Abstract = {Accelerating urban growth and land use/cover changes places increasingly pressure on the natural environment and human welfare and have become a global concern. Iran, as a developing country, is also experiencing growth of its urban areas during the last decades by high rate of rural-urban migration along with rapid socio-economic and political changes that has resulted in degrading environmental quality in many parts of Iran, particularly in the metropolitan areas such as Isfahan. Therefore, developing methods for assessing different urban growth planning scenarios and simulating urban expansion is critically important. The main goal of this study was simulating future urban expansion of Isfahan Metropolitan area from 2010 to 2050, by making use of cellular automata methodology in the SLEUTH modelling. The model was calibrated using historical data extracted from a time series of satellite images. The input data required by the model including Slope, Land use, Exclusion, Urban extent, Transportation and Hillshade were obtained from satellite images based on supervised classification. This research used the four images of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) acquired 1976, 1990, 2001, and 2010. Two scenarios were planned to simulate the spatial pattern of urban growth. The first scenario was historical urban growth, which permitted urban development maintenance of the historical trend and the second scenario was a more compact growth as an answer to hypothetical policies and the lack of land to decrease urban spreading. Calibration of the SLEUTH model for Isfahan metropolitan area showed a high spread coefficient, which means that the predicted mode of growth in Isfahan is ``organic{''} or edge growth. In Isfahan metropolitan area, topography was also shown to have an enormous effect in controlling the urban development. The results of this study invites many opportunities for further studies in many other regions which are experiencing growth of their urban areas and can be useful for planners, and policy makers to implement preventative or controlling factors in advance and make more informed strategic decisions.},

Title = {Leveraging Uncertainty in Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Stocks and Fluxes},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Forests sequester similar to 25\% of anthropogenic carbon (C) emissions annually and are of increasing interest for their potential as Nature-based Climate Solutions (NbCS). Emergent from the need to assess terrestrial ecosystem health and quantify C storage and fluxes, several gridded products documenting terrestrial C and changes in C stocks over time have been developed. However, researchers have not yet systematically compared C distributions across products, or developed a clear path forward for investigating and leveraging this cross-product uncertainty in estimates of terrestrial C. Alaniz et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EF002560) synthesize multiple published products to constrain the distribution of forest C stocks and fluxes globally. Building off of their results, we comment on opportunities for advancing both basic science and NbCS policy recommendations through systematic product cross-comparisons and targeting of areas with differing levels of uncertainties in the terrestrial C sink. Plain Language Summary Forests absorb and store a large amount of the carbon from the CO2 emitted by humans. These forests also provide the potential for storing more human emitted CO2 that helps delay climate change through targeted forest management. However, for both natural sciences and management, careful documentation of the amount of carbon in forests and how it is changing is necessary. Over time the number of ways to measure and evaluate this carbon has increased. The synthesis in Alaniz et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EF002560) of these numerous efforts provides an integrated view of carbon in forests and how it is changing. We propose expanding these observational synthesis efforts, leveraging uncertainty to help direct both basic scientific research and the potential for managing ecosystems to delay climate change.},

Title = {What is value in the New Space Economy? The end-users' perspective on satellite data and solutions},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},

Volume = {210},

Abstract = {New industrial dynamics are disrupting the space sector. New stakeholders bringing in capital, technologies, and knowledge from other industries are developing next-generation space infrastructures and services. Both commercial and institutional space projects have to be valuable for a wider set of end-users, asking not only for economic returns but also social and environmental benefits. Space organizations urge understanding and fostering value in the New Space Economy ecosystem. Indeed, end-users are still struggling to enact the expected value of satellite data and solutions for their business. This paper aims to investigate the expected value and the level of adoption (enacted value) of satellite data and satellite-based solutions in the New Space Economy ecosystem from end-users' perspective. We interviewed 21 managers from end-user organizations in different sectors (i.e., Insurance \& Finance, Energy \& Utility, Transportation \& Logistics). Value is deeply discussed in general management literature, and we identify Value Theory as the theoretical lens with the most explanatory power for the phenomenon under examination. From the end-users' perspective, we frame the expected value and the enacted value in taking strategic and tactical decisions regarding their activities, services and products, laying the foundations for further studies of value mechanisms in the New Space ecosystem. Our research set a theoretical and conceptual foundation on value in the New Space ecosystem. It also delineates the blurred boundaries of the New Space ecosystem, the main stakeholders involved, and their perception of value. Insights and implications for strategic and innovation management are also provided. Practitioners may exploit our research results and leverage the end-users-oriented framework to develop next-generation space projects in the New Space ecosystem. We also discuss the limitations and further developments of this research.},

Title = {INFLUENCE OF CULTURAL CONTEXT ON FORMATION OF SCIENCE POLICY (French Experience)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Pages = {119-129},
Abstract = {The article examines the science policy as an element of national public policy. The author gives the definition of the term ``science policy{''} and analyzes all the stages of formation of science policy in France. Based on the concept of the Neal, Smith and McCormick, based on the fact that the development of science policy is related to the beginning of the space era and the launch of the first satellite by USSR, the author analyzes in detail the formation of science policy in France after WW II. A special role in this formation played the activity of Pierre Mendes-France, and Charles de Gaulle in the 1950s. The author also investigates the background of the French science policy and begins with the analysis of the establishment in the 16th century of the College de France. The author attempts to identify the national specifics of research activities in France and its impact on the actual science policy. The existence of axiological pluralism in science suggests that scientific communities in different countries are influenced by their national cultures, which consist of different sets of values. To make a structure of the model for research culture in France, the author uses the description model of national cultures composed by D. Oyzerman for describing culture as a set of three interrelated sets of factors. The first group includes religious and philosophical beliefs, historical context and linguistic tradition. The second involves social institutions associated with the legal and economic systems of society, as well as education and upbringing. The third one is internalized by the individual part of the culture, which includes cultural norms and values. Guided by the proposed model, the author examines the scientific culture in France in terms of three dimensions: linguo-cultural, institutional, and axiological. This approach allows to cover fully all the most important factors affecting the national peculiarities of French research school, and demonstrate inconsistency of the positivist interpretation of scientific knowledge as based on universality and supra-national nature.},

Title = {Monitoring Quarry Area with Landsat Long Time-Series for Socioeconomic Study},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Quarry sites result from human activity, which includes the removal of original vegetation and the overlying soil to dig out stones for building use. Therefore, the dynamics of the quarry area provide a unique view of human mining activities. Actually, the topographic changes caused by mining activities are also a result of the development of the local economy. Thus, monitoring the quarry area can provide information about the policies of the economy and environmental protection. In this paper, we developed a combined method of machine learning classification and quarry region analysis to estimate the quarry area in a quarry region near Beijing. A temporal smoothing based on the classification results of all years was applied in post-processing to remove outliers and obtain gently changing sequences along the monitoring term. The method was applied to Landsat images to derive a quarry distribution map and quarry area time series from 1984 to 2017, revealing significant inter-annual variability. The time series revealed a five-stage development of the quarry area with different growth patterns. As the study region lies on two jurisdictions-Tianjin and Hebei-a comparison of the quarry area changes in the two jurisdictions was applied, which revealed that the different policies in the two regions could impose different impacts on the development of a quarry area. An analysis concerning the relationship between quarry area and gross regional product (GRP) was performed to explore the potential application on socioeconomic studies, and we found a strong positive correlation between quarry area and GRP in Langfang City, Hebei Province. These results demonstrate the potential benefit of annual monitoring over the long-term for socioeconomic studies, which can be used for mining decision making.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out with the aim of feasibility evaluation of the application of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches for settling balance between economic development and environmental impact as well as to facilitate the respective decision-makings in Zemkan basin, west of Iran. The biobjectives of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches are minimizing the destructive effects on the environment (less erosion and sediments) and maximizing the economical incomes resulted from different land uses (more net present value). Satellite images were used for recognition of different land uses and the areas of these land use. In this study, the environmentalists and Zemkan basin users were selected as environmental and economical players, respectively. The results reveal that Nash bargaining solution, which is the result of the multi-objective game theory model, differs from Pareto optimalities, obtained through the classical multi-objective model. Nash bargaining solution offered more satisfactory solutions based on decision-makers' priorities. In addition, the overall results showed that the results of fuzzy programming approach were very close to the results of the multi-objective game theory model. Therefore, in both methods, the decision variables of semi-closed forest, open forest, non-irrigated agricultural lands and barren rocky lands were eliminated and the ones of rural areas, urban areas, and water body remained unchanged. The innovation of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches, which can be understood and interpreted well by decision makers, is setting a kind of balance between economic and environmental concerns in watershed management. The results also show that multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches can be applied to many other issues concerning the environmental management. The upcoming researches can concentrate on developing a third objective like social concerns and accordingly to-objective games would be applied instead of bi-objective ones.},

Title = {When the Best Pandemic Models are the Simplest},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simple Summary There is a large variety of data available about the coronavirus pandemic, but we still lack data about some important factors. Who is likely to infect whom and under what conditions and how long after becoming infected? These factors are the essence of transmission dynamics. Two groups using identical complex models can be expected to make different predictions simply because they make different choices for such transmission parameters in the model. A policy setter has no way to choose between their predictions. Simple models are not good for assessing contact tracing and detecting asymptomatic carriers, and do not replace agent-based models. However, we explain how simple models can be used to answer complex questions by adding what we call satellite equations, addressing questions involving age groups, death rates, and likelihood of transmission to nursing homes and to uninfected, isolated populations. Simple models are ideal for showing policy setters who are not mathematically sophisticated the kinds of interventions that are needed to achieve public goals. As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the globe, people are debating policies to mitigate its severity. Many complex, highly detailed models have been developed to help policy setters make better decisions. However, the basis of these models is unlikely to be understood by non-experts. We describe the advantages of simple models for COVID-19. We say a model is ``simple{''} if its only parameter is the rate of contact between people in the population. This contact rate can vary over time, depending on choices by policy setters. Such models can be understood by a broad audience, and thus can be helpful in explaining the policy decisions to the public. They can be used to evaluate the outcomes of different policies. However, simple models have a disadvantage when dealing with inhomogeneous populations. To augment the power of a simple model to evaluate complicated situations, we add what we call ``satellite{''} equations that do not change the original model. For example, with the help of a satellite equation, one could know what his/her chance is of remaining uninfected through the end of an epidemic. Satellite equations can model the effects of the epidemic on high-risk individuals, death rates, and nursing homes and other isolated populations. To compare simple models with complex models, we introduce our ``slightly complex{''} Model J. We find the conclusions of simple and complex models can be quite similar. However, for each added complexity, a modeler may have to choose additional parameter values describing who will infect whom under what conditions, choices for which there is often little rationale but that can have big impacts on predictions. Our simulations suggest that the added complexity offers little predictive advantage.},

Journal = {MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {56-62},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Land use/cover changes during the period 1963-1993 and their ecological and socioeconomic implications in Pranmati Watershed in the Indian Himalaya were analyzed on the basis of information extracted from archival records, satellite data, participatory discussions, and field measurement. Agricultural land use was practiced on 14.2\% of the watershed area in 1963 compared with 18.5\% in 1993. More than 50\% of the agricultural expansion occurred in community forests between 1850 and 2400 m and on 20-30degrees slopes. The increase in area under cash crops, potato, and amaranth accompanied an 86\% increase in the mean monetary value of crop produce but at the cost of abandoning the traditional crops Fagopyrum esculentum, F. tataricum, Panicum miliaceum, and Setaria italica. Agricultural land use changes were such that mean manure input at the watershed scale increased by 50\%, and fodder output from crops decreased by 40\%, implying the increasing pressure on forests. Local forest management institutions have not been adequately empowered to respond to the growing economic aspirations of people and the increasing population pressure. Research and policy support for improvement in traditional soil fertility management practices and forest resource-based economic development opportunities for local people is needed to reduce the threat from agriculture to forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Changes of the Mediterranean fish farm sector towards a more sustainable approach: A closer look at temporal, spatial and technical shifts},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {214},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean is a miniature of the world with 22 countries sharing the its coastline. In the past few decades aquaculture production in Mediterranean showed an increasing trend but brought with it several environmental and socio-economic issues. In order to establish sustainable development, the Mediterranean aquaculture sector has adopted integrated management plans. Within this framework, our aim was to evaluate the state of the Mediterranean aquaculture industry with respect to sustainable growth, focusing mostly on the spatial scale. We used the evaluation framework for ICZM proposed by Bille ` (2007) that takes into consideration how multiple policies can be accountable for sustainable management practices. In order to identify the different management regimes and trends in the area, satellite images were processed as a diagnostic tool to locate and analyse the characteristics of the Mediterranean fish farms in cages over time. Google Earth historical images were used to map the characteristics of the Mediterranean fish farms in three different periods between 2006 and 2017. The average coastal surface occupied by the fish cages in the Mediterranean was 0.01\%; only two countries currently exceed this percentage due to having a large number of cages (Turkey and Greece) and five others due to their limited coastline. In total, 15,499 cages were counted in recent years in the Mediterranean area, 46.5\% of them belonging to larger cluster aggregations. Over time, square steel cages have been gradually replaced by larger and technically more advanced circular cages that significantly increased the finfish production rates. To understand the level of integration done by Mediterranean aquaculture we examined four dimensions of aqua culture issues: (i) policy and management; (ii) environment; (iii) economy industry and (iv) social. State-of-theart aquaculture policy and management systems were integrated in national legislations, boosting the production, ensuring at the same time better environmental quality from and for the aquaculture. Despite these positive results for the Mediterranean aquaculture industry, other factors, such as social issues related with the general bad image of aquaculture and the conflicts with local stakeholders, seem to inhibit the further development of aquaculture production. Thus, studies like this can identify factors that have favoured the expansion of aqua culture but also the evolving needs of the stakeholders in the context of changing market and social conditions.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion control is a major issue in agriculture. The no till system of soybean production has been widely adopted; however, soil erosion may increase due to pasture and forestry land convert ion to crop-land in the marginal Pampas, Argentina. The aim of this paper is to assess the conflicts and trade-off among environmental, economic and social interests by using three continuous multi-criteria approaches and a set of different weights. Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423 km(2)) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5th and 6th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak run-off, annual erosion. sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming. compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2:1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation-consensus process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Space for society: How Eurisy's activities and research support publicawareness raising on satellite applications in meeting societal needs},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {178},
Pages = {329-334},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {When we talk about Space, our interlocutors think about planets, stars, asteroids, astronauts and, sometimes satellites. But, only a small percentage is aware of what satellite technology can do and the relevance of satellite applications in our everyday life. From satellite communication, to navigation and to earth imagery, satellites data and technology are contributing in improving our daily life, or businesses or helping the management of our cities. Often, the end users come across an obstacle in communicating their needs to the service providers. On the other side, the service providers themselves are not fully aware how to communicate with the end-users. In some cases, this lack of communication makes difficult to meet the demand of space applications from the user side with the supply from the service providers. Eurisy, an association of space agencies established thirty years ago, works to put the end users at the core of the space value chain. In this last decades, Eurisy has been attentive and responsive to the changes of the space sector trying to picture how end users are becoming familiar with space technology. In particular, how the democratisation of space is turning space, especially satellite technology, into an enabler to guarantee the development of a sustainable living, accessible to everyone. Eurisy recently started a review of the case studies collected over the last ten years thanks to direct testimonials, event and conferences, publications and surveys. The user-centred approach adopted is innovative in the space sector and over the years proved to be effective in connecting users and service providers in different contexts. The paper aims at: 1-Identifying challenges and barriers that characterise the relations between service and/or information providers and end users. 2- Analysing the changes occurred in the relations between end users and service providers from 2007 to date in Europe. 3- Presenting the reasons that motivates the use of satellite data and technologies and which of these is the most used. 4- Presenting Eurisy's approach as an applicable model outside the European borders and the benefits deriving from connecting space and society. Furthermore, the paper will briefly present the ongoing activities as examples of the work put in place by the organisation and how the user-centred approach is applied.},

Abstract = {Deforestation and degradation are important aspects of landscape dynamics and have global significance. Quantification of landscape pattern using landscape metrics help in characterisation of landscapes and thus overall health of the forest cover. Himalayan foothills are one of the most important and fragile landscapes. Developmental activities and depdendence on the forest resources have altered the spatial pattern of these natural landscapes to a great extent. These changes in the landscape were analysed using satellite data from 1990, 2001 and 2006. The vegetation type maps of Dehradun forest division were prepared by supervised classification technique in order to study the landscape dynamics. Patch density, edge density, shape index, cohesion index, interspersion and juxtaposition index, normalised entropy, and relative richness are some important landscape metrics used in the study for quantifying the characteristics of landscape. The landscape metrics analysis and transformation analysis show that the forested areas are getting degraded and physical connectedness between the patches have also decreased making them isolated. The study demonstrates the importance of geospatial tools for monitoring the impact of disturbances on the forest ecosystem health, which can further help in landscape management.},

Title = {Development of a Methodology for Strategic Environmental Assessment: Application to the Assessment of Golf Course Installation Policy in Taiwan},

Abstract = {Some countries, including Taiwan, have adopted strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to assess and modify proposed policies, plans, and programs (PPPs) in the planning phase for pursuing sustainable development. However, there were only some sketchy steps focusing on policy assessment in the system of Taiwan. This study aims to develop a methodology for SEA in Taiwan to enhance the effectiveness associated with PPPs. The proposed methodology comprises an SEA procedure involving PPP management and assessment in various phases, a sustainable assessment framework, and an SEA management system. The SEA procedure is devised based on the theoretical considerations by systems thinking and the regulative requirements in Taiwan. The positive and negative impacts on ecology, society, and economy are simultaneously considered in the planning (including policy generation and evaluation), implementation, and control phases of the procedure. This study used the analytic hierarchy process, Delphi technique, and systems analysis to develop a sustainable assessment framework. An SEA management system was built based on geographic information system software to process spatial, attribute, and satellite image data during the assessment procedure. The proposed methodology was applied in the SEA of golf course installation policy in 2001 as a case study, which was the first SEA in Taiwan. Most of the 82 existing golf courses in 2001 were installed on slope lands and caused a serious ecological impact. Assessment results indicated that 15 future golf courses installed on marginal lands (including buffer zones, remedied lands, and wastelands) were acceptable because the comprehensive environmental (ecological, social, and economic) assessment value was better based on environmental characteristics and management regulations of Taiwan. The SEA procedure in the planning phase for this policy was completed but the implementation phase of this policy was not begun because the related legislation procedure could not be arranged due to a few senators' resistance. A self-review of the control phase was carried out in 2006 using this methodology. Installation permits for 12 courses on slope lands were terminated after 2001 and then 27 future courses could be installed on marginal lands. The assessment value of this policy using the data on ecological, social, and economic conditions from 2006 was higher than that using the data from 2001. The analytical results illustrate that the proposed methodology can be used to effectively and efficiently assist the related authorities for SEA.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric fine particulate matters (PM2.5) have raised global concerns because of their markedly adverse effects on public health and environmental quality. In parallel with technological variations and social changes in the evolving industrialization pathways in China, there is an acute need to evaluate the long-term spatio-temporal trend of PM2.5 concentrations across China after years of elevation. Toward this end, an integrated high-resolution satellite-derived (1998-2016) and ground-measured (2015-2017) PM2.5 data base was applied. Satellite-derived annual mean PM2.5 grids were firstly validated via comparison with collocated surface in situ PM2.5 measurements and were then used for trend analyses. The estimated linear trends from gridded PM2.5 data indicated that PM2.5 concentrations in China increased mainly before 2008 and have decreased since then, with prominent decreases observed primarily in south China. To corroborate the satellite-based PM2.5 trend estimations, surface in situ PM2.5 measurements from the period from 2015 to 2017 were applied to further evaluate the decreasing rate after 2014, at which time the Chinese ``Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan{''} was enforced. The results revealed that the national mean PM(2.5)concentrations decreased by about 6.5 mu g/m(3) from 2015 to 2017, with prominent decreases (by a rate of 5-10 mu g/m(3) per year) observed primarily associated with largePM(2.5) concentrations in Central China, North China, Northeast China, and East China during the period from October to December. Our systematic trend assessment provides a deepened understanding of PM2.5 variations across China in the past few years in association with the newly promoted action plan and offers a brief guideline for relevant policy making in the future.},

Title = {Prediction of Multi-Scale Socioeconomic Parameters from Long-Term Nighttime Lights Satellite Data Using Decision Tree Regression: A Case Study of Chongqing, China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) and the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) nighttime light (NTL) data provide an adequate proxy for reflecting human and economic activities. In this paper, we first proposed a novel data processing framework to modify the sensor variation and fit the calibrated DMSP/OLS data and NPP/VIIRS data into one unique long-term, sequential, time-series nighttime-lights data at an accuracy higher than 0.950. Both the supersaturation and digital value range have been optimized through a machine learning based process. The calibrated NTL data were regressed against six socioeconomic factors at multi-scales using decision tree regression (DTR) analysis. For a fast-developing city in China-Chongqing, the DTR provides a reliable regression model over 0.8 (R-2), as well explains the variation of factor importance. With the multi-scaled analysis, we matched the long-term time-series NTL indices with appropriate study scale to find out that the city and sub-city region are best studied using NTL mean and stander derivation, while NTL sum and standard deviation could be better applied the scale of suburban districts. The significant factor number and importance value also vary with the scale of analysis. More significant factors are related to NTL at a smaller scale. With such information, we can understand how the city develops at different levels through NTL changes and which factors are the most significant in these development processes at a particular scale. The development of an entire city could be comprehensively explained and insightful information can be produced for urban planners to make more accurate development plans in future.},

Title = {Estimation of consumption potentiality using VIIRS night-time light data},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {As an informative proxy measure for a range of urbanisation and socioeconomic variables, satellite-derived night-time light data have been widely used to investigate the diverse anthropogenic activities and reveal social economy development disparities from the regional to the national scale. The new-generation night-time light data have been proven to potentially improve our understanding in the development and inequality of urban social economy due to its high spatial resolution, strong timeliness and minimal background noise. These night-time light data are derived from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) instrument with day/night band located on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite. This study proposed a hybrid model to estimate urban consumption potentiality based on the comprehensive information of human activities obtained from the VIIRS night-time light data. Our method established a flexible geographically weighted regression-based estimation model based on the residential consumption data and DN values of the VIIRS data to predict the possible consumption potentiality of other urban areas in dynamic time. The experiment conducted in Guiyang, a provincial capital in China, affirms that our model is proven to have higher accuracy compared with traditional regression models and can potentially provide guidance for improved business management and increased profit.},

Abstract = {Choice experiment surveys are commonly used to assess the general public's willingness to pay for different levels of environmental quality. However, respondents need to understand what they are valuing or they will make potentially wrong assumptions based on different experiences and frames of reference. Three-dimensional computer generated models or Virtual Environments (VE) have so far seen little use in economics research, probably due to the complexity and cost of developing and delivering them to study participants. The few studies that have used them find that VE are superior to static image presentations in helping people evaluate complex data. For this study we developed virtual environments for a choice experiment about coastal erosion management using free, easy-to-use software and Google Earth(C) satellite imagery and presented these to respondents as video tours. Our results indicate that the VE treatment reduced choice error, reduced left-right bias and improved respondent engagement and retention when compared with static images. There were also differences in WTP between the two groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Individuals that produce resources are often exploited by several individuals; such exploitation may or may not be tolerated. We modeled the decision of a resource owner to accept one scrounger (the ``satellite{''}) and of both of these to accept being joined by another (the ``floater{''}). In general, satellites tolerated floaters when competition between them was low, while owners tolerated satellites when facilitation between satellite and floater was high. When floaters were likely to find resources without joining, owners were more likely to resist satellites. In some cases, Nash equilibria were also mutually beneficial for two of the three individuals. Our model makes the counterintuitive prediction that mutually beneficial coalitions between satellites and floaters can only arise when the net benefits arising from the other's presence are low. When facilitation between satellites and floaters is high, satellites and owners may form mutually beneficial groups and groups with division of labor, or alternatively, owners may benefit from encouraging floaters to join. Finally, our model suggests there must be differences in competitive ability or some benefit of familiarity for owners to tolerate satellites but not floaters. We discuss empirical evidence for these and other predictions of the model.},

Abstract = {As shown in the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), as well as in Chapter 12 of Agenda 21, desertification is one of the world's most serious environmental problems, threatening the earth's fertility and population food security. Desertification is spreading due to climatic causes and human activities.. both those performed in a single area and those performed all over the world (climate change). Some measures can only be taken at a general level, but others have to be taken at regional, national or local level. Combating desertification and the tasks to mitigate the effect of droughts requires an integrated treatment of the physical. biological and socio-economic aspects. Understanding natural, social, cultural, economic and political features of local and national environments, in particular their dynamics and interactions, is considered as one of the basic principles of the Convention to Combat Desertification. Improvement of the knowledge base is widely considered as a necessary first step for addressing the relevant problems and developing appropriate solutions. Many research and data-collection activities are being implemented worldwide, mainly to better understand the state of the natural resources in dry lands areas. Such dry lands cover 40\% of the world's land surface, and are the habitat and source of livelihood for more than one billion people. Of the 5,200 million hectares of dry lands used for agriculture, more than 70\% are suffering from degradation. Africa, Asia, and Latin America are particularly under threat, but some 30 million hectares of European territory, especially those bordering the Mediterranean, are also potentially affected, threatening the livelihoods of over than 16.5 million people. The mind of partnership as inspired by the UNCCD requires flexibility and simplicity in information circulation to all levels of decision: from local to international, and vice versa. The assessment of the current status of desertification in a country is a crucial first step for understanding and correcting the problem. National assessment maps are needed for planners and decision-makers to establish priorities for combating desertification. Considered the cost of the environmental damage caused by land degradation and considered the absence of reliable information, sustainable decisions can hardly be made. Dry land desertification can be remedied or even reversed, if updated information is provided on affected areas; especially concerning land use detection. Satellite images can highlight relevant land use change along with increased surface reflectivity, temperature, dryness and dustiness; infrared sensors can detect vegetation stress due to environmental shifts. This satellite data, if combined with in-situ information, processing tools, models, databases management and geo-information systems (GIS), can create standardized and comparable geo-information products, which can also be used to satisfy UNCCD reporting requirements. Advanced technologies for helping desertification assessment and monitoring, can be of great value: computers, satellite images, GIS and databases management systems have revolutionized natural resource data collection methods. However, these tools do not substitute field studies. Another problem related to gathering data on and lands is the diversity of sources, which influences negatively, and sometimes crucially, the GIS and databases quality. As result, the quality of products used in making decisions, can be more or less useful or erroneous. Therefore a quality control of the natural resources management databases in the and regions becomes a necessity.},

Abstract = {Space debris, an externality generated by expended launch vehicles and damaged satellites, reduces the expected value of space activities by increasing the probability of damaging existing satellites or other space vehicles. Unlike terrestrial pollution, debris created in the production process interacts with firms' final products, and is, moreover, self-propagating: collisions between debris or extant satellites creates additional debris. We construct a formal model to explore private incentives to launch satellites and to mitigate space debris. The model predicts that, relative to the social optimum, firms launch too many satellites and choose technologies which create more debris than is socially optimal. We discuss remediation strategies and policies, and demonstrate that Pigovian taxes can be used to internalize the debris externality.},

Abstract = {Urumqi is the capital city of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in the northwestern part of China. The city has witnessed rapid growth in recent years, mostly because of the national and regional policies and its economic and social development. We implemented this study to understand the urban growth of Urumqi City, to forecast its growth tendency for the next two decades and to provide a basis for urban management. The SLEUTH are employed to build the urban growth simulation and forecasting model. We calibrated it with historical data derived from a time series of satellite images. The results showed the utility of the modeling method in explaining the spatial pattern of urban growth. In the future years during the forecast period, Urumqi city should focus on enforcing the urban internal spatial structure optimization and spatial displacement, paying attention to the urban internal differentiation, improving the economic value and utilization of urban land resources, controlling the speed of urban growth, and retaining certain land reserve and development space for the future development.},

Abstract = {It is European Commission policy to charge modes of transport according to the marginal social cost of their use of the infrastructure, including environmental costs. However, progress in implementing this process has been slow, partly because of the difficulty of measuring and valuing these costs. This need has led to a great deal of research in this area in recent years. The paper presents the results of some of this research, and in particular of the European Commission-funded Unification of Accounts and Marginal Costs for Transport Efficiency (UNITE) project. UNITE used the Impact Pathway Approach developed in the ExternE project series to provide a bottom-up methodology for the estimation and valuation of marginal social costs of transport, taking into account the diversity of circumstances in terms of location (e. g. population density, and speed and direction of winds) and time of day. The paper first explains the approach used for the measurement and valuation of environmental costs and then presents results on both total and marginal costs. It then discusses the results of a parallel project using the same methodology that estimated the marginal social cost of road use at a very disaggregate level for different vehicle types, locations, types of road and times of day for Great Britain. The results show that off the main network and outside the conurbations, private cars are currently overcharged, but elsewhere they are charged too little, particularly in the main conurbations. Buses, and even more so heavy goods vehicles, are undercharged to a greater extent. Only a kilometre-based charging system capable of charging at different rates by vehicle type, type and location of road, and time of day is capable of reflecting all these differences; due to the development of global positioning satellite (GPS) technology, such systems are now becoming available.},

Abstract = {Urban air pollution is among the top 15 causes of death and disease worldwide, and a problem of growing importance with a majority of the global population living in cities. A important question for sustainable development is to what extent urban design can improve or degrade the environment and public health. We investigate relationships between satellite-derived estimates of nitrogen dioxide concentration (NO2, a key component of urban air pollution) and urban form for 83 cities globally. We find a parsimonious yet powerful relationship (model R-2 = 0.63), using as predictors population, income, urban contiguity, and meteorology. Cities with highly contiguous built-up areas have, on average, lower urban NO2 concentrations (a one standard deviation increase in contiguity is associated with a 24\% decrease in average NO2 concentration). More-populous cities tend to have worse air quality, but the increase in NO2 associated with a population increase of 10\% may be offset by a moderate increase (4\%) in urban contiguity. Urban circularity ({''}compactness{''}) is not a statistically significant predictor of NO2 concentration. Although many factors contribute to urban air pollution, our findings suggest that antileapfrogging policies may improve air quality. We find that urban NO2 levels vary nonlinearly with income (Gross Domestic Product), following an ``environmental Kuznets curve{''}; we estimate that if high-income countries followed urban pollution-per-income trends observed for low-income countries, NO2 concentrations in high-income cities would be similar to 10 x larger than observed levels.},

Abstract = {This study explores how aggregate payments received from two different U.S. agricultural conservation programs-the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)-influence county-level cover crop adoption rates in the Corn Belt. We utilize 2006-2015 county-level panel data with information on cover crop adoption rates and per acre conservation program payments to achieve the study objective. Cover crop adoption information is collected from a unique satellite-based data set of soil health practices. Linear fixed effect models, fractional regression models, and a moment-based instrumental variables model are used in the empirical analysis. Our estimation results suggest that EQIP payments have a statistically significant positive effect on cover crop adoption at the county level. In contrast, we find statistical evidence that CSP payments reduce the county-level proportion of acres planted to cover crops. These opposing effects indicate that it is possible for conservation payment programs to have differing aggregate effects on adoption rates of specific conservation practices (e.g., cover crops in this case). Moreover, these results imply that not all conservation programs ``are created equal{''} and differences in policy designs and focus areas may induce diverging effects in the uptake of particular conservation practices.},

Abstract = {With the unprecedented urbanization during the past three decades, air quality in many Chinese cities has been a serious issue which poses great challenges for urban sustainability. This study examines the health consequences of development patterns in China by establishing the linkage between urban form, air pollution level, and cardiorespiratory mortality rate. We assembled a dataset by compiling a series of variables from multiple sources, including China's Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system, which forms a nationally representative sample of mortality for the year 2005, Chinese census, satellite imagery, and the Chinese National Land Use Database. After controlling for local climate, demography, socioeconomics, and other pollution factors, this study finds that urban form elements (e.g., urban density, fragmentation level, forest/green space ratio) have significant influences on PM2.5 (atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers) concentration, thus influencing the incidence of cardiorespiratory mortality at the county level. These results may help explain how the type and pattern of development shape public health by influencing air quality and form an evidence-based land use policy to improve environmental quality and public health.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {208},
Pages = {24-35},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Urban tree canopy provides a suite of ecological, social, and economic benefits to the residents of urban areas. With an expanding recognition of these benefits among city residents, there is growing concern that access to these benefits is not distributed equally and may represent the presence of an environmental injustice. This study examines the spatial relationship between median household income and tree canopy variables, specifically realized tree canopy cover and potential tree canopy cover, for Toronto, Canada. Toronto provides a strong empirical focus as it is a densely populated urban setting reported to be exhibiting an increase in the geographic polarization of residents based upon household income. Spatial relationships between median household income and tree canopy variables are evaluated using the bivariate Moran's I statistic, a specialized local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). This method explicitly identified where statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low household income coincide with significant clusters of high and low urban tree canopy, providing the basis for an examination of the policies and management decisions that led to this temporal snapshot. The importance of these spatial clusters is examined from the perspective of understanding the impact of urban change (both socio-demographic and built form), and from the standpoint of improving equality of access to city trees and their benefits resulting from future tree planting decisions.

Title = {The migration and institutional sheltering of children and adolescents in the Federal District, Brazil},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MIGRATION HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to relate the phenomenon of migration to the Federal District (DF, Brazil), with the figures for institutional shelter of children and adolescents. Design/methodology/approach - The method chosen was the documental analysis of special folders that were processed in the Defense Office for Children and Adolescents of the DF from January 2007 to August 2009. The sample consisted of 545 special folders, referring to a total of 1,007 children and adolescents. Findings - The results indicate that most children and adolescents received at the shelters were from families living in the satellite cities of the DF (53.4 percent) and surroundings (8.3 percent), and were mainly from rural areas of the Northeast region of the country and also from the deprived areas of the states of Goias and Minas Gerais, near the DF. Among the main reasons for institutional shelter, is violence, abandonment by family, poverty and living on the streets. Research limitations/implications - It can be inferred that the policies of ``population clusters{''} in the DF were responsible for this migratory process and population growth of satellite cities and surrounding areas. It is understood in this way that the migration processes resulted in the rupture of the bond with the family of origin and an insertion into a reality, which again challenge these families in a situation of poverty and violence. Social implications - The reality of vulnerability and social exclusion of migrant families who leave their support networks in their home states need urgent attention of local public policies, especially with regard to encouraging the construction of other support networks and creating contexts of cultural identification in the communities, especially the neediest. The support and presence of quality public services in these communities and the preventive action of social policies are also considered essential to ensure quality of life and adequate subsistence to the people who migrate to the DF. Originality/value - Brasalia became the symbol of hope for unemployed people or for those suffering from their income being below the poverty level. Faced with this migratory reality, this paper discusses the situation of families of children and adolescents institutionally sheltered in the DF, given their social situation regarding poverty, unemployment, lack of support from their family of origin and lack of access of distribution of public policies and income generation.},

Abstract = {Effective ocean and coastal data management are needed to manage marine ecosystem health. Past ocean and coastal data management systems were often very specific to a particular application and region, but this focused approach often lacks real-time data and sharing/interoperating capability. The challenge for the ocean observing community is to devise standards and practices that enable integration of data from sensors across devices, manufacturers, users, and domains to enable new types of application and services that facilitate much more comprehensive understanding and analyses of marine ecosystem. A given kind of sensor may be deployed on various platforms such as floats, gliders or moorings, and thus must be integrated with different operation. and data management systems. Simplifying the integration process in existing or newly established observing systems would benefit system operators and is important for the broader application of diverse sensors. This paper describes a geospatial ``sensor web{''} architecture developed by the ``NeXOS{''} project for ocean and coastal data management, based on the concepts of spatial data infrastructure and the Sensor Web Enablement framework of the Open Geospatial Consortium. This approach reduces the effort to propagate data front deployed sensors to users. To support the realization of the proposed Next generation Ocean Sensors (NeXOS) architecture. hardware and software specifications for a Smart Electronic Interface for Sensors and Instruments (SEISI) are described. SEISI specifies small lower-power electronics. minimal operating system, and standards-basedresearch software to enable web-based sharing, discover, exchange, and processing of sensor observations as well as operation of sensor devices. An experimental scenario is presented in which sensor data front a low-power glider with low-bandwidth intermittent satellite communications is integrated into the geospatial sensor web using the NeXOS architecture.},

Journal = {TOURISM ANALYSIS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-69},
Abstract = {The agreement between international agencies that Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA) are the most appropriate way to measure the economic contribution of tourism has led to an explosion in the number of countries (and regions) developing such accounts. In reliably reconciling visitor supply and demand, TSAs offer improved information for tourism policy development and economic impact assessments, both of which are important in guiding resources and support for new tourism infrastructure and individual events. There are, however, a number of conceptual and structural issues that limit the usefulness of the TSA for economic modeling purposes. This article suggests that while the collection and manipulation of information that supports the TSA will aid impact and policy assessment, a further reengineering of the TSA framework is necessary to lever the full benefits for such studies. The TSA is found to be ideally used as a basis for complementary modeling techniques, including that of Computable General Equilibrium and Social Accounting Matrices.},

Volume = {93},

Pages = {1236-1242},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to innovatively propose to improve the efficiency of satellite observation and avoid the waste of satellite resources, a genetic algorithm with entropy operator (GAE) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites' task planning algorithm. Design/methodology/approach - The GAE abbreviated as GAE introduces the entropy value of each orbit task into the fitness calculation of the genetic algorithm, which makes the orbit with higher entropy value more likely to be selected and participate in the remaining process of the genetic algorithm. Findings - The simulation result shows that in a condition of the same calculate ability, 85\% of the orbital revisit time is unchanged or decreased and 30\% is significantly reduced by using the GAE compared with traditional task planning genetic algorithm, which indicates that the GAE can improve the efficiency of satellites' task planning. Originality/value - The GAE is an optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. It combines entropy in thermodynamics with task planning problems. The algorithm considers the whole lifecycle of task planning and gets the desired results. It can greatly improve the efficiency of task planning in observation satellites and shorten the entire task execution time. Then, using the GAE to complete SAR satellites' task planning is of great significance in reducing satellite operating costs and emergency rescue, which brings certain economic and social benefits.},

Abstract = {The meteorological satellite service range is extensive, and science and technology and related industries have become beneficiaries of it. The complex meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship warrants quantitative evaluation. This study investigates the meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network to provide a new research perspective for meteorological satellites in the field of management. For literature analysis, 16 meteorological satellite stakeholders are identified through keyword screening, classified, and coded. A meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network model is then constructed through social network analysis (SNA). Ego, local, and overall networks are analyzed from three perspectives to measure the network principle and to form a relationship network coordination degree evaluation system. The improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is then used to determine index weights and evaluate the relationship network coordination process design comprehensively. In empirical analysis, data for the meteorological satellite Fengyun-4 are obtained through questionnaire survey and literature analysis. Ucinet6 is used to generate relationship networks and analyze various stakeholder roles and status, stakeholder relationship network coordination degree, and evaluation results. The results demonstrate that the competent meteorological satellite department, the meteorological administration, the National Meteorological Centre, and the government are in the center of the Fengyun-4 stakeholder relationship network, with coordination degree in an ``average{''} state. Thus, establishing a stakeholder coordination mechanism may strengthen connection and promote the development of meteorological undertakings.},

Abstract = {Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are often conducted to evaluate the worth of existing data and data yet to be collected from proposed new missions. As missions increasingly require a broader Earth systems focus, it is important that the OSSEs capture the potential benefits of the observations on end-use applications. Toward this end, the results from the OSSEs must also be evaluated with a suite of metrics that capture the value, uncertainty, and information content of the observations while factoring in both science and societal impacts. This article presents a soil moisture OSSE that employs simulated L-band measurements and assesses its utility toward improving drought and flood risk estimates using the NASA Land Information System (LIS). A decision-theory-based analysis is conducted to assess the economic utility of the observations toward improving these applications. The results suggest that the improvements in surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and total runoff fields obtained through the assimilation of L-band measurements are effective in providing improvements in the drought and flood risk assessments as well. The decision-theory analysis not only demonstrates the economic utility of observations but also shows that the use of probabilistic information from the model simulations is more beneficial compared to the use of corresponding deterministic estimates. The experiment also demonstrates the value of a comprehensive modeling environment such as LIS for conducting end-to-end OSSEs by linking satellite observations, physical models, data assimilation algorithms, and end-use application models in a single integrated framework.},

Abstract = {In the past decade during IEEE sponsored professional meetings(2),(3) the theme of ``Global Health Transformation through true Interoperability{''} was brought to the forefront in the inaugural keynotes. Some technologies that started with the monitoring of hemodynamic variables of astronauts by NASA in the 60s were further developed by the Department of Defense for the purposes of treating their injured in the battlefield via Telemedicine. By August 511, 1997 President Clinton signed the first piece of legislation that was allowing the concepts of homecare to be tried to measure cost and medical effectiveness. With the development of Internet, the World Wide Web (WWW), social media, intelligent agents, mobile technology, sensors, and pieces of clothing containing them a new generation of devices have been created offering new possibilities for improvements particularly in areas such assist of living (for those suffering from chronic conditions), and homecare in general. The use of wearable computing in general and the use of augmented reality in the developed world in particular offer some unique opportunities to improve outcomes. In the 21(st) Century and as the Health Care and Public Health infrastructure intersect deeper into the many Information Technology (IT) subfields, abundant and formidable changes can occur that will allow society to shift current systems into some where wellness and disease prevention will be the focus. Many changes can affect positively medical and cost effective outcomes as well as the elimination of medical errors and patient safety for example. In these arenas, with the convergence of science, technology and with Information Technology acting as a catalyst for change, health care systems around the world are slowly shifting from -hospital based{''} ones into distributed systems that include: hospitals, clinics, homecare systems with treatment and management of chronic diseases for the elderly via Internet, etc. In order to achieve such visions, multiple efforts have been tried for creating electronic health record as well as the information highway for their use. In the US the health system is very scattered and most hospital systems do not contain for example mental health, dental health and or vaccine registry information. On one hand through major medical research the emergence of clinical and health data repositories or ``Intelligent Data Warehouses{''} that not only include traditional clinical data, but also advanced imaging, molecular medicine, tissue micro-array analysis and other bioinformatics information is available. These increasingly multi-modality data warehouses are constantly updated, continuously expanded and populated with millions of records. Although these repositories of electronic information can be leveraged not only to improve point of care clinical decision-making for individual patients, they can also support population health chronic and infectious disease analytics (i.e., epidemiology and surveillance), cost efficient multi-center (e.g., and multi-country) clinical trials, and comprehensive post-market pharmaco-vigilance. On the other hand the integration of healthcare and public health is a major concern as well. Globalization (i.e., the interdependencies that each country has with many others) for example has raised the sense of awareness through ``the information highway{''}. In 2004 the total production of flu vaccines coming to the US from the UK's Chiron had to be thrown away (approximately in the range of 42 to 44 million vaccines). During and since 2007 the US public has learnt through successive media stories related to: the death of pets due to food-import contamination, children's toys imports containing lead paint, food contamination, drug contamination, drug ingredients contaminated, etc. During 2008 we heard about: People getting very sick from fish containing the ciguatera toxin and Tab / drinking water containing about 36 different medications, e.g., antibiotics, antidepressants, etc. As the northern hemisphere prepared for the second wave of the 2009 H1N1 Flu Pandemic (which was expected to start around October 2009) all nations could have benefited by having epidemiology and surveillance data from all southern hemisphere nations available for the production of more ``accurate{''} vaccines. In 2011 the European Union had to cut back in their consumption of vegetables and fruit because of an e-coli outbreak. Simultaneously the food from Asia in sonic cases was contaminated with radiation from the nuclear disaster caused by the combination of earthquake / tsunami at the Fukushima site. In South America the eruption of the volcano Puyehue in Chile closed all the airports in Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and the south of Brazil. All of these events resulted in major conflicts regarding world demand for food supplies. Still the perfect opportunity to transform our health care systems to a strategy of disease prevention and wellness is in the horizon. Using information technology as an enabler, we can encompass a wide range of opportunities that can start at the cellular, molecular and genetics levels and go as far as population health. Initial immunization studies show the level of antibody titers against viral diseases depends on the circadian time of inoculation. The concepts of chronobiology and chrono-therapeutics can be used to generate disease prevention strategies based on these circadian-rhythm dependencies. Just imagine how the public could also be better protected not only against environmental threats, water contamination, food borne diseases through the use of remote sensing data and a worldwide food enterprise architecture, but through alerts that could flow into a person through Wearable Computing, Augmented Reality and the Veillances. Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom could ``flow{''} into an individual alerting him/her that they need to immediately visit their doctor, or stop consuming certain products. Some examples of our current problem environment could change outcomes by using these tools: 1. Getting the right information at the right time ---the steroid injection that they got for pain from laboratory x (in Massachusetts) is contaminated ( Just in the USA, between September 2012 and March 2013 at least 44 people have died and over 700 are contaminated from fungal meningitis according to the CDC) and their life may be at risk; 2. Preventing potential water and or food poisoning --- on February 4(th,), 2013, a report regarding the drinking water in many places within the State of California containing large amounts of Arsenic. Since we eat year round vegetables and fruits, livestock, poultry, etc. from that State, it may require the public to be cautious. As discovery from new research expands our knowledge about our body, its genome, and the cause-effect of new drugs, it also provides an opportunity to bring not only all these types of information to the forefront of the patient regardless where she /he may be at, but enable the transition from a system that has focused on disease to one that will focus on wellness through prevention and hopefully improve the quality of our lives.},

Title = {Enhancing the Australian Gridded Climate Dataset rainfall analysis using satellite data},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Rainfall estimation over large areas is important for a thorough understanding of water availability, influencing societal decision-making, as well as being an input for scientific models. Traditionally, Australia utilizes a gauge-based analysis for rainfall estimation, but its performance can be severely limited over regions with low gauge density such as central parts of the continent. At the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the current operational monthly rainfall component of the Australian Gridded Climate Dataset (AGCD) makes use of statistical interpolation (SI), also known as optimal interpolation (OI) to form an analysis from a background field of station climatology. In this study, satellite observations of rainfall were used as the background field instead of station climatology to produce improved monthly rainfall analyses. The performance of these monthly datasets was evaluated over the Australian domain from 2001 to 2020. Evaluated over the entire national domain, the satellite-based SI datasets had similar to slightly better performance than the station climatology-based SI datasets with some individual months being more realistically represented by the satellite-SI datasets. However, over gauge-sparse regions, there was a clear increase in performance. For a representative sub-domain, the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) value increased by + 8\% (+ 12\%) during the dry (wet) season. This study is an important step in enhancing operational rainfall analysis over Australia.},

Title = {Global Observational Needs and Resources for Marine Biodiversity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {The diversity of life in the sea is critical to the health of ocean ecosystems that support living resources and therefore essential to the economic, nutritional, recreational, and health needs of billions of people. Yet there is evidence that the biodiversity of many marine habitats is being altered in response to a changing climate and human activity. Understanding this change, and forecasting where changes are likely to occur, requires monitoring of organism diversity, distribution, abundance, and health. It requires a minimum of measurements including productivity and ecosystem function, species composition, allelic diversity, and genetic expression. These observations need to be complemented with metrics of environmental change and socio-economic drivers. However, existing global ocean observing infrastructure and programs often do not explicitly consider observations of marine biodiversity and associated processes. Much effort has focused on physical, chemical and some biogeochemical measurements. Broad partnerships, shared approaches, and best practices are now being organized to implement an integrated observing system that serves information to resource managers and decision-makers, scientists and educators, from local to global scales. This integrated observing system of ocean life is now possible due to recent developments among satellite, airborne, and in situ sensors in conjunction with increases in information system capability and capacity, along with an improved understanding of marine processes represented in new physical, biogeochemical, and biological models.},

Abstract = {Up to 1,000 drowning deaths occur every year on Lake Victoria in East Africa. Nocturnal thunderstorms are one of the main culprits for the high winds and waves that cause fishing boats to capsize. The High Impact Weather Lake System (HIGHWAY) project was established to develop an Early Warning System for Lake Victoria. Prior to HIGHWAY, weather forecasts for the lake were overly general and not trusted. Under the HIGHWAY project, forecasters from weather service offices in East Africa worked with leaders of fishing communities and Beach Management Units to develop marine forecasts and hazardous-weather warnings that were meaningful to fishermen and other stakeholders. Forecasters used high-resolution satellite, radar, and lightning observations collected during a HIGHWAY field campaign, along with guidance from numerical weather prediction models and a 4.4-km resolution Tropical Africa model, to produce specific forecasts and warnings for 10 zones over the lake. Forecasts were communicated to thousands of people by radio broadcasters, local intermediaries, and via smartphones using the WhatsApp application. Fishermen, ferry-boat operators, and lakeside communities used the new marine forecasts to plan their daytime and nighttime activities on the lake. A socioeconomic benefits study conducted by HIGHWAY found that similar to 75\% of the people are now using the forecasts to decide if and when to travel on the lake. Significantly, a 30\% reduction in drowning fatalities on the lake is likely to have occurred, which, when combined with the reduction in other weather-related losses, generates estimated socioeconomic benefits of \$44 million per year due to the HIGHWAY project activities; the new marine forecasts and warnings are helping to save lives and property.},

Title = {Monitoring Mining-Induced Geo-Hazards in a Contaminated Mountainous Region of Indonesia Using Satellite Imagery},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Mining-induced or enhanced geo-hazards (MGHs) pose significant risks in rural mountainous regions with underground mining operations by harming groundwater layers, water circulation systems, and mountain stability. MGHs occurring in naturally contaminated environments can severely amplify socio-environmental risks. A high correlation was found among undermining development, precipitation, and hazards; however, details of MGHs have yet to be adequately characterized. This study investigated multiple mining-induced/enhanced geo-hazards in a naturally contaminated mountain region in Bone Bolango Regency, Gorontalo Province, Indonesia, in 2020, where a rapidly developing coexisting mining sector was present. We utilized PlanetScope's CubeSat constellations and Sentinel-1 dataset to assess the volume, distribution, pace, and pattern of MGHs. The findings reveal that severe landslides and floods accelerated the mobilization of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) via the river water system, thus considerably exacerbating socio-environmental risks. These results indicate potential dangers of enhanced PTE contamination for marine ecosystems and humans at a regional level. The study design and data used facilitated a comprehensive assessment of the MGHs and associated risks, providing important information for decision-makers and stakeholders. However, limitations in the methodology should be considered when interpreting the findings. The societal benefits of this study include informing policies and practices that aim to mitigate the negative impacts of mining activities on the environment and society at the local and regional levels.},

Title = {The Growth of China's Non-governmental Space Sector in the Context of Government Support for Public-Private Partnerships: An Assessment of Major Legal Challenges},
Journal = {SPACE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The effectiveness of public-private partnerships (PPPs) has been emphasized in Chinese policy-making discourse in recent years, and policies have been introduced to promote the adoption of PPPs. A 2016 White Paper on China's space activities advocated for policies that encourage `social forces' (including non-governmental space entities) to participate in space development. The White Paper proposed amending the government procurement process of space products and services and facilitating cooperation with the private space sector. Furthermore, `satellite internet' was introduced into the scope of space policy as a new type of infrastructure, providing opportunities to establish PPPs in space programs. Nonetheless, the military-dominated nature of space exploration has resulted in a complicated administration and strict supervision of non-governmental entities in order to develop space activities, including launching satellites. In addition, government-owned enterprises, commonly acknowledged as `public' parties of PPPs, are counted among the `social forces' authorized to act as `private' parties in the Chinese PPP market. Therefore, favorable PPP policies are applied to public entities. This impedes the growth of underdeveloped non-governmental space entities, and as such, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. From a national space legislation perspective, clear and supportive rules for nongovernmental space activities administration and permissions of operation should be established. Concerning PPP rules, based on fully considering existing laws, measures ought to be taken to improve the procurement measures of space products and services. Moreover, rules concerning the `value for money' evaluation criteria and other details deserve to be created or improved upon to ensure nongovernmental participants benefit in PPP programs conducted with public partners.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Impervious surface is mainly defined as any surface which water cannot infiltrate the soil. Due to the impact of urban impervious surfaces (UIS) on environmental issues, the amount of impervious surfaces has been recognized as the most significant index of environmental quality. Detection and analysis of impervious surfaces within a watershed is one of the developing areas of scientific interest. This study evaluates and compares the accuracy and performance of five classification algorithms-supervised object-based nearest neighbour (NN) classifier, supervised pixel-based maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), supervised pixel-based spectral angle mapper (SAM), band ratioing normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized difference impervious index (NDII)-in extracting urban impervious surfaces. Our first aim was to identify the most effective method for mapping UIS using Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 satellite data. The second aim was to compare and reveal the efficiency of the spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data in extracting UIS. The results revealed that the supervised object-based NN approach using the visible and near-infrared bands of both satellite imagery produced the most homogenous and accurate map among the other methods. The object-based NN algorithm achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.91\% and 88.64\%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.82 and 0.77 for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, respectively. The study also showed that the Sentinel-2 image yielded better results than the Landsat-8 pan-sharpened image in extracting detail and classification accuracy. Comparing these methods in the selected challenging study area can provide insight into the selection of the classification method for rapid and reliable extraction of UIS.},

Abstract = {This article presents the current status and characteristics of China's space programme before describing the country's future goals and the specific types of research and satellite production that will be undertaken to realize them. China's programme, although small, has achieved much in terms of economic and social benefits for its people (eg through land-surveying, communications, education, water conservation and earthquake prediction). This is a result of the emphasis placed on applied satellites, coordination of production, development and research and intensive ground testing. This emphasis will remain, along with the effort to ensure that new satellites are long-lived and stable in operation. However, a change from the previous policy of independence is signalled by a growing interest in international cooperation, including that with other developing countries like Brazil.

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {3671-3691},
Abstract = {This article examines shifting approaches to audience measurement in the context of platformization of cultural production and the turn to data-driven fandom in the evolving screen ecology in China. Focusing on the video streaming service iQiyi, the article considers its pivot away from view counts to an algorithmic measurement regime. It critiques the platform's legitimacy-building strategy, in which the problematization of data manipulation is not only flawed, but also evasive and hypocritical. It reveals how the shift in audience measurement is closely connected to iQiyi's approach to platformization. Specifically, the article delineates how operationalization with data through a satellite platform serves the new regime by mobilizing and commodifying data-driven fandom, thereby consolidating platform power in the broader screen ecology. It analyzes how the economic and cultural logic of the approach is underpinned by (1) the metric of celebrity impact; (2) the metric of fan value; (3) perishable data and accelerated temporality by design; and (4) metrics-informed decision-making. The article concludes by outlining the implications for research on the co-evolution of audience measurement and platformization.},

Title = {Current and future land fire risk mapping in the southern region of Sumatra, Indonesia, using CMIP6 data and GIS analysis},
Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Land fires lead to a deterioration of environmental quality and have perilous social and economic aspects. One method for mitigating this hazard is to determine the range of fire risk areas. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the current and potential future fire risk in the Ogan Komering Ilir, southern Sumatra region of Indonesia, using CMIP6 data and geospatial technology. In order to analyze fire risk areas, the Landsat 8 satellite image from 2021 (as a baseline period) was used. Variables like the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land surface temperature (LST) were extracted from the satellite image. Then, the standard precipitation index (SPI) was determined using rainfall data from meteorological stations. For future period prediction (periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060), this study used future climate data from the CMIP6. By overlaying these variables, current and future fire risk zone maps were produced. The results obtained showed that in the current period, around 726.4 km(2) (4.2\%) of the area was at high fire risk, then 5,621.3 km(2) (32.7\%) and 10,835.3 km(2) (63.1\%) were at moderate and low fire risk zones, respectively. Furthermore, for the future period, this study estimated there was an increase in high fire risk areas of about 14\% during 2021-2040 and 30\% during 2041-2060. This was recorded in the southern and northern parts of the study area. Fire risk areas were strongly associated with NDMI, NDVI, and LST. The study's findings may be useful for land fire management in fire-prone areas.},

Abstract = {The availability of ``free{''} positioning services provided by the satellite systems operated by the United States (GPS) and Russia (GLONASS) has resulted in worldwide recognition of the broad range of social and economic benefits that can be realized from this technology. Under ideal conditions, the performance of these systems has proved to be so good that those who make policy and those who are responsible for national budgets have been sold on the concept of a future satellite-only environment.. In support of this concept, traditional terrestrial radionavigation systems become redundant and can be terminated with concomitant savings. More recently the vulnerabilities associated with satellite positioning technology and the international political reality of accepting free services from single States that possess military control over these services have resulted in a number of position papers, studies and reports on the use of satellite technology. This paper reviews some recent significant documents and addresses what appears at first to be an insurmountable complex problem facing the achievement of global harmonization of radionavigation systems. A way forward is proposed based on a mix of legally and politically acceptable terrestrial and satellite systems.},

Abstract = {NOAA's Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) is a physical space and research framework to foster collaboration and evaluate emerging tools, technology, and products for NWS operations. The HWT's Experimental Warning Program (EWP) focuses on research, technology, and communication that may improve severe and hazardous weather warnings and societal response. The EWP was established with three fundamental hypotheses: 1) collaboration with operational meteorologists increases the speed of the transition process and rate of adoption of beneficial applications and technology, 2) the transition of knowledge between research and operations benefits both the research and operational communities, and 3) including end users in experiments generates outcomes that are more reliable and useful for society. The EWP is designed to mimic the operations of any NWS Forecast Office, providing the opportunity for experiments to leverage live and archived severe weather activity anywhere in the United States. During the first decade of activity in the EWP, 15 experiments covered topics including new radar and satellite applications, storm-scale numerical models and data assimilation, total lightning use in severe weather forecasting, and multiple social science and end-user topics. The experiments range from exploratory and conceptual research to more controlled experimental design to establish statistical patterns and causal relationships. The EWP brought more than 400 NWS forecasters, 60 emergency managers, and 30 broadcast meteorologists to the HWT to participate in live demonstrations, archive events, and data-denial experiments influencing today's operational warning environment and shaping the future of warning research, technology, and communication for years to come.},

Title = {Impacts of Community-Based Forest Management Policies Implemented by a Local Forest Institution: A Case Study from Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines},

Abstract = {A number of developing countries have implemented forest tenure reforms, including community forestry, to achieve social justice. While many studies have assessed the impact of community forestry, few have examined how interventions of local forest institutions influence the conditions of forests and forest dwellers. This study addresses this gap by examining the impacts of forest management policies implemented by the Federation of Vista Hills, Kalongkong and Kakilingan Upland Farmers, Inc. (Federation) in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. Specifically, the study aimed to: (1) examine these interventions in relation to livelihood, income, forest condition, and equity (LIFE) indicators; (2) measure the impacts of these interventions on LIFE indicators; (3) analyze relations between the interventions and LIFE indicators; and (4) identify policy implications to promote sustainable and equitable benefits from local forest governance. Data were compiled from a household-level survey, interviews, satellite image analysis, and a secondary data review. Correlation analysis was performed on the survey results. The Federation's interventions were found to have improved forest condition and equity. However, they had limited impact on livelihoods and no significant effect on household incomes. Hence, the Federation needs to undertake household-level initiatives to improve the financial capital of forest-dependent populations. Moreover, policy-makers should devolve the issuance of resource use permits to local Department of Environment and Natural Resources offices. Central forest policies, particularly those on forest resource utilization, require adaptation to local situations as incentives for forest-dependent populations to sustainably manage forest resources.},

Abstract = {The International Space University (ISU) was created to deliver graduate-level education, training and development for young professionals in the space and satellite sector, both at its Central Campus in Strasbourg, France and at locations around the world. In its two-month Summer Session Programme (SSP) and one-year Masters of Space Studies (MSS) as well as the Master of Space Management (MSM), ISU not only offers its students a unique curriculum covering all disciplines related to space programmes and enterprises - space science, space engineering, systems engineering, space policy and law, business and management, and space and society, but does so in an International, Interdisciplinary and Intercultural (3I) context. An essential component of both the MSS and SSP programmes are the Team Projects. In these, ISU students are given the opportunity to solve complex problems together in an active 3I environment. The Interdisciplinary aspect requires all the varied disciplines relevant to space to be addressed, so introducing students to the broad perspectives necessary to work in the space field. The International aspect provides valuable experience in working effectively and collaborating with professionals from all parts of the globe. The Intercultural aspect allows students to interact with and understand people from a variety of different backgrounds: professional, academic, cultural and national each with their own approaches to organisation, decision-making, problem-solving, etc. Together, the 3I approach prepares ISU students for the complex, multicultural environment of today's world space community. This paper, written in the 3I spirit by a lawyer and an engineer (graduates of SSP2003 and SSP2004 respectively), outlines ISU and its programmes, explains the importance of the 3I approach, describes the implementation of 3I through the Team Project process, illustrates the authors' own experience of ISU programmes and Team Projects and assesses the benefits accrued.},

Title = {Linking MODIS-derived forest and cropland land cover 2011 estimations to socioeconomic and environmental indicators for the European Union's 28 countries},

Abstract = {With the proliferation of satellite-derived data, it is now possible to link land cover with socioeconomic and environmental indicators. This manuscript focuses on the 2011 forest and cropland estimations for the European Union's 28 countries (EU28) derived from moderate resolution imaging spectoradiometer observations and identifies links to socioeconomic indices such as the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, urbanization degree (UD), Human Development Index (HDI), ecological footprint, and total biocapacity. Results show that GDP per capita and UD are related to forest decrease, as countries with high GDP per capita have a 10\% higher urban population and on average 40\% less forest share than the EU28 average. The negative relation between the urban population and forest share is even stronger within the moderate GDP countries. Linear fit models reveal that for these countries, a 5.0\% increase in urban population leads to a 7.4\% decrease of forest share and a 3.9 \% increase of cropland share, something contradictory to the general belief that urban population increase is mostly at the expense of agricultural land. In addition, affluent countries with higher HDI tend to have smaller forest per capita values, which is less than half of the EU28 average. Such statistics can become an important indicator for policy advisors for assessing sustainable development.},

Title = {High-resolution spatially explicit land surface model calibration using field-scale satellite-based daily evapotranspiration product},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {596},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {High-resolution simulation of water budgets across the agricultural landscape is critically important to a variety of applications, such as precision agriculture, water resources management, and environmental quality assessment. Model-data integration has been shown to be an effective approach to reduce model uncertainties and there is a growing opportunity to improve land surface modeling through spatially explicit calibration with satellite data in recent decades. Recently, a satellite-based daily 30-m resolution evapotranspiration (ET) product BESS-STAIR has been developed, achieving a high performance and well capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of ET across the U.S. Corn Belt. To explore the potential of high-resolution spatially explicit calibration for advancing land surface modeling at fine scales, we carried out calibration experiments for the Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) over cropland using this newly developed BESS-STAIR ET. We first used Sobol sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for the Noah-MP's ET simulation. The most sensitive vegetation (minimum stomatal resistance) and soil parameters (saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated matric potential, and a soil pore size distribution parameter) were calibrated using BESS-STAIR ET to improve model simulation of surface water balance. We conducted calibration experiments at 8 eddy covariance flux tower sites that grew maize and soybean across the U.S. Corn Belt, as well as a regional calibration study on the Spoon River watershed in Champaign, Illinois. When benchmarked with flux tower measurements, the BESS-STAIR ET-calibrated model (driven by flux tower forcing) on average reduced the RMSE of hourly ET from 61 W/m(2) to 47 W/m(2) for maize, and from 66 W/m(2) to 53 W/m(2) for soybean, and matched the performance of directly calibrating using flux tower measured ET. The regional study found that calibration using BESS-STAIR ET also improved the simulation of long-term regional water budgets and achieved better performance of ET than traditionally lumped calibration using streamflow. Further analysis revealed that the high-resolution calibration can resolve the spatial variations of ET to a certain extent, and the accuracy of the calibration can be largely attributed to the low bias and excellent long-term correlation of the BESS-STAIR ET data itself. Our study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of high-resolution model calibration and provides important implications in field-scale hydrological modeling and precision agricultural applications.},

Abstract = {Attentions over the health of evergreen vegetation are increasing owing to frequently occurrence of recent disturbance events (i.e. soil erosion, logging activities, and afforestation). However, vegetation indices that characterize canopy greenness have limitations in spectral saturation for representing the growth states of densely vegetated areas, and the continuous acquisition of satellite-derived vegetation functional metrics depends on the availability of clear image observations. This study investigated the vegetation health dynamics (1993-2012) in the red soil regions of southern China using satellite observations based task-oriented metrics, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Water Content (VWC), and Aboveground Biomass Carbon (ABC). The results indicated that the total number of pixels with significant changes (SC) was 214, 1,186, and 794 for the NDVI, VWC, and ABC indices, respectively. More than 90\% of the SC pixels in the three metrics exhibited increasing trends, which were primarily observed in mountainous areas. Pixels that exhibited a continuously declining trend were discretely distributed throughout the entire study area. Among the SC pixels, vegetation in major parts of the study area was disturbed by abrupt events. In the NDVI, VWC, and ABC, the frequency of abrupt changes increased after 2000, coinciding with the launch of the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) in 2000-2001. For regions with abrupt changes, four patterns were further observed based on the indices: the continued increases (pattern-1), sustained decreases (pattern-2), recovery growth after an initial decline (pattern-3), and significant decreases after initial growth (pattern-4). Pattern-1 appeared more frequently than the other three patterns. This study indicates that vegetation in most areas was optimally developed and exhibited a healthier tendency compared with previous growth states. Notably, the presence of an increasingly unhealthy vegetation state was observed in the northeastern region of the study area. Satellite derived datasets and synergetic use of indicators contribute to understanding the changes in the vegetation health in the entire red soil regions in southern China. Thus, this study acts as a reference for forest management and soil erosion control.},

Abstract = {Mapping of human and structural exposure to hazards is a fundamental risk assessment undertaking, which should be based on detailed and up-to-date geo-information. However, the dynamics of land change in large cities cause base maps and censuses to rapidly become outdated, possibly resulting in inaccurate assessment of risk. Using tsunami hazard in Lisbon as the case study, this paper presents an approach to improve the mapping and analysis of exposure and risk by updating the municipal cartography and creating 3D urban models having functional information. The methodology is based on the updating of building features using LiDAR data and Very-High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and their further characterization using ancillary spatial data sets. Results include more up-to-date structural and socioeconomic geographic information that can benefit Emergency Management activities as well as other urban planning tasks.},

Abstract = {Now-a-days large amount of data is generated from various stake holders such as data from sensors and satellites regarding environment and climate, social networking sites about messages, tweets, photos, videos and data from telecommunications etc. This big data, if processed in real-time, helps decision makers to make timely decisions when an event occurred. When source data sets are large (velocity, variety, veracity) traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is time consuming process. This paves path to extend traditional data management techniques for extracting business value from big data. This paper extends the hadoop framework for performing entity resolution in two phases. In phase 1 MapReduce generate rules for matching two real world objects with similarities. The more the similarity, the objects are similar. Similarity is calculated using domain dependent and independent Natural language processing measures. In Phase 2 these rules are used for matching stream data. Our proposed approach uses 13 semantic measures for resolving entities in stream data. Stream data such as tweets, messages, e-catalogues are used for testing the proposed system.},

Abstract = {Population decline in cities ('shrinking cities') is an increasing international phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to determine citizens' policy preferences for tackling shrinkage and to ascertain whether different causes of shrinkage lead to different preferences, on the basis of which we identify viable urban regeneration strategies to implement in Portugal's shrinking cities. This information was obtained by a face-to-face questionnaire survey of 701 residents in four case study cities, who were asked to rank five types of policy: economic revival, safety and accessibility, public services, building interventions, and environmental actions. The results show no differences between cities regarding the policy identified by residents as being most important (economic revival). However, differences between cities in the second and third most important policies were observed and are linked to the particularities of shrinkage in each city. Furthermore, we found a strong link between the ranking of the policies and the demographic and socioeconomic profiles of respondents, which also differ between cities. Younger respondents ranked economic revival higher, whereas older residents ranked safety and accessibility higher. Building rehabilitation was ranked as important mostly by lower-income residents, whereas improvement in public services was identified as being important by the residents of smaller cities in the interior of the country. Giving voice to citizens and allowing them input into policy options appears to be of value for defining the most appropriate policies to apply in shrinking cities.},

Abstract = {The occupation and use of coastal environments are characterized by a general lack of planning, which provokes increasing pressures and the progressive intensification of problems such as deforestation, the pollution of water resources, inadequate disposal of solid waste, and the illegal occupation of public areas. The present study proposes a diagnosis of the environmental quality of the Guaribas estuary on the western coast of Ceara, in northeastern Brazil, based on the application of the DPSIR model (Driving Forces, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses). In the field, geographic coordinates were collected (GPS navigator), providing the data for the production of maps in an SIG environment, based on the interpretation of high spatial resolution satellite images. Based on the observed constraining factors, it was possible to predict eventual impacts, such as a reduction in fishery productivity, loss of habitats and biodiversity, and numerous problems in the sphere of public health. The appropriation of space was clearly related to the installation of the Pecan shipping terminal and industrial complex, as well as hotels financed by foreign investments attracted by the economic development policies of the state, which conflicts with the interests of the traditional local communities and creates a marked imbalance in the use of coastal space. The results of the present study indicate that the DPSIR model represents an excellent analytical tool for the evaluation of the local scenario, given the integrated analysis of socio-environmental problems, in addition to the identification of potential strategies that may be adapted to the perspective of public authorities, the economic sector, and society in general. Overall, there is clearly an urgent need for the regulation of the use of the coastal environments of western Ceara, Brazil.},

Abstract = {Despite the expected importance, the changes in mangrove ecosystems and the main causes in Fiji have not been well addressed. To address the issues, we collected data from multiple sources to assess mangrove ecosystem variation due to both natural factors and human impacts in the Ba and Rewa deltas, Fiji. Landsat satellite data were used to map the land use and cover of the study area from 2000 to 2020. Questionnaire surveys were conducted to identify the main uses of mangroves that could influence mangrove ecosystems. Over the period investigated, the mangrove area increased by 572 ha (by 12\%) in Ba and decreased by 697 ha (by 9\%) in Rewa. The social survey revealed that 45\% of respondents in the Ba delta and 20\% in the Rewa delta visited the mangrove area daily in search of food resources. The net annual economic loss and lost functioning of mangroves as an anthropogenic CO2 reservoir caused by mangrove degradation in the two deltas were estimated to be 335,000 USD and 202 t-C, respectively. Because local livelihoods are strongly linked with mangroves, the outcomes of this study will provide preliminary information for policy interventions to ensure the sustainability of the mangrove ecosystem.},

Title = {Lockdowns Save People from Air Pollution: Evidence from Daily Global Tropospheric NO2 Satellite Data},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Motivated by the global fear of the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, we investigated whether lockdowns save people from air pollution, notably from Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Using daily satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), we first found that the global NO2 tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) decreased by 16.5\% after the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Then, we calculated the global health benefits, as the monetized value of life, using the value of a statistical life (VSL). The total global health benefits were approximately 8.73 trillion USD, accounting for 10\% of the global GDP; such benefits would be the largest in China, followed by the United States, Japan and Germany. Our results suggest that lockdowns may bring benefits to countries that policy interventions cannot easily bring, thus highlighting the importance of social distancing.},

Title = {Socioeconomic and spatial inequalities of street tree abundance, species diversity, and size structure in New York City},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {206},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Street trees are often unequally distributed in urban areas, and their physical and structural attributes, such as extent of canopy cover, species composition, and size distribution, are also spatially heterogeneous. Some studies report that inequalities are more prevalent in streetscapes than in private landscapes. Considering the existing inequality issues and public nature of street trees, street tree inequality studies warrant greater attention. However, most existing studies in this field focus heavily on the unequal distribution of tree canopy cover, while disregarding other tree attributes. In this study, seven street tree measures covering tree abundance, species diversity, and size structure were derived from high-resolution satellite images, Google Street View, and street tree census. We then applied the geographically weighted regression to these seven tree measures in New York City, United States, compared street tree inequalities among different socioeconomic groups, and identified inequality hotspots. Our results show that street tree inequalities are greatest with respect to tree abundance and species diversity. Furthermore, race-based and education-based inequalities are most notable, and age-, income-, and household characteristic-based inequalities were also detected based on tree abundance or species diversity. Socially vulnerable areas that suffer the most severe inequalities are clustered in Brooklyn and Queens. Disaggregated street tree inequalities, with explicit recognition of the differentiated distribution of limited tree resources among different social groups and across geographical areas, are critical for effective decision-making to alleviate environmental inequities.},

Title = {Urban Growth Modeling and Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Analysis in a Metropolitan Area (Case Study: Tabriz)},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {During the last three decades, the expansion of the Tabriz Metropolitan Area (TMA) to the surrounding areas has caused the destruction of environmental resources and problems such as disturbing ecological balance, increasing service costs, construction over unsuitable lands, exacerbation of air pollution, and lack of consideration of existing deteriorated textures and previous ongoing trends, reducing the environmental quality of the TMA. The goal of this study was to perform ecological modeling of urban development in the TMA with respect to the preservation of environmental resources, prevention of urban sprawl, and the management of the physical expansion of the TMA in an eco-friendly manner. In this research, to investigate the previous pattern of growth of the TMA, Landsat satellite imagers from 1984 to 2018 were used to discover the non-ecological and sprawl development of the TMA, and artificial neural networks and logistic regression techniques were applied to simulate future development up to 2038. According to information from the Iranian Statistical Center and 34 year of satellite imagery analysis, the population of the TMA increased from 1,007,992 to 1,961,560 during this period. Additionally, urban and rural land area increased from 7220.34 hectares to 27,640.57 hectares. A lack of coordination between population and urban expansion, as well as a decrease of 8513.61 hectares of agricultural and garden lands was inferred from the Holdern model. Detailed Calculations of the Holdern index (sprawl tendency) showed a lack of consideration of urban development capacity with population growth rate, and the Holdern index is equal to 0.6 in Tabriz. For future ecologic development of the TMA, hexagonal blocking of the urbanization probability map was used alongside environmental development policies in the form of using 30 percent of infill development capacities of inefficient land uses to prevent sprawl growth in Tabriz. Additionally, to preserve ecological landscapes, ecological networks in the form of green belts and bows with a length of 91 km were designed that may be effective in preventing the merging of small cities and nearby villages in the Tabriz metropolis.},

Abstract = {Environmental history, as a field of analysis and transdisciplinary study, aims to explore the interactions between society and ecosystems from a deep understanding of how relationships between human groups and natural systems change over defined periods of time. This article seeks to delve into the environmental history of the savannahs of the Cesar department in Colombia, documenting the milestones in the privatization of the commons and the degradation of social-ecological systems. Methodologically, satellite images and aerial photographs are analyzed to determine the changes in land cover that reveal the state of the ecosystems, and an ethnographic approach is used to document the perception and valuation of local Afro-descendant communities in the region. The article shows how, over the last 60 years, land-use planning models have favored individual appropriation practices and agroindustrial models over collective forms of pastoralism and small-scale agrifood systems. It also documents the main socio-ecological impacts and the conflicts implicit in different tenure models that should be taken into account in the various public policies related to sustainability, peace building, and the recognition of territorial rights in the Colombian Caribbean.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine plausible macroeconomic responses to the ex ante (planned but not implemented yet) reforms in the labor market, taking a currently proposed Social Model in Lithuania as an example. We contribute not only to the current debate on the efficacy of announced structural reforms, but also to the literature on policy evaluation, by assessing reforms from a global perspective. Taking trade linkages and openness into account, we demonstrate macroeconomic reactions to shocks in unemployment benefits, active labor market policies, and tax wedge on the reforming economy. In particular, we show that the omission of an international dimension could lead to seriously biased results on policy effects for any open and small economy. Using a satellite model for the intermediate trade, we link the global framework with the sectoral extensive margin, which changes some of the results derived from the aggregate data.},

Abstract = {The importance of measuring forest biophysical properties for ecosystem health monitoring and forest management encourages researchers to find precise, yet low-cost methods especially in mountainous and large areas. In the present study, geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS) on board Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was used to estimate three biophysical characteristics of forests located in the north of Iran: 1) maximum canopy height (H-max); 2) Lorey's height (H-Lorey); and 3) forest volume (V). A large number of multiple linear regressions (MLR) and also random forest (RF) regressions were developed using different sets of variables including waveform metrics, principal components (PCs) produced from principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet coefficients (WCs) generated from wavelet transformation (WT). To validate and compare models, statistical criteria were calculated based on a fivefold cross validation. Best model concerning the maximum height was an MLR (RMSE = 5.0 m) which combined two metrics extracted from waveforms (waveform extent ``W-ext{''} and height at 50\% of waveform energy ``H-50{''}), and one from digital elevation model (terrain index, TI). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of maximum height estimates was 16.4\%. For Lorey's height, a simple MLR (including W-ext and TI) represented the highest performance (RMSE = 5.1 m, MAPE = 24.0\%). Generally, MLR models had a better performance when compared to the RF models. In addition, the accuracy of height estimations using waveform metrics was greater than those based on PCs or WCs. Concerning forest volume, regression models estimating volume directly from GLAS data led to a better result (RMSE = 128.8 m(3)/ha) rather than volume-HLorey relationship (RMSE = 167.8 m(3)/ha).},

Pages = {120-131},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to find out the prospects and the factors which militate against the smooth operations of the University of Cape Coast satellite libraries. Design/methodology/approach - A well-structured questionnaire was used to solicit data from all the staff of the 31 satellite libraries on the Campus of the University of Cape Coast. To ensure reliable findings, the survey approach was used. The first part of the questionnaire looked at the status of staff of the satellite libraries. The second part dealt with the information resources of the libraries, services provided by the libraries and staff developmental issues, while the last part solicited information on the challenges of these libraries. The quantitative data obtained mainly from the questionnaire were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings - Some of the major findings are as follows: staff of the satellite libraries have the opportunity to upgrade themselves academically; the Main Library organised a series of in-service training for the staff of the satellite libraries; majority of the staff of the satellite libraries were non-professional and inadequate; and the majority of the satellite libraries were ill equipped, lack of simple working materials like accession registers and stamps, and lack of recognition of library staff by administrators, lecturers and students. Research limitations/implications - The major components of a library are the building, staff and information resources; however, the study was limited to the staff and information resources, but excludes the building in which the libraries were housed. Practical implications - Functional satellite libraries are required to support the activities of the main libraries. Social implications - Satellite libraries are to support the main library to achieve its vision and mission; hence, their ineffectiveness affects the parent institution. Originality/value - Satellite libraries support the main libraries in accomplishing their vision and mission, but it can be noted that much has been written on the main libraries, and is it high time the state, management and challenges of satellite libraries were exposed.},

Title = {Adoption of Satellite Offices in Response to a Pandemic: Sustainability and Infection Control},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The office environment has changed rapidly due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Companies consider various types of remote work environments to contain the spread of the virus. Among them, a satellite office is a type of remote work environment where a number of employees are allocated to their nearest office. The benefits from satellite offices are twofold: The significant reduction of travel distance also reduces the amount of carbon emission and fuel consumption. In addition, dividing employees into smaller groups significantly reduces the potential risks of infection in the office. This paper addresses a satellite office allocation problem that considers social and environmental sustainability and infection control at work. In order to evaluate the effect of different satellite office allocation, quantitative measures are developed for the following three criteria: carbon emission, fuel consumption, and the probability of infection occurrence at work. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate different scenarios of regional infection rate and modes of transportation. The results show that adopting satellite offices not only reduces carbon emission and fuel consumption, but also mitigates business disruption in the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Detailed urban land use classification plays a highly important role in the development and management of cities and in the identification of human activities. The complexity of the urban system makes its functional zoning a challenge, which makes such maps underutilized. A detailed land use classification encompasses both the natural land features and the classification of structures closely related to human activities. The use of satellite imagery to classify land use can effectively benefit the recognition of natural objects, but its performance demands significant improvement in the recognition of social functions due to the lack of information regarding human activities. To identify such activities in an urban area, we added Point of Interests (POI) data. This dataset contains both geographical tags and attributes that describe human activities. However, it has an uneven spatial distribution, with gaps in coverage being readily apparent. This paper proposes a land use classification framework using satellite imagery and data from social media. The proposed method employs a kernel density estimation to handle the spatial unevenness of POI data. The solution of mixed programming of MPI and OpenMP was adopted to parallel the algorithm. The results are compared to data compiled manually by means of human interpretation. Considering the example of Wuhan city, results show that the overall accuracy of land use type classification is 86.2\%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.860. It is demonstrated that using both POI and satellite images, a detailed land use map can be created automatically with satisfactory robustness.},

Title = {The invention of the shopping mall Victor Gruen and production of the high-liquidity, capitalist space},

Abstract = {Purpose The economic system of competitive capitalism strives toward liquid markets wherein the cost for transacting is minimized. Liquidity is mostly addressed in association with abstract markets (e.g. the securities market), but also consumer markets are determined by liquidity concerns. The purpose of this paper is to examine the shopping mall concept, developed by the architect and social reformer Victor Gruen during the early 1950s, as a form of production of capitalist space, intended to reduce transaction costs. As an auxiliary benefit, Gruen envisioned the shopping mall as a cultural and civic center in the midst of the satellite town of suburbia, the new site of urban expansion during the post-war boom decades. Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews secondary literature on the historical development of the shopping mall as a consumer space. In addition, relevant economic and social science literature is referenced. Findings The architecture, design, ornamentation and day-to-day management of the shopping mall were premised on a consumerist way of life, ultimately serving as an all-too-visual index of the triumph of competitive capitalism in the cold war era. However, Gruen's accomplishments were gradually compromised by the interest of money-minded developers and construction industry actors, and the shopping mall arguably never fulfilled the social and cultural function that Gruen anticipated. Regardless of such outcomes, the production of capitalist space as scripted by Gruen is still determining everyday life in consumer society, making Gruen a key figure, albeit only limitedly recognized, in the history of late modern society and in the capitalist economy. Originality/value The paper emphasizes the role of Victor Gruen in the post-Second World War period, being one of the most influential practitioners and social reformers in the era. Furthermore, the paper stresses how market liquidity is a key concern in Gruen's project to create a communal space for the American suburban population in the era of the expanding welfare state.},

Month = {2023 MAR 27},
Abstract = {There is worldwide concern about how climate change -which involves rising temperatures- may increase the risk of contracting and developing diseases, reducing the quality of life. This study provides new research that takes into account parameters such as land surface temperature (LST), surface urban heat island (SUHI), urban hotspot (UHS), air pollution (SO2, NO2, CO, O-3 and aerosols), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference building index (NDBI) and the proportion of vegetation (PV) that allows evaluating environmental quality and establishes mitigation measures in future urban developments that could improve the quality of life of a given population. With the help of Sentinel 3 and 5P satellite images, we studied these variables in the context of Granada (Spain) during the year 2021 to assess how they may affect the risk of developing diseases (stomach, colorectal, lung, prostate and bladder cancer, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease and suicide). The results, corroborated by the statistical analysis using the Data Panel technique, indicate that the variables LST, SUHI and daytime UHS, NO2, SO2 and NDBI have important positive correlations above 99\% (p value: 0.000) with an excess risk of developing these diseases. Hence, the importance of this study for the formulation of healthy policies in cities and future research that minimizes the excess risk of diseases.},

Title = {The relationship of land tenure, land use and land cover changes in Lake Victoria basin},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {126},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Water basins characterise both physical and social environmental aspects such as land tenure. As such, the basins extend beyond spatial units of physical resources and human relations analysis to policy research and reform units. The comprehensive view of water basins in research goes along with an observed increase in anthropogenic-driven changes, such as land use and land cover changes, and cases of ineffective remedial measures to the adverse change, such as through applying integrated watershed management approaches. The human-induced land cover changes affect the water basin's biodiversity, for instance, contributing to an increase in zoonotic disease outbreaks like coronaviruses. The Lake Victoria basin exhibits similar patterns of change and effects due to, among other factors, land tenure, whose contribution is less known empirically. Therefore, this paper integrates satellite imagery and catchment survey data to examine the relationship between land tenure and land uses and land cover changes in the Lake Victoria basin of Eastern Africa. Additionally, explore the contextual character and role of three land tenure systems of Customary, Native freehold and Mailo found in the Uganda country segment of the basin in explaining the outcomes. The aim is to provide information that, among other benefits, improves water basin management and governance. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship exists between the perceived extent of land use and land cover change; drivers of change; the extent of adopting sustainable land-use practices, and the prevailing land tenure. Though with different tenure systems, the three case study water catchments experienced adverse land use and cover changes. The changes mainly affected land tenure indicative land use and cover classes, prominently on the Customary, Mailo, and Native freehold land tenure systems. However, marginal differences occur among the land tenure systems, as the systems feature both de jure and de facto systems and an orientation towards customary tenure characters. The situation likely explains the observed closeness in perceptions regarding the role and relationship between land tenure and land use and cover changes, tenure systems character, perceived drivers of change and eventual outcomes, including the sustainable land use practices adoption. In addition to explaining the land use and cover change, land tenure is an essential tool for restoration and sustainable basin development and sustainability. We, thus, recommend land tenure responsiveness in water basin management approaches for sustainable societal development.},

Title = {Challenges for Sustained Observing and Forecasting Systems in the Mediterranean Sea},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean community represented in this paper is the result of more than 30 years of EU and nationally funded coordination, which has led to key contributions in science concepts and operational initiatives. Together with the establishment of operational services, the community has coordinated with universities, research centers, research infrastructures and private companies to implement advanced multi-platform and integrated observing and forecasting systems that facilitate the advancement of operational services, scientific achievements and mission-oriented innovation. Thus, the community can respond to societal challenges and stakeholders needs, developing a variety of fit-for-purpose services such as the Copernicus Marine Service. The combination of state-of-the-art observations and forecasting provides new opportunities for downstream services in response to the needs of the heavily populated Mediterranean coastal areas and to climate change. The challenge over the next decade is to sustain ocean observations within the research community, to monitor the variability at small scales, e.g., the mesoscale/submesoscale, to resolve the sub-basin/seasonal and inter-annual variability in the circulation, and thus establish the decadal variability, understand and correct the model-associated biases and to enhance model-data integration and ensemble forecasting for uncertainty estimation. Better knowledge and understanding of the level of Mediterranean variability will enable a subsequent evaluation of the impacts and mitigation of the effect of human activities and climate change on the biodiversity and the ecosystem, which will support environmental assessments and decisions. Further challenges include extending the science-based added-value products into societal relevant downstream services and engaging with communities to build initiatives that will contribute to the 2030 Agenda and more specifically to SDG14 and the UN's Decade of Ocean Science for sustainable development, by this contributing to bridge the science-policy gap. The Mediterranean observing and forecasting capacity was built on the basis of community best practices in monitoring and modeling, and can serve as a basis for the development of an integrated global ocean observing system.},

Title = {Impacts of the COVID-19 confinement on air quality, the Land Surface Temperature and the urban heat island in eight cities of Andalusia (Spain)},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing global lockdown situation have generated a very negative impact on the world economy, but they have also lent us a unique opportunity to research and better grasp the impacts of human activity on environmental pollution and urban climates. Such studies will be of vital importance for decision-making on measures needed to mitigate the effects of climate change in urban areas, in order to turn them into resilient environments. This study looks at eight cities in the region of Andalusia (southern Spain) to comprehensively assess their environmental quality with parameters (Pm-10, So(2), No-2, Co and O-3) obtained from meteorological stations. The aim was to determine how these parameters affect the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), on the basis of Sentinel 3 satellite thermal images. Knowing to what extent improved air quality can reduce the LST and SUHI of cities will be essential in the context of future environmental studies on which to base sustainable decisions. The geographic situation of cities in the Mediterranean Sea basin, highly vulnerable to climate change, and the high pollution rates and high daily temperature variations of these urban areas make them particularly attractive for analyses of this sort. During the confinement period, average reductions of some environmental pollutants were achieved: So(2) (-33.5\%), Pm-10 (-38.3\%), No-2 (-44.0\%) and Co (-26.5\%). However, the environmental variable O-3 underwent an average growth of 5.9\%. The LST showed an average reduction of -4.6 degrees C (-19.3\%), while the SUHI decreased by 1.02 degrees C (-59.8\%). These values exhibit high spatio-temporal variations be-tween day and night, and between inland and coastal cities.},

Title = {Toward Cloud-Native, Machine Learning Base Detection of Crop Disease With Imaging Spectroscopy},

Abstract = {Developing actionable early detection and warning systems for agricultural stakeholders is crucial to reduce the annual \$200B USD losses and environmental impacts associated with crop diseases. Agricultural stakeholders primarily rely on labor-intensive, expensive scouting and molecular testing to detect disease. Spectroscopic imagery (SI) can improve plant disease management by offering decision-makers accurate risk maps derived from Machine Learning (ML) models. However, training and deploying ML requires significant computation and storage capabilities. This challenge will become even greater as global-scale data from the forthcoming Surface Biology \& Geology satellite becomes available. This work presents a cloud-hosted architecture to streamline plant disease detection with SI from NASA's AVIRIS-NG platform, using grapevine leafroll-associated virus complex 3 (GLRaV-3) as a model system. Here, we showcase a pipeline for processing SI to produce plant disease detection models and demonstrate that the underlying principles of a cloud-based disease detection system easily accommodate model improvements and shifting data modalities. Our goal is to make the insights derived from SI available to agricultural stakeholders via a platform designed with their needs and values in mind. The key outcome of this work is an innovative, responsive system foundation that can empower agricultural stakeholders to make data-driven plant disease management decisions while serving as a framework for others pursuing use-inspired application development for agriculture to follow that ensures social impact and reproducibility while preserving stakeholder privacy.},

It appears that online learning places the same demands on learners' ability to remain on-task and focused While following up on assessing the benefits of live satellite broadcasts from remote areas of the world, the researchers made several interesting discoveries about the nature of the design of the content management system that delivered the classroom experience. The interface included a means by which students could synchronously chat during the live broadcasts. The ability to multitask appeared to increase participants' engagement in the class and their sense of social presence. The reseamhers present their results based on the results of a pre and post participant questionnaire to determine how best to sustain student engagement and interaction in a distance-learning environment.},

Title = {Sensors for UAVs dedicated to agriculture: current scenarios and challenges},
Journal = {AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JUN 19},
Abstract = {Purpose The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) entered into their development stage when different applications became real. One of those application areas is agriculture. Agriculture and transport currently follow infrastructure as the top industries in the world UAV market. The agricultural UAV can be acquired as a ready-made, built by its future user or UAV-as-a-service (UaaS) way. This paper aims to help the UAVs' users to choose the right sensors for agricultural purposes. For that sake, the overview of the types and application areas of onboard sensors is presented and discussed. Some conclusions and suggestions should allow readers to choose the proper onboard sensors set and the right way of acquiring UAVs for their purposes related to the agricultural area. Design/methodology/approach The agricultural UAVs' onboard specialised sensors have been analysed, described and evaluated from the farmer's operational point of view. That analysis took into consideration the agricultural UAVs' types of missions, sensor characteristics, basics of the data processing software and the whole set of UAV-sensor-software operational features. As the conclusions, the trends in the onboard agricultural UAVs' sensors, their applications and operational characteristics have been presented. Findings Services performed by the UAVs for the agriculture businesses are the second in the UAV services world market, and their growth potential is around 17\% compound annual growth rate in the next years. As one of the quickest developing businesses, it will attract substantial investments in all related areas. They will be done in the research, development and market deployment stages of that technology development. The authors can expect the new business models of the equipment manufacturers, service providers and sellers of the equipment, consumables and materials. The world agricultural UAVs' services market will be divided between the following two main streams: the UAVs' solutions dedicated to the individual farmers, systems devoted to the companies giving the specialised services to individual farmers, in the form of UaaS. It will be followed by the two directions of the agriculture UAV set optimisation, according to each of the above streams' specific requirements and expectations. Solutions for the individual users will be more straightforward, universal and more comfortable to operate but less effective and less accurate than systems dedicated to the agricultural service provider. UAVs are becoming important universal machines in the agriculture business. They are the newcomers in that business but can change the processes performed traditionally. Such an example is spraying the crops. UAVs spray the rice fields in Japan on at least half of them every year. The other is defoliating the cotton leaves, which only in one China province takes place on a few million hectares every year (Kurkute et al., 2018). That trend will extend the range of applications of UAVs. The agricultural UAV will take over process after process from the traditional machines. The types and number of missions and activities performed by agricultural UAVs are growing. They are strictly connected with the development of hardware and software responsible for those missions' performance. New onboard sensors are more reliable, have better parameters and their prices are reasonable. Onboard computers and data processing and transmitting methods allow for effective solutions of automatisation and autonomy of the agricultural UAVs' operation. Automatisation and autonomous performance of the UAVs' agricultural missions are the main directions of the future development of that technology. Changing the UAV payload allows for its application to a different mission. Changing the payload, like effectors, is quite simple and does not require any special training or tooling. It can be done in the field during the regular operation of the agricultural UAV. Changing the sensor set can be more complicated, because of the eventually required calibrating of those sensors. The same set of sensors gives a possibility to perform a relatively broad range of missions and tasks. The universal setup consists of the multispectral and RGB camera. The agricultural UAV equipped with such a set of sensors can effectively perform most of the crop monitoring missions. The agriculture business will accept the optimised sensor-computer-software UAV payload set, where its exploitation cost and operational simplicity are the critical optimisation factors. Simplicity, reliability and effectiveness of the everyday operation are the vital factors of accepting the agricultural UAV technology as a widespread working horse. Research limitations/implications Performed research studies have been done taking into consideration the factors influencing the real operational decisions made by the farmers or companies offering UAV services to them. In that case, e.g. the economical factors have been considered, which could prevail the technical complexity or measuring accuracy of the sensors. Then, drawn conclusions can be not accurate from the scientific research studies point of view, where the financing limits are not so strict. Practical implications The main goal of the paper is to present the reasons and factors influencing the ``optimised{''} solution of the configuration of agricultural UAV onboard sensors set. It was done at the level useful for the readers understanding the end-users expectations and having a basic understanding of the sensors-related technologies. The paper should help them to configure an acceptable agricultural UAV for the specific missions or their servicing business. Social implications Understanding the technology implications related to the applying of agricultural UAVs into everyday service is one of the main limits of that technology market deployment. The conclusions should allow for avoiding the misunderstanding of the agricultural UAVs' capabilities and then increasing their social acceptance. That acceptance by the farmers is the key factor for the effective introduction of that technology into the operation. Originality/value Presented conclusions have been drawn on the base of the extensive research of the existing literature and web pages, and also on the own experience in forestry and agriculture and other technical applications of the onboard sensors. The experience in practical aspects of the sensors choosing and application into several areas have been also used, e.g. manned and unmanned aeroplanes and helicopters applied in similar and other types of missions.},

Abstract = {Many studies have considered community-based forestry enterprises to be the best option for development of rural Mexican communities with forests. While some of Mexico's rural communities with forests receive significant economic and social benefits from having a community forestry enterprise, the majority have not formed such enterprises. The purpose of this article is to identify and describe factors limiting the formation of community forestry enterprise in rural communities with temperate forests in the Southern Mixteca region of Oaxaca, Mexico. The study involved fieldwork, surveys applied to Community Board members, and maps developed from satellite images in order to calculate the forested surface area. It was found that the majority of Southern Mixteca communities lack the natural and social conditions necessary for developing community forestry enterprise; in this region, commercial forestry is limited due to insufficient precipitation, scarcity of land or timber species, community members' wariness of commercial timber extraction projects, ineffective local governance, lack of capital, and certain cultural beliefs. Only three of the 25 communities surveyed have a community forestry enterprise; however, several communities have developed other ways of profiting from their forests, including pine resin extraction, payment for environmental services (PES), sale of spring water, and ecotourism. We conclude that community forestry enterprise are not the only option for rural communities to generate income from their forests; in recent years a variety of forest-related economic opportunities have arisen which are less demanding of communities' physical and social resources.},

Abstract = {One of the responses to the fight against climate change by the developing world has been the large-scale adoption of solar energy. The adoption of solar energy in countries like India is propagating mainly through the development of energy producing photovoltaic farms. The realization of solar energy producing sites involves complex decisions and processes in the selection of sites whose knowhow may not rest with all the stakeholders supporting (e.g., banks financing the project) the industry value chain. In this article, we use the region of Bangalore in India as the case study to present how open innovation using satellite imagery can provide the necessary granularity to specifically aid in an independent initial assessment of the solar photovoltaic sites. We utilize the established analytical hierarchy process over the information extracted from open satellite data to calculate an overall site suitability index. The index takes into account the topographical, climatic, and environmental factors. Our results explain how the intervention of satellite imagery-based big data analytics can help in buying the confidence of investors in the solar industry value chain. Our study also demonstrates that open innovation using satellites can act as a platform for social product development.},

Abstract = {The Southern Atlantic rainforest is continuously suffering from wood extraction activity, which results in the increase of clearings within the forest. Although the direct impacts of deforestation on landscape are already well described, there is an absence of studies focused on the evaluation of its indirect effects, such as the increase of solar UV radiation levels inside forest environment and its consequences for forest specialist anuran species. The results presented in this work clearly show that the threatened tree frog species Hypsiboas curupi presents severe traits of sensitivity to UV wavelengths of sunlight, making it a vulnerable species to this environmental stressor, as well as a biological indicator of the quality of forest canopy coverage. In addition, the measurement of solar UVB and UVA radiation incidence upon H. curupi breeding site and the analyses of a 20-year dataset of satellite images regarding the management of canopy coverage indicate that the photoprotection provided by trees of the Southern Atlantic rainforest is critical for the conservation of this forest specialist anuran species. Therefore, this work demonstrates that the deforestation process enhances the exposure of H. curupi embryos to solar UVB and UVA radiation, negatively affecting their embryonic development, inducing mortality and population decline.

Abstract = {Purpose - In light of the discussions on outer space property management, this conceptual review paper aims to discuss and evaluate if, when and under which conditions certain land management and property right frameworks can apply to allocate and/or restrict property rights in outer space. Design/methodology/approach - This paper applies a pragmatic review approach which seeks to better understand if and how the basic tenets of the land management frameworks could better shape and revise the challenges in outer space regulations. Findings - Despite the fact that regulatory guidelines on outer space rights are existing, the analysis shows that these lack a number of practical tools and measures aiming at intervening if stakeholders do not follow the rules. With the use of land management frameworks, it is possible to derive policy options for making the outer space management more practical and action-oriented, in particular for the removal of space debris. These include amongst others more attention for formulating global public restrictions in outer space, incorporating regulatory guidelines for accessing open space regimes, addressing responsiveness and robustness in adherence and compliance to regulations Research limitations/implications - Given the conceptual and discursive character of the paper, there are no specific empirical data, yet several recommendations for further research include expanding the boundary work between the land management and regulatory outer space domain. Practical implications - The insights derived from land management and real estate related property theories could potentially provide new starting points for (re)formulating the regulatory framework for outer space property discourses. Social implications - Interpreting the outer space regulations from known and practiced land management perspective helps to bridge the policy-society knowledge and necessity gap on outer space activities. Originality/value - The specific land management perspective and discursive analysis on outer space debris provide new options for devising and extending regulatory guidelines for assigning responsibilities on outer space debris and debris rights, restrictions and responsibilities.},

Title = {Why do MNEs both make and coopete for innovation?},
Journal = {TECHNOVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {106},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {While multinational enterprises (MNEs) possess the resources and knowledge to develop innovation projects internally with their own international subsidiaries, they sometimes prefer to develop innovation projects with their competitors. We investigate the circumstances under which MNEs prefer to ``make{''} or ``coopete{''} for certain specific innovation projects, which has not previously been addressed in the literature. Based on a case study of Airbus Defence and Space, we study two telecommunication satellite innovation projects (one developed internally and the other with a competitor). We show that both make and coopete strategies lead to short- and long-term benefits as well as risks. More precisely, we underscore that coopete decisions provide more short-term benefits than make decisions. By contrast, in the longer term, make decisions are more beneficial than coopete decisions. Therefore, we emphasize that for a given project, managers weight the options for and against each choice based on specific time frames, keeping in mind the necessity of both making and coopeting at the corporate level.},

Title = {Happiness, life satisfaction, and the greenness of urban surroundings},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {237},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cities' environmental factors are pivotal for the quality of life of the population, and green space is increasingly recognized as a significant environmental factor in this regard. In this analysis, we study the contribution of green space to happiness in a mid-sized city in the Global South. We use a population survey and open satellite imagery to assess the relationship between self-reported happiness and the surrounding greenness of the respondent's place of residence while controlling for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. We measure surrounding greenness using the average NDVI value within different distances from the home address, calculated with open satellite imagery. The results show that age and surrounding greenness are significantly correlated with happiness, while the relationships with gender and socioeconomic status appear to be not significant. Our results indicate that increases of 10\% in surrounding greenness at different distances from 100 up to 500 m increase the likelihood of self-reported happiness between 13\% and 18\%. When quality aspects of green areas are considered, they are also significantly correlated with happiness. This paper contributes to the knowledge of surrounding greenness and subjective well-being in one of the most urbanized regions in the world and promotes the discussion of well-being policies in urban planning. The results indicate that increasing surrounding greenness and its quality in dense urban environments could help to improve the quality of life and well-being of the urban populations in Global South cities like Cali.},

Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed and reviewed the 374 articles on weather index insurance (WII) based on a systematic literature search on Web of Science and Scopus databases by using the systematic literature review method. Findings WII studies shifted their focus on growing and emerging areas of climate change impact risk. The finding shows that the impact of climate change risk significantly influenced the viability of WII in terms of pricing and design of WII. Therefore, the cost of WII premium increases due to the uncertainty of climate change impact that enhances the probability of losses related to insured weather risks. However, WII has emerged as a risk management tool of climate insurance for vulnerable agrarian communities. The efficacy of WII has been significantly influenced by repetitive environmental disasters and climate change phenomena. Research limitations/implications This study will be valuable for scholars to recognize the missing and emerging themes in WII. Practical implications This study will help the policy planners to understand the influence of climate change impact on WII viability. Originality/value This study is the original work of the author. An attempt has been made in the present study to systematically examine the viability of WII for insuring the climate change risk.},

Title = {Modelling and evaluation of land use changes through satellite images in a multifunctional catchment: Social, economic and environmental implications},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016-2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. ``S-Upstream{''}, ``S-Downstream{''} and ``S-Total{''}. Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11\%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3\% for S-Up; 8.6\% for S-Down and 13\% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (euro15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at euro29,580,643 and euro65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.},

Title = {A Statistical Approach to Mapping Flood Susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region},

Abstract = {Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between different region types; for each region flood risk factors were extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood susceptibility increased by over 200\% between the rural and urban regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk (80-100\%) and high risk (60-80\%) were located outside of the SFHA and included several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood susceptibility. Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding. Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1, respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope, land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor. An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk factor's influence on flooding in a subregion. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20\%), low risk (20-40\%), medium risk (40-60\%), high risk (60-80\%), and very high risk (80-100\%). It was observed that several areas classified as very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require additional flood risk mitigation.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the status of current mobile TV phone usage and discuss the issues for strategic implications for the communications and mobile TV industry. Design/methodology/approach - Real tracking data, collected from server's logs during 2006 and 2007 from South Korean satellite DMB providers, were analyzed according to users' age group, peak viewing time of programs, location usage and program duration. Further analysis with the previous literature led to inferences about strategic implications. Findings - The analysis revealed the current mobile TV usage patterns: widespread user age group, peak viewing time, high indoor usage and longer viewing time. These results shaped strategic implications, furthering and enhancing a personalized media experience. Research limitations/implications - The data set, collected from the subscription-based satellite DMB usage in South Korea, is well recognized as being a technological frontier. Further cultural comparison research work on mobile TV usage is required to validate the strategic implications for a wider cross cultural adoption. Practical implications - This research benefits the strategic planning of the mobile communications and entertainment content industries in decision-making regarding the improvement of hands-on experience for mobile TV users. Originality/value - The findings, based on the mobile TV real tracking data, collected in South Korea for over two years contrast to that of other countries, which only begin to experience the roll-out of a full commercial service. Consequently, the data presented here highlights an important role in understanding and shaping of the mobile TV phone market for other parts of the world.},

Abstract = {Public works programs have long been a popular policy tool to reduce poverty and build productive infrastructure. Although an extensive literature has documented the effect of these programs on poverty, there is virtually no evidence on the productive effect of the infrastructure. This paper attempts to start filling this gap in the context of the Productive Safety Net Program-a large-scale public works program implemented in Ethiopia since 2005. Under the program, millions of beneficiaries received social transfers conditional on their participation in activities such as land improvements and soil and water conservation measures. We examine the value of these activities using a satellite-based indicator of agricultural productivity and (reweighted) difference-in-differences estimates. Results show that the program is associated with limited changes in agricultural productivity. The upper bound of the main estimate is equivalent to a 2.2\% increase in agricultural yield. This contrasts with existing narratives and calls for more research on the productive effects of public works.},

Title = {What's driving solar energy adoption in Brazil? Exploring settlement patterns of place and space},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The energy transition is forcing power systems to face exceptional transformations, with the rise of the distributed generation systems, and the urge of prosumers. This paper aims to investigate the influence of settlement patterns on residential photovoltaic adoption in Brazil, under a cross-section structure, using the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator. Other key drivers are also included as control variables in the analysis. I benefit from a rich dataset of economic, social, housing, and environmental variables for 310,120 census sectors. Variables such as rural/urban dummies or population/housing density, used in previous papers to test for association between settlement patterns and residential PV adoption poorly represent the real relationship between these dimensions. The results of this paper ratify a U-shape relationship between urbanization degree and household solar power uptake. Satellite areas in the surroundings of great urban centers are more likely to present households equipped with photovoltaic systems in Brazil. Besides, the number of housing units, average income, solar resource potential, gender, education, ethnicity, age, housing type, and housing size play an important role in the explanation of the dynamics of household photovoltaic adoption. Policy design must take into consideration these effects in order to democratize photovoltaic home uptake.},

Abstract = {The sensitivity analysis of pesticide models to input parameters related to crop management practices supplies working hypotheses to improve pesticide uses and environmental quality. Parameters of pesticide models that are influential to model output vary depending on regional environmental conditions, and their probability distribution functions must be identified on a case-oriented basis. While the performance of pesticide models has been extensively tested in temperate regions, comparative studies in subtropical areas are relatively scarce. In this study, we coupled results of landscape analyses supported with a geographical information system (GIS), field data and information about management scenarios of citrus crops in Misiones (Argentina) to inspect the behavior of a field-scale pesticide model (GLE-AMSv3.0). Probability distribution functions of model parameters relevant to hydrology, geo-forms and crop distribution were derived from satellite imagery (SAC-C, SRTM), while crop characteristics, information on soils and pesticides were obtained from field data. Spatial descriptors were used to generate sensitivity scenarios to explore the potential effect of management practices on the fate of the pesticides chlorpyrifos, mancozeb, mercaptothion, copper hydroxide, carbendazem, glyphosate and 2-4-D used in citrus crops. Our results indicate that management practices to change the roughness-contouring of the soil, maintaining a high vegetation cover below the citrus crops, and devising pesticide spraying techniques that would efficiently increase the contact with the crop leaves would be expected to significantly reduce pesticide losses. Plant spacing, improving soil textural conditions through soil-correction practices and selecting adequate soil conditions for installing new crops are also potentially effective techniques to the same goal. Glyphosate losses are almost insensitive to management manipulation, which is a favorable trait in cases where management alternatives are constrained by practical or economic considerations. We present comparisons of the sensitivity of the pesticide model in these scenarios in relation to previously reported results with the same model in other cases, and formulate proposals on a normalized format to report sensitivity results to facilitate comparisons among models and cases.

Title = {Strength in numbers: Large and permanent colonies have higher queen oviposition rates in the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile, Mayr)},

Abstract = {Polydomy associated with unicoloniality is a common trait of invasive species. In the invasive Argentine ant, colonies are seasonally polydomous. Most follow a seasonal fission-fussion pattern: they disperse in the spring and summer and aggregate in the fall and winter. However, a small proportion of colonies do not migrate; instead, they inhabit permanent nesting sites. These colonies are large and highly polydomous. The aim of this study was to (1) search for differences in the fecundity of queens between mother colonies (large and permanent) and satellite colonies (small and temporal), (2) determine if queens in mother and satellite colonies have different diets to clarify if colony size influences social organization and queen feeding, and (3) examine if colony location relative to the invasion front results in differences in the queen's diet. Our results indicate that queens from mother nests are more fertile than queens from satellite nests and that colony location does not affect queen oviposition rate. Ovarian dissections suggest that differences in ovarian morphology are not responsible for the higher queen oviposition rate in mother vs. satellite nests, since there were no differences in the number and length of ovarioles in queens from the two types of colonies. In contrast, the higher delta N-15 values of queens from mother nests imply that greater carnivorous source intake accounts for the higher oviposition rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Marine scientists often assess habitats to understand the distribution and relative abundance of marine resources. Due to the spatial nature of habitats and associated temporal changes, however, assimilating data using traditional analytical methods is often difficult. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are proving to be effective tools to help address problems inherent in the analysis of spatial data. GIS can be used to effectively collate, archive, display, analyze, and model spatial and temporal data. Additionally, by combining dissimilar data types, such as socio-political boundaries, bottom types, and fish distributions, for example, resource managers can use GIS to make informed management decisions. In this way, GIS provides resource managers with a means to integrate scientific data with prevailing cultural values and traditions. We have developed a working GIS for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary that allows interpretation of many terrestrial and marine data sets, including inter-tidal monitoring data, permit locations, seabird strandings, fisheries catch data, habitat types, marine political boundaries, as well as land cover classification from satellite imagery, watersheds, streams, roads, and political boundaries. We have linked terrestrial and marine data to create a broad spatial and temporal database that will be used in a variety of ways such as evaluating natural processes, permitting and monitoring coastal development and assessing environmental impacts (e.g. oil spills).

Abstract = {Tracking the movements of aquatic animals is a primary means of understanding movement ecology and interactions with human activities such as fisheries. Despite the diverse spatiotemporal scales that various underwater tracking tools (e.g., acoustic, satellite, PIT, radio, archival telemetry) enable, there are still limitations associated with their application and ability to address diverse research questions. In many cases, supplementary methods are used to complement tracking approaches either to overcome such limitations or to optimize the data that can be collected in a study. In this review, we synthesize relevant literature between 2010 and 2019 to evaluate the different types of complementary methods used with one of the main approaches for tracking fishes-acoustic telemetry. We categorize broad and specific methods used, as well as the outcome or objectives targeted for each method. In addition to summarizing the use of complementary methods and their outcomes, we discuss how they supplement acoustic telemetry and other tracking approaches. Our review shows that using additional methods to support telemetry data helps expand the breadth of research questions that can be addressed regarding the complex and assorted factors influencing movement patterns. Doing so enables greater value in movement ecology research and adjacent fields such as population dynamics, physiology, trophic ecology, reproduction, and health and survival, to underpin management decisions. This review serves as a primer and guide for bolstering data collection and multidisciplinary research within the growing field of movement ecology.},

Abstract = {Rapid growth in demand for lignocellulosic bioenergy will require major changes in supply chain infrastructure. Even with densification and preprocessing, transport volumes by mid-century are likely to exceed the combined capacity of current agricultural and energy supply chains, including grain, petroleum, and coal. Efficient supply chains can be achieved through decentralized conversion processes that facilitate local sourcing, satellite preprocessing and densification for long-distance transport, and business models that reward biomass growers both nearby and afar. Integrated systems that are cost-effective and energy-efficient will require new ways of thinking about agriculture, energy infrastructure, and rural economic development. Implementing these integrated systems will require innovation and investment in novel technologies, efficient value chains, and socioeconomic and policy frameworks; all are needed to support an expanded biofuels infrastructure that can meet the challenges of scale.},

Abstract = {In mobile computing, the location awareness of a mobile device and its user enables numerous personalized and social services such as recommendation of products and sharing current locations on social networks. Extending positioning services to indoor environments augments the value of the mobile communication market vastly. Due to serious signal attenuation, navigation satellites are incapable, and a common approach is to use or deploy small-scale radio frequency transmitters. When deploying these radio beacons, it is crucial to use a small number of them to provide high-quality positioning services. Such a deployment task is a challenging optimization problem, and the system administrators would benefit from having a spectrum of solutions with varying balance between cost and quality. In this study, we propose an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to tackle the problem. Using a cost-quality adjustment parameter, our EA framework is able to provide a set of solution options to meet varying requirements balancing cost and quality. This property is a result of the parallel population-based search of EAs, and can be very useful in real-world engineering applications.},

Abstract = {The coexistence of IMT-2020 and satellite networks plays an important role in bridging the digital divide and for the economic and social development of rural areas and allows for extended coverage of mobile communications. In this context, for such a network defined as hybrid, adaptations and changes in transmission systems and media are essential to benefit from the advantages of coexistence. Many researches have been carried out, and through the literature, the technique of cognitive radio can be considered the most attractive. The objective of this paper is to study the problem of coexistence between the FSS system operating in the C-band and the IMT-2020 system in order to avoid harmful interference and to improve the spectrum efficiency (scarce resource). This work also presents two solutions to improve the network performance; the control of the transmit power of 5G antennas and the implementation of a reference filter at the ground stations. Probabilistic techniques such as Monte Carlo algorithm, root-raised-cosine filter (SRRC) model will be used to evaluate the impact of the 5G network cells on the satellite receivers. The results obtained show that in order to respect the interference threshold of the receivers, the minimum separation distance will have to be respected, and filters with a rejection value of more than 60dB will have to be equipped. The calculations and the simulation were made with the Matlab tool.},

Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Soil erosion induces land degradation and minimizes the water-holding capacity, resulting in poor environmental quality at a basin scale. This becomes more serious due to long-term anthropogenic pressure including over exploitation of natural resources and lack of sustainable development. In this study, an automated RUSLE-SY model was developed to identify the potential soil erosion and sediment yield zones in Tamiraparani sub-basin, South India. The input parameters required to execute the RUSLE-SY model are digital elevation model, study area boundary, land-use/land-cover data, soil data, annual rainfall data, near-infrared and red bands from satellite imagery. The entire set of data was geoprocessed with standard RUSLE and sediment yield equations for generating soil erosion and sediment yield map. The distribution of soil erosion and sediment yield in the study area was analyzed, and its impacts were discussed. The result reveals that the high soil erosion is noticed in the western part of the sub-basin ( 31.25 ton ha(-1) year(-1)). Moreover, the sediment yield in this area contributes around 14.54 ton ha(-1) year(-1). The low level of soil erosion and sediment yield (similar to 95 \% of the area) reflects the climatic variability and topography of Tamiraparani sub-basin. The resulting RUSLE-SY model provides a robust and easy to use soil erosion and conservation management tool for efficient planning in similar environments.},

Title = {Reliable design of urban surface-underground integrated logistics system network with stochastic demand and social-environmental concern},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {181},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Transforming urban goods movement from roads to underground is an emerging concept to improve supply chain performance and alleviate overcrowded environments. Existing literature merely discussed the underground logistics system (ULS) network design problem within a simplified boundary, whereas several critical system features (e.g., stochastic freight demand and co-modality) were omitted. To bridge the knowledge gaps, this paper proposes a reliable modeling approach to solve an urban surface-underground integrated logistics network (USUIL) design problem with a holistic consideration of cost-benefit objectives, road-ULS modal split, and demand uncertainties. To begin with, we introduce a city-wide hub-and-spoke USUIL network structure with a two-tier parallel distribution process. Five major external benefits of underground goods movement are formulated using real-world data. Next, a deterministic model is developed to optimize the network decisions including hub-satellite location-allocation, deployment of tunnels and pipelines, logistics service assignment, and flow routing. Then, to deal with the influences of case-wise demand uncertainties, the model is reformulated into a reliable one by incorporating the ideas of solution robustness and stochastic equivalents. A two-stage heuristicbased optimization tool that hybridizes the adaptive immune genetic algorithm, plant growth simulation algorithm, and Clarke-Wright saving algorithm was proposed to solve the problem. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on the Beijing city case to validate the proposed method, and the best network schemes obtained from different models and scenarios are compared. Results show that a greater robust control factor in our model helps the network to lower the integrated freight transport cost while improving the social-environmental benefit at the expense of deploying more facilities. The reliable model performs well in balancing the conservativeness (i. e., less capacity insufficiency risk) and optimality (i.e., less cost due to redundant facilities) of the USUIL network design when faced with diverse demand cases.},

Title = {Change in the fire season pattern from bimodal to unimodal under climate change: The case of Daxing'anling in Northeast China},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The length of the wildfire season has become longer in many regions around the world under climate change. This study investigated changes in fire season pattern (i.e., the number of separate periods of a year when wildfires are most likely to ignite, spread, and affect resources) and the contributions of climate change in Daxing'anling, Northeast China. An expanded fire dataset in both spatial and temporal converge from ground reporting was used. A comparison with satellite detected burned areas showed good agreement in spring, summer, and entire fire season. The results showed that the number of fires used to appear in a bimodal pattern with spring and fall peaks in the last century, but transitioned to a unimodal pattern peaked in summer in this century. This conversion was mainly resulted from a remarkable increase in summer lightning fires, which was in turned associated with warming in Daxing'anling. Another factor for the conversion was decreased spring nonlightning fire occurrence in the northwest subregion, where the conversion was the most significant. This decrease of fire was mainly associated with increased precipitation. The analysis of a compositional fire series, built as the log of the ratio of lightning to nonlightning fires, suggests that climate change was a major factor for the conversion of fire season pattern. The finding from this study indicates a need to adjust the fire prevention implementation timeline by including summer fires and to develop strategies to reduce the related risks to firefighter safety and forest ecosystem health in Daxing'anling.},

Title = {Does Investing in Renewable Energy Sources Contribute to Growth? A Preliminary Study on Greece's National Energy and Climate Plan},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As more economies are transitioning away from fossil fuels for their electricity production and towards greener alternatives, many socioeconomic implications of this shift remain actively debated. The present paper attempts to assess the economic impact of investments in renewable energy sources (RESs) for Greece and whether the broader effects of this transition can offset the negative impact that will occur due to the targeted phase-out of lignite plants by 2028, which constitute the predominant power source for Greece. Our methodological approach builds on input-output analysis and the creation of composite RES industries for the estimation of the net effects of a series of monetary shocks that correspond to Greece's phase-out investment plan, utilizing the most recent national input-output tables and satellite structural business statistics. We focus on the structural effects of these shocks on a series of socioeconomic indicators, including GDP, employment, wages, government income (through taxes), and capital formation. The results indicate that even though lignite power production still provides a significant contribution to the Greek economy, investing in renewables presents a significant opportunity for value added and job creation.},

Title = {Measuring dam induced alteration in water richness and eco-hydrological deficit in flood plain wetland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {285},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Along with wetland loss, the damming effect on hydrological modification in wetland is another less debated and challenging topic, which needs to have urgent attention. The present work intended to investigate the damming effect on the water richness and eco-hydrological condition of the floodplain wetland and its consequent ecological responses in Punarbhaba River Basin of India and Bangladesh. Satellite images derived hydro-period, water presence frequency (WPF), and water depth were generated for developing water richness model in pre (up to 1992) and post dam conditions (1993?2019). The range of variability (RVA) was modelled using time series satellite images based water index or normalized difference water index (NDWI). Based on RVA model, the hydrological failure rate was developed. Depth of water was used for preparing the flow duration curve (FDC) to estimate the eco-hydro-deficit and surplus condition in wetland at spatial scale for pre and post-dam periods. Satellite image based trophic state index models for pre and post dam conditions were constructed to investigate the ecological response of dam on floodplain wetlands. Results of water richness model showed that wetlands area under high wetland water richness zone decreased from 71.83\% to 7.65\% in the post-dam conditions. Results of hydrological failure rate showed that high failure rate captured 45\% of total wetland area in the post dam period. Results of eco-hydro-deficit exhibited that eco-hydro-deficit areas increased from 11.22\% to 52.19\% and 35.03\%?52.67\% respectively in post-dam conditions indicating growing ecological stress. The TSI models showed that most parts of the wetlands were converted from oligotrophic to meso-eutrophic state signifying the qualitative degradation of water and potential ecosystem health. The area under high TSI was observed in the wetland area having eco-hydro-deficit and high hydrological failure rate zones. These characteristics of wetland areas were found at the fringe of wetlands and fragmented smaller wetland units. The study concluded that damming over the Punarbhaba River adversely affected the water security of the floodplain wetlands in terms of modifying the hydrological richness, ecological condition of the wetland habitat, and ecological systems. The findings of the present study could provide a comprehensive research on the monitoring of surface water crisis in the wetlands, which will be the basic foundation to formulate water resource management plans for conservation, management and restoration of wetlands.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {One of the main obstacles towards the promotion of IoT adoption and innovation is data interoperability. Facilitating cross-domain interoperability is expected to be the core element for the realisation of the next generation of the IoT computing paradigm that is already taking shape under the name of Internet of Everything (IoE). In this article, an analysis of the current status on IoT semantic interoperability is presented that leads to the identification of a set of generic requirements that act as fundamental design principles for the specification of interoperability enabling solutions. In addition, an extension of NGSIv2 data model and API (de-facto) standards is proposed aiming to bridge the gap among IoT and social media and hence to integrate user communities with cyber-physical systems. These specifications have been utilised for the implementation of the IoT2Edge interoperability enabling mechanism which is evaluated within the context of a catastrophic wildfire incident that took place in Greece on July 2018. Weather data, social media activity, video recordings from the fire, sensor measurements and satellite data, linked to the location and the time of this fire incident have been collected, modeled in a uniform manner and fed to an early fire detection decision support system. The findings of the experiment certify that achieving minimum data interoperability with light-weight, plug-n-play mechanisms can be realised with significant benefits for our society.},

Abstract = {The NASA/CNES Jason satellite, follow-on to the highly successful TOPEX/Poseidon mission, continues to provide oceanographers and marine operators across the globe with a continuous twelve-year, high quality stream of sea surface height data. The mission is expected to extend through 2007, when the NASA/NOAA/CNES follow-on mission, OSTM, will be launched with the wide-swath ocean altimeter on board. This unprecedented resource of valuable ocean data is being used to map sea surface height, geostrophic velocity, significant wave height, and wind speed over the global oceans. Altimeter data products are currently used by hundreds of researchers, and operational users to monitor ocean circulation and improve our understanding of the role of the oceans in climate and weather. Ocean altimeter data has many societal benefits and has proven invaluable in many practical applications including; Ocean forecasting systems, Climate research and forecasting, Ship routing, Precision marine operations such as cable-laying and oil production, Fisheries management, Marine mammal habitat monitoring, Hurricane forecasting and tracking, Debris tracking The data has been cited in nearly 2,000 research and popular articles since the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992, and almost 200 scientific users receive the global coverage altimeter data on a monthly basis. In addition to the scientific and operational uses of the data, the educational community has seized the unique concepts highlighted by these altimeter missions as a resource for teaching ocean science to students from grade school through college. This presentation will highlight societal benefits of ocean altimetry data in the areas of climate studies, marine operations, marine research, and non-ocean investigations.},

Abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations are productive and short rotation forests prevalent in tropical areas that experience fast expansion and face controversies in ecological issues. In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of factors influencing eucalyptus growth through plot records from the National Forest Inventories and satellite images. We find primary restricting factors for eucalyptus growth via machine learning algorithms with random forests and accumulated local effects plots, as conventional forest growth models are inadequate to calculate the causal effect with the large number of environmental and socioeconomic factors. As a result, despite common belief that temperature affects eucalyptus growth the most, we find that precipitation is the most evident restricting factor for eucalyptus growth. We then identify and rank key factors that affect timber growth, such as tree density, rotation period, and wood ownership. Finally, we suggest optimal management and planting strategies for local farmers and policymakers to facilitate eucalyptus growth.},

We contrasted changes in rangeland vegetation cover across a region-the Altai Mountains of central Asia (China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia)-that juxtaposes strongly contrasting social, political and economic conditions across a community of herders of shared cultural background (all of Kazakh origin). Our analysis focused on a satellite-derived vegetation index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor during the period 1982-2013, which included the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990 and heralded a transition away from pervasive state control on herding practices in many parts of the region. Grassland cover increased with decreasing elevation and increasing precipitation. Grassland also decreased under increased livestock density but was largely unresponsive to the dramatic changes that occurred in the sociopolitical context for grazing practices. Average NDVI values and duration of growing season were greater after the Soviet Union's collapse across the region, trends that precipitation and temperature data indicate were most likely driven by a changing climate. We conclude that rangeland policy development to assure sustainability of herder livelihoods in the Altai Mountain region should focus on climate change adaptation measures rather than modifying herders' grazing practices.},

This paper presents results of the prop osed Hadoop framework that performs entity resolution in Map and reduce phase. Map Reduce phase matches two real world objects and generates rules. The similarity score of these rules are used for matching stream data during testing phase. Similarity is calculated using 13 different semantic measures such as token-based similarity, edit-based similarity, hybrid similarity, phonetic similarity as well as domain dependent Natural language processing measures. Semantic measures are implemented using Hive programming. The proposed system is tested using e-catalogues of Amazon and Google. (C) 201 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The progress of multimedia applications for education, research, social welfare and commerce is generating a lot of interest in the potential of a combination of satellite networking and Internet technology. The combination is particularly attractive as a low cost solution in regions which are large and sparsely populated. In 1991, aiming at networking the Pan-Pacific region, the PARTNERS (Pan-Pacific Regional Telecommunications Network Experiment and Research by Satellite) project was initiated. In this project, the major target was to construct a satellite-based network infrastructure to support education, research and so on in the Pan-Pacific region. As a part of PARTNERS the MEISEI-NET (Multimedia Education System using satellite ETS-V and InterNET) project was started to evaluate the utility of satellite networking for education and research and, to investigate the feasibility of expanding the reach of the Internet using the PARTNERS infrastructure. MEISEI-NET focussed on (1) low start-up cost, (2) open access to the rich information resources on the Internet, (3) use of network to support education and research, and, (4) development and distribution of software for MEISEI-NET users. The construction of MEISEI-NET will be detailed followed by a report on its usage and the effects of this network. To support and manage MEISEI-NET operations, we developed and deployed SNMP-based intelligent network management system. It offered fault detection and notification. This made the MEISEI-NET robust and practical despite of the satellite's (ETS-V) drift-problem. Students and researchers of universities from different countries participated in and benefited from MEISEI-NET until March 1996.},

Abstract = {Edited by Catherine Kling, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, and approved April The space industry?s rapid recent growth represents the latest tragedy of the commons. Satellites launched into orbit contribute to-and risk damage from-a growing buildup of space debris and other satellites. Collision risk from this orbital congestion is costly to satellite operators. Technological and managerial solutions-such as active debris removal or end-of-life satellite deorbit guidelines-are currently being explored by regulatory authorities. However, none of these approaches address the underlying incentive problem: satellite operators do not account for costs they impose on each other via collision risk. Here, we show that an internationally harmonized orbital-use fee can cor-rect these incentives and substantially increase the value of the space industry. We construct and analyze a coupled physical-economic model of commercial launches and debris accumulation in low-Earth orbit. Similar to carbon taxes, our model projects an optimal fee that rises at a rate of 14\% per year, equal to roughly \$235,000 per satellite-year in 2040. The long-run value of the satellite industry would more than quadruple by 2040-increasing from around \$600 billion under business as usual to around \$3 trillion. In contrast, we project that purely techno-logical solutions are unlikely to fully address the problem of orbital congestion. Indeed, we find debris removal sometimes worsens economic damages from congestion by increasing launch incentives. In other sectors, addressing the tragedy of the com-mons has often been a game of catch-up with substantial social costs. The infant space industry can avert these costs before they escalate.},

Title = {The problem of overcoming a social and political division of the Ukrainian society by region, ethnicity and language},
Journal = {NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MANAGERIAL STAFF OF CULTURE AND ARTS HERALD},
Year = {2014},
Number = {4},
Pages = {206-211},
Abstract = {The article deals with the problem of overcoming a social and political division of the Ukrainian society by region, ethnicity and language. Having intensified during the years of its independence, the existing social and political division of the Ukrainian society suggests that the governments ethnic and national policy is ineffective, points to a segmental awareness of individuality and a conflict of interests of social and political groups, a stronger institutional representation etc. Today, the political elite fails to utilize the nation-consolidating potential and often ignores the objective of social, political and national consolidation of the society, enhances the imbalances in the system of values and standards, exacerbates interethnic relationships. In contemporary conditions, Ukrainian citizens from different regions have a different understanding of the past and the future development of their country, give preference to different political and geopolitical vectors. That Ukraine did not have statehood has made more complicated the evolution of sustainable national identification factors of the Ukrainian society, ultimately limited the natural development of interethnic and intergovernmental relationships and their impact on the formation of a nation, conditioned peculiar types of regional identity to a great degree. Remaining immature in most regions, the ethnic foundation of the national identity prevents the Ukrainian political nation from consolidation. It has been substantiated that the social and political division may, if escalated, provoke a nation's breakup which has two aspects - external (lack of the nation's unity is caused by certain geopolitical factors, interference of other countries or organizations in the constitution of the nation) and internal (by historical, cultural, religious, language-related, mental and other factors). Today, the breakup between the west and and east can be witnessed in Ukraine as it correlates with language-related and geopolitical reference points of Ukrainian citizens. The current social and political division of the Ukrainian society has been strengthened by internal political factors such as inferior public governance, ethnic and political management has failed to eliminate discontent of both the title ethnos and national minorities by developing their national cultures, and they have an increasing sense of neglect and humiliation. Unfortunately, most political solutions, official documents and declarations intended to promote national consolidation fail to achieve their functions and are of formal nature in that they fail to assist in overcoming regional disproportions and disintegration of the regions. Today, the ethnic and regional division is also based on the language because lingual conduct is the most prominent factor of regional differentiation. A further development of these tendencies poses a threat of having the existing ethnic and cultural differences between the regions transform themselves into an institutionalized territorial and political demarcation. When forming a language policy, the state should proceed from that the problem of protection of national minorities languages should not threaten the national identity and national consolidation of Ukraine. This condition should be of top priority in the society that has set out for national consolidation instead of a breakup of the nation. It is improper and useless to treat national minorities' languages as an aspect of their `survival'. It has been demonstrated that the social and political division of the Ukrainian society is also strengthened by external political factors such as the policy of Russia, which creates social and political organizations that raise territory claims against Ukraine; uses the dominant position of the Russian satellite and broadcast television in southern and eastern oblasts of Ukraine to reinforce pro-Russian sentiment among the population of these regions; promotes a negative attitude to the EU and NATO; creates centers of tensions over language-related and national issues, makes military intervention etc. Introduction of dual citizenship also has negative effects such as the exacerbation of interethnic relationships, a shift in the national identity or promotion of dual national identity. For national consolidation, it is crucial today to create a new system of values of the Ukrainian society, a nationwide idea which can consolidate the Ukrainian society. Of course, it is both unreasonable and ineffective to treat an individual factor as primary to national consolidation because national consolidation is a comprehensive and systemic process. National consolidation should be primarily founded on spiritual, social and moral values. The Ukrainian society can consolidate provided there is ethnic, social and national consensus - an agreement between policy actors on national matters based on fundamental values and standards that are common to all main-stream social and political groups of the society. National consolidation may evolve top down and vice versa, bottom up, as initiated by the people in the context of a developed civil society. During national consolidation of the contemporary Ukrainian society, it is important to create conditions for the establishment of institutions of political power and civil society which can maintain territorial integrity and unity of the country and guarantee its sustainable development. The consolidation of the Ukrainian society requires a number of transformations in the humanitarian area. These include developing integrative humanitarian policy intended to create a single political nation, the national identity; creating a single information space; resolving the language issue; reinforcing community ties between Russian- and Ukrainian-speaking regions. It is only when and if all internal and external political factors of the national consolidation of the Ukrainian society are taken into account comprehensively that an effective national strategy of consolidation can be developed and a sustainable development of nation building can be secured.},

Title = {Ontogenetic shifts from social to experiential learning drive avian migration timing},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Learning from one's own experience, and/or social learning from older individuals, could influence decision-making in migrating birds. Here the authors analyse 16 years of tracking data on whooping cranes to show that whether social or experiential learning is the dominant process in migration timing depends on life stage. Migrating animals may benefit from social or experiential learning, yet whether and how these learning processes interact or change over time to produce observed migration patterns remains unexplored. Using 16 years of satellite-tracking data from 105 reintroduced whooping cranes, we reveal an interplay between social and experiential learning in migration timing. Both processes dramatically improved individuals' abilities to dynamically adjust their timing to track environmental conditions along the migration path. However, results revealed an ontogenetic shift in the dominant learning process, whereby subadult birds relied on social information, while mature birds primarily relied on experiential information. These results indicate that the adjustment of migration phenology in response to the environment is a learned skill that depends on both social context and individual age. Assessing how animals successfully learn to time migrations as environmental conditions change is critical for understanding intraspecific differences in migration patterns and for anticipating responses to global change.},

Demographic and economic alterations are factors that contribute to the degradation of vegetation coverage in landscape units. In addition, because vegetation is essential for protection of recharge areas in aquifers, the fragmentation of habitats in hydrographic basins causes changes in climate temperature, soil erosion, eutrophication, and siltation of watercourses. This study analyzed the vegetation coverage from the municipality of Sao Carlos, State of Sao Paulo (SP) to assess the environmental quality of water resources in the hydrographic basins and sub-basins, in the Guarani Aquifer System. The vegetation coverage was analyzed in three scales: municipality, Hydric Resource Management Units (UGRHIs), and hydrographic sub-basins based on map overlapping from the LAPA/UFSCar Digital Cartographic Collection and visual interpretation of LANDSAT 5, TM sensor, Path 220, row 075 on satellite images. The municipality of Sao Carlos has vegetation coverage of 31,776.4 hectares, in which 57\% is classified as preserved vegetation typology, and 58\% is over the Guarani aquifer recharge area. The vegetation coverage with savannas, riparian forests, and mesophyll forests represented 28\% of the total studied area and is located over 28.3\% of the Guarani aquifer recharge area extension. The Permanent preservation areas (PPAs) represent 21.6\% of the total vegetation coverage with 51\% of it being vegetated. The municipality has a total of 686 springs (Topographic maps of IBGE, escale 1:50,000) distributed on an average of 60 springs per km(2); 40\% of these are protected by vegetation.},

Abstract = {Agricultural decision support systems (DSSs) are hardware and software tools that utilize big data collected from satellites and drones, ground-based sensors, and analyzed with machine learning algorithms to provide site-specific farming recommendations. Despite the promise of DSSs to address many challenges of the farm economy, there are social and ethical concerns that need to be addressed. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach that consisted of focus group discussions and a follow-up survey questionnaire, we highlight the experiences and affectations of heterogeneous food system actors from Vermont and South Dakota. We find that DSSs transform agricultural knowledge production, reconfigure labor arrangements and unevenly distribute benefits and burdens among farmers. We suggest that agritech developers implement inclusive and deliberative processes when redesigning DSSs to engender ethical, equitable and sustainable improvements to food production systems. Inclusive processes of open deliberation are modalities of responsible innovation, tasked with mitigating frictions within socio-technical systems.},

Title = {Changes of livelihood due to land use shifts: A case study of Yanchang County in the Loess Plateau of China},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {28-35},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Studies of land use policies are commonly based on the environmental impacts or on people's direct responses to the policies. However, research on the impact of policy implementation on people's livelihood and activities and the subsequent economic development of an area is incomplete. We selected Yanchang County as an example to track land use changes and their effects on the livelihood of the local population following the implementation of a new land use policy known as the Grain for Green Project (GGP). The data were collected from statistical yearbooks, questionnaire surveys, and satellite imagery from 1990, 2000, and 2008. We found that dramatic land use changes have occurred in Yanchang County. The vegetation coverage improved significantly from 1990 to 2008, as the grassland and forest areas increased from 44.1\% to 60.1\% and from 17.7\% to 18.4\% of the total land area, respectively. The cultivated land declined from 37.3\% to 20.7\%. With the agricultural area and grain production decreasing from 64 x 103 tons to slightly over 20 x 103 tons per year, an increasing number of local people sought employment in towns and cities. The non-farm income increased, and the local income structure shifted. Migrant and orchard worker income contributed the most to the balance of the total household income. We narrowed our focus to discuss how the GGP accelerated the changes in the participants' lifestyles and what might be done to sustain the long-term effects of the GGP. While the GGP has brought about considerable environmental benefits, a comprehensive study of environmental social systems is still needed to achieve a more efficient land use policy. The research results presented in this paper demonstrate that changes in land use and people's activities were triggered by policy changes. We aim to pave the way for studies on the ``policy-land-use-social development{''} chain and to provide references for new policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sustainable Development under Population Pressure: Lessons from Developed Land Consumption in the Conterminous US},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Population growth will result in a significant anthropogenic environmental change worldwide through increases in developed land (DL) consumption. DL consumption is an important environmental and socioeconomic process affecting humans and ecosystems. Attention has been given to DL modeling inside highly populated cities. However, modeling DL consumption should expand to non-metropolitan areas where arguably the environmental consequences are more significant. Here, we study all counties within the conterminous U.S. and based on satellite-derived product (National Land Cover Dataset 2001) we calculate the associated DL for each county. By using county population data from the 2000 census we present a comparative study on DL consumption and we propose a model linking population with expected DL consumption. Results indicate distinct geographic patterns of comparatively low and high consuming counties moving from east to west. We also demonstrate that the relationship of DL consumption with population is mostly linear, altering the notion that expected population growth will have lower DL consumption if added in counties with larger population. Added DL consumption is independent of a county's starting population and only dependent on whether the county belongs to a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). In the overlapping MSA and non-MSA population range there is also a constant DL efficiency gain of approximately 20km(2) for a given population for MSA counties which suggests that transitioning from rural to urban counties has significantly higher benefits in lower populations. In addition, we analyze the socioeconomic composition of counties with extremely high or low DL consumption. High DL consumption counties have statistically lower Black/African American population, higher poverty rate and lower income per capita than average in both NMSA and MSA counties. Our analysis offers a baseline to investigate further land consumption strategies in anticipation of growing population pressures.},

Abstract = {The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is one of the first-tier satellite missions recommended by the U. S. National Research Council Committee on Earth Science and Applications from Space. The SMAP mission 1 is under development by NASA and is scheduled for launch late in 2014. The SMAP measurements will allow global and high-resolution mapping of soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state at resolutions from 3-40 km. These measurements will have high value for a wide range of environmental applications that underpin many weather-related decisions including drought and flood guidance, agricultural productivity estimation, weather forecasting, climate predictions, and human health risk. In 2007, NASA was tasked by The National Academies to ensure that ``emerging scientific knowledge is actively applied to obtain societal benefits{''} by broadening community participation and improving means for use of information. SMAP is one of the first missions to come out of this new charge, and its Applications Plan forms the basis for ensuring its commitment to its users. The purpose of this paper is to outline the methods and approaches of the SMAP applications activity, which is designed to increase and sustain the interaction between users and scientists involved in mission development.},

Abstract = {Indonesia is undergoing rapid pace of urbanization and inadequacy of reliable data for environmental and urban planning, especially in the developing countries. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate land use/cover change (LUCC) and urban spatial expansion, from 2005 to 2017, in Semarang City, Indonesia, using satellite images, field observations, and socioeconomic data. The urban sprawl was also measured using Shannon's entropy based on its primary spatial form. As known, urban sprawl measurements based on its spatial forms would affect the policies and specific regulations in dealing with its dominant form. LUCC change and urban growth were simulated for 2029, using the CA-Markov model. The results show rapid growth of built-up areas that led to a significant decrease in the agriculture areas, gardens and wasteland, from 2005 to 2017. The obtained relative entropy values indicate Semarang city has experienced an increasing urban sprawl over the last few years. The CA-Markov model predicts that this unsustainable trend will continue in the future and built-up areas. The results in this study determine appropriate policies and regulations, especially to prevent linear glaciers along the main road.},

Title = {The economics of universal service: An analysis of entry subsidies for high speed broadband},
Journal = {INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {13-20},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Universal service is a policy objective that all individuals or households have access to some service. Subsidy policies to accomplish universal service may arise when private provision is non-universal. In the context of rural high speed wired broadband subsidies, this paper examines novel household-level cable and satellite broadband subscription data from North Carolina to examine household adoption and substitution patterns across broadband types to evaluate how many currently unserved regions warrant an entry subsidy. This paper has three main findings: (i) fewer than 43\% of households adopt high speed broadband in areas currently served by a single broadband provider, (ii) there exists evidence of a significant elasticity of substitution between high speed wired broadband and the lower speed options of satellite broadband and DSL, and (iii) a generous upper bound on the number of regions that warrant an entry subsidy is 64\%. These results suggest a policy of universal high speed wired broadband service in North Carolina would be unlikely to achieve universal adoption, would connect many households already with internet access and who would not substitute, and in many regions would be prohibitively costly even assuming very generous estimates of the consumer surplus generated. From the perspective of social welfare, to justify connecting the 5\% least dense areas of North Carolina would require each adopting household value high speed wired broadband access at more than \$1519 per month.

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {100-107},

Abstract = {Accurately mapping urban infrastructure and extent is a high priority for resource management and service allocation as well as for addressing environmental, socioeconomic, and geopolitical concerns. Most available data products only document surficial (two-dimensional) land use and land cover (LULC), yet a substantial component of urban growth occurs in the vertical dimension. Light detection and ranging (lidar) data offer the potential for monitoring three-dimensional (3D) change, but the extreme lack of systematic lidar coverage worldwide inflicts considerable gaps in both spatial and temporal coverage. Satellite scatterometer (radar) data may serve as an alternative data source for characterizing urban growth and development in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The accuracy of these radar-based datasets for estimating building volumes remains to be validated quantitatively. For nine U.S. cities, we test whether scatterometer data can be used to estimate 3D urban built-up volume. We found strong, linear correlations between the lidar-derived and radar-derived building volume estimates for all cities with r(2) values as high as 0.98 when using spatial trend analysis. Given the high expense that limits lidar data acquisition to small areas at sporadic points in time, satellite scatterometer data provide a breakthrough method for monitoring both vertical growth and horizontal expansion of cities across the world with a continuous decadal time scale.},

Title = {Prosopis juliflora management and grassland restoration in Baringo County, Kenya: Opportunities for soil carbon sequestration and local livelihoods},

Abstract = {Climate change, land degradation and invasive alien species (IAS) threaten grassland ecosystems worldwide. IAS clearing and grassland restoration would help to reduce the negative effects of IAS, restore the original vegetation cover and sustain livelihoods while contributing to climate change mitigation, but uncertain financial benefits to local stakeholders hamper such efforts. This study assessed where and when net financial benefit could be realized from Prosopis juliflora management and subsequent grassland restoration by combining ecological, social and financial information. Impacts of Prosopis invasion and grassland degradation on soil organic carbon (SOC) in nine sublocations in Baringo County, Kenya, were evaluated. Then the financial impacts of Prosopis removal and grassland restoration in the area were calculated and spatially explicit management scenarios for each sublocation modelled, combining geographical information derived from satellite images taken in different years of the invasion with SOC data and socio-economic data collected in the sublocations. The expanding Prosopis distribution and density since 1995 have increased cumulated SOC storage on former bare land or degraded grasslands. On former pristine or restored grasslands, however, Prosopis invasion has reduced total SOC storage. Prosopis removal and grassland restoration are predicted to yield financial benefits through charcoal made from removed trees, increased cattle numbers and carbon credits. However, a trade-off between increased SOC and net financial benefit was found. The predicted net SOC increase would contribute around one-tenth, at most, to the net financial benefit. The available budget, based on Baringo households' average willingness to pay, would enable removal, on average, of one-fifth of Prosopis per sublocation in a single year. A larger area can be cleared if Prosopis is sparse than if it is dense. The analyses show that in some sublocations, households' annual investments could result in restoration of all former grassland areas. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how integrating and linking detailed ecological, social and financial geodata to develop accurate and realistic invasive alien species management scenarios can illustrate costs and benefits of management interventions in a spatial context. Such scenarios should be used more extensively to support land management decisions.},

Title = {Global patterns and influencing factors of post-fire land cover change},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {223},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fire, as a strong disturbance type, can exert significant impacts on the biosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere and human society. It can inherently trigger both critical transitions in ecosystems and dramatic changes in land cover. However, the general patterns and possible influencing factors of post-fire land cover change remain largely unclear at a global scale. Obtaining such knowledge is of great value in advancing the understanding of fire ecology and promoting sustainable fire management. Here, we combined satellite observations of long-term ESA CCI land cover (300 m resolution) and burned area data from MODIS collection 6 (500 m resolution) to assess the global post-fire land cover change patterns from 2005 to 2015. The results showed that areas with identified post-fire land cover change accounted for approximately 0.36-0.74\% of the annual global burned areas during the study period and were most common in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and the D.R. Congo. The most common land cover change types in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were ``forest-to-agriculture{''} (31.93\%), ``forest-to-shrubland{''} (26.23\%) and ``agriculture-to-forest{''} (18.74\%), respectively. In addition, the conversion between agriculture and forest, and shrubland and forest, after fire were found to be bidirectional. After assessing 14 fire-related, climatic, topographic, ecological and socioeconomic factors that could potentially influence post-fire land cover change occurrence, burned area size and vegetation cover di-versity were identified as the two strongest predictors, followed by aspect, fire intensity and slope. Our results provide a global overview of post-fire land cover change patterns and offer guidance for developing sustainable fire management policies.},

Abstract = {Coastal lagoons have been providing ecological, economic and cultural benefits for many centuries. Despite their importance, the monitoring of coastal lagoons poses numerous challenges related to their complex environmental processes, their large variability in size and their remote location, inhibiting effective management programmes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 satellites to map highly dynamic morphological and hydrological changes in the Louro lagoon, a small choked lagoon located on the Galician coast (NW Spain). For this purpose, a simple methodology using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) has been evaluated, which allows to monitor the sand barrier changes and the inlet formation. The results show that the sand barrier's opening and closing might take only a very short period, and the recovery of the lagoon to its full water level can happen in less than a month. Sentinel-2 images also reveal drastic changes in the water level once the sand barrier is broken. A water surface area of 0.24 km(2) was estimated on 04/11/2019, while this surface was reduced to 0.10 km(2) on 04/12/2019. Monitoring these changes is critical to understand the different processes ongoing in these valuable environments and making informed decisions for their management and protection.

Title = {A Typology for Reef Passages},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Coral reefs host exceptionally diverse and abundant marine life. Connecting coasts and sheltered lagoons to the open ocean, reef passages are important yet poorly studied components of these ecosystems. Abiotic and biotic elements `pass' through these reef passages, supporting critical ecological processes (e.g. fish spawning). Reef passages provide multiple social and ecological benefits for islands and their peoples, but are so far neither characterized nor recognized for their multifaceted significance. This study investigated 113 reef passages across nine Pacific islands (Fiji, New Caledonia, Vanuatu). GIS-based visual interpretations of satellite imagery were used to develop criteria to define three distinct types, mainly based on distance to coastline and presence/absence of an enclosed water body. The discussion identifies ways to refine and augment this preliminary typology as part of a research agenda for reef passages. With these next steps, this typology will be extendable to other regions to better document reef passages and their various roles, supporting biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries management.},

Volume = {648},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The current study aimed to comprehensively assess the potential watershed health (WH) using an adapted reliability, resilience and vulnerability (RelResVul) framework for the 24 sub-watersheds of Shazand, Markazi Province, Iran. Towards this goal, the appropriate criteria and acceptable corresponding thresholds were adapted to calculate the main WH indictors of reliability (R-el), resilience (R-es) and vulnerability (V-ul). Accordingly, the RelResVul framework was conceptualized and customized for five criteria of standardized precipitation index (SPI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil erosion, and low and high flow discharges. The effect sizes of used criteria and indicators on the Shazand WH status were also determined. Consequently, the status of R-el, R-es and V-ul indicators and integrated WH status were mapped for four years of 1986, 1998, 2008 and 2014 and for the whole watershed by developing an integrated watershed health index (IWHI). Finally, the change detection approachwas applied to determine the trend of changes in IWHI during last three decades. The results approved the high variability in effectability of R-el, R-es and V-ul indicators and integrated health status of the Shazand Watershed from the selected criteria in study four years. The results revealed that in the all study years, the Rel indicator almost had the higher contribution rate (>= 34\%) in the ShazandWH. None of sub-watersheds in the study years were assessed in a healthy status in terms of IWHI based on the RelResVul framework. In terms of WH change detection over the study periods, WH was found to declining by some 4\% in the periods of 1986-1998 and 1986-2008 due to impact of industrialization and urban development. Whilst, the health status was non-significantly improved in other study periods. The present procedure can be supposed as a screening tool for a directive and efficient management of the watersheds.

Title = {Public libraries and difficulties with targeting the homeless},
Journal = {LIBRARY REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {7-18},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to consider the potential for public library policies that specifically target ``the homeless{''} to undermine their own objectives, and seeks to suggest alternative approaches to extend inclusion and ensure that all demographics are served equally. Design/methodology/approach - The paper was written for a satellite meeting of the 78th IFLA Congress entitled ``The Homeless and the Libraries - the Right to Information and Knowledge For All{''}. Drawing on previous research detailed in Muggleton, and Muggleton and Ruthven, the author presents a discursive perspective on the impact that assumptions about homelessness might have for policymaking. Findings - Extant prejudices and the tendency to create a homeless ``other{''} mean that policies specifically addressing the homeless have the potential to accentuate difference and patronise and alienate the intended beneficiaries of these policies. Moreover, political opposition to more inclusive, accommodating policymaking makes it important to reject assumptions and prejudices that weaken one's own position. Grounding policymaking in the empirical experience of homeless library users is argued to be the most effective way to extend inclusion, and also avoid false dichotomies and the perpetuation of prejudice. Originality/value - Insights into unconscious assumptions gathered from previous research have been applied to the conceptualisation and implementation of public library policy. The arguments presented in the paper will hopefully be of use both for developing effective policies and for defending policies relating to homeless library users.},

Title = {Impacts of haze weather on tourist arrivals and destination preference: Analysis based on Baidu Index of 73 scenic spots in Beijing, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {273},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Environmental quality is an important factor affecting the tourism industry. As a world-famous tourist city, Beijing is seriously affected by haze weather. Tourists carefully consider haze weather and shortlist their destinations based on these considerations. It is thus important to analyze the impact of haze weather on tourist arrivals and examine whether haze weather affects tourists' destination preference for scenic spots. This study incorporates the tourism resource heterogeneity into the push-pull theory to construct a new theoretical framework of haze weather affecting tourism. Using the Baidu Index, we obtain the daily tourist arrivals data for 73 scenic spots (4A and 5A) in Beijing and construct the FE-OLS, IV-2SLS, and air-bin models to evaluate and analyze the effects of haze weather on tourist arrivals, preferences of scenic spots, and tourism economic losses. The following conclusions are drawn. First, from a regional perspective, haze weather has a significant and negative impact on tourist arrivals. Second, the degree of the effect on tourism is related to the severity of the haze. Moderate, heavy, and severe haze led to a reduction in tourist arrivals by 2.29\%, 6.0\%, and 14.77\%, respectively. Third, haze weather changes the choice of tourist destination from preferred cultural and natural attractions to recreational attractions. Lastly, it is estimated that Beijing lost 5.22 million tourists and 8.95 billion yuan in tourism revenue due to haze from 2016 to 2018. This study also provides policy recommendations to help the tourism industry cope with haze weather and suggestions to expand and enrich the theoretical perspective of climate change and tourism industry research.

Title = {Using simulation to evaluate a blood supply network in the Canadian maritime provinces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {119+},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact on customer service of amalgamating two production/distribution facilities in a blood distribution network, located in the Maritime region of Canada, into a single production facility and a satellite distribution facility. Design/methodology/approach - Simulation models of the existing distribution network and the future distribution network were built. Experiments were conducted, using the two models, to compare the performance of each. Findings - Results indicate that there is no evidence to suggest a decrease in customer service resulting from the consolidation of the two facilities. Furthermore, results indicate that this conclusion is robust with respect to lower inventory levels at the satellite and up to three road closures per annum. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on specific operational assumptions regarding the number of hospitals supplied by the satellite facility and the methods used to transport blood products between locations. Social implications - The results of this study have important implications for how vital blood products are distributed to patients in the Maritime provinces of Canada. Originality/value - This paper is a case study describing a unique application of simulation methods to an important area of application. It will be of interest to readers interested in the management of blood supply chains and to researchers applying simulation methods.},

Abstract = {Indian space programme, whose objectives involve acceleration of economic and social development through applications of space technology, has been engaged in the development of state-of-the-art satellite systems, launch vehicles and equipment necessary for applications. Even during the early phase of evolution of this Programme, deliberate policies have been adopted by the national space agency, namely, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), to promote spin-off benefit from the technologies developed for the use of space projects. Consistently adhering to this policy, ISRO has transferred over 280 technologies till date, spanning a wide spectrum of disciplines. This has resulted in a fruitful two-way cooperation between a number of SMEs and the ISRO. In order to make the technology transfer process effective. ISRO has adopted a variety of functional and organizational policies that included awareness building measures, licensee selection methods, innovative contract systems, diverse transfer processes, post licencing services and feedback mechanisms. Besides analyzing these policies and their evolution, the paper discusses various models adopted for technology transfer and their impact on assessment. It also touches upon relevant issues relating to creating interface between public funded R\&D and the private commercial enterprises. It suggests few models in which international cooperation could be pursued in this field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Phenological heterogeneities of invasive Spartina alterniflora salt marshes revealed by high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The rapid expansion of invasive Spartina alternifiora in China's coastal wetlands has seriously threatened regional ecosystem health. Characterizing phenology of S. alternifiora salt marshes supports the studies on plant invasion mechanism and carbon fluxes in coastal wetlands. To date, little is known about the capacity of high-spatial-resolution imagery in revealing local scale heterogeneities and temporal variations in the phenology; in addition, the driving factors of such heterogeneities are not well understood. This study took Yellow River Estuary (YRE) as the study site where S. alternifiora area has expanded since 2008. We retrieved start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of growing season (LOS), and maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVImax) from time series Sentinel-2 imagery (10-meter resolution) during 2017 - 2019 with assist of a rulebased data noise removal approach. Results showed that phenological metrics differ with invasion years. The differences in the median NDVImax reached 0.13, in the median SOS reached 26 days, and in the median LOS reached 51 days. S. alternifiora with 5-year invasion had the highest NDVImax, and younger S. alterniflora marshes had earlier SOS and longer LOS. Both SOS and EOS showed negative relationships with NDVImax, indicating the marshes with greater green vegetation cover had earlier SOS and EOS. More spatial details can be revealed from higher-resolution PlanetScope imagery (3-meter resolution), showing the influence of tidal creeks on phenology. The spatial heterogeneity in phenology was associated with environmental factors such as tidal inundation, elevation, micro-climate, nutrients, and canopy structure. S. alternifiora showed markedly higher NDVImax and earlier EOS in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2019, associated with larger river water discharge and sediment load brought by Water Sediment Regulation Scheme, greater precipitation in the wettest season and lower preseason temperature in 2018. Large phenological variations at both spatial and temporal scales suggest that S. alternifiora marshes are sensitive to the local environment and climate change. This study has the potential to provide references for the management of invasive plants threatening coastal wetlands in the world.},

Title = {Analysis on the Evolution of Rural Settlement Pattern and Its Influencing Factors in China from 1995 to 2015},
Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, China has experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization. As cities have expanded rapidly, the spatial patterns of rural settlements also changed significantly. This study uses land use data from satellite imagery interpretation, socioeconomic statistics, and field survey data, together with techniques including landscape pattern analysis, kernel density estimation, and spatial measurement models, to analyze the evolving spatial patterns of rural settlements influencing factors in China from 1995 to 2015. The results indicate the following: First, China's rural settlements experienced significant changes in the period 1995-2015, as 88.92\% of Prefectural-level administrative district units saw an increase in rural settlement area, with total settlement size increasing by 1.35 million hectares, and settlement area sprawl index values can be summarized as ``high in the west and low in the east{''}. Second, in the two-decade study period, the population agglomeration capacity of rural settlements in China continuously weakened, and the shape and structure of rural settlement became more complex and irregular. The scale and scope of the disappearance of rural settlement areas in the northeast and southeast regions was relatively drastic, and the kernel density value of settlements dropped significantly. Third, the increase in rural settlement land area is concentrated in low-altitude and low-slope areas, with a significant tendency to be near water and roads. Fourth, social and economic factors, such as per capita net income of rural residents, the proportion of the population employed in agriculture, the size and structure of the permanent rural population, local fiscal revenue, and urbanization level, are the main factors that cause changes of rural settlement patterns. The results of this study can serve as a reference for promoting regional rural sustainable development policies and advancing rural spatial governance and comprehensive revitalization.},

Abstract = {NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) aims to provide a platform to enable and facilitate scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing in the Earth sciences, as current satellite measurements rapidly magnify the accumulation of more than 40 years of NASA datasets. One of the main objectives of NEX is to help Earth scientists leverage and reuse various data processing software modules developed by their peers, in order to quickly run value-added executable experiments (workflows). Toward this goal, this paper reports our efforts of leveraging social network analysis to intelligently extract hidden information from data processing workflows. By modeling Earth science workflow modules as social entities and their dependencies as social relationships, this research opens up new vistas for applying social science to facilitate software reuse and distributed workflow development. As a proof of concept, a prototyping system has been developed as a plug-in to the NEX workflow design and management system (VisTrails) to aid Earth scientists in discovering and reusing workflow modules and extending them to solve more complex science problems.},

Abstract = {The CHRONOS space mission concept provides time-resolved abundance for emissions and transport studies of the highly variable and highly uncertain air pollutants carbon monoxide and methane, with sub-hourly revisit rate at fine (similar to 4 km) horizontal spatial resolution across a North American domain. CHRONOS can provide complete synoptic air pollution maps ({''}snapshots{''}) of the continental domain with less than 10 min of observations. This rapid mapping enables visualization of air pollution transport simultaneously across the entire continent and enables a sentinel-like capability for monitoring evolving, or unanticipated, air pollution sources in multiple locations at the same time with high temporal resolution. CHRONOS uses a compact imaging gas filter correlation radiometer for these observations, with heritage from more than 17 years of scientific data and algorithm advances by the science teams for the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on NASA's Terra spacecraft in low Earth orbit. To achieve continental-scale sub-hourly sampling, the CHRONOS mission would be conducted from geostationary orbit, with the instrument hosted on a communications or meteorological platform. CHRONOS observations would contribute to an integrated observing system for atmospheric composition using surface, suborbital and satellite data with atmospheric chemistry models, as defined by the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites. Addressing the U.S. National Academy's 2007 decadal survey direction to characterize diurnal changes in tropospheric composition, CHRONOS observations would find direct societal applications for air quality management and forecasting to protect public health.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 outbreak has constrained human activities in Jakarta, Indonesia during the large-scale social restriction (LSSR) period. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the spatial variation of air pollutants over Jakarta during and after the LSSR periods. This study used satellite retrievals such as OMI, AIRS, and MERRA-2 satellite data to assess spatial variations of NO2, CO, O-3, SO2, and PM2.5 from May to June 2020 (during the LSSR period) and from July to August 2020 (after the LSSR period) over Jakarta. The satellite images were processed using GIS software to increase the clarity of the images. The relationship between air pollutants and meteorological data was analyzed using Pearson correlation. The results showed the levels of NO2, PM2.5, O-3, and CO increased by 59.4\%, 21.2\%, 16.2\%, and 1.0\%, respectively, while SO2 decreased by 19.1\% after the LSSR period. The temperature value was inversely correlated with PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 concentrations. Furthermore, the backward trajectory analysis revealed that air pollutants from outland areas such as the east and southeast carried more particulate matter and gases pollutants, which contributed to the air pollution during and after the LSSR periods. As a whole, the COVID-19 outbreak had bad impacts on human health, but the increase in air pollutants levels after loosening the LSSR policy could also lead to a higher risk of severe respiratory diseases. This study provides new insight into air pollutant distribution during and after LSSR periods and recommends an effective method of mitigating the air pollution issues in Jakarta.},

Abstract = {Ozone (O-3) dry deposition is a major O3 sink. As a follow-up study of Huang et al. (2021), we quantify the impact of satellite soil moisture (SM) on model representations of this process when different dry-deposition parameterizations are implemented, based on which the implications for interpreting O-3 air pollution levels and assessing the O-3 impacts on human and ecosystem health are provided. The SM data from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission are assimilated into the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model within the NASA Land Information System framework, semicoupled with Weather Research and Forecasting model with online Chemistry (WRF-Chem) regional-scale simulations covering the southeastern US. Major changes in the modeling system used include enabling the dynamic vegetation option, adding the irrigation process, and updating the scheme for the surface exchange coefficient. Two dry-deposition schemes are implemented, i.e., the Wesely scheme and a ``dynamic{''} scheme, in the latter of which dry-deposition parameterization is coupled with photosynthesis and vegetation dynamics. It is demonstrated that, when the dynamic scheme is applied, the simulated O-3 dry-deposition velocities vd and their stomatal and cuticular portions, as well as the total O-3 fluxes F-t, are larger overall; vd and F-t are 2-3 times more sensitive to the SM changes due to the data assimilation (DA). Further, through case studies at two forested sites with different soil types and hydrological regimes, we highlight that, applying the Community Land Model type of SM factor controlling stomatal resistance (i.e., beta factor) scheme in replacement of the Noah-type beta factor scheme reduced the vd sensitivity to SM changes by similar to 75 \% at one site, while it doubled this sensitivity at the other site. Referring to multiple evaluation datasets, which may be associated with variable extents of uncertainty, the model performance of vegetation, surface fluxes, weather, and surface O-3 concentrations shows mixed responses to the DA, some of which display land cover dependency. Finally, using model-derived concentration- and flux-based policy-relevant O-3 metrics as well as their matching exposure-response functions, the relative biomass/crop yield losses for several types of vegetation/crops are estimated to be within a wide range of 1 \%-17 \%. Their sensitivities to the model's dry-deposition scheme and the implementation of SM DA are discussed.},

Abstract = {The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has experienced phenomenal transformations in the past four decades both economically and socially. Motivated by the goal to become a global player, the UAE government has invested heavily in all sectors particularly in its educational system (23\% of its budget) to ensure that future generations acquire the latest knowledge and skills needed in the global environment (Drzeniek-Hanouz and Yousef, 2007). To reach its educational objectives, the country has adopted educational policies in its higher education that rely on Western experts to reform its curriculum and opted for the use of English as a medium of instruction in its public and private universities. It also encouraged Western universities to set up satellite campuses in educational free zone areas. The adoption of English as a medium of instruction, in particular, has raised serious concerns about the maintenance and development of Arabic as its national language and its Arab identity under the pressures of globalization. This paper examines whether the transplantation of Western curricula, western experts and the adoption of English as a medium of instruction to modernize higher education is aligned with the UAE's official cultural and linguistic identity of being ``founded on progressive and moderate Islamic values and endowed with a rich Arabic language, to proudly celebrate Emirati traditions and heritage while reinforcing national identity{''} (Cabinet releases, Theme 1.4). Using a multidisciplinary approach combining perspectives from education and development models and globalization studies, it offers a critique of the underlying utilitarian approach to higher education (Fagerlind \& Saha, 1989) and the transplantation of Western curricula to deliver it by addressing two intertwined questions. 1) Does the import of higher education content and administration allow the UAE to prepare its graduates to respond to globalization challenges in their local/national context? 2) Is the adoption of English as the medium of instruction consistent with its declared vision as an Arab nation? The analysis is based on published mission statements, general education curricula and goals from the three public universities in the UAE, complemented with interviews of university executives and my personal experience as an academic and administrator in UAE higher education, for the past 13 years. It concludes by arguing for an alternative humanistic education reform aimed at achieving integrated economic, linguistic, cultural and social goals that correspond to the UAE's national development vision and adopting an effective dual language education policy that values both Arabic and English.},

Title = {Innovation management from the inside: An approach from attention and everyday praxis},
Journal = {INTANGIBLE CAPITAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {640-667},
Abstract = {Purpose: We attempt to deepen the understanding of innovation management from the attention and everyday life. Design/methodology: Following a micro-sociological approach along with social constructivism, qualitative and inductive methods are used. The methodological design responds to the Grounded theory. Focusing on organizational units of innovation management, the empirical sample consists of a central case study coupled with six satellite case studies. For all cases, an in-depth review of corporate documentation is carried out. During 2016, an indepth ethnography had been carried out in the case of a central study, including interviews with each participant; at the end of the year, qualitative interviews were carried out in satellite study cases. Findings: The research results on an emerging theory establish a transverse movement crisscrossing an organization, which in turn diffuses organizational attention as regards the inputs of innovation, largely contributing to the fact that innovation management units' experience multifocality, and that the agenda of their agents become volatile. In addition, the micro-sociological positioning offers a new vision in managing innovation, regardless of linear or schematic representations. Research limitations/implications: The empirical sample includes Spain-based organizations different sectors. The data structuration and the derived conclusions could vary according to the chosen nation. Practical implications: Far from abstractions, the paper offers results that enable understanding on innovation management from a realistic perspective. The knowledge of praxis allows a better understanding of innovation management carried out by these organizational units, which are the main nodes of promotion, stimulation and execution of innovation in modern organizations. Social implications: From the micro-sociology perspective, our focus remains on the importance of agents and the everyday life in the process of building an organization as a collective representation. Originality/value: The originality of the present study is in two sense: the conceptual framework explores innovation management for the first time through attention; under the methodological framework, we leave aside the hegemonic quantitative-structural approach, to focus the study in the everyday life of Innovation Project Managers (the organizational agents), who actually go on to implement innovation management. Thus, we elude the discursive rhetoric of innovation to cling to the real praxis, that by which organizations will get results and survive.},

Title = {Work-family enrichment of firefighters: ``satellite family members{''}, risk, trauma and family functioning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SERVICES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {395-407},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Purpose Traditionally, research exploring the work-family interface has focussed on two perspectives: the organisation and the employee. The third perspective of the family has been largely neglected. This has also been the case with emergency responders. Arguably, the social support that emergency responders receive from their families maintains the health and well-being of the emergency responders. There has been more literature focussing on family members of police and ambulance staff, but less is known about the experiences of the families of firefighters. This study, therefore, aims to explore the occupation-related consequences for families of firefighters to establish what could be done to preserve this important source of social support. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was needed to understand the perspective of relatives of firefighters. Grounded theory was used to analyse interviews of family members of firefighters. Findings Important concepts to families of firefighters include the management of emotional contagion from their firefighter, their sophisticated perceptions of physical and emotional risk, their ability to make things work around a satellite family member, detail of the sacrifices they make and the social support from other firefighters' families. Research limitations/implications The findings highlight the rich understanding and benefits offered when fire and rescue services and researchers consider the family perspective of the work-family interface within this context to develop a rich supportive dynamic between the organisation, the employee and their family. Practical implications Findings from this study are considered to inform the development of a positive resource ecology within fire and rescue services. Where work-family enrichment positively informs the interventions and practical approaches organisations can use to enhance the wellbeing of their employees, by acknowledging other life domains. Originality/value The contribution to theoretical perspectives on the work-family interface, as well as the informed understanding of occupational consequences of the firefighting occupation on relatives, offers a unique contribution to the literature.},

Title = {How magnitude of PM2.5 exposure disparities have evolved across Chinese urban-rural population during 2010-2019},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {382},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Rapid industrialization and urbanization in China not only facilitate economic progress, but also aggravate environmental pollution and disparity. Particulate matter (especially PM2.5) pollution has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to its serious adverse health impact. However, the spatial disparity and socio-economic inequality between urban and rural population owing to PM2.5 pollution have rarely been quantified. In this study, PM2.5 exposures to urban and rural population in China during 2010-2019 were estimated respectively using satellite data and the convolutional neural network. The association between socioeconomic indexes and PM2.5 exposure was then examined with the geographic detectors, considering the tremendous disparity in socioeconomic development between rural and urban communities. The regional difference and urban-rural disparity in PM2.5 exposure was finally quantified based on Theil index. The results show PM2.5 exposure and its spatial difference have decreased significantly during the decade, with the concentration decreasing by 26\% (from 48 to 35 mu g/m3) and the Theil index decreasing from 0.13 to 0.05. The inter-provincial difference dominates the overall spatial variation in 2010, changing to intra-provincial difference in 2019. We also find that China has faced environmental inequality in PM2.5 exposure between urban and rural community in the past decade, manifesting that the urban population suffered from higher PM2.5 levels than the rural population, while the inequality had decreased significantly by 2019. This is consistent with the pattern that PM2.5 exposures increase with socioeconomic development in the early stage, and stabilize or decrease in the late stage. The results suggest that China should abandon the old path of ``pollute first and control later{''} on rural revitalization strategy, otherwise rural population may experience higher exposure than urban population, plunging rural communities into the ``environment-health-poverty{''} trap.},

Title = {Greening residential quarters in China: What are the roles of urban form, socioeconomic factors, and biophysical context?},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Residential greenspace has great intracity variations. Its driving factors have been widely investigated in Western countries (e.g., in Europe and North America), where residential areas are mostly privately owned, but few studies have examined the determinants of residential greenspace in China, where land is owned by the gov-ernment. Taking the subtropical city of Changsha, China, as an example, this study mapped the percent green cover (PGC) in residential quarters with a fine-resolution satellite image. We also investigated its driving factors measured from multisource geospatial data. The results show that (1) the PGC in the residential quarters showed great spatial variation, with an average of 36.6\% (0-85.7\%) and a standard deviation of 18.3\%. (2) Urban form, biophysical context, and socioeconomic factors together explained 49.18\% of the variation in the PGC, and they independently explained 22.87\%, 11.17\%, and 2.31\% of the variation, respectively. (3) Residential quarter size, PGC in the surrounding buffer zone, residential quarter age, housing value, and population density significantly and positively impact the PGC, while percent building cover, floor area ratio, and distance to city center had significant negative impacts. The strongest positive and negative impacts came from PGC in the surrounding buffer zone and percent building cover, respectively. Socioeconomic factors, the dominant driving factors in Western countries, show little impact on residential PGC. These findings expand our understanding of the intracity variation in greenspace coverage and the driving factors, which sheds light on the effective planning and management of urban greenspaces in China.},

Abstract = {Historical land use may shape landscapes for centuries into the future, but it remains unclear how much land-use legacies affect contemporary land use. Knowing for how long and how strongly land-use legacies affect agricultural systems is important for contemporary land-use planning and conservation. We assessed the effect of nineteenth-century agricultural legacies for contemporary agricultural abandonment by integrating historic maps and satellite imagery in the Carpathian region. We modeled the choice of agricultural land, and the legacies of Habsburg and Socialist regimes, while controlling for agro-ecological, accessibility and sociopolitical variation. Farming during the Habsburg era was concentrated in agro-ecologically suitable areas, but socialist agricultural expansion occurred mostly in less suitable areas, leading to subsequent abandonment. In addition, our results showed that historic land use affected abandonment even 100 years later. Although legacies diminished over time, their effects were amplified when political transformations occurred, likely due to land tenure systems, land owner attitudes, cultural values and differences in land improvement over time. Taken together, land-use legacies and shifts in political systems can constrain current land management and possible future land-use options, suggesting that contemporary land-use decisions can affect future land use for decades and even centuries.},

Title = {Variability, predictability, and uncertainty in global aerosols inferred from gap-filled satellite observations and an econometric modeling approach},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {261},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Time series analyses and stochastic modeling assessments of aerosols are critical for climate change and human health studies. However, the precise characterization of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), its variability, trends, and predictability, and its associated uncertainty at the global scale is largely unexplored. In addition, gaps in satellite-retrieved AODs across space and time remain an obstacle to accurately revealing aerosol properties. This study uses MODIS Collection 6 AOD retrievals for a time series analysis and modeling of global aerosols from 2003 to 2015. Random forest (RF) regression is first applied to replace the missing data in the satellite AOD retrievals. AOD variations and trends are then investigated and future values are predicted using a Mann-Kendall analysis approach and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, respectively. The results indicate that the developed RF model enhances the AOD data coverage significantly, with the root mean square error and mean absolute error statistical metrics well below 0.13 and 0.08, respectively. High AOD loadings are found over East, South, and Southwest Asia, West and Central Africa, and northern South America. Prominent discrepancies are shown in aerosol variations and trends likely because of dust emissions, biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and socioeconomic practices, which has significant implications for climate systems and mitigation policy-making. The ARIMA model delineates AOD features with clear annual and seasonal variations and with high accuracy over most regions. The performance of the model is jointly impacted by the data quality and data values. Overall, our study suggests the feasibility and applicability of the RF model in reconstructing area-scale satellite missing AOD retrievals, as well as the ability of the stochastic ARIMA model to accurately depict and forecast AOD profiles. The globally simulated and predicted aerosols will improve evaluations of aerosol effects for climate and epidemiological studies.},

Abstract = {Climate variability along with increase in the demand for water resources highlights the need for better understanding of the link between regional climate and terrestrial water storage. This paper examined the variation of terrestrial water storage in relation to climatic influences over the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) River Basin from GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA), satellite altimetry, rainfall, and Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index (MEI) anomaly data. Although there is no statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) long-term trend in terrestrial water variation and rainfall in the basin (lake storage, TWSA, and rainfall, p-value = 0.45, 0.48, and 0.55, respectively), in the last decade, two visible droughts occurred between 2002 and 2004, and 2009 and 2010, which resulted in water deficit in the basin, where below average rainfall, TWSA, and lake height (storage) were observed during these periods. Extreme rainfall analysis from Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and strong connection between wet season rainfall, lake height, and TWSA, respectively, indicate interannual terrestrial water storage dynamics in the UBN Basin is strongly influenced by climate. Further, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences rainfall in the UBN Basin, specifically the peak rainfall season (June-September), which shows negative correlation (r = -0.62) with MEI anomaly values, which indicates that the El Nino case (positive MEI values) is linked to the dry conditions in the basin. The findings of this study, combined with studies such as socioeconomic impact of drought, will facilitate better planning and management of water resources in water stressed regions. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the application of a combination of satellite and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro-climatic condition of a remote basin.},

Abstract = {Savanna burning for greenhouse gas abatement presents an opportunity for remote Aboriginal communities of northern Australia to engage with the mainstream economy while fulfilling cultural obligations for (land stewardship. The recently established Tiwi Carbon Study aims to identify the biophysical and economic potential of fire management for greenhouse gas abatement on the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin, as a basis for possible livelihood opportunities for the Aboriginal Tiwi people. Recent (20012010) fire history for the Tiwi Islands based on AVHRR satellite imagery shows that on average 35\% (187 700 ha) of its savanna woodlands and open forests are burned every year, with 72\% of burning occurring late in the dry season (August to) November). Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from Tiwi fires average 68 000 t CO2-e year-1 and we discuss scenarios for greenhouse gas abatement through management of these fires by Tiwi people, consistent with the savanna burning methodology approved under the Federal Government's Carbon Farming Initiative. Changed fire management scenarios produced emissions abatement of up to 46 000 t CO2-e year-1, with highest savings under a change in both fire frequency and intensity. In addition to abatement of non-CO2 emissions, fire management has the potential to alter rates of carbon sequestered in soil and vegetation. Current ecosystem C stocks (excluding roots) on the Tiwi Islands range from 60 to 160 t C ha-1. The Tiwi Carbon Study features a long-term, landscape-scale fire experiment for informing full carbon accounting in relation to different fire management options, and for understanding their implications for biodiversity. We discuss potential co-benefits and trade-offs of fire management for greenhouse gas emissions abatement in relation to biodiversity and Tiwi cultural requirements and livelihood aspirations.},

Abstract = {The negative consequences of urbanisation have been recently recognised despite the social and economic benefits it provides to the community. Effects of urbanisation include increases in surface runoff, frequency and magnitude of floods and urban water harvesting capacity. Accordingly, this study utilised multi-spectral and multi-resolution satellite images combined with field data to conduct a quantitative assessment of the impact of urbanisation on urban flooding for the period of 1975-2015 in Ajman City, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Results showed that urban areas in the city have increased by approximately 12-fold over the period 1975-2015, whilst the population increased by approximately 16-fold. Owing to a substantial increase in urbanisation (as impervious areas expanded), minimum precipitation to generate runoff in built areas dropped from approximately 16.37 mm in 1975 to approximately 13.3 mm in 2015, which caused a substantial increase in the surface runoff. To visualise the flooding potential, urban flooding maps were generated using a well-established decision analysis technique called Analytical Hierarchy Process. The latter adopted three thematic factors, namely excess rain, elevation and slope. Flooding potential was then found to have increased substantially, specifically in the downtown area. Finally, this study is expected to contribute highly to flood protection and sustainable urban storm water management in Ajman City.},

Title = {Space as an enabler for sustainable digital transformation: The new space race and benefits for newcommers},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {198},
Pages = {728-732},

Abstract = {Disruptive events are the ones that have historically transformed our world. COVID-19 has forced governments and companies to seek transformation in particular in the field of digital. Space has been an enabler for a number of sectorial policies e.g. agriculture, defence, maritime. Digital transformation requires connectivity providing ???anything???, ???anytime???, ???anywhere???. Space as an enabler for digital transformation has become a centerpiece for socioeconomic sustainability and growth. Mega constellations provide telecom services globally and will directly compete with the terrestrial telecom operators, in the next years while the telecom operators should concentrate on the investment of 5G infrastructure. The most promising mega constellation is the one planned by Starlink, which will consist of more than 40,000 satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), with service coverage of the whole surface of Earth. It is to be highlighted that there is no European project of this scale. The strong point of the Starlink mega constellation is the complete vertical integration: satellite design, manufacturing, launching, control, operation and telecom service provision by a single group of companies. The economies of scale which would be achieved could lower the retail prices of the telecom service to levels which will not be viable for the terrestrial telecom operators. Thus a strong dependency of European telecommunications with the non-European mega constellation like Starlink is expected. The European Union is to develop the next flagship programme in the field of connectivity, following the announcement of Commissioner Breton on 15 July. The Commissioner stated that ???... we already need to look beyond 5G. I am talking about starting to prepare for 6G of course, but not only. The next paradigm shift is about linking connectivity with space to provide high-speed connectivity everywhere in Europe???. This has been confirmed by the 22 March Action Plan placing it as the next European flagship after Galileo and Copernicus. It will build on Govsatcom, European Quantum Communications In-frastructures. Small countries like Greece have been taking a step by step approach in ensuring the digital transformation of the country. These steps have been at the level of policy, governance, programmatic and financial instruments. The much higher data rates available would change the transmission of data to and from locations. An opportunity arises for new architectures where satellites can provide internet connectivity blend with terrestrial wireless or wired networks. The service to the user will be seamless and unaware of switching between the different infrastructures. This paper will provide an overview how Europe and small member states have been preparing its space related activities in combination with non-space activities for the digital trans-formation of the country.},

Abstract = {The Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS) have the world's largest supply of floating algae. The green and golden tides appear mainly in the YS and ECS, respectively, but become entangled as they drift. The floating algae obstructs navigation and is a huge socioeconomic problem in the vicinity of coastal areas. To manage these floating algae more systematically, a method of distinguishing between the green and golden tides is required. In this study, the reflectivity characteristics of the green and golden tides appearing in the YS and ECS were investigated based on which a classification method was proposed and applied to satellite sensors. First, the reflectance of Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri was measured, which are the major causative species of the green and golden tides in the YS and ECS, respectively. Under visible light, the reflectance of U. prolifera increased at 555 nm, and that of S. horneri increased at 602 and 646 nm and decreased at 632 nm. To distinguish the two algae, slope of red-green (SRG) method was applied with the red and green reflectance slope. U. prolifera exhibited SRG that was always negative, whereas that of S. horneri was always positive. When SRG was applied to the difference in reflectance values between floating algae and nearby water detected in satellite imagery, the green tide was always negative, and the golden tide was always positive. Classification and detection of floating algae using multi-satellite sensors and SRG system can reduce the associated management cost and time.},

Title = {Hydro- and sediment dynamics in the Gironde estuary (France): Sensitivi to seasonal variations in river inflow and sea level rise},

Volume = {165},

Abstract = {Understanding estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics is of key importance to provide the foundation for sound management of these coastal systems. Turbidity maxima, which are zones of elevated suspended sediment concentration (SSC), are of particular interest as they control biogeochemical cycling and affect the overall environmental quality of the estuary. These turbidity maxima, however, are complex dynamic features that respond to changes in forcing conditions. In this study we use a 3D numerical model to investigate the response of hydrosedimentary dynamics to variations in river inflow and sea level rise in the Gironde estuary, which is one of the largest estuarine systems in Europe. Yearly simulations and comparisons with satellite data and measurements of salinity and SSC show that the model reproduces variations in salinity intrusion and the migration of the turbidity maximum driven by seasonal fluctuations in river inflow. Numerical experiments indicate that the formation of this dynamic turbidity maximum is mainly driven by tidal asymmetry. Density gradients play a secondary role by maintaining the stability of the suspended sediment mass. The model also simulates the presence of a secondary turbidity maximum which is more stable, consistent with observations. Evaluation of the sediment budget shows that sediment export mainly occurs during spring tides and when river discharge is high. Simulations including sea level rise suggest that salinity levels in the middle estuary will increase and rising water levels cause tidal amplification, strengthening of tidal currents and enhanced SSC levels in the upper estuary. On the other hand, the locations of the salinity front and the turbidity maximum remain relatively stable under rising water levels. Overall, our simulations suggest that decadal changes in river inflow can potentially have a larger effect on turbidity maximum dynamics than sea level rise.},

Abstract = {Research summary: How does a business family manage its business portfolio in times of declining performance to sustain the portfolio's long-term endurance? Drawing on social identity theory and six family business portfolios from Pakistan, we find that business families may prefer to shut down a satellite business rather than sell it, which is primarily driven by identity considerations. In addition, the family's goal to recycle the assets, the aim to restart the business later, and the increasing decline in performance are important contingency factors. This study contributes to the literature on portfolio entrepreneurship, business exit, and the enduring entrepreneurship of family firms. Managerial summary: Family business managers and practitioners can benefit from our work, which provides evidence of how family firm portfolios can respond to business decline and ensure enduring entrepreneurship. Shutting down a satellite firm instead of selling it is a promising turnaround strategy that can prevent a family's identity loss while supporting the family business portfolio's continuity.

Abstract = {Coastal areas in East Africa are experiencing rapid economic, resource management, demographic and technological shifts. In response diverse Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) applications have been embraced to provide mutual conservation and use benefits. These initiatives have met with mixed success in practice. Reflecting on the limitations of past research using common pool resources theory theory to study CBNRM we use insights from actor oriented theory combined with satellite image analysis to describe and discuss the forces dynamically influencing institutional and mangrove forest cover change at Kisakasaka, Zanzibar focussing on the formal CBNRM project period between 1996 and 2001, but also considering the period before and after this. We examine the shifting social relations that affected the performance and viability of the formal CBNRM arrangements. An integrated approach was taken to the presentation and discussion of results where it was possible to enrich and expand explanations of socio-environmental change, which was driven by a lack of government support, the undermining effects of party political divisions, and the lack of institutional adaptive capacity. We conclude that this was a useful approach to explain CBNRM intervention events at Kisakasaka. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {174-185},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper examines how indigenous peri-urban households in Wa, one of the fastest growing towns in Ghana are adapting to the effects of physical transformation of their environment. By analysing Landsat satellite images and using social research methods, the paper discusses the nature and extent of urban growth, its impact on periurban livelihoods, and the coping strategies of peri-urban households. Findings show that urban land in Wa increased by 5.73 times-from 5.75 km(2) in 1986 to 32.93 km(2) in 2016 with an annual growth rate of 5.9\%. This growth led to the conversion of agricultural lands into residential and other uses. As a result, many indigenous peri-urban households are abandoning agriculture in search for urban-based employment as a safety net. The study recommends partnership between local government and landowners to identify and protect high potential agricultural lands in Wa; modernisation of the land governance and management processes in view of the loss of cultural and spiritual values associated with land; prioritisation of physical and spatial planning at the district level; and equipping indigenous peri-urban households with skills to assist them create sustainable livelihoods to compensate for the loss of their agriculture lands.},

Title = {Improvement in air quality and its impact on land surface temperature in major urban areas across India during the first lockdown of the pandemic},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {199},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and the enforced lockdown have reduced the use of surface and air transportation. This study investigates the impact of the lockdown restrictions in India on atmospheric composition, using Sentinel-5Ps retrievals of tropospheric NO2 concentration and ground-station measurements of NO2 and PM2.5 between March-May in 2019 and 2020. Detailed analysis of the changes to atmospheric composition are carried out over six major urban areas (i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad) by comparing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) measurements in the lockdown year 2020 and pre-lockdown (2015-2019). Satellite-based data showed that NO2 concentration reduced by 18\% (Kolkata), 29\% (Hyderabad), 32-34\% (Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore), and 43\% (Delhi). Surface-based concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and AOD also substantially dropped by 32-74\%, 10-42\%, and 8-34\%, respectively over these major cities during the lockdown period and co-located with the intensity of anthropogenic activity. Only a smaller fraction of the reduction of pollutants was associated with meteorological variability. A substantial negative anomaly was found for LST both in the day (-0.16 degrees C to -1 degrees C) and night (-0.63 degrees C to -2.1 degrees C) across select all cities, which was also consistent with air temperature measurements. The decreases in LST could be associated with a reduction in pollutants, greenhouse gases and water vapor content. Improvement in air quality with lower urban temperatures due to lockdown may be a temporary effect, but it provides a crucial connection among human activities, air pollution, aerosols, radiative flux, and temperature. The lockdown for a shorter-period showed a significant improvement in environmental quality and provides a strong evidence base for larger scale policy implementation to improve air quality.},

Abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a fundamental factor of development. They represent a major economic, political, and social opportunity for the countries. Bridging the digital divide - access to ICTs, appropriation of these technologies, promotion and respect of the cultural and linguistic diversity of contents - is also, in itself, what is at stake in development. In order for ICTs and Telecommunications to contribute to development in a way that does not only benefit the developed countries, thus increasing the gap between the North and the South, three aspects seem essential to us: the development of applications and uses; the deployment of communication networks allowing a financially bearable access; lastly, a legal and regulatory environment, favorable to investments and to the strengthening of the information society. It is impossible to make the most out of the ICTs' potential without infrastructure, and their effective management assumes a favorable legal and regulatory environment. The telecommunication sector has known dramatic changes, giving way to a competitive system, stimulating supply and bringing it closer to demand. This paper intends to offer an overview and some reflections about the use of ICTs and Telecommunications with special regard to the use of ``Television{''} as a technological means to educate in favor of development. It also describes a practical application realized in African countries in the frame of the international project named SWAY4Edu: Satellite Way for Education.},

Title = {Reflooding the Faguibine floodplain system, northern Mali: potential benefits and challenges},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-117},
Abstract = {The Faguibine system, northern Mali, consists of a series of interconnected floodplains of which the flooded surface area declined from about 1 000 km(2) in the late 19th century to only some 90 km(2) in 2010. Flood extent depends on the height of the Niger River flood peak at Dire. Satellite imagery analysis indicated that a phase shift may have occurred in the year 2000, probably as a delayed consequence of the Sahelian drought of the 1970s compounded by the collapse of societal controls on water use during recent civil conflict. An economic evaluation of the system in 2011 showed US\$100 000 per year of net income per flooded km(2) in Lake Faguibine, allowing vulnerable people to practise recession agriculture, to fish and to graze livestock. An intensive investment phase, combined with an approach of rebuilding local governance systems and environmental management capacity, could yield net benefits to the user communities of the order of ten times the maintenance costs, contributing to human well-being. The system is currently threatened by the building of the Fomi Dam in Guinea and by the planned expansion of irrigation upstream. There is also a risk of the return of a prolonged drought linked to the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation index.},

Title = {A XGBoost-Based Downscaling-Calibration Scheme for Extreme Precipitation Events},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},
Abstract = {Extreme precipitation events have caused severe societal, economic, and environmental impacts through the disasters of floods, flash floods, and landslides. The coarse-resolution of satellite-derived precipitation data, however, makes it difficult to quantitatively capture certain fine-scale heavy rainfall processes. Therefore, to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of satellite-based precipitation extremes, a downscaling-calibration scheme based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost\_DC) was proposed in this study, where the XGBoost algorithm was applied in both downscaling and calibration procedures. The performance of XGBoost\_DC was evaluated with two other comparative methods, in which XGBoost was only used in either downscaling (XGBoost\_Spline) or calibration (Spline\_XGBoost) process. The results showed that: 1) XGBoost\_DC achieved the best performance, as it obtained the highest accuracy and well reproduced the occurrence and the spatial distribution of precipitation during typhoon events; 2) XGBoost\_DC could capture the spatial variations of the precipitation. Although Spline\_XGBoost obtained results only slightly worse than the XGBoost\_DC, it significantly underestimated the spatial variability; and 3) the model assessment between the XGBoost\_DC and Spline\_XGBoost illustrated the essential contribution of XGBoost algorithm in downscaling process, and improved our understanding of the capability of machine learning (ML) algorithm in reproducing spatial variance of precipitation. These findings imply that our proposed downscaling-calibration scheme can be applied for generating high-resolution and high-quality precipitation extremes during typhoon events, which would benefit water and flood management, as well as other various applications in hydrological and meteorological modeling.},

Title = {A Quantitative Analysis of Socioeconomic Impacts of Sea Level Rise on the Anzali International Coastal Wetland},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1173-1181},
Abstract = {This is a two-phase study to investigate the socioeconomic impacts of the Caspian Sea Level Rise (CSLR) on Anzali International Wetland at the southern fringe of the Caspian Sea. In the first phase, a Landsat satellite image (2013) and digital elevation model (DEM) of the wetland were used to determine the areas vulnerable to the CSLR-induced flooding under four water level rise scenarios of 0.2 m, 0.6 m, 1 m, and 1.4 m. Then in the second phase, the possible effects of the CSLR on some market values of Anzali Wetland and the livelihood of the wetland-dependent communities were assessed based on the loss of agricultural and fishing products (as two main sources of livelihood for local people), as well as the loss of different land uses surrounding the wetland. According to the results, under the most optimistic CSLR scenario of 0.2 m, the wetland area will be expanded from 19,095 to 24,942 ha, while an expansion of 19,353 ha (from the current area of 19,095 ha to 38,448 ha) is expected under the most pessimistic CSLR scenario of 1.4 m. This will affect a minimum number of eight villages, including 4,518 inhabitants (under the CSLR scenario of 0.2 m) and a maximum number of 41 villages including 22,493 inhabitants (under the 1.4 CSLR scenario). These people will have to displace and move from their homes, which leads to several social ills. Depending on the severity of water level rise under various scenarios, 545, 646, 670, and 699 ha of the total area (790 ha) of fish ponds will be destructed, and total numbers of 70, 76, 83, and 93 units out of the 172 active industrial units are predicted to be inundated. In sum, the total loss values (damage to agriculture and fish farming) under the CSLR scenarios of 0.2, 0.6, 1, and 1.4 m were estimated to be \$ 63 million (USD), \$ 117 million, \$ 151 million, and \$ 184 million, respectively. Our research findings can help policy makers develop proper adaptation measures to prohibit or reduce the possible socio-economic damage caused by the CSLR in the future.},

Title = {Technology-enhanced auditing: Improving veracity and timeliness in social and environmental audits of supply chains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {258},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Social and environmental audits (SEA) in supply chains prove to be difficult: costly, administratively challenging, retrospective and often lacking veracity and timeliness. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of technology (such as blockchain, satellite imaging and others) in improving the veracity and timeliness of SEA in supply chains. We develop conceptualizations of veracity and timeliness appropriate to the SEA context. We also link veracity and timeliness to key steps in the auditing process (data collection, recording and sharing, and analysis and interpretation) and explore technology's role in these steps. We then contrast the traditional audit process to a technology-enhanced audit process and develop an organizing framework to generate a research agenda linking technology-enhanced auditing to veracity and timeliness of the audit process, and, in turn, enhancing social and environmental supply chain performance. The novelty and value of our work lie in its exploration of how technology-enhanced auditing relates to (1) issues related to scope/focus, firm motivations for SEA, and governance of the audit function, (2) three conditions under which the benefits of technology-enhanced audits are most likely, (3) the 4 V's of data (volume, variety, velocity/timeliness and veracity); and (4) possible mechanisms by which veracity and timeliness affect social and environmental performance in the supply chain.

Title = {Mangrove restoration in Vietnamese Mekong Delta during 2015-2020: Achievements and challenges},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta plays important roles in protecting coasts from soil erosion and strong waves, supplying seafood, and accumulating carbon. Despite these benefits, mangroves have been and continue to be severely damaged by the impacts of natural and socioeconomic activities. In recent years, large areas of mangrove forest have been restored through planting and other various management actions. In this study, we analyzed high-resolution WorldView-2 images to quantify changes in the mangrove forest in seven coastal provinces (Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, and Kien Giang) of the Mekong Delta from 2015 to 2020. Our study is one of the first to analyze mangrove forest change at the commune scale, the smallest official administrative unit in Vietnam, to determine the area of restored mangroves. The potentials and challenges in future mangrove restoration were also assessed by analyzing satellite imagery and field survey data. In the study area, mangrove forest area increased by 11,184 ha (approximately 2,237 ha per year) from 79,593 ha in 2015 to 90,777 ha in 2020. A total area of 16,138 ha (approximately 20.3\%) was lost due to mangrove conversion to other land uses, aquaculture activities and coastal erosion, etc., while 27,322 ha (approximately 34.1\%) was restored or newly planted during state- and NGO-funded mangrove restoration projects and programs. These results confirmed that mangrove restoration projects and programs have played a significant role in maintaining and increasing mangrove forest cover in Mekong Delta. The results can also assist managers and decision makers in mangrove restoration evaluation, and suggest analyzing WorldView-2 images to monitor mangrove restoration over time in Vietnam.},

Title = {Global trends in vegetation fractional cover: Hotspots for change in bare soil and non-photosynthetic vegetation},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {324},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Vegetation Fractional Cover (VFC) is an important indicator of the condition of the terrestrial surface of the Earth. The dynamics of bare soil (BS), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and photosynthetic vegetation (PV) fractions reveal patterns of growth, senescence, dormancy and regeneration. The dynamics also reveal trends in land cover and land use management across the globe. Analysis of satellite data has indicated increasing greenness of the land surface however the dynamics of the NPV and BS fractions are equally important indicators of many elements of ecosystem function and sustainability. In this study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of trends in VFC for the global terrestrial land surface based on a trend analysis over the period 2001-2018 using the Global Vegetation Fractional Cover Product. Trends were analysed by Mann-Kendell regressions over 18 years for each month of the year. Monthly maps of significant trend areas were aggregated to provide seasonal assessments. Areas and percentage areas of positive and negative trends were compiled for United Nations Subregions, Countries and Ecoregions. Significant negative trends in BS occurred across 20 M km2 of the terrestrial land surface. Although the areas of negative trends in BS were largest in China and India, the top 24 countries by area were widely distributed across the world. However, BS increased significantly across more than 11 M km2. Eleven of the top 24 ranked countries for area of increasing BS were in Africa. Substantial areas exhibited negative trends in NPV split between China and India where PV was increasing, and drylands in Asia and Africa where BS was increasing. Analysis of covariate factors at country scale inferred an association between significant increase in BS and long-term drought and increases in livestock populations. The positive trends in BS and negative trends in NPV are indicators of current and future risk for soil erosion, habitat change, and reduction in ecosystem health across heavily populated regions of the developing world.},

Title = {An Open Data and Citizen Science Approach to Building Resilience to Natural Hazards in a Data-Scarce Remote Mountainous Part of Nepal},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The citizen science approach has gained momentum in recent years. It can enable both experts and citizen scientists to co-create new knowledge. Better understanding of local environmental, social, and geographical contexts can help in designing appropriate plans for sustainable development. However, a lack of geospatial data, especially in the context of developing countries, often precludes context-specific development planning. This study therefore tests an innovative approach of volunteer citizen science and an open mapping platform to build resilience to natural hazards in the remote mountainous parts of western Nepal. In this study, citizen scientists and mapping experts jointly mapped two districts of Nepal (Bajhang and Bajura) using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. Remote mapping based on satellite imagery, capacity building, and mobilization of citizen scientists was performed to collect the data. These data were then uploaded to OSM and later retrieved in ArcGIS to produce a usable map that could be exploited as a reference resource for evidence-based decision-making. The collected data are freely accessible to community members as well as government and humanitarian actors, and can be used for development planning and risk reduction. By piloting in two communities of western Nepal, we found that using open data platforms for collecting and analyzing location-based data has a mutual benefit for researchers and communities. Such data could be vital in understanding the local landscape, environmental risk, and distribution of resources. Furthermore, they enable both researchers and local people to transfer technical knowledge, collect location-specific data, and use them for better decision-making.},

Abstract = {AimIn order to understand fire's impacts on vegetation dynamics, it is crucial that the distribution of fire sizes be known. We approached this distribution using a power-law distribution, which derives from self-organized criticality theory (SOC). We compute the global spatial variation in the power-law exponent and determine the main factors that explain its spatial distribution. LocationGlobal, at 2 degrees grid resolution. MethodsWe use satellite-derived MODIS burned-area data (MCD45) to obtain global individual fire size data for 2002-2010, grouped together for each 2 degrees grid. A global map of fire size distribution was produced by plotting the exponent of the power law. The drivers of the spatial trends in fire size distribution, including vegetation productivity, precipitation, population density and net income, were analysed using a generalized additive model (GAM). ResultsThe power law gave a good fit for 93\% of the global 2 degrees grid cells with important fire activity. A global map of the fire size distribution, as approached by the power law shows strong spatial patterns. These are associated both with climatic variables (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and with anthropogenic variables (cropland cover and population density). Main conclusionsOur results indicate that the global fire size distribution changes over gradients of precipitation and aridity, and that it is strongly influenced by human activity. This information is essential for understanding potential changes in fire sizes as a result of climate change and socioeconomic dynamics. The ability to improve SOC fire models by including these human and climatic factors would benefit fire projections as well as fire management and policy.},

Title = {Multilevel Thresholding Segmentation for Color Image Using Modified Moth-Flame Optimization},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {44097-44134},
Abstract = {Multilevel thresholding has got more attention in the field of image segmentation recently. However, it is still challenging and complicated for color image segmentation in many applications. To mitigate the above conditions, a novel multilevel thresholding algorithm consists of two innovative strategies is proposed on the basis of moth-flame optimization (MFO) to develop the SAMFO-TH algorithm. On one hand, a creative self-adaptive inertia weight scheme is used to enhance both the exploration and exploitation, on the other hand, a newly proposed thresholding (TH) heuristic is embedded into MFO to improve the global performance in multilevel thresholding. To find the optimal threshold values of an image, Otsu's variance, and Kapur's entropy criteria are employed as fitness functions. The experiments have been performed on ten color images including six natural images and four satellite images at different threshold levels with a comparison of other eight meta-heuristic algorithms: multi-verse optimizer (MVO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), standard MFO, and so on. The experimental results are presented in terms of computational time (CPU time), mean value to reach (MVTR), standard deviation (STD), mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), feature similarity (FSIM), probability rand index (PRI), the variation of information (VoI), and threshold value distortion (TVD). The results demonstrate that the proposed SAMFO-TH outperforms other competitive algorithms and has superiority concerning stability, accuracy, and convergence rate, which can be applied to practical engineering problems.},

Title = {Trans-disciplinary research and strategic urban expansion planning in a context of weak institutional capacity: Case study of Huambo, Angola},
Journal = {HABITAT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {244-251},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increasingly online public access to satellite imagery and the development of qualitative GIS have, in principle, the potential to provide action- and strategic planning approaches with more economical spatial information to monitor and plan physical urban transformation. This is of particular use in rapidly urbanising contexts in the global South, where lack of resources prompted the development of rapid and participatory urban appraisal techniques since the 1990s. However, in such contexts weak institutional capacity, unclear responsibilities and poor integration among key actors may still be major barriers to effective decision-making and implementation of strategic land use plans. In addition, as most urban expansion is driven by popular demand, understanding the nature of this demand has to be the basis for effective supply of urban land etc. This means exploring change in important core social and cultural values, as well as participatory engagement with key stakeholders on immediate and mid-term strategic objectives. This paper reflects on the experience of an Urban Development Priority Action Strategy being developed for the city of Huambo, Angola, by the city administration in partnership with local NGO Development Workshop (DW), with support from a European academic institution, the Centre for Environment \& Human Settlements (CEHS). This initiative seeks to embed trans-disciplinarity in a meaningfill manner at the local level to permit the identification and implementation of a realistic set of priority actions. This paper reports on the type of information and understanding that is generated through this approach, as well as on the de facto constraints and boundaries that are created by the relationships between the key stakeholders, their capacities and interests. It also illustrates the more immediate and short-term results that can be achieved through this approach in comparison with traditional master planning approaches including key stakeholder engagement with identified actions and proposal of new organisational and financial models for urban land development and management as well as highlighting the advantages of mutual knowledge exchange between praxis and research.

Title = {An Integrated Communication Technology and Social Change Typology},
Booktitle = {COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE: THEORY AND IMPLICATIONS},
Series = {LEAs Communication Series},
Year = {2007},
Pages = {283-307},
Abstract = {This volume adopted a unique approach, one that addresses various social settings-namely, home, workplace, surveillance, entertainment, consumer, and legal settings-to examine the relations between technology and social change. By presenting scholarly explications in a range of theoretical and empirical venues, we thus integrated these perspectives using conceptual themes in socially relevant contexts-rather than technology modalities-as the unit of analysis. Drawing from our various contributions, it is clear that the influence of these mediated communication technologies has been evolutionary. Newton's Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Based on this ``dual effects{''} conception, it would appear that for all of the benefits accruing from a new technology, there are likely to be countervailing negative effects. Naturally, not all predictions concerning the social consequences of mediated communication technology adoption have come to pass. Orwell's (1949) dystopian prophecies involving digital ``Big Brother{''} governments-where average citizens endure a fish bowl existence in the eye of government surveillance-provides a case in point. Instead, the rise of telematic ``technologies of freedom{''} (Poole, 1983) has actually helped undermine totalitarianism in some instances and encourage a freer flow of information across borders. At the global level, spurred by the deregulation of state-supported media monopolies and protectionist policies (Anowkwa, Lin, \& Salwen, 2003), many nations now are opening up their media systems to competition, hoping to hasten cross-media competition and convergence (see e.g., Noam, Groebel, \& Gerbarg, 2004; Pelton, 2003; Straubhaar, Burch, Guilherne Duarte, \& Sheffer, 2002). As a result, Ogan (chap. 2, this volume) notes that interactive media technologies such as the Internet are altering the one-way media domination or information flow from the industrialized to the developing nations of the yesteryear (see Dizard, 2000). Hence, there is a shift from the traditional media/cultural imperialism paradigm to the new glocalization paradigm (Robertson, 1995)-where cultural regionalism and linguistic commonality dominate how data, information, news, media, and communication content are shared, exchanged, and marketed. Moreover, just as new media technologies represent a threat to totalitarianism, they also present channels for oppositionary discourse aimed at the world's remaining superpower. As a case in point, Yahoo!, Google, and MSN have all consented to comply with the censorship rules issued by the communist Chinese government, which include stripping all references to the word democracy. Even so, Chinese bloggers have been able to circumvent the government's surveillance and system control to convey their free thoughts with the outside world. In a similar vein, the Dubai-based Arab language satellite TV network Al Jazeera regularly reports stories that overshadow the ideological hegemony and propaganda diffused by American and Arabic national media outlets on the issues of democracy, religion, and war. Although technology innovations have the potential to become the equalizer for social, political, and economic development inequities among societies, a vast digital divide that exists between the digital haves and have-nots has, nevertheless, created unprecedented information and knowledge gaps. Surprisingly, these information and knowledge gaps also exist within the borders of an information society like ours, where concerns over the digital divide are considered minimal. These information and knowledge gaps, along with other social changes, are a result of how individuals, groups, and institutions adopt and use communication and information technologies to function as part of the social system in different social settings. The section to follow outlines these avenues of social influence in the context of our various book chapters, each of which is outlined in turn.},

Title = {Identifying Opportunities to Conserve Farm Ponds on Private Lands: Integration of Social, Ecological, and Historical Data},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In some landscapes, effective conservation of wildlife habitat requires extending beyond the boundaries of reserves and addressing stewardship of private lands. This approach could be especially valuable for the conservation of farm ponds, which are abundant and serve key agricultural functions on private lands. Though farm ponds also provide wildlife habitat, little is known about how they are managed or how values and beliefs of their owners relate to their quality. To address this knowledge gap, we collected data on pond habitat quality and management using historical aerial imagery and high-resolution Google Earth satellite imagery of the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and Northern Missouri. We also collected spatially congruent social data using a mail back survey sent to 456 landowners in the region (32.7\% response rate). We used mixed-effects linear regression to link indicators of habitat quality to the survey results. We found that many ponds were permanent, accessible to cattle, in early successional states, and had little wetland vegetation, indicating a scarcity of suitable habitat for wildlife. At the same time, 35-57\% of survey respondents said they would be willing to change their management to benefit aquatic organisms. Our analyses indicated that higher cover of cattails correlated with ownership by respondents who regarded row crops or income from agriculture as less important and ponds tended to be temporary if owned by respondents who had many ponds. Moving forward, large landowners and those willing to manage their land to benefit wildlife may constitute a core set of future partners for conservation efforts focused on improving pond habitat in the region.},

Abstract = {Coastal mapping with satellite imagery is broadly used to calculate shoreline positions due to its high ecological and socioeconomic value in the context of coastal conservation and management strategies. We show the applicability of the Sentinel-1 to monitor large-scale shoreline at a country level. The present study develops a novel shoreline extraction method based on C band from SAR missions, that improves coastal ocean/land discrimination. The method considers an automated processing chain using the incorporation of GLCM-mean texture information to increase improvements in image binarization by Sauvola thresholding. Results show that the proposed method may be used for shoreline monitoring of different types of geomorphology along the Mexican coastline, thus guaranteeing its applicability in different geographic surroundings. For the six specific areas of validation, the overall agreement between binarization ranges is from 90\% to 100\% and Sentinel-2 images are used to evaluate the VV and VH shorelines from Sentinel-1.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the archaeological evaluation of 458 tiles of LiDAR collected by environmental scientists over southern Mexico using the G-LiHT system of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Specifically, this article describes the results of a full processing, inspection, and annotation of these data for the identification and baseline analysis of archaeological features. In this paper, we: 1) introduce the dataset and describe our efforts to systematically process and annotate archaeological features and 2) revisit the cultural and ecological context of the samples. The results presented here confirm some of the conclusions presented previously, including the benefit of mining large previously acquired digital data for archaeological information, the diversity of lowland settlement and features in between areas already well-documented, and the contribution to landscape archaeology of such transect samples when coupled to macro-environmental data sets. These data also fill in some details about the prehispanic Mesoamerican landscape, raising new questions about the relationship between past settlements and regional cultural, political, and ecological systems. Finally, these data offer important foundational inventories for discussing how to preserve and conserve archaeological resources across the lowlands, especially when these resources are not tied to monumental architecture.},

Title = {Dynamic of population growth and its effect on land use/land cover of bahraich district in Uttar Pradesh},

Abstract = {Studying the dynamics of land use and land cover change (LULC) is essential to the formulation of land-use policy. This study describes the spatial-temporal changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in the Bahraich district and the underlying mechanisms behind these changes. To detect the land transformation, satellite images for over 30 years (1991-2021) have been used. Five major LULC classes (agriculture, forest, water bodies, built-up area, and sand) have been taken into consideration for analyzing the land transformation. The aim of the study is to find out the level at which the LULC changes have taken place and their correlation with the population dynamism. It has been found that the population growth in the Bahraich district has a very strong correlation with LULC classes defined in this study which includes both natural and anthropogenic features. In these 30 years, natural features like waterbody (-74.01\%), fallow land (- 72.89\%), forest (- 26.20\%), and sand (- 38\%) have seen a major loss in the area coverage due to extensive anthropogenic activities. These classes are strongly correlated with human population growth with Rho values of - .963, - .947,- .983, and - .830, respectively. Other classes such as built-up and agriculture have shown a strong positive correlation with the expension of human population. The Rho values of built-up and agriculture are noted to be .982 and .986, respectively, whereas the increase in the area of land surface cover is found to be 394.57\% and 43.04\% respectively. This signifies that the geometrical progression in the human population has amplified anthropogenic activities vastly, resulting in the loss of areal extent of natural classes such as water bodies, forest, fallow land, and sand and increment in the area extent of human-induced activities such as agriculture and built-up. For the abovementioned analysis, Landsat 4-5 TM images for the year 1991 and 2007 and Landsat 8 OLI images for the year 2021 have been used. The results have shown that although the study area is rich in biodiversity, yet it has been facing escalating environmental issues due to acute land surface transformation resulting majorly due to human-induced activities. The majority of the transitions are reversible. The research area's LULC change processes are primarily influenced by socioeconomic, demographic, and proximity variables. The findings will be useful in modelling future LULC situations as a direction for land management policies.},

Abstract = {The population of Ethiopia has been facing a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Most of the people live in rural areas where healthcare service is detrimental and very poor and their accessibility to these services is abysmally low. Spatial healthcare accessibility is determined by the availability and location of healthcare facilities as well as the location of people. It can be measured by distance traveled and traveling time. This study was carried out to analyze the distribution and spatial accessibility of healthcare service centers by using Geospatial technologies in Gamo Gofa zone of SNNP (Southern Nations and Nationalities People) region, Ethiopia. Satellite data, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), road network, population data and healthcare service centers location data was used for further analysis by using AccessMod extension 4.0 to Arc GIS 9.3.1 software. 30- and 60-min traveling time were considered to analyze the accessibility by means of walking and motor vehicle as the mode of transportation. It was found that 12.62\%, 36.60\%, 29.10\% and 59\% peoples of the total population were able to access the healthcare service centers by means of 30-min walking, 60-min walking, 30min walking and motor vehicle and 60-min walking and motor vehicle respectively. Health and disease management is key to social, cultural and economic development of any society so this approach offers considerable benefit.},

Title = {A Framework for the Development, Design and Implementation of a Sustained Arctic Ocean Observing System},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Rapid Arctic warming drives profound change in the marine environment that have significant socio-economic impacts within the Arctic and beyond, including climate and weather hazards, food security, transportation, infrastructure planning and resource extraction. These concerns drive efforts to understand and predict Arctic environmental change and motivate development of an Arctic Region Component of the Global Ocean Observing System (ARCGOOS) capable of collecting the broad, sustained observations needed to support these endeavors. This paper provides a roadmap for establishing the ARCGOOS. ARCGOOS development must be underpinned by a broadly endorsed framework grounded in high-level policy drivers and the scientific and operational objectives that stem from them. This should be guided by a transparent, internationally accepted governance structure with recognized authority and organizational relationships with the national agencies that ultimately execute network plans. A governance model for ARCGOOS must guide selection of objectives, assess performance and fitness-to-purpose, and advocate for resources. A requirements-based framework for an ARCGOOS begins with the Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs) that underpin the system. SBAs motivate investments and define the system's science and operational objectives. Objectives can then be used to identify key observables and their scope. The domains of planning/policy, strategy, and tactics define scope ranging from decades and basins to focused observing with near real time data delivery. Patterns emerge when this analysis is integrated across an appropriate set of SBAs and science/operational objectives, identifying impactful variables and the scope of the measurements. When weighted for technological readiness and logistical feasibility, this can be used to select Essential ARCGOOS Variables, analogous to Essential Ocean Variables of the Global Ocean Observing System. The Arctic presents distinct needs and challenges, demanding novel observing strategies. Cost, traceability and ability to integrate region-specific knowledge have to be balanced, in an approach that builds on existing and new observing infrastructure. ARCGOOS should benefit from established data infrastructures following the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reuseable Principles to ensure preservation and sharing of data and derived products. Linking to the Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON) process and involving Arctic stakeholders, for example through liaison with the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), can help ensure success.},

Title = {Land use and cover change dynamics in Zambia's Solwezi copper mining district},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In Anthropocene, Earth's social-ecological systems are experiencing intense pressure as a result of human-induced resource over-exploitation at a magnitude never seen before. Consequently, land use and cover change (LUCC) dynamics have implications for environment through the resultant land degradation. This study focuses on understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics associated with mining activities in Zambia's Solwezi copper mining district. Landsat-5 (TM), Landsat-8 (OLI and TIRS) satellite images were classified using Supervised Classification and Maximum Likelihood Approach in ERDAS Imagine 2015 for the LUCC detection between 1995 and 2019. The images were categorized into six different classes: water body, mine, agriculture, built-up, barren and forest areas. The results show a rapid reduction of forest cover and water body from 82.32\% and 1.88\% to 54.14\% and 0.47\% in 1995 and 2019, respectively. Built-up area on the other hand increased from 2.04\% in 1995 to 4.9\% in 2019. Mine area increased from 0.02\% in 1995 to 1.43\% in 2019. Barren and agriculture areas both gradually increased from 8.24\% and 5.5\% to 19.52\% and 19.53\% in 1995 and 2019, respectively. Thus, there was progressive LUCC with increase in the mining activities in the study area. The results obtained from this study proffer lessons that will benefit policy and environmental management strategies applicable to mining-dominated landscapes. We suggest that multiple stakeholders make use of such baselines to guide conservation planning and mitigation measures in resource-rich and mining-dominated landscapes. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Agriculture is cultural heritage, and studies of agricultural spaces and practices help this heritage to be valued and protected. In the Galapagos Islands, little focus has been placed on local agricultural practices and agroforestry, despite their increasing importance for food security and invasive species management. This article discusses the possibilities for unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) high-resolution imagery in examining agricultural and agroforestry spaces, techniques, and practices. It describes and assesses an UAV-assisted participatory methodology for on-farm qualitative research that aims to investigate the visible and invisible features of farming practices. An analysis of the types of responses elicited by different methods of interviews with Galapagos farmers demonstrates how incorporating UAV data affects what we took away from the interview, and how the perceived relationship between farmer and land is reflected. Specifically, we find that when interacting with orthomosaics created from UAV images of their farms, farmers' responses reveal a greater focus on management strategies at larger spatial and temporal scales. UAV imagery thus supports studies of agricultural heritage not only by recording agricultural spaces but also by revealing agrarian knowledge and practices.},

Abstract = {We used Landsat TM imagery and GIS to quantify the rates and patterns of landscape change of two different oasis ecosystems transects - Fukang oasis and Yutian oasis in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, P. R. China. Human dimension is a major disturbance agent throughout the area and desert-oasis ecotone is also important. Maximum likelihood classification of satellite imagery identified landscape class types and changes among the landscape mosaics in two transects. Rate and pattern of the spatial and temporal of landscape change in two oases agricultural landscapes were detected at class and landscape level. The resulting landscape changes have a multitude of consequences; for agricultural production, landscape aesthetics, recreational and amenity values of the landscape, and for biodiversity. Results show that further intensification of the intensively managed landscape has led to an increasingly homogeneous, large-scale landscape featuring fewer boundaries. hi contrast, reduced management in the oasis-farm system has resulted in an increasingly heterogeneous, small-scale landscape. The main pattern and key factors of dynamic changes of oasis-desert heterogeneity with frequent human's activities especially land use were discussed. Because land use changes are triggered by socioeconomic forces in two oases, a through comprehension of historical change will enhance our capability to predict future landscape dynamics and devise effective landscape management strategies.},

Abstract = {Open biomass burning (OBB) has significant impacts on air pollution, climate change and potential human health. OBB has gathered wide attention but with little focus on the annual variation of pollutant emission. Central and eastern China (CEC) is one of the most polluted regions in China. This study aims to provide a state-of-the-art estimation of the pollutant emissions from OBB in CEC from 2003 to 2015, by adopting the satellite observation dataset - the burned area product (MCD64Al) and the active fire product (MCD14 ML) - along with local biomass data (updated biomass loading data and high-resolution vegetation data) and local emission factors. The successful adoption of the double satellite dataset for long-term estimation of pollutants from OBB with a high spatial resolution can support the assessing of OBB on regional air quality, especially for harvest periods or dry seasons. It is also useful to evaluate the effects of annual OBB management policies in different regions. Here, monthly emissions of pollutants were estimated and allocated into a 1 x 1 km spatial grid for four types of OBB including grassland, shrubland, forest and cropland. From 2003 to 2015, the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning had an annual fluctuation, whereas the emissions from crop straw burning steadily increased. The cumulative emissions of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), methane (CH4), nitric oxide (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and fine particles (PM2.5) were 3.64 x 10(3), 2.87 x 10(2), 3.05 x 10(3), 1.82 x 10(3), 6.4 x 10(3), 2.12 x 10(2), 4.67 x 10(2), 4.59 x 10(4), 9.39 x 10(5) and 4.13 x 10(3) Gg in these years, respectively. Crop straw burning was the largest contributor for all pollutant emissions, by 84 \%-96 \%. For the forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning, forest fire burning emissions contributed the most, and emissions from grassland fire were negligible due to little grass coverage in this region. High pollutant emissions concentrated in the connection area of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui, with emission intensity higher than 100 tons per square kilometer, which was related to the frequent agricultural activities in these regions. Peak emission of pollutants occurred during summer and autumn harvest periods including May, June, September and October, during which similar to 50\% of the total pollutant emissions were emitted in these months. This study highlights the importance of controlling the crop straw burning emissions. From December to March, the crop residue burning emissions decreased, while the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland exhibited their highest values, leading to another small peak in emissions of pollutants. Obvious regional differences in seasonal variations of OBB were observed due to different local biomass types and environmental conditions. Rural population, agricultural output, economic levels, local burning habits, social customs and management policies were all influencing factors for OBB emissions.},

Abstract = {Purpose The use of technology has remained a staple in modern day industry because it creates an enabling environment, which promotes innovation that has propelled globalization. Maritime and tourism are two such critical sectors that have benefited from such technology and stand to benefit more in light of the fourth industrial revolution. The handcart has been used by humans for centuries as a mode of transportation. It has remained relevant to this day, more so a positive contributor to public market experience in developing countries. Notwithstanding, this phenomenon remained largely under-explored and informal with little to no integration in the planning of public markets or market districts. As such, little study or research exists to inform policies to improve and integrate the handcart profession in the overall planning and rejuvenation of downtown Kingston, Jamaica. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to understand the characteristics and benefits of the handcart logistics by investigating the socioeconomic and spatial dynamics surrounding the operations of this mode of transportation. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to completely grasp the complexity of factors that influence and sustain the handcart trade within the coronation market as well as its contribution to Jamaica's economy. Collection of data was achieved via the administration of questionnaires supported by observations and interviews. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used along with satellite images to integrate spatial representations in the analysis and discussions of results. Findings Consistent with the reviewed literature, the results and analyses revealed that, despite the handcart's informality and inadequate infrastructural support, handcarts are generally perceived as beneficial to market districts. They fill the transportation gaps where formal governance operations failed and contribute to the local economy by providing employment for low-skilled persons. The handcart industry has been sustained because of the need for the service by mostly vendors and shoppers but more so because of the economic benefits that have been accrued by builders, owners and operators. Originality/value The handcart system is a prominent feature of market districts in Jamaica and, as such, this research bears high levels of significance because it can be replicated or used as a basis to inform handcart policies and the design to improve logistics in any tourism destination. The research serves as a body of knowledge to ``all and sundry{''} because it unearthed some of the handcart's attributes and contribution to the local economy, can contribute to adequate layout of Market districts by government to incorporate the handcart system, facilitate their integration in cultural and community tourism and facilitate the handcart trade being viewed by society as a profession. At the advent of this Fourth Industrial Revolution, an upgraded design of the handcart may appear.},

Title = {Nature-based solutions for urban landscapes under post-industrialization and globalization: Barcelona versus Shanghai},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {272-283},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Using Barcelona and Shanghai as case studies, we examined the nature-based solutions (NBS) in urban settings specifically within cities experiencing post-industrialization and globalization. Our specific research questions are: (1) What are the spatiotemporal changes in urban built-up land and green space in Barcelona and Shanghai? (2) What are the relationships between economic development, exemplified by post-industrialization, globalization, and urban green space? Urban land use and green space change were evaluated using data derived from a variety of sources, including satellite images, landscape matrix indicators, and a land conversion matrix. The relationships between economic development, globalization, and environmental quality were analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling based on secondary statistical data. Both Barcelona and Shanghai have undergone rapid urbanization, with urban expansion in Barcelona beginning in the 1960s-1970s and in Shanghai in the last decade. While Barcelona's urban green space and green space per capita began declining between the 1950s and 1990s, they increased slightly over the past two decades. Shanghai, however, has consistently and significantly improved urban green space and green space per capita over the past six decades, especially since the economic reform in 1978. Economic development has a direct and significant influence on urban green space for both cities and post-industrialization had served as the main driving force for urban landscape change in Barcelona and Shanghai. Based on secondary statistical and qualitative data from on-site observations and interviews with local experts, we highlighted the institution's role in NBS planning. Furthermore, aspiration to become a global or globalizing city motivated both cities to use NBS planning as a place-making tool to attract global investment, which is reflected in various governing policies and regulations. The cities' effort to achieve a higher status in the global city hierarchy may have contributed to the increase in total green space and urban green per capita. In addition, various institutional shifts, such as land property rights in a market economy vs. a transitional economy, may also have contributed to the differences in efficiency when expanding urban green space in Barcelona and Shanghai.},

Title = {Reductions in NO2 burden over north equatorial Africa from decline in biomass burning in spite of growing fossil fuel use, 2005 to 2017},

Abstract = {Socioeconomic development in low- and middle-income countries has been accompanied by increased emissions of air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides {[}NOx: nitrogen dioxide (NO2) + nitric oxide (NO)], which affect human health. In sub-Saharan Africa, fossil fuel combustion has nearly doubled since 2000. At the same time, landscape biomass burning-another important NOx source-has declined in north equatorial Africa, attributed to changes in climate and anthropogenic fire management. Here, we use satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and burned area to identify NO2 trends and drivers over Africa. Across the northern ecosystems where biomass burning occurs-home to hundreds of millions of people-mean annual tropospheric NO2 VCDs decreased by 4.5\% from 2005 through 2017 during the dry season of November through February. Reductions in burned area explained the majority of variation in NO2 VCDs, though changes in fossil fuel emissions also explained some variation. Over Africa's biomass burning regions, raising mean GDP density (USD.km(-2)) above its lowest levels is associated with lower NO2 VCDs during the dry season, suggesting that economic development mitigates net NO2 emissions during these highly polluted months. In contrast to the traditional notion that socioeconomic development increases air pollutant concentrations in low- and middle-income nations, our results suggest that countries in Africa's northern biomass-burning region are following a different pathway during the fire season, resulting in potential air quality benefits. However, these benefits may be lost with increasing fossil fuel use and are absent during the rainy season.},

Abstract = {Biotic mixing, where introduced and native species mix into a newly formed ecosystem, is an increasing phenomenon worldwide. It particularly affects islands, where the number of introduced plants often exceeds native ones, and where invasive alien species are one of the main threats to terrestrial biodiversity. The mangrove tree species Rhizophora stylosa, first introduced in French Polynesia (South Pacific) in the early 1930s, is now well established and found in nearly all the inhabited islands of the Society archipelago (Bora Bora, Huahine, Moorea, Raiatea, Tahaa, Tahiti). It forms dense thickets on coastal habitats and estuaries, and gradually colonizes native tidal grassland marshes and nearshore rocky habitats. In order to assess its current expansion, we mapped its distribution from satellite images interpretation and ground-truthing fieldwork. Results indicate that mangroves currently cover a total of 41 ha in the Society Islands. Expansion rate seems relatively slow, particularly in Moorea where only 2.8\% of the coastline is colonized over 90 years after its introduction. A preliminary study of the socio-cultural perception of mangroves was undertaken through an online questionnaire sent to local stakeholders and NGOs. It revealed that although more than 70\% of the respondents recognized R. stylosa as an introduced species, 40\% considered that it had positive impacts and only 20\% that it was a harmful species. A more detailed ecological and socio-economical cost-benefit analysis is still needed to provide clearer conclusions on the invasive status of mangroves in the Society Islands, and the most appropriate management strategies to be implemented by local authorities in collaboration with island communities.},

Title = {Residential greenness and mortality in oldest-old women and men in China: a longitudinal cohort study},

Abstract = {Background Exposure to natural vegetation, or greenness, might affect health through several pathways, including increased physical activity and social engagement, improved mental health, and reductions in exposure to air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Few studies of the effects of greenness have focused on Asia, and, to the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the effect on vulnerable oldest-old populations. We assessed the association between residential greenness and mortality in an older cohort in China. Methods We used five waves (February, 2000-October, 2014) of the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), a prospective cohort representative of the general older population in China. We assessed exposure to greenness through satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in the 250 m and 1250 m radius around the residential address for each individual included in the study. We calculated contemporaneous NDVI values, cumulative NDVI values, and changes in NDVI from the start of the study over time. The health outcome of the study was all-cause mortality, excluding accidental deaths. Mortality rate ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, geographical region, childhood and adult socioeconomic status, social and leisure activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Findings Among 23 754 individuals (mean age at baseline 93 years {[}SD 7.5]) totaling 80 001 person-years, we observed 18 948 deaths during 14 years of follow-up, between June, 2000, and December, 2014. Individuals in the highest quartile of contemporaneous NDVI values had 27\% lower mortality than those in the lowest quartile for the 250 m radius (hazard ratio {[}HR] 0.73, 95\% CI 0.70-0.76), and 30\% lower mortality for the 1250 m radius (0.70, 0.67-0.74). No clear association was observed for cumulative NDVI measurements and mortality. We did not detect an association between area-level changes in NDVI and mortality. Interpretation Our research suggests that proximity to more green space is associated with increased longevity, which has policy implications for the national blueprint of ecological civilisation and preparation for an ageing society in China.

Title = {Planning renewable energy in rural areas: Impacts on occupation and land use},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {155},
Pages = {630-640},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Reflecting on the role of rural areas in the 21st century is, nowadays, a central theme in the important debate on the long-term renewable energy development. It is the case that while cities demonstrate an ever-growing pattern of energy consumption, rural areas keep themselves as almost low-density territories and with the greatest potential of renewable energy sources. This means a new smart specialization of rural areas as green energy exporters to fuel urban areas, providing effective and long-lasting answers to the climate change, the reduction of energy dependency and respective social, economic and environmental impacts. Nevertheless, the implementation of renewable energy sources requires safeguarding the balance between occupation and land use and, at the same time, preservation and respect for the environmental, cultural and scenic values of these privileged territories. The present paper describes the first stage of an exploratory empirical study on the various impacts caused by the implementation of different renewable energy sources in rural areas. With reference to the County of Loures in Portugal, factors and geographical determinants, underlying the localization of recently implemented photovoltaic power plants and wind farms, have been identified. The level 5 Corine Land Cover 2007 datasets and satellite images have been used along with the information collected during on-site field work. The delimitation of infrastructure areas associated with renewable energy production, has enabled an understanding of the changes in land occupation over the time period of a decade and how these aspects are linked to the spatial dimensions of planning and land management. The results obtained demonstrate the emergence of a functional dichotomy between the preservation of lands with strong agricultural potential and the massive expansion of renewable energy production across rural areas. This allows us to understand how the implementation of renewable energy sources is ever more linked to the local decision-making process associated with spatial planning. The role that municipalities can play in the definition of strategies to ensure an efficient, balanced and sustainable renewable energy zoning in rural areas will therefore be crucial.

Abstract = {This paper deals with the impact of IoT on the human society that produces opportunities for exciting innovations. IoT impacts ethical and social aspects towards human society, as individuals and as community, operational and global aspects towards the technical systems. It is a generator of individual and collective advantages that can be expropriated or inhibited for the benefit just a few individuals or groups. IoT must comply with the social right to a no-fake information and so must be protected globally by international laws and policies. Without invading the individual privacy IoT can provide to each person controlled automata, robosats (robot satellites), as extension of the personal sphere of action. It contributes to the globalization as a planetary complex of connected services where the reference system has to be the human society. This paper deals with the prospective impact of IoT on the utilization of electrical energy that can allow an epochal evolution in the structure/operation of power systems and facilitate an efficient constitution of the electrical microgrids. The interaction of the electrical equipment requires their ``socialization{''} that is their improved integration by a revision of their load profiles and behaviors as much as possible.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to analysis of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) for anticipating the effect of oil spills on the environment in coastal areas. The study location is the coastal area and waters of the Karas District, Fakfak Regency, West Papua Province, Indonesia. The purpose of the study is to determine the priority of areas that are sensitive to oil spills. This method was carried out by scoring each unit of land based on vulnerability, conservation, and social values. ESI Analysis was carried out through geographic information systems and classified into 5 classes of sensitivity levels. The land use classification was carried out through satellite imagery and field surveys conducted in December 2018. The results of resource classification can be divided into 16 classes. The ESI analysis showed that most (51\%) were categorized as insensitive, sensitive low 24\%, very sensitive 15\%, moderately sensitive 6\%, and sensitive 4\%. Although most are not sensitive, it should be followed by effective environmental protection to maintain sustainable development.},

Title = {Vegetation EVI changes and response to natural factors and human activities based on geographically and temporally weighted regression},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The research on vegetation changes plays a crucial role in the assessment of ecosystem health, monitoring environmental changes, providing early warnings for natural disasters, and supporting decision-making for sustainable development. However, understanding the nonstationary characteristics of drivers affecting vegetation change remains challenging. This study used Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data obtained through Google Earth Engine (GEE), Theil-Sen, and Mann-Kendall methods to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns and trends of vegetation changes in Sichuan, western China from 2000 to 2020. The Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression (GTWR) method was applied to deal with spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously. Results showed that vegetation cover in Sichuan was good overall, with medium and high vegetation covering more than 78\% of the area. About 72.75\% of the area showed an increasing trend in vegetation cover, and areas with extremely significant and significant EVI growth (p < 0.01 and 0.01 \& LE; p < 0.05) accounted for 23.94\% of the total area. The areas with significant increases in vegetation EVI were mainly distributed in northeast, east, southeast, central, and southwest in Sichuan, while the areas with significant decreases were mainly distributed in the central Sichuan plain urban agglomeration and western Sichuan plateau. GTWR addressed the nonstationary effect of the temporal dimension on the drivers of natural and human activities, with a fitted R2 of 0.846. The study identified climate, terrain, and human activities as the primary driving factors behind vegetation EVI fluctuations. Annual average temperature and precipitation, human activities, and slope had a positive impact on vegetation EVI changes, while solar radiation and aspect had a negative inhibitory effect. The effects of climate, terrain, and human activities on EVI changes exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity and clustering, resulting in either positive promotion or negative inhibition. This study provides an additional methodology to solve the nonstationary problem of vegetation change trends and their response mechanisms. The revealed changes in vegetation EVI and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristics of their driving factors are important for fragile ecosystems to adapt to and mitigate the effects of natural changes and human activities. Revealing the variations in vegetation EVI and their underlying drivers can showcase diverse characteristics across regions and time periods, the presence of spatiotemporal heterogeneity holds great significance in},

Abstract = {Rapid population growth, economic development, land-use modifications, and climate change are the major driving forces of growing hydrological disasters like floods and water stress. Reliable flood modelling is challenging due to the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation intensity, duration and frequency, heterogeneity in temperature rise and land-use changes. Reliable high-resolution precipitation data and distributed hydrological model can solve the problem. This study aims to develop a distributed hydrological model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simulate streamflow extremes from satellite-based high-resolution climate data. Four widely used bias correction methods were compared to select the best method for downscaling coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) global climate model (GCMs) simulations. A novel ML-based distributed hydrological model was developed for modelling runoff from the corrected satellite rainfall data. Finally, the model was used to project future changes in runoff and streamflow extremes from the downscaled GCM projected climate. The Johor River Basin (JRB) in Malaysia was considered as the case study area. The distributed hydrological model developed using ML showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.96 and 0.78 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.01 and 5.64 during calibration and validation. The simulated flow analysis using the model showed that the river discharge would increase in the near future (2020-2059) and the far future (2060-2099) for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The largest change in river discharge would be for SSP-585. The extreme rainfall indices, such as Total Rainfall above 95th Percentile (R95TOT), Total Rainfall above 99th Percentile (R99TOT), One day Max Rainfall (R x 1day), Five-day Max Rainfall (R x 5day), and Rainfall Intensity (RI), were projected to increase from 5\% for SSP-119 to 37\% for SSP-585 in the future compared to the base period. The results showed that climate change and socio-economic development would cause an increase in the frequency of streamflow extremes, causing larger flood events.},

Abstract = {With shrinking budgets and expanding program costs, government program offices are seeking innovative ways to accomplish their goals with better efficiency and less cost. In 2008, the U. S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center's Development Planning Directorate (SMC/XRF) took a bold step in this direction and funded a new program that started as an unsolicited proposal from SES Government Solutions, and its industry teammates, Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The program called for hosting of an Air Force furnished infrared sensor, developed by SAIC, on an SES commercial communications satellite, built by Orbital, and was appropriately referred to as CHIRP (Commercially Hosted Infra-Red Payload). This bold new effort has been a resounding success and has stimulated a whole new market area for hosted payloads that is now germinating throughout the aerospace industry. The concept of a staring sensor using large format focal plane arrays began as a risk reduction program by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Under that program (the Alternate InfraRed Satellite System (AIRSS) or Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) program), SAIC developed a laboratory model of a full-earth, four-telescope staring Overhead Persistent InfraRed (OPIR) sensor for ground validation. For the CHIRP contract, but under the 3GIRS umbrella, SAIC designed and developed a space-qualified, one-quarter earth, single OPIR staring telescope for a technical demonstration in space. The satellite was built by Orbital Sciences as part of an existing commercial contract with SES. The sensor and satellite efforts were leveraged by the CHIRP program, integrating the government furnished equipment (GFE) sensor with the commercial SES-2 telecommunications satellite. The CHIRP program uses contractor ground system facilities and mission operations teams to operate and evaluate the CHIRP system, including sensor commanding, state-of-health monitoring, sensor calibration and characterization, and tracking algorithm assessment on the ground using on-orbit data. The satellite is operated by SES through its commercial satellite operations center (SOC). By design, CHIRP operations are completely independent of spacecraft operations except for initial deployments and CHIRP power on/off activities. Sensor commands are generated at SAIC's CHIRP Mission Analysis Center (CMAC) in Seal Beach, California, transmitted through Orbital's CHIRP Mission Operations Center (CMOC) in Dulles, Virginia, and uplinked to the spacecraft by the SES-operated teleport in Woodbine, Maryland. The CHIRP mission data is transmitted from the CHIRP payload through an Orbital-developed Secondary Payload Interface (SPI) on the spacecraft, where it is encrypted and transmitted to the ground through one of the commercial transponders. The ground entry point for the CHIRP data is a SES teleport, which transmits the data to the CMOC for dissemination in real-time to the CMAC and the U. S. Air Force's Advanced Fusion Center (AFC). The CMOC and CMAC are accredited to handle collateral classified data, while the SES facilities are commercial entities with no access to classified data. The CHIRP program is a truly ground breaking, but like many early endeavors had to overcome challenges along the way. However, at the end of the day, the CHIRP team: a) Space-qualified a ground-breaking wide-field-of-wiew (WFOV), OPIR sensor designed and developed by SAIC in two years on the 3GIRS program; b) Integrated the payload onto a commercial communications satellite platform, including all payload accommodations for heat, power, and commanding, and tested the payload within the commercial integration and testing (I\&T) flow; c) Launched and flew the sensor in space a little over three years from the start of the contract; d) Demonstrated the agility and flexibility of the commercially hosted payload concept, which included accommodating a payload development within commercial schedules; e) Delivered a sensor to orbit that was operational and performing its mission two days before the satellite arrived at its operational orbital location and within 24 hours of removal of the baffle cover; f) Proved that classified systems can be operated as a commercially hosted payload; and g) Showed that high quality commercial buses can support demanding optical missions. The CHIRP program uncovered and resolved several hosted payload-related challenges and pioneered solutions for future hosted payloads in areas ranging from contracts to space policy, weight/power/thermal accommodations, security and cultural differences between the commercial and government environments. The main take-away from this unique program is that by working closely together, with a common goal, both government and industry can benefit greatly from the hosted payload model.},

Abstract = {Ten per cent of Europe's roads are congested on a daily basis and mobility demands continue to grow together with the pressure on national budgets to build or scale up roads. In addition, road transport is a significant source of CO2 emissions. A new strategy is needed to pass from ``road saturation{''} to ``network fluidity{''}: balancing traffic to eliminate congestion, increasing the net value of externalities (e.g., socioeconomic benefits), improving the fairness of cost-sharing (e.g., new pay-per-use road pricing initiatives). While Electronic Fee Collection solutions have traditionally been implemented using manned or partially automated toll gates, free flow options are now available to cities, regions, countries and road operators. In this context, GNSS solutions play a key role, since they do not require an infrastructure, are flexible, and have proven to be the enabling technology for new nationwide road pricing schemes. When road pricing strategies are applied to specific vehicle types (e. g. Heavy Goods Vehicles ``HGVs{''}) in large road networks, or when tolling systems are extended to different road classes (e. g. first class roads or all roads), the advantages of GNSS solutions in terms of cost-benefit ratio are maximised. In addition, GNSS enables a holistic approach to the road network optimisation: operators and public authorities have in fact the flexibility to charge by time, distance or the number of times the vehicle crosses the boundary of the toll area, realising innovative mobility management. The schemes can be adapted easily and dynamically as new roads are added or new mobility problems appear (e. g., large events). These systems, currently based on GPS, can now be enhanced by Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in US and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. EGNOS Open Signal is officially operative since October 2009 and is already successfully used in some professional application, as precision agriculture. In addition, the EC is committed to have the Safety of Life service certified for use in the aviation sector, before the end of the year 2010. EGNOS can enhance road pricing systems based on GNSS. In fact EGNOS provides increased accuracy over GPS (e. g., a meter-level accuracy could solve disambiguation among parallel roads or, under certain conditions, also among parallel lanes) and could offer a ``guaranteed position{''} (obtained as exploitation for the EGNOS integrity information). This means that EGNOS can help reducing incorrect charging and increasing trust in the system. Moreover, thanks to EDAS (EGNOS Data Access Service), EGNOS corrections are available (e. g, via cellular network) also in difficult environments, such as urban canyons. In addition, Galileo will offer several advantages over current GPS to a ``liability critical{''} service like road pricing: increased availability (a new constellation interoperable with GPS will improve visibility in urban canyons); increased accuracy (allowing lane detection), stronger resistance against interference and reflections faster Time To First Fix; service guarantees and liability acceptance due to authentication and to the ``subscription{''} nature of the future Galileo Commercial service. The EC and the GSA are supporting the full exploitation of EGNOS and Galileo potential to accelerate in Europe the passage from ``road saturation{''} to the ``network fluidity{''} paradigm by means of: Identification and analysis of applications requirements in road pricing initiatives favourable to GNSS Cost-Benefit Analysis to quantify the cost-efficiency advantage Field trials to demonstrate the EGNOS benefits R\&D projects to fill the gaps and leverage on the EGNOS/Galileo's differentiators (e.g., integrity, authentication) Awareness campaign, at different decision levels (e. g., national authorities, road operators), to increase knowledge of the GNSS potential. Policy developments in the frame of the EC strategy to fight climate change and provide better mobility conditions to citizens. The current results of these actions are presented hereafter, explaining the activities under development and the next steps.},

Abstract = {Mechanistic models suggest that individuals' memories could shape home range patterns and dynamics, and how neighbors share space. In social species, such dynamics of home range overlap may be affected by the pre-dispersal memories of immigrants. We tested this ``immigrant knowledge hypothesis{''} in a wild population of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We predicted that overlap dynamics with a given neighboring troop's home range should reflect males' adaptive interests in overlap when the alpha male had immigrated from this neighboring troop but less so when the alpha male originated from elsewhere. We used data collected between 2005 and 2013 on two neighboring troops in Namibia, comprising GPS records of daily ranges, male natal origins, daily females' reproductive status, and a satellite index of vegetation growth. We found support for our prediction in line with male reproductive strategies but not in line with foraging conditions. In periods with a higher relative number of fertile females over adult males in the focal troop, male baboons would benefit from reducing overlap with their neighbors to mitigate the costs of between-troop mating competition. This was indeed observed but only when the alpha male of the focal troop was an immigrant from that neighboring troop, and not with alpha males of other origins, presumably due to their different knowledge of the neighboring troop. Our findings highlight the role of reproductive competition in the range dynamics of social groups, and suggest that spatial segregation between groups could increase through the combination of dispersal and memory. Our study suggests immigrant male baboons influence their new troop's movements away from their natal troop to reduce mating competition. Specifically, immigrant alpha males influence their new troop to avoid their natal troop's range when their new troop contains more fertile females. This is likely to reduce the risk of extra-group copulations and the arrival of new male immigrants. Male knowledge and dispersal thus act to increase, rather than reduce, spatial segregation between groups.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) datasets are critical to understanding the global water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles and benefit extensive societal applications. However, individual sources of SM data (e.g., in situ and satellite observations, reanalysis, offline land surface model simulations, Earth system model ESM - simulations) have source-specific limitations and biases related to the spatiotemporal continuity, resolutions, and modeling and retrieval assumptions. Here, we developed seven global, gap-free, long-term (1970-2016), multilayer (0-10, 10-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) SM products at monthly 0.5 degrees resolution (available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13661312.v1; Wang and Mao, 2021) by synthesizing a wide range of SM datasets using three statistical methods (unweighted averaging, optimal linear combination, and emergent constraint). The merged products outperformed their source datasets when evaluated with in situ observations (mean bias from 0.044 to 0.033m(3) m(-3), root mean square errors from 0.076 to 0.104m(3) m(-3), Pearson correlations from 0.35 to 0.67) and multiple gridded datasets that did not enter merging because of insufficient spatial, temporal, or soil layer coverage. Three of the new SM products, which were produced by applying any of the three merging methods to the source datasets excluding the ESMs, had lower bias and root mean square errors and higher correlations than the ESM-dependent merged products. The ESM-independent products also showed a better ability to capture historical large-scale drought events than the ESM-dependent products. The merged products generally showed reasonable temporal homogeneity and physically plausible global sensitivities to observed meteorological factors, except that the ESM-dependent products underestimated the low-frequency temporal variability in SM and overestimated the high-frequency variability for the 50-100 cm depth. Based on these evaluation results, the three ESM-independent products were finally recommended for future applications because of their better performances than the ESM-dependent ones. Despite uncertainties in the raw SM datasets and fusion methods, these hybrid products create added value over existing SM datasets because of the performance improvement and harmonized spatial, temporal, and vertical coverages, and they provide a new foundation for scientific investigation and resource management.},

Abstract = {To promote and sustain excellent vaccination coverage, while preserving the key core values of ethics, truth, transparency and trust, the vaccine community should adopt modern digital communication strategies. This article summarizes our views-as experts in multidisciplinary field of vaccinology (consisting of an anthropologist, a public health policy advisor, a vaccine industry expert, a health care journalist and a practicing physician)-which were presented at a satellite symposium held at the 33rd European Society of Paediatric Infectious Disease conference in Leipzig, Germany, in May 2015. This article aims to suggest and recommend strategies to promote vaccination awareness, and highlight proactive measures for building, maintaining and enhancing trust in vaccination through innovative communication and evidence-based interaction with the end user. We believe that converting the results of vaccine research into a successful vaccination program, and replacing misinformation with evidence-based communication, will require a multidisciplinary approach that embraces modern digital and tailored applications to reach out to all populations.},

Title = {Is there sustainability for ``satellite{''} ornamental fishing regions? A case study of Guama River basin- Para -Brasil},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Ornamental fisheries and socio-economic aspects of fishermen in the major fishing regions in Brazil such as the Xingu River have been well studied. However, there is lack of information about the sustainability of ``satellites{''} (auxiliary) fishing areas, which contribute towards supplying fish for exportation centers as Belem, the Capital of Para state-Brazil. The ornamental fishery in the Guama River basin is an example of an important activity that supports the families along the river, but it has low social returns and its sustainability is consequently in jeopardy without government aid. We collected fish samples and environmental data to evaluate the market chain aspects, fishery tools and techniques, fish handling and environmental issues of the region. We observed a reduction in numbers of families involved in the ornamental fishery over time. The intensification of anthropogenic impacts reduced the environmental integrity degree of fishing sites have resulted in lower fish diversity. The fishery was characterized by capture of a limited number of loricariids fish where the small ones are preferred. Thus the fishing is more selective and consequently an environmental issue. Economically, income is directly associated to the exportation market, consequently the US dollars value influences the species and quantity of the traded fish. Most of the fishermen work on an informal basis and have no intention to continue in this activity due to the low profits reflected by presence of middlemen which concentrates the profit. Therefore, without a management plan for improvement of fishing, environmental and fish quality, the activity presents risks of unsustainability. Suggestions to ensure the perpetuation of this activity are discussed.},

Title = {Assessment of human impacts on vegetation in built-up areas in China based on AVHRR, MODIS and DMSP\_OLS nighttime light data, 1992-2010},

Abstract = {Since the reform and opening-up program started in 1978, the level of urbanization has increased rapidly in China. Rapid urban expansion and restructuring have had significant impacts on the ecological environment especially within built-up areas. In this study, ArcGIS 10, ENVI 4.5, and Visual FoxPro 6.0 were used to analyze the human impacts on vegetation in the built-up areas of 656 Chinese cities from 1992 to 2010. Firstly, an existing algorithm was refined to extract the boundaries of the built-up areas based on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP\_OLS) nighttime light data. This improved algorithm has the advantages of high accuracy and speed. Secondly, a mathematical model (Human impacts (HI)) was constructed to measure the impacts of human factors on vegetation during rapid urbanization based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. HI values greater than zero indicate relatively beneficial effects while values less than zero indicate proportionally adverse effects. The results were analyzed from four aspects: the size of cities (metropolises, large cities, medium-sized cities, and small cities), large regions (the eastern, central, western, and northeastern China), administrative divisions of China (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities) and vegetation zones (humid and semi-humid forest zone, semi-arid steppe zone, and arid desert zone). Finally, we discussed how human factors impacted on vegetation changes in the built-up areas. We found that urban planning policies and developmental stages impacted on vegetation changes in the built-up areas. The negative human impacts followed an inverted' U' shape, first rising and the falling with increase of urban scales. China's national policies, social and economic development affected vegetation changes in the built-up areas. The findings can provide a scientific basis for municipal planning departments, a decision-making reference for government, and scientific guidance for sustainable development in China.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT DECISION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {491-511},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and empirically test the theory that new industry entrants hold advantages over incumbents in the shift from unidirectional to multi-directional revenue streams. Design/methodology/approach - Using a Cobb-Douglas production function, modified to isolate returns to innovation, the authors examine data from three separate contexts: steamships on Western US rivers (1810-1860), satellite-based internet services (1962-2010) and food waste recycling (1995-2015). Findings - The results reveal that while incumbents often attempt to stretch existing technologies to fit emerging circumstances, entrepreneurial innovators achieve greater success by approaching multi-directional value creation as a distinct challenge, one requiring new technologies, organizational forms and business models. Existing theories have primarily attributed incumb ent inertia to a firm's inability perceive and pursue radical innovations, the results also suggest that existing firms are unwilling to pursue innovations that are likely to erode the marginal profitability of their respective business models. Ironically, rather than protecting incumbents' financial interests, the authors find that ``marginal reasoning{''} can lead to diminished performance and even extinction. Research limitations/implications - The proposed framework and empirical findings have implications for numerous multi-directional frontiers, including: social networking, commercial space travel, distance education and medical treatments using nanoscale technologies. Practical implications - While incumbents often lament the destabilizing effects of multi-directionality, new and small firms enjoy a compelling array of entry points and opportunities. Originality/value - Scholars, incumbent firms and start-ups both benefit from insights stemming from the novel formulation of multi-directionality challenges and opportunities.},

Abstract = {Traditional fire practices in Australia's deserts may have created mosaics of post-fire seral stages that benefitted some plants and animals. Managing fire to emulate the patterns produced by traditional burning practices is a common objective in contemporary conservation planning in Australia's deserts. However, the extent to which traditional burning in deserts affected fire regimes across space and time is contested. We aim to contribute to knowledge about the impacts of traditional burning on fire patterns in the Great Sandy Desert, northwest Australia. Our study covered the traditional lands of the Karajarri people, where some families were living a traditional lifestyle on Country until the 1960s. We analysed high-quality aerial photographs taken over 18,000 km(2) of Karajarri Country in the 1940s. Fire footprints up to several years old were mapped from these images, and their spatial characteristics were compared to those of contemporary fire regimes over the same area, visualised using high-resolution Sentinel satellite imagery. Fires in the 1940s (considered traditional) were more numerous but much smaller than contemporary (2016-2020) fires. The areal extent of recently burnt areas was smaller and the fire frequency was lower in the 1940s. Contemporary fire patterns around cultural sites differed little from fire patterns elsewhere in the landscape, possibly because people were burning over large areas rather than only at localised sites. Our study suggests that Karajarri influenced fire patterns at a landscape scale in the Great Sandy Desert, at least during periods of average rainfall. The findings are helping Karajarri refine fire management goals, for example, by informing the size and dispersion of future burns, and supporting community discussion about fire and culture. Fire management outcomes for plants and animals are being tracked with a biodiversity monitoring program.},

Title = {An analysis of the human activities impact on water quantity in the Jequitinhonha Valley, MG/Brazil},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},

Pages = {383-393},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the changes of the characteristics of the study area caused by human influence and the reduction of flow rates with time, in Agua Limpa stream basin, Jequitinhonha Valley of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Design/ methodology/ approach - The study area is a typical arid zone in the northeast of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Field observations, collection and analyses of precipitation, evaporation, temperature and flow rate data were the main approaches used in this study. The data cover the last 50 years, including aerial photographs and satellite images of different dates. The stream flow rate has decreased in the region of the Jequitinhonha valley in the last decades, in particular during draught periods (base flows), with serious social-economic and environmental consequences. The increase in stream intermittence is responsible for rural exodus to other parts of the country, mainly to Sao Paulo state. The study presented provides decision makers with important information that can assist them in making objective decisions relational this problem. Findings - The research shows that the forest cover has declined, the agricultural and pasture cover have decreased and the deforestation areas have grown. These changes resulted in a spatially diverse landscape with implications in the flow rate, and consequently, in the social-economic condition of the region considering the high rate of emigration. Practical implications - The expected results of this study will be of great importance, because the clarification of the factors addressed in this project will allow progress in the understanding of the reduction of flow rates.

Abstract = {In the developed or developing economies, the infrastructure systems and their effective and reliable operation is a pre-requisite for delivery of services for HVAC and building systems including associated energy, mobility, water, sanitation, and communication. It is projected that by 2030, more than \$50 trillion will need to be invested in infrastructure globally to keep up with GDP, urbanization and climatic changes. Investments of this magnitude can only be delivered through collaboration between cities, regions, and international businesses and investors. Where there are gaps between public funds availability and the needs, Public-Private-Partnerships need to be evaluated and structured to dose the gaps. International collaboration common in scientific research, education and finance need to be transposed to capacity building and management of multifaceted infrastructure projects. Advanced countries can collaborate with regional country counterparts to projects execution, financing and timely delivery. Geo-collaboration enables cities in regional economies to boost their effectiveness by bringing international know-how dined, to projects facilitators. Buildings systems including fighting and HVAC consume nearly 40\% of total energy use. To lower their carbon footprint buildings need to perform better than they had been doing, environmentally, economically and socially. Need in regional economies is for open innovations for self sustainable habitats with minimum pollution levels, optimized energy supplies, adequate security, scalable and adaptable to different situations. A well coordinated collaborative approach is favored to benefit from nexus between smart buildings, HVAC systems, IAQ environment, power and water infrastructure. Them are already collaborative activities, such as regional satellites, regional countries collaboration, National League of Cities, C40 Cities, 100 Resilient Cities, Future-Cities-Collaborative for shared benefits. In the future, the combination of power, water and communications infrastructure with real time data analytics and potential use of Artificial Intelligence will bring us high performance cities and buildings that can also adopt to global weather changes and emergencies. This paper presents a conceptual framework for development of robust, and resilient infrastructure to suit the needs of regional economies along with fostering skills and job creation. A new approach of using open innovation with a geo-collaborative vision, knowledge, skills, experience and strategies for effective and sustainable delivery of services, goods and policies is discussed. Technologies need to be adapted to serve local needs commensurate with global experiences, to ensure that the right technologies and applications are employed in the right environments, tailored to the specific cultural social and economic characteristics of the individual city.},

Abstract = {Despite the successes of the Green Revolution, about a billion people are still undernourished and food security in the developing world faces new challenges in terms of population growth, reduced water resources, climate change and decreased public sector investment. It is also becoming widely recognized that poverty is a cause of environmental degradation, conflict and civil unrest. Internationally coordinated agricultural research can play a significant role in improving food security by deploying promising new technologies as well as adapting those with well-established impact. In addition to the genetic challenges of crop improvement, agriculturalists must also embrace the problems associated with a highly heterogeneous and unpredictable environment. Not only are new genetic tools becoming more accessible, but a new generation of quantitative tools are available to enable better definition of agro-ecosystems, of cultivar by environment interactions, and of socioeconomic issues, while satellite imagery can help predict crop yields on large scales. Identifying areas of low genetic diversity - for example as found in large tracts of South Asia - is an important aspect of reducing vulnerability to disease epidemics. Global strategies for incorporating durable disease resistance genes into a wider genetic background, as well as participatory approaches that deliver a fuller range of options to farmers, are being implemented to increase cultivar diversity. The unpredictable effects of environment on productivity can be buffered somewhat by crop management practices that maintain healthy soils, while reversing the consequences of rapid agricultural intensification on soil degradation. Conservation agriculture is an alternative strategy that is especially pertinent for resource-poor farmers. The potential synergy between genetic improvement and innovative crop management practices has been referred to as the Doubly Green Revolution. The unique benefits and efficiency of the international collaborative platform are indisputable when considering the duplications that otherwise would have been required to achieve the same impacts through unilateral or even bilateral programmes. Furthermore, while the West takes for granted public support for crucial economic and social issues, this is not the case in a number of less-developed countries where the activities of International Agricultural Research Centres (IARCs) and other development assistance organizations can provide continuity in agricultural research and infrastructure.},

Title = {Variable Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Quality across 91 Indian Cities},

Abstract = {India responded to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through a three-phase nationwide lockdown: 25 March-14 April, 15 April-3 May, and 4-17 May 2020. Weutilized this unique opportunity to assess the impact of restrictions on the air quality of Indian cities. We conducted comprehensive statistical assessments for the air quality index (AQI) and criteria pollutant concentrations for 91 cities during the lockdown phases relative to the preceding seven days (prelockdown phase of 18-24 March 2020) and to corresponding values from the same days of the year in 2019. Both comparisons show statistically significant countrywide mean decrease in AQI (33\%), PM2.5 (36\%), PM10 (40\%), NO2 (58\%), O-3 (5\%), SO2 (25\%), NH3 (28\%), and CO (60\%). These reductions represent a background or the lower bound of air quality burden of industrial and transportation sectors. The northern region was most impacted by the first two phases of the lockdown, whereas the southern region was most affected in the last phase. The northeastern region was least affected, followed by the eastern region, which also showed an increase in O-3 during the lockdown. Analysis of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) shows that effects of restrictions on particulate pollution were variable-locally confined in some areas or having a broader impact in other regions. Anomalous behavior over the eastern region suggests a differing role of regional societal response or meteorological conditions. The study results have policy implications because they provide the observational background values for the industrial and transportation sector's contribution to urban pollution.},

Abstract = {The problem of air pollution is a frequently recurring situation and its management has social and economic considerable effects. Given the interaction of the numerous factors involved in the raising of the atmospheric pollution rates, it should be considered that the relation between the intensity of emission produced by the polluting source and the resulting pollution is not immediate. The aim of this study was to realise and to compare two support decision system (neural networks and multivariate regression model) that, correlating the air quality data with the meteorological information, are able to predict the critical pollution events. The development of a back-propagation neural network is presented to predict the daily PM10 concentration 1, 2 and 3 days early. The measurements obtained by the territorial monitoring stations are one of the primary data sources; the forecasting of the major weather parameters available on the website and the forecasting of the Saharan dust obtained by the ``Centro Nacional de Supercomputacion{''} website, satellite images and back trajectories analysis are used for the weather input data. The results obtained with the neural network were compared with those obtained by a multivariate linear regression model for 1 and 2 days forecasting. The relative root mean square error for both methods shows that the artificial neural networks (ANN) gives more accurate results than the multivariate linear regression model mostly for 1 day forecasting; moreover, the regression model used, in spite of ANN, failed when it had to fit spiked high values of PM10 concentration.},

Title = {The performance of externally managed REITs in Asia Further evidence from free cash flow and agency costs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT \& FINANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {200-227},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of free cash flow (FCF) on the agency costs and how these FCF and agency costs affect the performance of REITs in Asia. Unlike previous studies that focus on conventional public listed companies and non-regulated industry, the Asian REIT industry being a highly regulated industry provides a new context for further research. Design/methodology/approach - The samples for this study comprise REIT data from four major Asian REIT countries, namely, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia. These countries are the leaders in Asian REITs which account for 94 percent of the total market capitalization of REITs in Asia. The study period is from 2002 to 2012 using panel data. This study employs GMM method which is more robust compared to previous studies that used pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) and other panel data methods. Findings - The results indicate that FCF and agency costs persist over time in Asian REITs even though REITs are in a highly regulated industry. The findings also imply that REIT managers face substantial costs when they wish to adjust to the equilibrium level of agency costs, whereby the optimum level is always dynamic and not constant over time and moves with the changes in the determinants of agency costs. These agency costs persist over time and have significant impacts on the performance of REITs in Asia. Research limitations/implications - There are limited data in selling, general and administrative expenses in Asian REITs which render only limited use of selling, general and administrative expenses ratio in this empirical study on Asian REITs. For future research, researchers can embark on research studies on issues that might determine the speed of adjustment toward the equilibrium level of agency costs in Asian REITs. Practical implications - For REIT regulators in Asia, this empirical study helps to provide useful information for policy planning and formulation in REIT corporate governance; and to transform the inherent satellite structure of the externallymanaged REIT structure into internally managed REIT structure. For REIT managers and practitioners, this empirical study serves as a reflection for them which helps them to be more aware of the dynamism of FCF and agency costs in REITs; and alert them that these FCF and agency costs persist over time which can have significant impacts on the REIT performance, return on assets and return on equity, REIT value and REIT return, respectively in Asia. Thus, they could consider internalizing their REIT management structure for better and more efficient management in REITs in order to mitigate the agency costs that are persistent over time. As a whole, this empirical study contributes significant benefits to all level of the REIT industry in Asia. Social implications - This implies that the REITs in Asia should consider internally managed REIT structure since the agency costs persist over time and there are always dynamic and not constant over time and moves with the changes in the determinants of agency costs. The findings also imply that the regulators in Asian REITs should enforce absolute stringent corporate governance rules and regulations in order to govern the existing inherent satellite structure of the externally managed REITs in Asia. Originality/value - This empirical study contributes significant benefits to all levels of the REIT industry in Asia and the current limited literature on Asian REITs by examining the impact of FCF and agency costs on the performance of REITs in Asia. This is the first research to embark on FCF and agency costs on REITs in Asia. Furthermore, this study employs GMM method which is more robust compared to previous studies that used pooled OLS and other panel data methods.},

Abstract = {Land subsidence is a hazard that results from conditioning factors that cause environmental change and generate social and economic impacts. Some of these factors may increase dissolution of calcareous stones, change groundwater storage, or stem from mining, faulting, and seismic activity. Semnan Plain, Iran is experiencing land subsidence that, along with secondary impacts like surface fissures, is becoming increasingly troublesome. This study modeled land subsidence and created a susceptibility map using multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), and boosted regression tree (BRT) machine-learning methods. Analysis of satellite imagery, documents reporting past subsidence, and a contemporary field survey identified 65 sinkholes on Semnan Plain. Twelve conditioning factors were selected for analysis from a review of the scholarly literature, field investigation, and data availability. The three methods were used to model subsidence from a training subset of the known sites. The models were validated with the remaining subset of subsidence locations. Finally, susceptibility maps were used to predict other sites that are highly likely to see subsidence. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curves (AUC) were applied to assess the accuracies of the maps. AUC values (0.637, 0.783, and 0.712 for the BRT, MARS, and MDA models respectively) showed that MARS generated the most accurate model, MDA generated the second most accurate, and BRT's was the least accurate model. Subsidence susceptibility maps as produced here can be useful, meaningful, and functional tools for local and regional planners and policy makers involved in land use planning, resource management, and hazard mitigation.},

Title = {Urban forests' recreation and habitat potentials in China: A nationwide synthesis},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urban forests are important landscape components in cities around the world that offer multiple functionality, thereby serve as a nature-based solution to offsetting negative social-ecological effects brought by urbanization. While the recreational function, as a traditional focus of urban forests, has been primarily emphasized in Chinese cities, the emerging ecological civilization, as a national guiding institution, has gradually brought ecological dimension into urban forest construction and management. By combining statistical data and satellite image data covering 31 key-cities in mainland China, we attempt to quantitatively analyze the transition of urban forests with regard to two intertwined, critical dimensions: recreational potential (proxied by public park space per capita) and habitat potential (proxied by the percentage of core habitat that is not subject to significant disturbances and thus able to effectively maintain the ecological functionality of urban forest patches), to unveil possible synergies or tradeoffs between these two critical aspects for the period of 2011-2018. We found that overall urban forests' recreation potential has increased, but their habitat potential has decreased. Economic growth is positively associated with recreation potential, but negatively associated with habitat potential. Results of this study revealed that the institutionalization of ``ecological civilization{''} paradigm in China has not yet been successfully taken into urban forest domain. This calls for urban landscape policy and planning directed towards fostering synergistic effects between urban forests' recreational function and habitat potential in order to essentially reconcile citizens' recreational uses and the resilience of cities as complex socioecological systems. In this vein, the development of urban forest, as a visualized form of the mainstream yet subtle ecological civilization, can be further geared towards multi-functionality.},

Abstract = {For over two decades, researchers, space users, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) service providers, and international policy makers have been working diligently to expand the space-borne use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and, most recently, to employ the full complement of GNSS constellations to increase spacecraft navigation performance. Space-borne Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications employing GNSS are now ubiquitous in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). GNSS use in space is quickly expanding into the Space Service Volume (SSV), the signal environment in the volume surrounding the Earth that enables real-time PNT measurements from GNSS systems at altitudes of 3000 km and above. To support the current missions and planned future missions within the SSV, initiatives are being conducted in the United States and internationally to ensure that GNSS signals are available, robust, and yield precise navigation performance. These initiatives include the Interagency Forum for Operational Requirements (IFOR) effort in the United States, to support GPS SSV signal robustness through future design changes, and the United Nations-sponsored International Committee on GNSS (ICG), to coordinate SSV development across all international GNSS constellations and regional augmentations. The results of these efforts have already proven fruitful, enabling new missions through radically improved navigation and timing performance, ensuring quick recovery from trajectory maneuvers, improving space vehicle autonomy and making GNSS signals more resilient from potential disruptions. Missions in the SSV are operational now and have demonstrated outstanding PNT performance characteristics; much better than what was envisioned less than a decade ago. The recent launch of the first in a series of US weather satellites will employ the use of GNSS in the SSV to substantially improve weather prediction and public-safety situational awareness of fast moving events, including hurricanes, flash floods, severe storms, tornados and wildfires. Thus, the benefits of the GNSS expansion and use into the SSV are tremendous, resulting in orders of magnitude return in investment to national governments and extraordinary societal benefits, including lives saved and critical infrastructure and property protected. However, this outstanding success is tempered by dual challenges: that for GPS, the current SSV specifications do not adequately protect SSV future use; and that for GNSS, the capabilities that are currently available are not protected in the future by specifications.},

Abstract = {Patagonian archaeology includes several valuable applications of Geographical Information Systems. But mapping, the necessary previous step to analysis, is not always detailed. The case of the middle Limay river basin is presented. The research team has been working in the region for decades, as well as other scholars have, both during and before this time. Only in recent years has been possible to involve direct positioning devices (like GPS) in surveys. Because of that, a considerable amount of information is embedded in conventional cartography, site forms, survey logs and other documents. Part of the data was previously entered in digital databases, and made available to study. The task at hand consisted in developing a georreferenced database of sites by means of digitizing documentation, inventorying and cross-referencing observations, and marking them on satellite images accessed online. We emphasize the importance of keeping simple work processes, the convenience of registering of each mark with precision, and the value of `digging' in the archaeological files. The result -provisory because of its possibility of improvement- is a start point for future research, cultural resource management, or divulgation.},

Title = {Model-Observations Synergy in the Coastal Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Integration of observations of the coastal ocean continuum, from regional oceans to shelf seas and estuaries/deltas with models, can substantially increase the value of observations and enable a wealth of applications. In particular, models can play a critical role at connecting sparse observations, synthesizing them, and assisting the design of observational networks; in turn, whenever available, observations can guide coastal model development. Coastal observations should sample the two-way interactions between nearshore, estuarine and shelf processes and open ocean processes, while accounting for the different pace of circulation drivers, such as the fast atmospheric, hydrological and tidal processes and the slower general ocean circulation and climate scales. Because of these challenges, high-resolution models can serve as connectors and integrators of coastal continuum observations. Data assimilation approaches can provide quantitative, validated estimates of Essential Ocean Variables in the coastal continuum, adding scientific and socioeconomic value to observations through applications (e.g., sea-level rise monitoring, coastal management under a sustainable ecosystem approach, aquaculture, dredging, transport and fate of pollutants, maritime safety, hazards under natural variability or climate change). We strongly recommend an internationally coordinated approach in support of the proper integration of global and coastal continuum scales, as well as for critical tasks such as community-agreed bathymetry and coastline products.},

Pages = {61-77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Described in this paper is a concept that combines a set of technologies with a set of economic and social concepts that would allow people to create sustainable ecologies for their region or country. As such it describes a possible implementation path. The technologies are: solar electricity, power satellites, wireless power transmission, electrolytic hydrogen, and synthetic liquid fuels manufactured from air, water, and electricity. Economic initiatives and policies include creating sustainable economic development regions through the use of tax incentives :and tax penalties. The technologies and economies are brought together by social concepts such as Technopolis and the theory of self-organizing and self-energizing social systems, i.e. creating wealth where there was none through sweat equity. Existing organizational structures such as credit unions, kibbutz's and agricultural and marketing cooperatives provide methods by which global marco-projects can be implemented on a local level. The unique topics of this paper are: Creating global markets by solving global problems or how to breakout of the chicken or egg paradox that has stymied the development of energy from space for so long. Linking energy availability to self-help economic development programs that create sustainable cultures while benefiting both the local and global environment. Integrating solar hydrogen research with energy from space and synthetic liquid fuels. Bartering energy for orbital slots and frequency allocations, i.e. energy has foreign aid. The proposed approach builds on current distribution systems in use for electricity, natural gas, and liquid fuels. We have the technology to expand the horizons and options of mankind, hasten its descent into the swamp of overpopulation, or wipe the slate clean and let nature try again. While the questions of which path will we choose and how will we choose it is beyond the scope of this paper it is within the scope of this paper to map out a possible path. Whether these technologies and concepts are implemented depends on choices made not by engineers and scientists but the people, their governments, and the religious leaders they choose to support for without the development of an ethical system of values that gives equal or greater weight to the importance of the quality of existence with respect to the mandate to procreate technology and economics will never be able to keep up with the growth in population. The bottom line of this paper is that linking the concept of baseload energy from Solar Power Satellites to the concepts of a hydrogen energy economy and capitalistic based economic cooperatives could create paths to sustainable futures for the cultures and civilizations of the world. This would expand the horizons and options of mankind while improving or at least maintaining the current quality of our biosphere. The unanswered question is can we do it before we run out of economical and environmentally acceptable recoverable fossil fuel resources.},

Abstract = {Political, economic, and technological changes in recent years have created a world with global economic intertwining, increased mobility of world citizens, and communications needs that capability of current infrastructures. To meet demands by this ``Global Village{''} for services that can meet new needs for mobility and communications, a new organisational paradigm must respond. This new paradigm is global from Day 1, ``at home{''} everywhere, and profit-oriented. In the past, such global organisations have primarily been loosely intertwined, intergovernmental organisations with the primary objective df providing social or commercial benefits rather than bottom-line profitability. Other global organisations have sprung from a strong national company that has expanded internationally but still retained a defining national image (e.g. Motorola, Ericcson, McDonald's, Coca-Cola). ICO is perhaps the first organisation to fit the new paradigm demanded ``Global Village. ICO will offer mobile satellite services to handheld-sized globally beginning in the year 2000. We are a global, multilingual, multicultural company. This is reflected in the company's heritage, management team, partners and employees. ICO Global Communications will link people anytime, anywhere on the planet. By the nature of our service offering, we must be global from Day 1 offering services for people to communicate around the world. We are achieving this through a global network of people and partners. People and partners are the key to creating an organisation that is at home{''} everywhere with products and services that are tailored to local markets through language and service. ICO is a truly multinational company with no single country as its ``home{''}. Our partners consist of 59 investors from 51 different countries representing the `A' list of telecommunications players. Some are satellite industry players, many are leading telecommunications operators, while still others are financial organisations that have the capital and local mark et experience to distribute ICO services. At present, we have over employees representing over 30 different nationalities. Certainly, the management challenges of creating and operating such an organisation are formidable but the potential rewards in serving the ``Global Village{''} are enormous and can probably only be realised by the development of such a new, unique management and organisational approach.},

Title = {Spatial Management Measures Alter Vessel Behavior in the Aleutian Archipelago},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The Aleutian Archipelago and surrounding waters have enormous ecological, cultural, and commercial significance. As one of the shortest routes between North American and Asian ports, the North Pacific Great Circle Route, which crosses through the Aleutian Archipelago, is traveled by thousands of large cargo ships and tanker vessels every year. To reduce maritime risks and enhance navigational safety, the International Maritime Organization built upon earlier offshore routing efforts by designating five Areas To Be Avoided (ATBAs) in the Aleutian Islands in 2016. The ATBAs are designed to keep large vessels at least 50 nautical miles (93 km) from shore unless calling at a local port or transiting an authorized pass between islands. However, very few studies have examined the effectiveness of ATBAs as a mechanism for changing vessel behavior and thereby reducing the ecological impacts of maritime commerce. In this study, we use 4 years of satellite-based vessel tracking data to assess the effectiveness of the Aleutian ATBAs since their implementation in 2016. We determined whether vessels transiting the North Pacific Great Circle Route changed behavior after ATBA implementation, both in terms of overall route selection and in terms of compliance with each ATBA boundary. We found a total of 2,252 unique tankers and cargo vessels >400 gross tons transited the study region, completing a total of 8,794 voyages. To quantify routing changes of individual vessels, we analyzed the 767 vessels that transited the study region both before and after implementation. The percentage of voyages transiting through the boundaries of what would become ATBAs decreased from 76.3\% in 2014-2015 (prior to ATBA designation) to 11.8\% in 2016-2017 (after implementation). All five Aleutian ATBAs had significant increases in compliance, with the West ATBA showing the most dramatic increase, from 32.1\% to 95.0\%. We discuss the framework for ATBA enforcement and highlight the value of local institutional capacity for real-time monitoring. Overall, our results indicate that ATBAs represent a viable strategy for risk mitigation in sensitive ecological areas and that through monitoring, spatial protections influence vessel route decisions on multiple spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Over the last four decades the eradication of rats from islands around New Zealand has moved from accidental eradication following the exploratory use of baits for rat control to carefully planned complex eradications of rats and cats (Felis catus) on large islands. Introduced rodents have now been eradicated from more than 90 islands. Of these successful campaigns, those on Breaksea Island, the Mercury Islands, Kapiti Island, and Tuhua Island are used here as case studies because they represent milestones for techniques used or results achieved. Successful methods used on islands range from bait stations and silos serviced on foot to aerial spread by helicopters using satellite navigation systems. The development of these methods has benefited from adaptive management. By applying lessons learned from previous operations the size, complexity, and cost effectiveness of the campaigns has gradually increased. The islands now permanently cleared of introduced rodents are being used for restoration of island-seabird systems and recovery of threatened species such as large flightless invertebrates, lizards, tuatara, forest birds, and some species of plants. The most ambitious campaigns have been on remote subantarctic Campbell Island (11300 ha) and warm temperate Raoul Island (2938 ha), aimed to provide long-term benefits for endemic plant and animal species including land and seabirds. Other islands that could benefit from rat removal are close inshore and within the natural dispersal range of rats and stoats (Mustela erminea). Priorities for future development therefore include more effective methods for detecting rodent invasions, especially ship rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus), broader community involvement in invasion prevention, and improved understanding of reinvasion risk management.},

Title = {Inequities in ambient fine particulate matter: A spatiotemporal analysis in Canadian communities},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {858},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Background: Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with adverse health outcomes but communities are not randomly exposed to PM2.5. Previous cross-sectional environmental injustice analyses in Canada found dispro-portionately higher exposure to PM2.5 in low-income populations, visible minorities and immigrants. Beyond static surveillance, it is also important to evaluate how changes in PM2.5 exposure over time may differentially impact disad-vantaged communities. We examine whether communities with different sociodemographic characteristics benefited equitably from the overall decreases in ambient concentrations of PM2.5 from 2001 to 2016 in Canada.Methods: We derived census tract level estimates of average annual PM2.5 using validated satellite-based estimations of annual average PM2.5 concentration surfaces. We investigated how the spatial distribution of PM2.5 has evolved over 15 years (2001-2016) by comparing absolute values and rank percentiles of census tract level annual average PM2.5 concentrations in 2001 and 2016. Using decennial census data and multivariable linear regression, we determined if sociodemographic characteristics are associated with changes in exposure to PM2.5, accounting for geographic boundary changes between census periods.Results: Overall, ambient PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 2001 (median of 9.1 mu g/m3) to 2016 (median of 6.4 mu g/ m3), with varying provincial patterns. Across communities, ranked census tract specific PM2.5 in 2001 and in 2016 are highly correlated (Spearman's rho = 0.75). We found that, on average and accounting for provincial differences and baseline PM2.5, communities with greater density of aboriginal population, lower education, higher shelter-cost-to -income ratio, unemployment or lower income experienced smaller absolute decreases in PM2.5 from 2001 to 2016.Conclusions: Identifying sociodemographic groups that benefit least from decreasing exposure to PM2.5 highlights the need to consider environmental injustice when designing or revising air pollution policies.},

Title = {Assessing and monitoring the risk of land degradation in Baragan Plain, Romania, using spectral mixture analysis and Landsat imagery},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {188},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The fall of the communist regime in Romania at the end of 1989 and the ensuing transition to the market economy brought about many changes in the use of agricultural land. These changes combined with the action of climatic factors led, in most cases, to negative effects increasing the risk of degradation of agricultural land. This study aims to assess and monitor the risk of land degradation in Baragan Plain, Romania, for the period 1988-2011 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). Each satellite image was classified through the Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) method; then, on the basis of certain threshold values, we obtained maps of land degradation and maps showing the passage from various classes of land use/land cover (LULC) to land degradation. The results indicate that during the intermediary periods there was an ascending and descending trend in the risk of land degradation determined by the interaction of climatic factors with the social-economic ones. For the entire period, the overall trend was ascending, the risk of land degradation increasing by around 4.60 \% of the studied surface. Out of the climatic factors, high temperatures and, implicitly, drought were the most significant. The social-economic factors are the result of the changes which occurred after the fall of the communist regime, the most important being the fragmentation of agricultural land and the destruction of the irrigation system.},

Title = {Assessment of the lobster puerulus (Panulirus homarus and Panulirus ornatus, Decapoda: Palinuridae) resource of Indonesia and its potential for sustainable harvest for aquaculture},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {528},

Abstract = {Indonesia has a unique opportunity to establish the world's largest lobster aquaculture industry, based on a significant natural resource of settling puerulus. These seed lobsters can be captured and on-grown to generate high value, consumption size lobsters. However, existing fisheries regulation prohibits fishing of these seed lobsters in Indonesia. Nevertheless, seed fishing occurs widely, and the seed are smuggled into Vietnam, where the Vietnamese gain most of the commercial benefit. By removing access to pueruli and grow-out opportunities, these regulations have diminished the capacity of Indonesian lobster farmers to develop a sustainable grow-out industry. Although the new policies were introduced as a management intervention to protect adult lobster stocks, they have had the unintended consequence of preventing development of lobster aquaculture while having no known benefit on abundance of adult lobsters. This study collected data on the puerulus available in Indonesia, species composition, seasonality, and capture methods. A census of seed capture determined that 5,243,887 pueruli were fished from two bays in the southeast of Lombok in 2014, representing 64,787 pueruli per km(2). Surveys beyond Lombok determined there was high abundance of seed in areas with similar environmental characteristics, where local communities had also engaged in seed fishing. The locations identified as having substantial puerulus abundance comprised the southern coast of Java, Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa covering a distance of 1500 km. Puerulus abundance is highest in enclosed bays with distinct currents, relatively high turbidity attributable to terrestrial inflows, and muddy/sandy substrates. Satellite imaging identified all such suitable locations for puerulus settlement, enabling an estimate of total puerulus catch of 103,480,283 per year. The composition of puerulus fished consisted of two species, Panulirus homarus and P. ornatus. P. homarus was most abundant representing between 63 and 87\%, while P. ornatus represented 37 to 13\%. Seasonality of catch was unclear, with low catch between December and March and higher catches from April to November. The magnitude of the estimated puerulus resource of Indonesia is > 20 times greater than that of Vietnam. If used for aquaculture, the seed available can support an industry generating > 12,500 t of market size lobster, and provide social and economic benefit to many thousands of households. To achieve this, fisheries policies could be revised and a regulatory framework established to manage the puerulus fishery and support lobster farming. Tropical marine rock lobster aquaculture is a major opportunity for high-value aquaculture production for the Indonesian economy.},

Abstract = {Farmland abandonment (FLA) could be defined as the cessation of agricultural activities on a given surface of land (Pointereau et al., 2008). FLA, often associated with social and economic problems in rural areas, has significant environmental consequences. During the 1990s, millions of hectares of farmland in the new EU Member States, from Central and Eastern Europe, were abandoned as a result of the transition process from centralized and planned to market economy. The policy tools adopted gradually within the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union (EU CAP), as well as the EU environmental and structural policies, aimed to prevent further expansion of this phenomenon and to facilitate the revival of the agriculture land, being abandoned (ComReg 1122/2009). The Agri-Environment (AGRI-ENV) component of the Core Information Service (CIS), developed within the scope of the FP7-funded project ``geoland2{''} were designed to support the agricultural user community at pan-European and national levels by contributing to the improvement of more accurate and timely monitoring of the status of agricultural land use in Europe and its change. The purpose of the product `Farmland abandonment', as part of the AGRI-ENV package, is to detect potentially abandoned agriculture land, based on multi-annual SPOT data with several acquisitions per year. It provides essential independent information on the status of the agricultural land as recorded in the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which is one of the core instruments of the implementation of CAP. The production line is based on object-based image analysis and benefits from the extensive availability of Biophysical parameters derived from the satellite data (geoland2). The method detects/tracks those land (or so-called reference) parcels in the LPIS, holding significant amount of land agriculture found as potentially abandoned. Reference parcels with such change are flagged and reported, enabling the National Administrations to further analyze the spatial distribution and magnitude of this phenomenon at regional and national levels. Test results have been successfully generated for one test area (the Bulgarian part of the Strymunas-Struma River Basin). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Land use land cover change and the resilience of social-ecological systems in a sub-region in South west Cameroon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains highly prevalent in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and undermining the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems. We analysed satellite imagery of 1986 and 2018 to examine the extent and spatial patterns of LULCC in Fako sub-region of Cameroon. In addition, we explored the likelihood of LULCC and magnitude of impact of the drivers and predictors of LULCC in the sub-region by engaging 25 stakeholders in a focus group survey. Other cultivated areas of cropland, built-up, oil palm, and banana plantation covers increased by 21,360 ha (10.5\%), 3152 ha (1.6\%), 5721 ha (2.8\%), and 1823 ha (0.9\%), while dense forest, rubber and tea plantation covers decreased by -44,945 ha (-22.1\%), -15,557 ha (-7.7\%), and -110 ha (-0.1\%), respectively, from 1986 to 2018. Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. The spatial pattern of LULCC showed that expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland and agro-industrial plantations were highest in the north and east zones, respectively, while expansion of built-up areas and decrease in agro-industrial plantation covers were highest in the central, south and western coastal zones of Fako division. The variations in the spatial patterns of LULCC between the sub-divisions are attributed to differences in rates of population growth and urbanisation, topography, size of farming population, proportion of cultivable land, socioeconomic opportunities, and strength and resilience of local economy. The presence of the Mount Cameroon (4095 m), with high value forests, endemism, and conservation attractiveness restricted increased LULCC with elevation, while LULCC increased with nearness to the sea and national road networks. The likelihood of change from one LULC to oil palm plantation, banana plantation, and other cultivated areas and from rubber plantation, dense forest, lowland grassland to other land uses was 95\% and 90\%, respectively. Population growth, agricultural and farmland expansion, and infrastructural development were ranked as the three most important drivers of degradation under the business as usual scenario, while sustainable land management, good governance, and reforestation were ranked as the three most important predictors of LULCC reduction under the green economy scenario. In general, production and living space functions significantly increased at the expense of ecological land cover. Prioritising and increasing the legal protection of the mountain and coastal land-boundary ecosystems while providing for production and living land are invaluable for the sustainability of the social-ecological systems in the western highlands of Cameroon.},

Title = {Identifying and quantifying key pressures in a data poor region: Coastal Spatial Planning in Heraklion Prefecture, Greece},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal regions are among the most valuable ecosystems due to the socioeconomic and ecological benefits and services they provide. Pressures, leading to multiple adverse effects on coastal habitats, seriously threaten these benefits. Coastal Spatial Planning (CSP) aims to mitigate these pressures in parallel with the E.U. Marine Strategy Framework Directive. A key aspect of ecosystem-based CSP is mapping the spatial distribution of pertinent pressures, and identifying Key Environmental Indicators (KEIs). This objective however, is difficult to achieve in data-poor regions leading to variable sources of uncertainty. Furthermore, a conceptual framework to homogenize spatially explicit data of relevant pressures is lacking. This study proposes a methodology for developing and integrating spatial pressure datasets in a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) environment. This methodology was applied to a case study location in the northern and southern coastal area of Heraklion Prefecture, in Crete (Greece). The pressure datasets, used, were developed from a synthesis of proxy and satellite data, including abrasion, chlorophyll-a, commercial fish catches, invasive species, light pollution, microplastics, noise pollution, ocean acidification and organic load. These nine Potential Environmental Indicators (PEIs) were subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to reduce the number of parameters, and identify their relationships. The shortlisted 7 KEIs were organic load, chlorophyll-a, microplastics, commercial fish catches, and noise pollution, indicating that this methodology can be of management relevance in the initial steps of CSP implementation, especially in data poor areas. The proposed spatial integration of disparate pressure datasets as part of the flowchart presented constitutes a compositional approach to the spatial illustration of pressures in a coastal area. The patterns of KEI connectivity and disturbance highlighted herein through statistical analysis, could provide a feasible, economic and less biased procedure leading to effective marine resource management, also allowing for a regional and European implementation.

Abstract = {Space has been attracting human attention since the dawn of our history, and clues thus given have triggered scientific and cultural evolutions. Now the space is in our hands. Near earth space has been developed, providing benefits to daily life. Moon and Mars will become the stage of human activity in a few decades. What will be the next logical step? The next step should be an undertaking that promises substantial influence to human history, both in knowledge and productive activities. Looking into the future directions of technology development combined with their outcome, Kyushu University selected a stepwise long-term undertaking toward establishment of an outpost in the Jovian system. Jupiter is our closest gas planet, which is a replica of the Sun. Its true understanding is essential to our knowledge of the universe. Its satellites abounds versatility providing not only the crucial knowledge of science but energy and materials vital to space activities. Jovian outpost consists of the central station on or around Callisto, controlling several laboratories on other Galilean satellites and dispatching probes to the main planet including Jovian-Crafts to cruise within its atmosphere and Deep Probes to explore the depth of the hydrogen ocean. Utilization of materials especially water on Europa will enable energy management of the stations and probes, and will further provide sound base toward exploration of the outskirts of the solar system and beyond. This understanding needs a long-term endeavor that should be handed over many generations. This is a technology development program but education is an essential part of the process. The task is based on a series of short (5 year) targets. Each target provides stepwise solution to the objective, yet provides substantial outputs to the society and industries in a timely manner. The paper describes the overall program and details of the first 5 year targets. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {NASA and the French space agency, CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency ( CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency ( UKSA) are developing new wide swath altimetry technology that will cover most of the world's ocean and surface freshwater bodies. The proposed Surface Water and Ocean Topography ( SWOT) mission will have the capability to make observations of surface water ( lakes, rivers, wetland) heights and measurements of ocean surface topography with unprecedented spatial coverage, temporal sampling, and spatial resolution compared to existing technologies. These data will be useful for monitoring the hydrologic cycle, flooding, and characterizing human impacts on a changing environment. The applied science community is a key element in the success of the SWOT mission, demonstrating the high value of the science and data products in addressing societal issues and needs. The SWOT applications framework includes a working group made up of applications specialists, SWOT science team members, academics and SWOT Project members to promote applications research and engage a broad community of potential SWOT data users. A defined plan and a guide describing a program to engage early adopters in using proxies for SWOT data, including sophisticated ocean and hydrology simulators, an airborne analogue for SWOT ( AirSWOT), and existing satellite datasets, are cornerstones for the program. A user survey is in development and the first user workshop was held in 2015, with annual workshops planned. The anticipated science and engineering advances that SWOT will provide can be transformed into valuable services to decision makers and civic organizations focused on addressing global disaster risk reduction initiatives and potential science-based mitigation activities for water resources challenges of the future. With the surface water measurements anticipated from SWOT, a broad range of applications can inform inland and coastal managers and marine operators of terrestrial and oceanic phenomena relevant to their work.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},

Volume = {27-28},
Pages = {15-22},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Sensitivity Analysis (SA) was performed on the MASC model (Multi-attribute Assessment of the Sustainability of Cropping systems), a hierarchical qualitative model built to assess the sustainability of cropping systems developed under a decision support tool called DEXi. Three approaches were tested to perform a first-order SA assuming a fixed model structure and no correlation among input variables: (i) factorial designs combined with analysis of variance (ANOVA), (ii) Monte-Carlo sampling (MC), (iii) conditional probabilities (CPs). The three tested approaches were coded under the R-statistical package in a generic way in order to be used to perform SA on every DEXi-type model. Results showed that, due to the dimension of the tree, a complete factorial design was unsuitable. MC and CPs represented efficient alternatives to perform an analysis of the overall model. CPs exploited better the hierarchical structure of the model to give exact first-order indices, while MC would be a more flexible approach for the introduction of correlations among variables. The outputs of the SA showed that there was an unbalanced distribution of the modalities of the three domains of sustainability (i.e., Economic, Social and Environmental) and that the MASC model tends to poorly discriminate the cropping systems. This may be due to the structure of the tree. Reducing the complexity of the tree using ``satellite trees{''}, restructuring the tree to get an equilibrated tree between the Economic, Social and Environmental dimension or increase the number of qualitative value per leaf may improve the discriminative power of the model. Such results demonstrated the interest of performing SA as a guiding tool for modellers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Human modification of forest habitats is a major component of global environmental change. Even areas that remain predominantly forested may be changed considerably by human alteration of historical disturbance regimes. To better understand human influences on the abundance and pattern of forest habitats, we studied forest land cover change from 1936 to 1996 in a 25 000 km(2) landscape in the Oregon ( USA) Coast Range. We integrated historical forest survey data and maps from 1936 with satellite imagery and GIS data from 1996 to quantify changes in major forest cover types. Change in the total area of closed-canopy forests was relatively minor, decreasing from 68\% of the landscape in 1936 to 65\% in 1996. In contrast, large-conifer forests decreased from 42\% in 1936 to 17\% in 1996, whereas small-conifer forests increased from 21\% of the landscape in 1936 to 39\% in 1996. Linear regression models were used to predict changes in the proportion of large conifer forest as a function of socioeconomic and environmental variables at scales of subbasins ( mean size = 1964 km(2), n = 13), watersheds (mean size = 302 km(2), n = 83), and subwatersheds (mean size = 18 km(2), n = 1325). The proportion of land in private ownership was the strongest predictor at all three spatial scales ( partial R-2 values 0.57 - 0.76). The amounts of variation explained by other independent variables were comparatively minor. Results corroborate the hypothesis that differing management regimes on private and public ownerships have led to different pathways of landscape change. Furthermore, these distinctive trajectories are consistent over a broad domain of spatial scales.},

Title = {Greener and Smarter Phones for Future Cities: Characterizing the Impact of GPS Signal Strength on Power Consumption},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Pages = {858-868},
Abstract = {Smart cities appear as the next stage of urbanization aiming to not only exploit physical and digital infrastructure for urban development but also the intellectual and social capital as its core ingredient for urbanization. Smart cities harness the power of data from sensors in order to understand and manage city systems. The most important of these sensing devices are smartphones as they provide the most important means to connect the smart city systems with its citizens, allowing personalization n and cocreation. The battery lifetime of smartphones is one of the most important parameters in achieving good user experience for the device. Therefore, the management and the optimization of handheld device applications in relation to their power consumption are an important area of research. This paper investigates the relationship between the energy consumption of a localization application and the strength of the global positioning system (GPS) signal. This is an important focus, because location-based applications are among the top power-hungry applications. We conduct experiments on two android location-based applications, one developed by us, and the other one, off the shelf. We use the results from the measurements of the two applications to derive a mathematical model that describes the power consumption in smartphones in terms of SNR and the time to first fix. The results from this study show that higher SNR values of GPS signals do consume less energy, while low GPS signals causing faster battery drain (38\% as compared with 13\%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a quantitative understanding of how the poor strength (SNR) of satellite signals will cause relatively higher power drain from a smartphone's battery.},

Title = {The savannization of tropical forests in mainland Southeast Asia since 2000},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 5},
Abstract = {ContextTropical forests in mainland Southeast (MSEA) have important conservation values and provide critical ecosystem functioning and services. With climate change and increasing anthropogenic activities, these forests can be lost to other land use types or degraded.ObjectivesWe aim to understand how these forests have changed under the context of MSEA's rapidly changing physical and socioeconomic environments in recent decades.MethodsWe employed satellite-derived tree cover products, primarily the MODIS-based Vegetation continuous field (VCF) data, to investigate changes in forest cover with a focus on potential forest degradation to savannah since 2000 for the four MSEA countries, i.e., Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.ResultsWe found an overall increasing trend of savannah (defined as places with tree cover between 10 and 55\%) during the period 2000-2020. However, the sources of the increased savannah area differed significantly between 2000-2009 and 2009-2020: In the earlier decade, the positive trend of the savannah area was primarily attributed to tree regeneration from grasslands; while during the more recent decade, the degradation (savannization) of forests was the major cause. Fire disturbance primarily controlled interannual variation in tree cover for the savannah gain during the period of 2000-2009, while high atmospheric water demand drove the degradation of forests during the period of 2010-2020.ConclusionsOur analysis sheds light on the understanding of changing forest landscapes in a globally important region of tropical forests, which is critical for informing land management and tropical forest protection.},

Title = {An Evaluation of Risk-Based Agricultural Land-Use Adjustments under a Flood Management Strategy in a Floodplain},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Agricultural damage due to floods in the Indus basin's fertile land has been the most damaging natural disaster in Pakistan so far. Earthen dikes are protecting the vast areas of the floodplain from regular flooding. However, the floodplain is attractive to farmers due to its fertility and experiences regular crop production within and out of the dike area. This paper evaluates the flood risk in a floodplain of the Chenab river in Pakistan and recommends land-use changes to reduce the flood risk for crops and associated settlements within the study area. The objective of the land-use change is not just to reduce flood losses but also to increase the overall benefits of the floodplain in terms of its Economic Rent (ER). This preliminary study analyses the economic impacts of the risk-based land-use improvements on existing floodplain land uses. Expected Annual Damage (EAD) maps were developed using hydrodynamic models and GIS data. The developed model identified the areas where maize can be economically more productive compared to rice under flood conditions. Promising results were obtained for the settlement relocations. It was also observed that the infra-structure, running parallel to the river, plays a significant role in curtailing the extent of floods. The results show that a combination of structural and non-structural measures proves more effective. The study also recommends the inclusion of social and environmental damages as well as other types of non-structural measures to develop the most effective flood management strategy.},

Title = {A scale-adjusted measure of ``Urban sprawl{''} using nighttime satellite imagery},

Abstract = {``Urban Sprawl{''} is a growing concern of citizens, environmental organizations, and governments. Negative impacts often attributed to urban sprawl are traffic congestion, loss of open space, and increased pollutant runoff into natural waterways. Definitions of ``Urban Sprawl{''} range from local patterns of land use and development to aggregate measures of per capita land consumption for given contiguous urban areas (UA). This research creates a measure of per capita land use consumption as an aggregate index for the spatially contiguous urban areas of the conterminous United States with population of 50,000 or greater. Nighttime satellite imagery obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is used as a proxy measure of urban extent. The corresponding population of these urban areas is derived from a grid of the block group level data from the 1990 U.S. Census. These numbers are used to develop a regression equation between Ln(Urban Area) and Ln(Urban Population). The `scale-adjustment' mentioned in the title characterizes the ``Urban Sprawl{''} of each of the urban areas by how far above or below they are on the ``Sprawl Line{''} determined by this regression. This ``Sprawl Line{''} allows for a more fair comparison of ``Urban Sprawl{''} between larger and smaller metropolitan areas because a simple measure of per capita land consumption or population density does not account for the natural increase in aggregate population density that occurs as cities grow in population. Cities that have more ``Urban Sprawl{''} by this measure tended to be inland and Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Surprisingly, west coast cities including Los Angeles had some of the lowest levels of ``Urban Sprawl{''} by this measure. There were many low light levels seen in the nighttime imagery around these major urban areas that were not included in either of the two definitions of urban extent used in this study. These areas may represent a growing commuter-shed of urban workers who do not live in the urban core but nonetheless contribute to many of the impacts typically attributed to ``Urban Sprawl{''}. ``Urban Sprawl{''} is difficult to define precisely partly because public perception of sprawl is likely derived from local land use planning decisions, spatio-demographic change in growing urban areas, and changing values and social mores resulting from differential rates of international migration to the urban areas of the United States. Nonetheless, the aggregate measures derived here are somewhat different than similar previously used measures in that they are `scale-adjusted'; also, the spatial patterns of ``Urban Sprawl{''} shown here shed some insight and raise interesting questions about how the dynamics of ``Urban Sprawl{''} are changing.

Abstract = {In ``Le Droit a la ville{''}, Lefebvre declares that urban space is not a scientific object, but it is, and has always been, political and strategic. However, in recent decades, the architecture seems to have given up theorizing about the causes that determine the design of cities. This situation has promoted the creation of a collective imagination in which city appears as a neutral backdrop where happen, almost by accident, social, psychological, cultural and economic processes that are not considered as inherently urban. If it raises from this point a critical reflection on shaping of city, it should be accepted that currently we have no alternatives to deal to systems of `super-production' and `des-management' urban and territorial, which nowadays control the city planning. We need to develop new approaches, strategies and solutions that allow us to overcome the current, but outdated, urban models. To do this, we consider it essential taking as reference some of most relevant projects built in one of the most prolific periods in planning field: the years after Second World War. Many of British `new towns', Dutch neighbourhoods and Nordic `satellite towns' built at that time, remain today, in a lot of ways, paradigmatic models of good urban design. We believe that the analysis of some of these works is able to provide us some useful keys to address the design of contemporary city. This paper aims to help form a new framework, drawn since architecture, which helps us to quantify the urban quality of any project; obviously considering that as there are so many factors involved in this question, it is not possible a complete objectivity. But we know empirically that there are pleasant and unpleasant urban environments. So, we will try to convert these abstract perceptions in concrete, measurable and quantifiable magnitudes. For this purpose, we have developed a research methodology that allows us to have data, parameters and values that make it possible to begin the road to objectification of urban quality.},

Title = {Wintering waterbirds in a large river floodplain: Hydrological connectivity is the key for reconciling development and conservation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {An alteration in the hydrological connectivity reduces the synergistic processes and interactions between rivers and their floodplains, and changes the distribution of waterbirds that rely on floodplains as foraging grounds. Recent river and wetland conservation and restoration efforts have been partially focused on reinstating the natural river-floodplain connectivity to ameliorate the ecological effects of regulation in river systems. However, in regions where human well-being is tightly linked with the cultivation of the floodplain (such as fisheries), management options are constrained and trade-offs among competing social, economic and ecological goals may be necessary for the wise use of wetlands. Poyang Lake in east central China includes numerous sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation; therefore, this lake may provide a useful context for exploring the likelihood of such trade-offs. In this study, we used multiyear simultaneous waterbird survey data together with habitat maps derived from satellite imagery for Poyang Lake to examine-the variations in waterbird community structure and abundance within sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation. Using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, we built generalized linear mixed models to explore the differences in wetland composition and waterbird abundance/diversity among three lake types (i.e. isolated, freely connected, and controlled) at community, guild and species levels.. The results showed hydrological connectivity alteration clearly affects wintering waterbirds; in addition, the ecological benefits of a natural flow regime were most unambiguous at the community level. Nevertheless, little evidence exists to indicate that the lakes' ecological values as waterbird foraging grounds were compromised by partial regulation. That is, species richness and population size were comparable in naturally connected and controlled lakes. Our results suggest that, with carefully designed management plans, a delicate balance between waterbird conservation and development can be accomplished in large river floodplains.

Abstract = {Where policy and science intersect, there are always issues of ambiguous and conflicting lines of evidence. Combining disparate information sources is mathematically complex; common heuristics based on simple statistical models easily lead us astray. Here, we use Bayesian Nets (BNs) to illustrate the complexity in reasoning under uncertainty. Data from joint research at Resources for the Future and NASA Langley are used to populate a BN for predicting equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The information sources consist of measuring the rate of decadal temperature rise (DTR) and measuring the rate of percentage change in cloud radiative forcing (CRF), with both the existing configuration of satellites and with a proposed enhanced measuring system. The goal of all measurements is to reduce uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity. Subtle aspects of probabilistic reasoning with concordant and discordant measurements are illustrated. Relative to the current prior distribution on ECS, we show that after 30years of observing with the current systems, the 2 sigma uncertainty band for ECS would be shrunk on average to 73\% of its current value. With the enhanced systems over the same time, it would be shrunk to 32\% of its current value. The actual shrinkage depends on the values actually observed. These results are based on models recommended by the Social Cost of Carbon methodology and assume a Business as Usual emissions path.},

Title = {Changes in Tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide Vertical Column Densities over Japan and Korea during the COVID-19 Using Pandora and MAX-DOAS},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {We investigated the impact of human activity during COVID-19 on the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column density (NO2 TropVCD) at three urban sites (Gwangju and Busan in Korea and Yokosuka in Japan) and one remote site (Cape Hedo in Japan) from Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and Pandora. Compared to the monthly mean NO2 TropVCD from 2015 to 2018 and in 2019, the values were lower in 2020 due to social distancing in Korea and Japan. High negative relative changes were observed from May to September (-30\% to -18\%) at the three urban sites; Cape Hedo, a remote site, did not show a significant difference in relative changes between previous years and 2020, suggesting that only anthropogenic emission sources decreased dramatically. In the case of Yokosuka, the 15-day moving average of the NO2 TropVCD exhibited a good relationship with transportation (R = 0.48) and industry (R = 0.54) mobility data. In contrast, the NO2 TropVCD at the Korean sites showed a moderate to low correlation with the industrial sector and insignificant correlations with transportation. The differences in correlations might be caused by the different social distancing policies in Korea (voluntary) and Japan (mandatory). By applying generalized boosted models to exclude meteorological and seasonal effects associated with NO2 TropVCD variations, we revealed that the decreasing trend from 2019 to 2020 was much steeper than that from 2015 to 2020 (a factor of two), and a significant change was identified in January 2020, when the first cases of COVID-19 were observed in both Korea and Japan. This result confirmed that the reduction in NO2 can be largely explained by the NOx emission reduction resulting from social distancing for COVID-19 rather than annual meteorological differences; however, in December 2020, NO2 recovered suddenly to its previous level due to an increase in human activities.},

Title = {A human-centred assessment framework to prioritise heat mitigation efforts for active travel at city scale},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {763},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change is directly related to our livelihoods and needs to be studied in order to form mitigation and adaptation policies. Climate change is a global phenomenon and poses diverse implications in form and type for different ecologies. Human activities are greatly disturbing the nature through using the land for different types of anthropogenic activities like cultural, financial matters, environmental aspects. land policy and land development plans. The present study aims to analyze the climatic variation and assess the land use change of district Bahawalpur having total area of 24,830 km(2). Climatic data (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall) were collected for a period of 30 years (1989-2018). Monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature, annual rainfall, Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) and their anomalies were calculated using secondary data for the study area. Land use data were collected in the form of Landsat satellite images of last 30 years (1990-2019) with 10 yeas interval from different online sources. Landsat ETM and ETM + satellite imagery were processed in ArcGIS software. Results showed that there is a great variation in maximum temperature anomaly during the entire study period. Minimum temperature anomaly shows positive and negative trend during the entire study period from 1989 to 2019. There is a great variation in DTR anomaly during the study period. 10-years moving average of DTR anomaly remained positive during most of the time. There is variation in annual rainfall anomaly, with both positive and negative values. As in the whole time span of 30 years, built-up land increased from 2.54\% (631 Km(2)) in 1990 to 4.66\% (1,157 Km(2)) at the end of 2019. Agricultural land use also increased from 3,439 Km(2) (13.85\%) to 5,168 Km(2) (20.81\%). Forest land use decreased from the 1,321 Km2 (5.32\%) to 775 Km(2) (3.12\%) at end of 2019. Water occupied land with the high fluctuation was 109 Km(2) (0.44\%) in 1990 and in 2019 it recorded 148 Km(2) (0.60\%). The main land use class desert land also decreased from an area of 19,330 Km(2) (77.85\%) to 17,582 Km(2) (70.81\%). Correlation of land use change classes in last 30 years showed relationship intensity between different land use changes. Agricultural land and built up land have strong relationship with the value of 0.98. Desert land and agricultural land have strongly negative relationship with the value of -0.94. This study found how rapidly changes occurred in the land use with rate of land use change is a mile stone for the planners, researchers and scholars for the better understanding towards land use change in district Bahawalpur.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Hyper-Resolution Model-Derived Water Cycle Components Over the Upper Blue Nile Basin},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {590},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Freshwater scarcity is a major global concern that is being exacerbated by the increasing population and changing climate. While close estimates of water cycle components and water budget analysis can help with planning for sustainable water resources management, limited hydroclimatic data have made such analysis challenging. The Upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia is such a hydroclimatic data-scarce region, with relatively arid and hot weather. Multiple studies have focused on water budget analysis in the UBN basin, but water cycle analyses are missing at high spatiotemporal resolution yield from a fully distributed hydrological model that closes water and energy budgets. In this paper, we describe the simulation of evapotranspiration (ET) and discharge at fine spatiotemporal resolution (500 m and 3 hourly) from 1979 to 2014, using the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Snow (CREST- SVAS) distributed hydrological model, which physically maintains water and energy balance. We also present a comparison of ET and discharge as derived from CREST with those simulated by other existing global models. Our results show that, where the global models perform well for specific hydrological components, ET, and discharge, CREST can simulate ET at 500 m resolution with 0.93 correlation coefficient, 0.81 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and -4.75\% bias (for daily scale) and discharge at different basin scales with NSE values ranging from 0.46 to 0.75. We performed cascade calibration for discharge and tested the optimized parameters on noncalibrated sites. The good model performance at the noncalibrated sites (NSE > 0.6; bias within 15\%) indicated the calibrated parameters can be used for ungauged locations. Finally, the terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) from CREST was also consistent with reference data and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). The hyper-resolution accurate hydrological components from CREST will enable effective prediction of water budget, helpful for initiating local and large-scale sustainable development plans that address social and policy requirements, as well as extreme climatic conditions.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, together with the globalization fact, an effort is given to rebuild the environment. These models have been developed without taking natural and ecological corruption in to consideration. They just take into account the economical growth, leading to economical and cultural demolition. In order to balance economical development and ecology, a sustainable development must be reassured. If real estate development projects are investigated, one usually observes that the balance between urbanization and sustainability is not protected. Since the importance of land and land management has not been understood well, those implemented projects without required pre-evaluations have caused problems in terms of urbanization and urban economy. In this study, Formula One (Fl) Istanbul Park Circuit real estate development project is evaluated considering relation of urbanization and sustainability. Evaluation of the project was made in terms of economy, changes in land use types, effects on real estate prices and contributions to the benefits of society. The changes of land use types were monitored using the time series of high-resolution satellite data, namely QUICKBIRD and IKONOS. Change detection methods were used for the analysis of similar to 50 km(2) area. Results show that 2,826 ha of the area, mainly having agricultural field land use types, appears to be open to urbanization. 1,268 ha area of green land including endemic vegetations is, under pressure of uncontrolled urbanization.},

Title = {Determinants of tourism participation of Yoruba traditional and festival of class (Eyo and Ojude-Oba) in southwestern Nigeria},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 7},
Abstract = {PurposeEvery community with the potential to organize a festival aims to actualize increased participation to transform the community image and socio-cultural cohesion. Hence, this study aims to investigate the motivational factors influencing festival participation of Eyo and Ojude Oba in southwestern Nigeria, using the push and pull and activity theories as theoretical footing. Design/methodology/approachPrimary data was collected through questionnaire administration on members of the host communities. Geospatial data was collected on the number of buildings through high-resolution satellite imagery and maps sourced from the Cooperative Information Network (COPINE) of the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA). Systematic sampling procedure was adopted to select 3\% of the estimated 5231 and 4,934 buildings within the designated zones in Lagos Island and Ijebu Ode, respectively. In this case, 314 and 148 respondents were sampled in Lagos Island and Ijebu-Ode, respectively. Data collected were analyzed using mean index and factor analysis (principal component analysis). FindingsThis study revealed that the factors influencing participation of Eyo and Ojude Oba festivals comprise six and three factors, respectively, with varying contributions. Eyo festival explained 75.34\% variance with varying factors extracted which are psychosocial (22.9\%), proximity/mobility (9.93\%), facility (13.41\%), environmental/cultural (12.2\%), demographic (10.65\%) and health/safety factors (6.25\%). While factors influencing Ojude-Oba festival comprises of sociocultural/psychological (35.44\%), facilities/mobility (28.00\%) and demographic factor (8.51\%), thereby explaining 71.95\% variation of factors influencing its participation. The study therefore, prove policy response in enhancing the destination receptors based on the influencing factors to promote positive words of mouth and encourage visitors' intention to revisit. Originality/valueThis study focused on two distinguished festivals with internal homogenous and external heterogeneous features (Eyo and Ojude-Oba festivals). Ojude-Oba is an annual festival of class, whereas Eyo is non-annual traditional festival. Both festivals are mega, with similarities in the activities engaged in by the visitors and members of the communities, inform of colorful display of costumes, dances, chanting of songs and group parades among other activities.},

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Cardiotocography data uncertainty is a critical task for the classification in biomedical field. Constructing good and efficient classifier via machine learning algorithms is necessary to help doctors in diagnosing the state of fetus heart rate. The proposed neutrosophic diagnostic system is an Interval Neutrosophic Rough Neural Network framework based on the backpropagation algorithm. It benefits from the advantages of neutrosophic set theory not only to improve the performance of rough neural networks but also to achieve a better performance than the other algorithms. The experimental results visualize the data using the boxplot for better understanding of attribute distribution. The performance measurement of the confusion matrix for the proposed framework is 95.1, 94.95, 95.2, and 95.1 concerning accuracy rate, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively. WEKA application is used to analyse cardiotocography data performance measurement of different algorithms, e.g., neural network, decision table, the nearest neighbor, and rough neural network. The comparison with other algorithms shows that the proposed framework is both feasible and efficient classifier. Additionally, the receiver operation characteristic curve displays the proposed framework classifications of the pathologic, normal, and suspicious states by 0.93, 0.90, and 0.85 areas that are considered high and acceptable under the curve, respectively. Improving the performance measurements of the proposed framework by removing ineffective attributes via feature selection would be suitable advancement in the future. Moreover, the proposed framework can also be used in various real-life problems such as classification of coronavirus, social media, and satellite image.},

Title = {The Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium - a protocol for building a national environmental exposure data platform for integrated analyses of urban form and health},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Multiple external environmental exposures related to residential location and urban form including, air pollutants, noise, greenness, and walkability have been linked to health impacts or benefits. The Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE) was established to facilitate the linkage of extensive geospatial exposure data to existing Canadian cohorts and administrative health data holdings. We hypothesize that this linkage will enable investigators to test a variety of their own hypotheses related to the interdependent associations of built environment features with diverse health outcomes encompassed by the cohorts and administrative data. Methods: We developed a protocol for compiling measures of built environment features that quantify exposure; vary spatially on the urban and suburban scale; and can be modified through changes in policy or individual behaviour to benefit health. These measures fall into six domains: air quality, noise, greenness, weather/climate, and transportation and neighbourhood factors; and will be indexed to six-digit postal codes to facilitate merging with health databases. Initial efforts focus on existing data and include estimates of air pollutants, greenness, temperature extremes, and neighbourhood walkability and socioeconomic characteristics. Key gaps will be addressed for noise exposure, with a new national model being developed, and for transportation-related exposures, with detailed estimates of truck volumes and diesel emissions now underway in selected cities. Improvements to existing exposure estimates are planned, primarily by increasing temporal and/or spatial resolution given new satellite-based sensors and more detailed national air quality modelling. Novel metrics are also planned for walkability and food environments, green space access and function and life-long climate-related exposures based on local climate zones. Critical challenges exist, for example, the quantity and quality of input data to many of the models and metrics has changed over time, making it difficult to develop and validate historical exposures. Discussion: CANUE represents a unique effort to coordinate and leverage substantial research investments and will enable a more focused effort on filling gaps in exposure information, improving the range of exposures quantified, their precision and mechanistic relevance to health. Epidemiological studies may be better able to explore the common theme of urban form and health in an integrated manner, ultimately contributing new knowledge informing policies that enhance healthy urban living.},

Title = {Formative evaluation of a telemedicine model for delivering clinical neurophysiology services part I: Utility, technical performance and service provider perspective},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: Formative evaluation is conducted in the early stages of system implementation to assess how it works in practice and to identify opportunities for improving technical and process performance. A formative evaluation of a teleneurophysiology service was conducted to examine its technical and sociological dimensions. Methods: A teleneurophysiology service providing routine EEG investigation was established. Service use, technical performance and satisfaction of clinical neurophysiology personnel were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. These were contrasted with a previously reported analysis of the need for teleneurophysiology, and examination of expectation and satisfaction with clinical neurophysiology services in Ireland. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis was also conducted. Results: Over the course of 40 clinical sessions during 20 weeks, 142 EEG investigations were recorded and stored on a file server at a satellite centre which was 130 miles away from the host clinical neurophysiology department. Using a virtual private network, the EEGs were accessed by a consultant neurophysiologist at the host centre for interpretation. The model resulted in a 5-fold increase in access to EEG services as well as reducing average waiting times for investigation by a half. Technically the model worked well, although a temporary loss of virtual private network connectivity highlighted the need for clarity in terms of responsibility for troubleshooting and repair of equipment problems. Referral quality, communication between host and satellite centres, quality of EEG recordings, and ease of EEG review and reporting indicated that appropriate organisational processes were adopted by the service. Compared to traditional CN service delivery, the teleneurophysiology model resulted in a comparable unit cost per EEG. Conclusion: Observations suggest that when traditional organisational boundaries are crossed challenges associated with the social dimension of service delivery may be amplified. Teleneurophysiology requires a governance and management that recognises its socio-technical nature.},

Title = {North Pacific and Arctic marine traffic dataset (2015-2020)},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present a spatially explicit dataset of monthly shipping intensity in the Pacific Arctic region from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. We calculated shipping intensity based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, a type of GPS transmitter required by the International Maritime Organization on all ships over 300 gross tonnes on an international voyage, all cargo ships over 500 gross tonnes, and all passenger ships. We used AIS data received by the exactEarth satellite constellation (64 satellites as of 2020), ensuring spatial coverage regardless of national jurisdiction or remoteness. Our analytical approach converted raw AIS input into monthly raster and vector datasets, separated by vessel type. We first filtered raw AIS messages to remove spurious records and GPS errors, then joined remaining vessel positional records with static messages including descriptive attributes. We further categorized these messages into one of four general ship types (cargo; tanker; fishing; and other). For the vector dataset, we spatially intersected AIS messages with a hexagon (hex) grid and calculated the number of unique ships, the number of unique ships per day (summed over each month), and the average and standard deviation of the speed over ground. We calculated these values for each month for all vessels as well as vessels subdivided by ship type and for messages from vessels > 65 feet long and traveling > 10 knots. For the raster dataset, we created a series of spatially explicit daily vessel tracks according to unique voyages and aggregated tracks by ship type and month. We then created a raster grid and calculated the total length, in meters, of all vessel tracks within each raster cell. These monthly datasets provide a critical snapshot of dynamic commercial and natural systems in the Pacific Arctic region. Recent declines in sea ice have lengthened the duration of the shipping season and have expanded the spatial coverage of large vessel routes, from the Aleutian Islands through the Bering Strait and into the southern Chukchi Sea. As vessel traffic has increased, the social and natural systems of these regions have been increasingly exposed to the risks posed by large ships, including oil spills, underwater noise pollution, large cetacean ship-strikes, and discharges of pollutants. This dataset provides scientific researchers, regulatory managers, local community members, maritime industry representatives, and other decision makers with a quantitative means to evaluate the distribution and intensity of shipping across space and through time.

Title = {On the Potential of Surfers to Monitor Environmental Indicators in the Coastal Zone},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {The social and economic benefits of the coastal zone make it one of the most treasured environments on our planet. Yet it is vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Coastal management aims to mitigate these pressures while augmenting the socio-economic benefits the coastal region has to offer. However, coastal management is challenged by inadequate sampling of key environmental indicators, partly due to issues relating to cost of data collection. Here, we investigate the use of recreational surfers as platforms to improve sampling coverage of environmental indicators in the coastal zone. We equipped a recreational surfer, based in the south west United Kingdom (UK), with a temperature sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) device that they used when surfing for a period of one year (85 surfing sessions). The temperature sensor was used to derive estimates of sea-surface temperature (SST), an important environmental indicator, and the GPS device used to provide sample location and to extract information on surfer performance. SST data acquired by the surfer were compared with data from an oceanographic station in the south west UK and with satellite observations. Our results demonstrate: (i) high-quality SST data can be acquired by surfers using low cost sensors; and (ii) GPS data can provide information on surfing performance that may help motivate data collection by surfers. Using recent estimates of the UK surfing population, and frequency of surfer participation, we speculate around 40 million measurements on environmental indicators per year could be acquired at the UK coastline by surfers. This quantity of data is likely to enhance coastal monitoring and aid UK coastal management. Considering surfing is a world-wide sport, our results have global implications and the approach could be expanded to other popular marine recreational activities for coastal monitoring of environmental indicators.},

Title = {Facilitating feral camel removal in Australia through commercial use},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {143-151},
Abstract = {Approximately 16.5\% of feral camel removal under the Australian Feral Camel Management Project (AFCMP) was by commercial means, via mustering for transport to abattoir (9.3\%) and pet-meating in the field (7.2\%). The challenges of commercial use of feral camels as a removal method include: variable density, mobility and distribution of the feral camel population; achieving landholder collaboration; accessibility to remote areas by road; availability of yard infrastructure and trucking capacity; and distance to slaughter facilities and end-markets. However, the AFCMP recognised commercial use as important to some Aboriginal communities, bringing a range of economic and social benefits as well as environmental outcomes in terms of reduced feral camel density. To facilitate mustering offtake, a removal assistance scheme was developed, whereby a formal landholder agreement was entered into with various legal requirements, including animal welfare. The agreement incentivised removal of both sexes: payments were for cow camels received at abattoir, but with a concurrent requirement for approximately equal sexes to be delivered to abattoir in an annual contract period. Additional project costs included contract development and oversight, landholder engagement, training and animal welfare auditing. Pet-meating, by way of ground culling and in-field butchering for meat storage in mobile refrigeration units, was also supported by the AFCMP via measures to increase harvest efficiency such as satellite tracking, aerial spotting and improved road access. However, pet-meating ceased mid-project due to changed industry demands. Post-AFCMP, mustering operations continue to service market demand for camel meat. The camel industry is also looking to camel farming to ensure greater continuity and quality of supply than can be achieved through wild harvest.},

Title = {Chemical condition and surface ozone in large cities of Texas during the last decade: Observational evidence from OMI, CAMS, and model analysis},

Abstract = {This paper presents a long-term (2005-2013) analysis of tropospheric NO2 and HCHO using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and surface ozone using the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations (CAMS) sites in large cities of Texas. Rather than focusing solely on seasonal changes, the authors consider other harmonic changes using Least Squares Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE), which reduces uncertainty in trends by 5-15\%. Tropospheric NO2 observed from OMI demonstrated a downward trend in Austin (-0.06 +/- 0.02 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.21 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.16 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Houston (-0.14 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), and San Antonio (-0.07 +/- 0.02 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)). These decreasing trends could be attributed to efficient emission control policies. The OMI HCHO observations exhibited both negative and positive annual trends in Austin (+0.09 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.01 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.04 +/- 0.04 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), Houston (-0.06 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)), and San Antonio (+0.01 +/- 0.03 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) yr(-1)) mainly resulting from differences in decreases in anthropogenic emissions, the impact of climatic variations and biogenic emissions. The discrepancy between the annual trends of HCHO and NO2 provides strong evidence that all of the cities gradually became more NOx-sensitive. We obtained the slope of HCHO/NO2 ratios (a proxy for chemical condition) from OMI for Austin (0.10 +/- 0.04 yr(-1)), Dallas (0.08 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), Fort Worth (0.07 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), Houston (0.06 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)), and San Antonio (0.08 +/- 0.03 yr(-1)) and investigate the 1-2 pm local time surface ozone patterns along with maximum, annual, and minimum trends in relation to changes in their precursors and prevailing chemical conditions. The surface levels of wintertime ozone measured by the CAMS network were seen to increase in Austin (0.90 +/- 0.53 ppbv yr(-1)), Dallas (0.62 +/- 0.53 ppbv yr(-1)), Fort Worth (0.59 +/- 0.40 ppbv yr(-1)), Houston (0.56 +/- 0.55 ppbv yr(-1)), and San Antonio (0.64 +/- 0.54 ppbv yr(-1)) because of the reduction in the amount of ozone quenched through NO titration. Summertime ozone surface mixing ratio trends are mainly governed by NO2 annual trends as Well as climatic influences. We obtained the downward annual trend of the ozone mixing ratio from CAMS observations for Austin (-0.27 +/- 0.17 ppbv yr(-1)), Dallas (-0.41 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), Fort Worth (-0.55 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), Houston (-0.53 +/- 0.18 ppbv yr(-1)), and San Antonio (-0.03 +/- 0.16 ppbv yr(-1)). The results show that prevailing chemical conditions control the annual trends of surface ozone. While Austin and San Antonio exhibited similar declines in OMI NO2 levels, a more prevailing NOx-sensitive regime over Austin resulted in its greater sensitivity to NO2 changes. The dominant NOx-saturated regime over Dallas, however, led to its lower sensitivity to high annual downward trends of OMI NO2. To investigate the impact of reductions in ozone precursors on surface ozone, we employ the WRF-Chem regional model to simulate NO2, HCHO, and O-3 levels in September 2013 in two scenarios using National Emissions Inventory 2005 (NEI-2005) and NEI-2011 anthropogenic emissions. The model describes a decrease in ozone levels from the first to second scenario in Dallas (3\%) and Forth Worth (0.5\%) but an increase in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston (0.7\%, 0.8\%, and 7\%, respectively), which may be attributed to uncertainty in VOC concentrations and overestimation of NO in the NEI-2005 inventory that led to inaccurate HCHO/NO2 ratios. The results indicate that the emission uncertainties should be constrained to better inform emissions control policy based on air quality modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the fuel properties into the wildfire spreading capacity index (WSCI), which originally relies on multi-criteria of social, hydro-meteorological, and geo-physical character of the context. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Tree Cover Density (TCD), and land cover type are launched as indicators of fuel properties of the vegetated surfaces being indexed. The materials and software utilized here belong to a variety of open sources. CORINE Land Cover (CLC), Open Street Map (OSM), TCD via Copernicus high resolution data, and multispectral satellite images via Landsat 8 (Semi-Automatic Classification PluginSCP) are utilized as raw materials in a workflow in QGIS software. The study area is Montenegro, a Mediterranean territory prone to wildfire risk. Following the inventory stage, the indexing method relies on a normalizing procedure in QGIS and the assignment of weighted impact factor to each criterion via analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The WSCI value is derived as the sum of the products between the normalized class and the respective weighted impact factor of each criterion. The validation phase relies on ROC curve of WSCI values utilizing burned areas as positive cases. The results show high wildfire spreading capacities of vegetated areas of significant socio-economic and environmental profile such as the coastal zone along Adriatic Sea and the trans-boundary regions as part of Balkan Green Belt. Besides the methodological improvements the results of this work deliver tangible outputs in support of forest fire risk reduction means within disaster risk management and fire safety agendas in Montenegro.},

Title = {Radius based domain clustering for WiFi indoor positioning},
Journal = {SENSOR REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-60},
Abstract = {Purpose - Nowadays, WiFi indoor positioning based on received signal strength (RSS) becomes a research hotspot due to its low cost and ease of deployment characteristics. To further improve the performance of WiFi indoor positioning based on RSS, this paper aims to propose a novel position estimation strategy which is called radius-based domain clustering (RDC). This domain clustering technology aims to avoid the issue of access point (AP) selection. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed positioning approach uses each individual AP of all available APs to estimate the position of target point. Then, according to circular error probable, the authors search the decision domain which has the 50 per cent of the intermediate position estimates and minimize the radius of a circle via a RDC algorithm. The final estimate of the position of target point is obtained by averaging intermediate position estimates in the decision domain. Findings - Experiments are conducted, and comparison between the different position estimation strategies demonstrates that the new method has a better location estimation accuracy and reliability. Research limitations/implications - Weighted k nearest neighbor approach and Naive Bayes Classifier method are two classic position estimation strategies for location determination using WiFi fingerprinting. Both of the two strategies are affected by AP selection strategies and inappropriate selection of APs may degrade positioning performance considerably. Practical implications - The RDC positioning approach can improve the performance of WiFi indoor positioning, and the issue of AP selection and related drawbacks is avoided. Social implications - The RSS-based effective WiFi indoor positioning system can makes up for the indoor positioning weaknesses of global navigation satellite system. Many indoor location-based services can be encouraged with the effective and low-cost positioning technology. Originality/value - A novel position estimation strategy is introduced to avoid the AP selection problem in RSS-based WiFi indoor positioning technology, and the domain clustering technology is proposed to obtain a better accuracy and reliability.},

Title = {Keynote - Total Design Data Needs for the New Generation Large-Scale Activity Microsimulation Models},
Booktitle = {TRANSPORT SURVEY METHODS: BEST PRACTICE FOR DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {21-45},
Abstract = {Purpose - In this paper we describe a total design data collection method (expanding the definition of the usual ``total design'' terminology used in typical household travel surveys) to emphasize the need to describe individual and group behaviors embedded within their spatial, temporal, and social contexts. Methodology/approach - We first offer an overview of recently developed modeling and simulation applications predominantly in North America followed by a summary of the data needs in typical modeling and simulation modules for statewide and regional travel demand forecasting. We then proceed to describe an ideal data collection scheme with core and satellite survey components that can inform current and future model building. Mention is also made to the currently implemented California Household Travel Survey that brings together multiple agencies, modeling goals, and data collection component surveys. Findings - The preparation of this paper involved reviewing emerging transportation modeling approaches and paradigms, policy questions, and behavioral issues and considerations that are important in the multimodal transportation planning context. It was found that many of the questions being asked of policy makers in the transportation domain require a deep understanding of the interactions and constraints under which individuals make activity-travel choices, the learning processes at play, and the attitudes and perceptions that shape ways in which people adjust their travel behavior in response to policy interventions. Based on the work, it was found that many of the traditional travel survey designs are not able to provide the comprehensive data needed to estimate activity-based model systems that truly capture the full range of behavioral considerations and phenomena of importance. Originality/value of paper - This paper offers a review of the emerging transportation modeling approaches and behavioral paradigms of importance in activity-based travel demand forecasting. The paper discusses how traditional travel survey designs are inadequate to meet the data needs of emerging modeling approaches. Based on a review of all of the data needs and new data collection methods that are making it possible to observe a full range of human behaviors, the paper offers a total survey data collection design that brings together many different surveys and data collection protocols. The core household travel survey is augmented by a full slate of special purpose surveys that together yield a rich behavioral database for activity-based microsimulation modeling. The paper is a valuable reference for transportation planners and modelers interested in developing data collection enterprises that will feed the next generation of transportation models.},

Abstract = {The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) operates and maintains 55 Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) buoys in the equatorial Pacific Ocean from 9 degrees N latitude to 8 degrees S latitude and 95 degrees W longitude to 165 degrees E longitude. The TAO array was developed after the need was determined following the 1982-1983 El Nino event, which had evaded detection by the science community until well into its maturity. NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) is an interdisciplinary organization whose focal point is collecting open ocean data for monitoring and predicting purposes. PMEL's TAO project was created with help from NOAA's Equatorial Pacific Ocean Climate Studies (EPOCS) program to enhance the understanding and prediction of El Nino and La Nina events. PMEL completed the TAO array in December of 1994 and in 2005, PMEL began transitioning the TAO array (55 TAO buoys and four Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs)) to NDBC, first in data management and quality control (QC) and later in next-generation creation and implementation of buoys. The technology equipping the TAO array has become obsolescent. Many components are no longer offered or supported by manufacturers, and to maintain the continuity of the TAO array a technological ``refresh{''} was necessary. The data logger and the temperature-conductivity sensors are two of the major refreshed components. Maximum cost-effectiveness was a high priority in the refresh effort. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) underwater temperature-conductivity sensors were utilized, as well as a new all-purpose data collection system, the Advanced Modular Payload System (AMPS), and a new Short Burst Data (SBD) Iridium (R) (Iridium Communications Inc.) data transmission process. Developed by NDBC, AMPS is also presently deployed on many of NDBC's real-time weather buoys. The refresh effort began in 2006. Since May 2007, NDBC has tested TAO refresh systems to determine their capacity to replace PMEL's Autonomous Temperature Line Acquisition System (ATLAS) buoy, which communicates over the Service Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS) system. Refresh buoys are configured to transmit high-resolution (10-minute) data hourly over the SBD Iridium satellite system, providing a capability only available previously following delayed mode processing. Lab sensor comparisons were conducted between ATLAS and refresh sensors and the performance was found to be favorable. Refresh buoys have been deployed within 10 km of nearby ATLAS buoys for direct comparisons of data quality and data availability. COTS have been proven effective in the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) TRIangle Trans-Ocean buoy Network (TRITON) array. With COTS and AMPS both used across NDBC weather and ocean stations, the maintainability, reliability, continuity, and availability of environmental data will be maximized. Presented are the results of real-time refresh data availability studies, NDBC's deployment plan, and how NDBC's Data Assembly Center (DAC) will handle the changes in data processing. From June 1, 2010 to June 1, 2011, the refresh buoys at 5 degrees S 140 degrees W, 8 degrees N 155 degrees W, 2 degrees S 170 degrees W, 2 degrees S 165 degrees E, and 8 degrees S 165 degrees E provided high data availability percentages proving that the refresh system can provide data reliability as a replacement for the legacy buoys. NDBC plans to deploy refresh systems in place of legacy systems beginning in August 2011. The abundance of new data made available in real-time presents new challenges for quality control efforts of data in the DAC. One challenge is inductive noise associated with sensors located on the inductive line and new Environmental Quality Control (EQC) limits to address them. It is estimated that the refresh effort of all TAO buoys in the Pacific array will be completed by the end of 2015.},

Title = {Longitudinal access and exposure to green-blue spaces and individual-level mental health and well-being: protocol for a longitudinal, population-wide record-linked natural experiment},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction Studies suggest that access and exposure to green-blue spaces (GBS) have beneficial impacts on mental ealth. However, the evidence base is limited with respect to longitudinal studies. The main aim of this longitudinal, population-wide, record-linked natural experiment, is to model the daily lived experience by linking GBS accessibility indices, residential GBS exposure and health data; to enable quantification of the impact of GBS on well-being and common mental health disorders, for a national population. Methods and analysis This research will estimate the impact of neighbourhood GBS access, GBS exposure and visits to GBS on the risk of common mental health conditions and the opportunity for promoting subjective well-being (SWB); both key priorities for public health. We will use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to create quarterly household GBS accessibility indices and GBS exposure using digital map and satellite data for 1.4 million homes in Wales, UK (2008-2018). We will link the GBS accessibility indices and GBS exposures to individual-level mental health outcomes for 1.7 million people with general practitioner (GP) data and data from the National Survey for Wales (n=similar to 12 000) on well-being in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. We will examine if these associations are modified by multiple sociophysical variables, migration and socioeconomic disadvantage. Subgroup analyses will examine associations by different types of GBS. This longitudinal study will be augmented by cross-sectional research using survey data on self-reported visits to GBS and SWB. Ethics and dissemination All data will be anonymised and linked within the privacy protecting SAIL Databank. We will be using anonymised data and therefore we are exempt from National Research Ethics Committee (NREC). An Information Governance Review Panel (IGRP) application (Project ID: 0562) to link these data has been approved. The research programme will be undertaken in close collaboration with public/patient involvement groups. A multistrategy programme of dissemination is planned with the academic community, policy-makers, practitioners and the public.},

Title = {BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS},
Booktitle = {MAXIMIZING BROADBAND SERVICES TO RURAL COMMUNITIES},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {35-67},
Abstract = {The ``digital divide{''} is a term that has been used to characterize a gap between ``information haves and have-nots,{''} or in other words, between those Americans who use or have access to telecommunications technologies (e.g., telephones, computers, the Internet) and those who do not. One important subset of the digital divide debate concerns high-speed Internet access, also known as broadband. Broadband is provided by a series of technologies (e.g., cable, telephone wire, fiber, satellite, wireless) that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds far greater than current ``dial-up{''} Internet access over traditional telephone lines. Broadband technologies are currently being deployed primarily by the private sector throughout the United States. While the numbers of new broadband subscribers continue to grow, studies and data suggest that the rate of broadband deployment in urban and high income areas may be outpacing deployment in rural and low-income areas. Some policymakers, believing that disparities in broadband access across American society could have adverse economic and social consequences on those left behind, assert that the federal government should play a more active role to avoid a ``digital divide{''} in broadband access. One approach is for the federal government to provide financial assistance to support broadband deployment in underserved areas. Others, however, believe that federal assistance for broadband deployment is not appropriate. Some opponents question the reality of the ``digital divide,{''} and argue that federal intervention in the broadband marketplace would be premature and, in some cases, counterproductive. Legislation introduced in the 1 10(th) Congress seeks to provide federal financial assistance for broadband deployment in the form of grants, loans, subsidies, and tax credits. Of particular note is the reauthorization and reform of the Rural Utilities Service broadband loan program, which was enacted as part of the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-234). Legislation to reform universal service - which could impact the amount of financial assistance available for broadband deployment in rural areas - has been introduced (H.R. 42, H.R. 2054, H.R. 3428, H.R. 6320, H.R. 6356, S. 10 1, S. 711), as well as other broadband legislation (H.R. 1818, H.R. 2035, H.R. 2174, H.R. 2272, H.R. 2419, H.R. 2569, H.R. 2720, H.R. 2764, H.R. 2953, H.R. 3246, H.R. 3281, H.R. 3627, H.R. 3893, H.R. 3919, H.R. 5682, S. 541, S. 761, S. 1032, S. 1190, S. 1264, S. 1439, S. 1492, S. 2242, S. 2302). In assessing such legislation, several policy issues arise. For example, is the current status of broadband deployment data an adequate basis on which to base policy decisions? Is federal assistance premature, or do the risks of delaying assistance to underserved areas outweigh the benefits of avoiding federal intervention in the marketplace? And finally, if one assumes that governmental action is necessary to spur broadband deployment in underserved areas, which specific approaches, either separately or in combination, are likely to be most effective?},

Abstract = {Dynamic processes such as environmental, economic, and social factors influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes, with temporal and spatial variations. This study aims to identify changes in LULC and predict future trends in the Pakhal Lake area in Peninsular India. Satellite images for the years from 2016 to 2022 were used for LULC classification using deep learning with Sentinel - 2 imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Dynamic World dataset is used to classify the LULC changes of the study area with a 10 m near-real-time dataset. Images were classified based on six different LULC classes, namely water, vegetation, flooded vegetation, agriculture, built-up area, and bare land. The Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA - ANN) technique was used to predict LULC changes. QGIS plugin MOLUSCE with Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), was used to predict and determine potential LULC changes for 2025 and 2028. The overall Kappa coefficient value of 0.78, and an accuracy of 82\% indicated good results for LULC changes and projected maps for 2025. Prediction of LULC changes using MLP - ANN for the years 2025 and 2028 showed increase in agriculture, built-up areas, and barren land. The results of the study will be useful to develop better management techniques of natural resources.},

Title = {ROAD MAP OF EVOLUTION OF NICNET TOWARDS GLOBALIZATION OF COMPUTER-COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {A view is advocated here that the application of computers and communication as an integrated technology, has more impact on social and economic development than computer technology alone or communication technology alone. As social and economic interaction cannot be localised artificially in a world moving towards a `global village', globalisation of computer-communication networks will become the major enabling instrument for this evolution. The evolution of NICNET, the computer communication nework of the National Informatic Centre, is so oriented that such an integration and globalisation is progressively impelemented utilising the latest low cost technologies available in the international market. Tracing the evolution of NICNET from its genesis in 1985, the choice of the various technologies to date, and, the road map for NICNET till 2000 AD is projected in step with the forecasting of technological evolution towards integration and globalisation of computer and communication resources. The choice of Spread Spectrum Multiple Access/Code Division Multiple Access (SSMA/COMA) based Very Small Aperture Terminal (VAST) Satellite Earth Station technology is discussed to support the contention that VAST Technology enabled the first level of integration and globalisation between 1985 and 1992. Discussing the inevitability of the Ku/Ka band choice for the next level of integration and globalisation, the potential of Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) based `hubles' VASTs with two-way as well as data broadcast capabilities and dedicated high speed external gateways is outlined as the second essential step in the integration and globalisation while at the same time, realising a NICNET Info-Highway during the period 1993 to 1997. On the ground segment, special technologies for effectively linking widely separated local area networks, network FAX and image server and multimedia communication services are proposed. Special features for accommodating a large number or close user groups and offering virtual private networks can increase the propensity for the spread of the IT culture as well as prod the growth of demand. During the period from 1986 to 2001, certain concepts of future space data networks are forecast which can propell NICNET to the third level of integration and globalisation. Based on the concept of NICSAT earlier conceptualised, a series of very low cost microsats will be launched for an internally operable dedicated space data network with user end to end communication capability, built in features for promoting specialised value added services, built in access security and expert system based network management. Low cost on-board features, a versatile space link scenario and a low cost ground infrastructure scenario are suggested. The possibility of introducing BISDN via such a satellite cluster are examined. Towards the end of the decade, NICNET will be incrementally converted for providing global intelligent network services over a strong skeleton of data super highway utilising the concept of application gateway in a global intelligent network, the interoperability of the service management systems, service creation environment and operation systems as well as support the interaction of the intelligent network components for intra-network and inter-network cases. The intelligent network architecture proposed is explicitly designed to support personal communication services on a global basis.},

Title = {Terrestrial and groundwater storage characteristics and their quantification in the Chitral (Pakistan) and Kabul (Afghanistan) river basins using GRACE/GRACE-FO satellite data},
Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In Pakistan and Afghanistan, intensive groundwater abstraction has accelerated socioeconomic development, but it also endangers the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources. Sustainable water resource management throughout river basins requires a spatiotemporal analysis of groundwater storage changes, but continuous groundwater monitoring is critical while there are few observation wells in the Chitral Kabul River Basin (CKRB). Therefore, this study uses total water storage (TWS) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-on (GRACE-FO) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model water storage components, such as surface runoff (Qs), soil moisture content (SMS), and snow water equivalent (SWE) to determine the characteristics of groundwater storage (GWS) variations from 2003 to 2021. The seasonal decomposition LOESS method (STL) was used to assess the long-term trend, seasonal trend, and associated uncertainty of TWS and GWS time-series, while Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator was used to detect and quantify the increasing and decreasing trend values of TWS and GWS time-series. The results showed that TWS indicated a general decreasing trend of -3.67 \& PLUSMN; 0.98 mm/month while GWS indicated a harsh declining trend of -7.83 \& PLUSMN; 0.52 mm/month from 2003 to 2021 in CKRB. The validation of GRACE-derived GWS results showed a correlation of R2 = 0.47 in comparison to in situ GWS. Spatially and temporally, according to sub-basins of CKRB, the more severe decline of TWS in Chitral-Kunar (-2.66 mm/year) and GWS in Swat (-4.34 mm/year) was observed. This research would be insightful to estimate the agroeconomic impact of the intensive ground-water in CKRB and its sub-basins.},

Title = {Seasonal variations of park visitor volume and park service area in Tokyo: A mixed-method approach combining big data and field observations},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urban green and open space are important components of achieving the goal of planning sustainable cities, by offering health benefits to urban dwellers and providing socio-economic and environmental benefits to society. Recent literature studied the usage of urban parks, however, few has addressed seasonal fluctuations of park visitor volume, let alone seasonal variations of home-park travel distances and park service areas. This paper not only empirically shows the seasonal variations of park visits but also examines links between the park visit patterns and spatial characteristics of the case parks. Applying spatial analysis methods to location data of over 1 million anonymous mobile phone samples collected from January to December 2011, we analyzed the seasonal variations in six medium-sized urban parks, of which size falls under the category of `district parks,' in central Tokyo. We also conducted content analysis of a Japanese place review website to understand visitor perceptions of the case parks. On the other hand, park spatial characteristics data were collected and summarized through various ways including field observation and satellite image analysis. The results show that (1) while notable seasonal variations of park visitor volume and park service area existed in all case parks, the degree of variation also differed from park to park; (2) spatial characteristics of parks were closely interlinked to seasonal cultural events, to visitor perceptions, and consequently to seasonal fluctuations of the park visit patterns. Lessons learned from the policy perspective include highly diverse user groups visit these medium-sized urban parks than what the typical guidelines assume, and seasonal patterns of their visits considerably vary from park to park, interacting with spatial characteristics of the parks. Hence, the urban park planning process should consider specific and detailed characteristics of parks and allocate resources to respond to dynamic park visit patterns beyond generic guidelines.},

Abstract = {The future agriculture must maintain biodiversity and assure food production by the implementation ofdurableinnovative technologies. It is important to use innovative methods in order to determine the traceability of animal products as the concept of bio-economy supposesthe reduction of external marginal costs with the increase of social benefit by the reduction of the bio-resources used. The private marginal benefit for each animal breeder is also represented by the corrective subvention of 10 curos/animal and the co-operation with the sanitary-veterinary authorities leads to the increase of positive externalities. These external marginal benefits must be promoted and supported for an optimal time so as to eliminate sick animals from each EU country. The research team used advanced tools to identify the traceability of the food products (meat or milk) from different breeds as well as the traceability of certain traditional products by molecular tests based on the identification, amplification of nucleic acids for the traceability of food products (by PCR techniques). Several methods for the determination of genetic traceability were tested and applied. The best of all seems to be the DNA analysis as ``Genetic Fingerprinting{''}, which can be found in each cell and more recently, the micro-satellite analysis. This scientific paper presents the results of research concerning the determination of genotypes by microsatellite genetic markers, collecting and preserving the tissue samples by Typi Fix method as well as the influence of positive externalities, which have a role in substantiating the decisions to put into practice certain scientific research results (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {DMSP/OLS NTL image could offer an economically efficient and reliable solution to estimate the time lag of real estate development.The Chinese real estate industry has experienced rapid growth since China's economic reform. Along with a booming industry, a third of purchased lands were left undeveloped in the last decade. Knowledge of real estate development time lags between land being purchased and property being occupied can enable policymakers to produce more effective policies and regulations to guide the real estate industry and sustain economic development and social welfare. This paper presents an innovative method to estimate provincial land development time lags in China using DMSP/OLS NTL imagery and real estate statistical data. The results showed that real estate development time lag was common in China during 2000-2010. More than half of the study sites showed development time lags of three years or longer. An Increment of Developed Pixels (IDP) index was established to outline yearly land development completions in China between 2000 and 2010. A Comprehensive Real Estate Price Index (CREPI) was created to explore the causes of the time lags. A strong and positive correlation was found between the real estate development time lags and CREPI values (with r = 0.619, n = 31, p < 0.0005). The results indicated that the land development time lag during the study period was positively correlated to the activity of the local real estate market, the price trend of land and housing properties, and the local economic situation. The results also proved that with the support of statistical data the},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to determine the amount and value of carbon stock in Southwestern Ethiopia's coffee forest from 1978 to 2050, as well as carbon sequestration from 1988 to 2050. Different time-series satellite data were acquired and classified into land-use categories using ArcGIS and ENVI 5:0, followed by IDRISI forecasts up to 2050, and finally modeling with INVEST. Data were collected within the plot constructed in a systematic random sampling manner using quadrates 20 m X 20 m. The social cost of carbon (US\$12/tCO(2)e) used to estimate the monetary worth of the services. Forest conversion anticipated to reduce the carbon stock by 1.86 Mt by the end of 2050, from 65.8 Mt in 1978 to 7.01 Mt in 2018. The rate of Carbon sequestration was 2.1Mt/year at the end of 1998, and it will be reduced to 1.49Mt/year by the end of 2050. Overall, 121.1Mt of CO2 is sequestered over 63 years, but there was also emission from deforestation and service loss (84.4Mt), resulting a net sequestered CO2 of 36.6Mt by the end of 2050. The total elemental carbon stock value in 1978 was \$2. 896 billion, this will be reached \$2.5billion (\$9.175 billion CO(2)e) at the end of 2050. The value of sequestration will be estimated at \$1.715 billion, but with a value loss of \$1.153 billion, the net sink value from 1988 to 2050 will be \$0.6 billion. In general, these findings show that the forest region will have a total storage and sequestration value (CO(2)e) of \$9.775 billion by the end of 2050. The carbon worth in this forest area is thus a good indicator of the importance, and thus the value estimate here may well persuade policymakers to revise their forest-related policy and provide site-specific information to preserve this remnant forest.},

Title = {Quantifying the impacts of land use/land cover change on groundwater depletion in Northwestern China - A case study of the Dunhuang oasis},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the Dunhuang oasis in the arid Northwest China has been undergoing significant changes due to social-economic development and expanded irrigation for agricultural production. Groundwater table was found to have significantly declined during the period of 1987-2007 owing to greater pumping. We analyzed the impacts of land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes on the groundwater fluctuations in the study area. The LU/LC types were derived from the satellite images for the years of 1987, 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2007. The water consumptions associated with the LU/LC types were estimated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith method. Results show that during the period of 1987-2007, the area of agricultural land sharply increased by 98.7 km(2), and the cash crops were the main contributor. Under the current market system, farmers had much more autonomy and greater incentives to shift the cropping pattern from the traditional food crops to the high value cash crops with greater water consumption. The total water consumption of the cash crops accounted for 14.1\% of the total water consumption in 1987, but increased to 71.6\% in 2007, becoming the largest water consumer. The agricultural land use was the main cause of the declining groundwater table during the period from 1987 to 2007. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Heterogeneous accountingisation Accounting and inter-organisational cooperation in home care services},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1080-1112},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the effects of the increased influence of accounting on core values and practices within the services providing home care in Sweden a public sector setting involving inter-organisational cooperation. Design/methodology/approach - Case study data were obtained primarily through semi-structured interviews with managers and front-line staff involved in home care. Findings - When accountingisation is extended to include inter-organisational cooperation, a form of heterogeneous accountingisation occurred in the home care services: an internal domain (with a low level of accountingisation) could be differentiated from an inter-organisational domain (with a high level of accountingisation). When the accounting-induced disturbances intensified, there was a redefinition of core values. In the internal domain, core values of pensioner-oriented focus and flexibility during service delivery persisted. In contrast, in the inter-organisational domain, core values had the legal boundaries of the organisation as their central foundation, standardisation was emphasised, and inter-organisational work practices were defined as the other organisation's responsibility. The findings also extend the research on absorption groups by indicating the rise of a new type of absorption process. Absorption was not undertaken by a few individuals, specialist work groups or satellite organisations, as described in the literature; instead, all front-line welfare professionals were involved in absorbing the accounting-induced disturbances when performing their tasks. Research limitations/implications - This case study research is context-specific and the meaning and consequences of accountingisation may differ within the public sector because of the status and strength of professional groups concerned. Originality/value - To date, research on accountingisation has primarily employed an intra-organisational perspective. This paper analyses accountingisation in an inter-organisational setting.},

Title = {Role of the surface electrocardiogram in developing countries},

Abstract = {The surface electrocardiogram (ECG) is a basic cardiac investigation delivering information not only regarding heart rhythm but also regarding ischemic disease, effects of hypertension, congenital syndromes, and cardiomyopathies. These may determine decisions regarding follow-up investigations or treatment. The ECG fulfils several characteristics of a good screening test: it is rapid, is noninvasive, requires minimal technical expertise to perform, and is inexpensive. However, its interpretation requires highly trained physicians. In industrialized nations, the test is performed routinely in outpatient clinics and hospitals frequently in conjunction with further cardiac imaging. Developing nations confront a different situation. Urbanized segments may access ECG testing similarly to industrialized countries. However, in a country such as India, 80\% of population is rural and poor. Less than 30\% of physicians are rurally located, and most are primary care physicians. Access to medical care is limited by sparse and underresourced medical facilities and personnel, poorer socioeconomic status, ignorance of disease, and lack of motivation to seek health care. The ECG may be the only affordable cardiac test for this population, but poor communications (transport, telephone) hamper access. Initiatives to overcome these obstacles are being undertaken in some model situations. For example in Bangalore, India, use of mobile vans equipped with satellite terminals (aided by the Indian Space Research Organization) permits transmission of ECGs from rural points to central urban hospitals for physician interpretation. The physician community has responsibilities of improving the diagnostic yield from the ECG. Rural communities have a different spectrum of diseases with lesser coronary artery disease and greater incidence of valvular disease. The ECG has different roles in these diseases. (In contrast, urban communities in the same country experience diseases of industrialized nations.) Electrocardiogram interpretation also needs to account for different ``normal{''} values in different ethnic groups: there is a surprising dearth of such data in groups other than African Americans. This is essential for interpretation of abnormality. Development of additional sophisticated analyses from ECG data may guide more selective use of expensive and invasive therapies. For example, risk stratification for defibrillator implant may be enhanced by use of T-wave alternans and heart rate variability. In China, ischemia monitoring with 12-lead Holters is performed due to lack of availability of a chest pain clinic. Innovative measures in electrocardiography are required for improving health care delivery in developing nations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The strategic positioning and configuration of national mapping organisations as enablers of economic and social growth in South Africa},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {41-55},

Abstract = {This paper explores the transferability and application of business-driven strategic thinking to that of a public sector context, namely national mapping organisations. These organisations exist throughout the world because the economies of the world require geospatial information to support economic and social growth. As such their strategic positioning within government is of prime importance. In South Africa, however, there is a paucity of knowledge in this regard and consequently triggered the research which forms the basis of this paper. A macro-environmental analysis suggests significant growth opportunities for the South African geospatial industry, fuelled by a micro-industry borne out of the 2010 Soccer World Cup event. A profile description of the characteristics of consequence, boundaries between the private and public the industry and expected changes reflect a large industry which is expanding at a rapid rate but is fragmented and displays a complex network-system of inter and intra-industry relationships. As such it is attracting increasing numbers of competitors but, as an industry, appears to be slow to adjust to technological advancement. An internal analysis of the value chain of the National Mapping Organisation (NMO), the single most important player in the local public sector geospatial industry, reveals significant value creation in its in-house activities. However, the external deconstructed operations, outbound logistics and procurement processes are not allowing the organisation to realise any benefits from efficiencies it may introduce. Key to achieving efficiencies lies in the human capital, which by all accounts, it is failing to retain. Future strategic thrusts for the NMO have been identified by constructing a SWOT model and by analysing its relative competitive strength. These thrusts were found to concentrate on actions and themes related to staff, communication, marketing, general management, production (cost and capacity) and product (quality and innovation). Interpreting and applying those themes on an interorganisational basis will enable the NMO to best position itself in the industry. In this regard sufficient related strategic fit is evident between the value chains of the NMO, The Satellite Application Centre (SAC) and Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), enabling the NMO to leverage on the sales, marketing and distribution activities of SAC and the financial leveraging capabilities of Stats SA. This paper has presented an example of how delivering an efficient and effective service delivery may be hampered through the inappropriate strategic configuration of South African public sector activities. It is therefore suggested that the government revisits the strategic positioning of public sector organisations engaged in the provision of geospatial information.},

Title = {Head-cut gully erosion susceptibility mapping in semi-arid region using machine learning methods: insight from the high atlas, Morocco},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Gully erosion has been identified in recent decades as a global threat to people and property. This problem also affects the socioeconomic stability of societies and therefore limits their sustainable development, as it impacts a nonrenewable resource on a human scale, namely, soil. The focus of this study is to evaluate the prediction performance of four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), and the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), which are novel approaches in gully erosion modeling research, particularly in semi-arid regions with a mountainous character. 204 samples of erosion areas and 204 samples of non-erosion areas were collected through field surveys and high-resolution satellite images, and 17 significant factors were considered. The dataset cells of samples (70\% for training and 30\% for testing) were randomly prepared to assess the robustness of the different models. The functional relevance between soil erosion and effective factors was computed using the ML models. The ML models were evaluated using different metrics, including accuracy, the kappa coefficient. kNN is the ideal model for this study. The value of the AUC from ROC considering the testing datasets of KNN is 0.93; the remaining models are associated to ideal AUC and are similar to kNN in terms of values. The AUC values from ROC of GLM, LDA, and CART for testing datasets are 0.90, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively. The value of accuracy considering the validation datasets of LDA, CART, KNN, and GLM are 0.85, 0.82, 0.89, 0.84 respectively. The values of Kappa of LDA, CART, and GLM for testing datasets are 0.70, 0.65, and 0.68, respectively. ML models, in particular KNN, GLM, and LDA, have achieved outstanding results in terms of creating soil erosion susceptibility maps. The maps created with the most reliable models could be a useful tool for sustainable management, watershed conservation and prevention of soil and water losses.},

Title = {Land use and climate change impacts on the hydrology of the upper Mara River Basin, Kenya: results of a modeling study to support better resource management},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Some of the most valued natural and cultural landscapes on Earth lie in river basins that are poorly gauged and have incomplete historical climate and runoff records. The Mara River Basin of East Africa is such a basin. It hosts the internationally renowned Mara-Serengeti landscape as well as a rich mixture of indigenous cultures. The Mara River is the sole source of surface water to the landscape during the dry season and periods of drought. During recent years, the flow of the Mara River has become increasingly erratic, especially in the upper reaches, and resource managers are hampered by a lack of understanding of the relative influence of different sources of flow alteration. Uncertainties about the impacts of future climate change compound the challenges. We applied the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the response of the headwater hydrology of the Mara River to scenarios of continued land use change and projected climate change. Under the data-scarce conditions of the basin, model performance was improved using satellite-based estimated rainfall data, which may also improve the usefulness of runoff models in other parts of East Africa. The results of the analysis indicate that any further conversion of forests to agriculture and grassland in the basin headwaters is likely to reduce dry season flows and increase peak flows, leading to greater water scarcity at critical times of the year and exacerbating erosion on hillslopes. Most climate change projections for the region call for modest and seasonally variable increases in precipitation (5-10\%) accompanied by increases in temperature (2.5-3.5 degrees C). Simulated runoff responses to climate change scenarios were non-linear and suggest the basin is highly vulnerable under low (-3\%) and high (+25\%) extremes of projected precipitation changes, but under median projections (+7\%) there is little impact on annual water yields or mean discharge. Modest increases in precipitation are partitioned largely to increased evapotranspiration. Overall, model results support the existing efforts of Mara water resource managers to protect headwater forests and indicate that additional emphasis should be placed on improving land management practices that enhance infiltration and aquifer recharge as part of a wider program of climate change adaptation.},

Abstract = {As an important development direction of GIS, Virtual Reality GIS was founded in 1950s. After 1990s, due to the fast development of its theory and the computer technology, Virtual Reality has been applied to many fields: military, aerospace, design, manufactory, information management, business, construction, city management, medical, education, etc.. The most famous project is the Virtual Los Angeles implemented by the Urban Simulation Team (UST) of UCLA. The main focus of the UST is a long-term effort to build a real-time Virtual Reality model of the entire Los Angeles basin for use by architects, urban planners, emergency response teams, and the government entities. When completed, the entire Virtual L.A. model will cover an area well in excess of 10000 square miles and will elegantly scale from satellite images to street level views accurate enough to allow the signs in the window of the shops and the graffiti on the walls to be legible. Till now, the virtual L.A. has been applied to urban environments and design analysis, transportation studies, historic reconstruction and education, etc. Compared to the early development abroad, the development of Virtual Reality GIS in China is relatively late. It is researched in some universities in early years. But recently, it has been attended by the populace and been used in many social fields: urban planning, environmental protection, historic protection and recovery, real estate, tourism, education etc.. The application of Virtual Reality in urban planning of Huangdao District, Qingdao City is introduced in this paper. As a newly built district, great change has taken place in Huangdao district in recent years. In the backdrop of city development and environmental protection, the traditional urban planning work mode of Huangdao district needs change too. In order to solve the problems of traditional work mode, we developed a VR-based system: Three-dimension Auxiliary Decision-making System of Urban Planning in Huangdao District. This system is worked as a computer platform for the routine urban planning works in the way of Virtual Reality. This system covers 275 km2 area, in which 9000 delicate models (buildings, roads, trees, flowers, etc.) over 20 km2 was built. The data is in access of 45GB. The system can fulfills the following functions: three-dimension cruise: the user can cruise in any place of the scene in any speed and angle, including pre-scheduled route fly, object fly; geometric measurement: the user can measure the distance, area, volume and the visibility of two objects; sun analysis: at the designated city and time, the system can analyze and visualize the sunshine change on the selected buildings; attribute enquiry: like 2D GIS, the system can implement two enquiries: attribute to scene, scene to attribute; projects comparison: building projects of 3DS format can be imported into the system, the user can evaluate them by setting the visibility of different project; project editing: the user can change the height, base area, angel, texture of the project in a real-time way to find the best configuration; indices analysis of existing/planning buildings: in the user-defined content, the system can compute 5 construction indices, such as the construction area, base area, floor-area ratio, construction density, ratio of green space; visibility setting of existing/planning buildings: in this way, the user can realize the blueprint of urban planning in a few minute; export: the system can also export the user-interested viewpoint in BMP format and the animation in AVI format; environment: the system can simulate kinds of weather: rain, snow and fog. Due to the authenticity and interactive browse way of the three-dimension scene, it changes the traditional work and management mode. It supplies a new method for the decision-making of urban planning, and improves the efficiency of routine works. After the establishment of the system, it has been used in the project evaluation of Longji Jiayuan, Shuangxin Yuan, Jianguo Mansion, Difeng Mansion, etc. After the evaluation, the right project was adopted. In this way, much time and manpower was saved in the making of architectural renderings and animations. In addition to the evaluation of building projects, the system was also used in the city renovation. Browsing the simulated environment of the object region, the experts discussed the ecological environment construction, urban landscape design, sustainable development, etc. Acting as an platform for the urban planning of Huangdao district, this system has achieved remarkable social and economic benefits. Phase 2 of this system will cover the left regions of Huangdao district. As a result, a three-dimension database of the whole Huangdao district will be established, and the system will act as a ``real{''} virtual environment platform for the future urban planning work of Huangdao district.},

Title = {Satellite Observation of the Marine Light-Fishing and Its Dynamics in the South China Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The South China Sea (SCS) is one of the most important fishery resource bases in the world. Marine fisheries, as a crucial component of regional food security and national revenue, raise wide concern about marine ecology, social-economic and political consequences at regional, national and local scales. The large-scale dynamic detection and analysis of fishing activity in the SCS is still unclear because of the accessibility of in-site data, finite automatic identification system (AIS) usage, complex geopolitics and poor additional data coverage. Nighttime light imagery (NTL) derived from low light imaging sensors and the popularity of light fishing in the SCS offers a unique way to unveil fishing activities and its dynamics. In this study, we proposed a set of algorithms for automatic detection of nighttime fishing activity and provided the first large-scale dynamic analysis of nighttime fishing activity in the SCS using monthly Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) images between 2012 and 2019. The proposed method effectively minimized the spatio-temporal fluctuations in radiance values of background and their implications to ship detection by integrating high radiance gradient detection and local adaptive thresholding. Further, nighttime fishing activity trajectories were decomposed into trend and seasonal components by using Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) to accurately access general trends and the seasonality of nighttime fishing activity in the SCS. The typical subregions analysis, environmental driver analysis, correlation coefficient analysis and hot spot analysis were integrated to characterize the nighttime fishing activity. It appears that the nighttime fishing activity in the SCS exhibited spatio-temporal variability and heterogeneity and was shaped by policy and natural factors such as holidays, annual Chinese fishery moratoria in the Chinese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and seasonal tropical storm activity.},

Title = {Precision farming uses typology in arable crop-oriented farms in northern France},

Abstract = {The adoption of precision farming techniques (PFTs) has been widely studied targeting specific PFT or farming systems along with the potential benefits of these PFTs in terms of yield or input use. However, few studies have examined how PFTs are adopted and used at the farm level. In this study a preliminary investigation was made of on-farm PFT uses in the Oise region (northern France). Three main PFTs were identified in the area: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) guidance, section control, and variable rate (VR) application. For each farm, the use of every PFT was defined by the technical characteristics of the equipment, the field operation(s) concerned, the targeted crop(s), the aim of the use, the PFT adoption drivers, and the perceived impacts by the farmers. These different variables were combined into a typology of PFT uses. The results show that most of the farms combined GNSS guidance for all technical operations and section control, whereas VR application was less common. Section control was largely used by farmers for liquid fertilizers and phytochemical spraying. The typology shows three to five types of use for each PFT, which differ in terms of technique adoption drivers, e.g. reducing on-farm work or adaptation to field morphology. According to literature, economic impacts were found to be the most frequent, however farmers seemed unable to quantify them. Social impacts such as reduced work time and fatigue were also frequent and are becoming the main motivation for using PFT on farms studied. Further research is needed to assess the use trajectories of PFT along with the motivations of each PFT use.},

Abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation is sensitive to climate change and human activities. Its spatial-temporal changes also affect the ecological and social environment. In this paper, we considered the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to study the spatio-temporal vegetation patterns. The detailed analysis of a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were carried out through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Our results show a slow and tortuous upward trend in the average leaf area index (LAI) in the study region for the periods 2001-2020. Specifically, Beijing had the highest LAI value, with an average of 1.64 over twenty years, followed by Hebei (1.30) and Tianjin (1.04). Among different vegetation types, forests had the highest normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the range of 0.62-0.78, followed by shrubland (0.58-0.75), grassland (0.34-0.66), and cropland (0.38-0.54) over the years. Spatially, compared to the whole study area, index value in the northwestern part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region increased greatly in many areas, such as northwest Beijing, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou, indicating a significant ecological optimization. Meanwhile, there was ecological degradation in the middle and southeast regions, from Tangshan southeastward to Handan, crossing Tianjin, Langfang, the east part of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and the west part of Cangzhou. Air temperature and precipitation were positively and significantly correlated with net primary production (NPP) and precipitation stood out as a key driver. Additionally, an intensification of the urbanization rate will negatively impact the vegetation NPP, with the shrubland and forest being affected most relative to the cropland.},

Title = {A Restitution Study for the Plans of a Group of Traditional Erzurum Houses in Ibrahim Pasa District},
Journal = {MEGARON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {271-285},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to purpose a restitution for the plan of a group of traditional Erzurum houses, which were built as independent but adjacent houses in the second half of the 18th century in the historical city center of Erzurum, by examining the spatial, structural and functional transformation with the abolition of borders while transforming into a cafe/restaurant. These traditional Erzurum houses are located at the intersection of Rasit Pasa and Salih Yuzbasi Streets in Ibrahim Pasa District, which is one of the historical settlements in the south west of Inner Castle. Houses once used independently began to be used as a single building with a number of changes made in the plan layout. However, during the change of function, facade layout and numerous spaces intertwined under the same roof and this made it difficult to understand the original plan scheme of the buildings. As there is a lack of documentation of the changes made and the presence of ambiguity in the different verbal information sources about the buildings, the main problem of this study is to determine the number of houses the cafe/restaurant consists of. Other important problems are the determination of the boundaries and the spatial organization of the houses. In addition, the scarcity of written sources in literature about these historic adjacent houses, which are numerous but more modest in the urban fabric compared with the two-story independent houses, increases the importance of this study. In order to reveal the changes and transformation of a group of traditional Erzurum houses built independently but adjacent to each other, first of all, traditional Erzurum houses were examined architecturally under the headings of location, plan and facade layout, material and construction technique properties. Then the architectural features and possible traces of change on this group of buildings, which were not mentioned in any source or document, were revealed in terms of location and plan features. After documentation of the current situation, property deeds, cadastral plans, satellite images, old photographs, historical and current maps, traces of the buildings themselves, information about traditional Erzurum houses and comparative studies were used to understand the different building phrases and restitution of the plan of these buildings. When the archive documents are evaluated, it is understood that the group of buildings were built in the second half of the 18th century according to Nene Saliha Hanim's Foundation record dated to 1791-92. Also, parcel numbers with 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 belong to a foundation named ``Nene Saliha Hanim{''} and parcel numbers with 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 41 and 42 belong to private property according to the land registers. Within the building group, in addition to eight independent houses analyzed spatially, functionally and structurally, the external body walls and garden boundaries of at least two more houses, which do not exist currently, were identified. Possibly, a khan might have existed in the place of one. Unlike the traditional Erzurum houses mentioned in the literature, these houses, for which a restitution is prepared, have a simple spatial organization consisting of one or two rooms. The studied houses, which contain many clues about the social and cultural life style of the old Erzurum city, yet which are decreasing in number, should be registered as cultural assets by the relevant Conservation Board. Additionally, the reconstruction permit decision given in the Conservation Development Plan for this region that conforms to many protection criteria such as historical, architectural, continuity, rarity and memorial value with its structure, parcel and streets should be re-evaluated. This study is important as it reveals that these single-story houses, which are stacked in a building block on a traditional street texture, with modest architectural organization should be part of the relevant literature on traditional Erzurum houses, which mainly deals with independent separate two-story houses owned by wealthy families. In addition, it is stated for the first time in the literature with this study that the parcels inside the building block get access to the main street through a common closed inner street, in contrast to the houses lined up adjacent to each other on independent lots on the street.},

Title = {Analyzing Long-Term High-Rise Building Areas Changes Using Deep Learning and Multisource Satellite Images},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {High-rise building areas (HRBs) provide significant social and environmental services and play a crucial role in modern urbanization. The large-scale and long-term spatial distribution of HRBs is of great interest to many fields, such as urban planning and local climate analysis. While previous studies have confirmed the value of Sentinel-2 images in extracting HRBs and their changes, current work is limited to relatively local areas and short-term analysis. One reason is due to the fact that the earliest Sentinel-2 image can only date back to 2015. To address this research gap, this paper proposes an efficient procedure to intelligently extract HRBs and their changes from multitemporal Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 images, using a specifically designed fully convolutional network. To validate the proposed method, we selected four typical cities in China, namely, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Zhengzhou, as study areas. We utilized Landsat-7 images acquired in 2000 and 2010, along with Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2020, as experimental data. We extracted and analyzed three periods of HRBs and their changes in the four cities, along with urban rail terminal data and gross domestic product (GDP) data in the same period. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently extract HRBs and their changes in the four cities over the past 20 years, with an overall accuracy of more than 90\%. HRBs changes are primarily driven by urban planning policies and geographical factors. There is a strong positive correlation between the increase in HRBs and the increase in rail terminals, both in terms of quantity and spatial distribution. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between HRBs increase and GDP increase in terms of quantity, but the trend varies in different cities due to their diverse developing modes. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed method can be a potential operational tool to extract large-scale and long-term HRBs and their changes in China.},

Abstract = {Cocoa cultivation is labeled as a driver of both deforestation and reforestation, yet the extent of the phenomena varies at farm and landscape level and as a response to national and local contexts. In this study, we documented the main pathways and contexts behind cocoa cultivation in two sites with different histories of cocoa cultivation. We combined official statistics, land-use trajectory, satellite imagery, and the Q-analysis to explore the discourses of country experts in Nicaragua and Peru. The Q-statements were based on an analysis of a set of legal, institutional, social, and technical guidelines that the cocoa cultivation/sector influences or is influenced by. Based on the responses of national experts to 31 statements we found four discourses linking cocoa cultivation and reforestation and deforestation in each country-case study. The enabling and limiting conditions driving tree cover change were a combination of landscape configuration, governance, management/commercialization models, and farmer's knowledge. Overall, between 60 and 64\% of the variance was explained by four discourse factors in each country. In Nicaragua, the conditions associated with reforestation were the cocoa-agroforestry model promoted by local organizations/NGOs, the existence of incentives, degree of technical knowledge, access to safe market, and availability of improved genetic material. The circumstances associated with deforestation were the age of the farmers, fluctuation of cocoa beans prices, low productivity of cocoa plantations, and weak legal environmental frameworks. Whereas, in Peru, the main factors connecting cocoa cultivation to reforestation were access to market, degree of experimentation in cocoa, the economic weight of cocoa on family's income, certification processes, the existence of incentives, and the level of organization/association of cocoa farmers. The elements linking cocoa farming to deforestation were the influence of stakeholders in the cocoa value chain, weak legal environmental frameworks, fluctuation of cocoa prices, the existence of private investors, and insecure land tenure rights. This article demonstrated the utility of discourse analysis, through its application to two contrasting country case-studies, to elucidate the conditions that might minimize the deforestation footprint of cocoa cultivation and maximize its role as an agent for reforestation/restoration in the agricultural landscape of cocoa-growing areas in Latin America.},

Abstract = {With the impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change, the urban flood has increasingly become a major hazard risk faced by human being in recent decades. The catastrophic urban flood events appear every year in the world, especially in Asia and Pacific region due to its geographical composition, density population and un-even economic and social development. To reduce the urban flood risk and enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities, especially coastal communities, the Members of ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee (TC) have made their great efforts including engineering and non-engineering measures based on their different national conditions. As a key part of non-engineering measures, it is recognized that improving urban flood monitoring and forecasting is a measure with high benefit related to cost on urban flood risk reduction. In recent years, TC Members enhanced their capacity building on urban flood monitoring, forecasting and simulation, inundation mapping, etc. In order to enhance the technical cooperation and exchange on this aspect, Typhoon Committee Working Group on Hydrology (WGH) conducted two projects on ``Urban Flood Risk Management in Typhoon Committee Area (UFRM){''} and ``Operation System for Urban Flood Forecasting and Inundation Mapping (OSUFFIM){''} in the past years. This paper generally reviewed the situation and causes of urban flood in TC region; briefly summarized the progresses and shortages on urban flood monitoring and forecasting in TC Members; and initially discussed the areas to be enhanced in future for improvement of urban flood monitoring, forecasting and simulation, and inundation mapping with up-to-date development of weather radar and satellite monitoring, image-based monitoring, information technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), big data and artificial intelligence (AI).(c) 2022 The Shanghai Typhoon Institute of China Meteorological Administration.

Title = {Profiling information needs and behaviour of Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt An exploratory study},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {119},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {161-182},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to identify the information needs and information-seeking behaviour of Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data in the form of three focus groups were collected from 37 Syrian refugees who have displaced to Egypt and are concentrated mainly in Greater Cairo. In-depth interviews were conducted in September 2016. Findings - Data collected about the demography of Syrian refugees revealed that they tend to be men, slightly more than half, mostly with no formal education, with an average age in the mid-30's, labelled as low-income persons and mostly single. Findings also showed that much of the information needed by Syrian refugees was described as realistic and real, but some was less clearly defined. All Syrian refugees' information needs are strongly linked to their daily tasks. The majority of Syrian refugees reported that their priority information need was to be aware of the situation in their home country, followed by issues related to their states of the diaspora that they are passing through, such as services provided to their children, shelter and aid in general, as well as rights and obligations related to their refugee status. They also showed that they need information to help get the right or any appropriate work in the host country (Egypt). The study showed that many Syrian refugees were seeking information that meets their basic daily needs. It also showed that the information-seeking behaviour profile of a very large number of Syrian refugees was to prefer informal sources to formal sources to meet everyday problems, as well as troubles challenged by them. A very large number of Syrian refugees revealed that the verbal communication with friends and families were identified as the most popular informal sources of information sought. The study revealed that most of the Syrian refugees were able to use a variety of technologies for the purpose of communication with others, especially mobile phones, being the most key communication devices followed by almost all of them. The use of assisting technologies and devices, such as the computer and the internet and its vast applications proved to be meaningful by Syrian refugees. Other assisting technologies are also heavily used by Syrian refugees, particularly social media, including social networking sites and many other mobile applications. In addition, Syrian refugees have also relied on other technologies and tools to meet their information needs, including television and satellite channels, especially Arabic, which are widely distributed in the Arab environment. Because of some difficulties related to education and awareness, a number of Syrian refugees were not using any type of library. Syrian refugees have met several problems and challenges in accessing information. Such problem may make it difficult to find basic services, make informed decisions and stay in communication with families. Such problems have also a significant impact on their seeking and using information. Finding appropriate work to get money to secure housing, psychological burdens suffered concerning the image of being refugees, emotional distress, lack of accessing some basic services such as education and transportation, lack of financial resources, lack of time, lack of motivation and cultural and social barriers, were significant to Syrian refugees when seeking information. In spite of these challenges and problems met by Syrian refugees, a good number of them wished to improve their image as refugees and to improve their disastrous situation. Based on the review of the existing literature, as well as the findings of this study, further research is needed to understand information needs and information dissemination among Syrian refugees fled to Egypt and how they perceive, select, use, access and evaluate sources of information. Proper strategies should be designed towards the use of traditional and commonly used information dissemination channels among these refugees, such as cultural performances and group discussions. Research is also needed on the impact of illiteracy on the use of information by this category of information users. Owing to the fragile role played by different types of libraries in meeting the information needs of refugees, further research is seriously needed in this regard. In addition, appropriate services should be provided to refugees. Research limitations/implications - This study focuses only on Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt. It does not cover any other refugees inside or outside Egypt, although they significantly exist in Egypt, such as Palestinians, Sudanese, Iraqis, Yemenis, Africans and many other nationals. Any conclusions resulting from this study are limited to only Syrian refugees hosted by Egypt. Practical implications - This study tries to investigate the Syrian refugees' information needs and behaviours in terms of their thoughts, motivations, attitudes, preferences and challenges met by them in their search of information. It tries to look at the factors and characteristics that affect this search. Any results from this study may generate interest and create awareness of the information needs of refugees among advocates who are interested in such groups of information users. Originality/value - This study attempted to identify a significant gap in identifying the information needs and information-seeking behaviour of Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt. It is the first study of its type to address, in a systematic way, this disadvantaged group resettled and hosted by Egypt. Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt have become a matter of major concern that should be addressed and met by serious academic researchers, as well as by official authorities. The literature on the topic of this research revealed that further research is still needed to be undertaken on such group of information users, as there is a very limited research conducted on this topic in developing and Arab countries, including Egypt, particularly among academic library and information professionals.},

Abstract = {Historically, the Portuguese octopus fishery, targeting Octopus vulgaris, has been one of the most important in the country, yielding an average annual catch of 8,600 t during the decade 1988-97 and reaching a peak of 11,500 t valued at 43{*}10(6) US Dollars in 1996. Octopus is currently ranked third in landing statistics and is the highest revenue earner within the domestic fisheries sector. The three most important fisheries components ill Portugal are: purse-seiners, targeting pelagic species; non-species selective bottom trawlers; and a nominative artisanal fishery, which is a multi-gear, multi-species fishery, employing a large fraction of the traditional fishing community. The latter has its major expression in the octopus fishery, accounting for an average of 79\% of octopus landings in the last decade. Since 1996, the Fisheries and Aquaculture Directorate-General (DGPA) and the Fisheries and Sea Research Institute (IPIMAR), were confronted with requests by artisanal fishery representatives, to produce measures assuring the sustainable exploitation of the local stocks of octopus, ill order to maintain the livelihood of the traditional fishing communities. From data gathered during regular research cruise programmes, national fish-auction sampling programmes (via IPIMAR), official landing statistics (via DGPA), fishing log-books and satellite vessel, monitoring systems (VMS), the first legal step to protect the stocks of Octopus vulgaris was taken and a minimum weight limit of 750g was imposed. The available datasets, proved to be inadequate for the management of the octopus fishery, as they were designed to meet the requirements of the current models used in the assessment of finfish and crustacea. The careful planning and management of the highly visible trawling and purse-seining activities, overlooked the octopus fishery which is responsible for a large fraction of both landings and the economic success of dependant fishing communities. Particular features in the operation of this fishery and the nature of the artisanal assemblages of small fishing ventures, making up the largest proportion of the sector, meant that a new approach to State conducted, marine research in Portugal, was required. This needed to be based largely on the development of partnerships between fisheries scientists and individual fishers and on co-operation with social sciences researchers. An integrated programme of research into the biology and ecology of the species in nearshore waters (where the fishery has its greater impact), is also a priority; requirement to overcome the present research deficit.},

Abstract = {The topic on Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs) in Malaysia is relatively new and received little attention from geoscientists and engineers. This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury, fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3) interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 \% damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25\% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26 - 50\% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75\% damage/victims/period), and 1.00 (75 - 100\% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are compiled and analyzed with ``Landslide Distribution Map{''} (LDM) to generate a ``Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD){''}. The LDM was produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally, three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 (< 0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability; Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High Vulnerability); and Class 5 (> 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially to be extended with different background environments.

Title = {Environmental Impacts of Urbanization Encroachment in the Lowlands of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan},

Abstract = {Urban encroachment due to urban sprawl and unchecked expansion in built-up areas is one of the top challenges developing countries such as Pakistan face. The fertile agricultural land is continuously converting into built-up areas reducing the capacity of food production and bringing down the livelihood opportunities associated with agricultural land. Pakistan is an agricultural country with extensive fertile areas. The GDP share of agriculture is more than 20\%, and it engages more than half of the country's total labor force, producing a handsome foreign exchange. However, this fertile and productive land is now altering due to urbanization encroachment. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the level of urbanization encroachment and its temporal dynamics in the lowlands of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The sample area of District Peshawar was selected for this purpose. First, the study's objective was to detect the district's temporal dynamics in the land-use pattern. Secondly, the quantification of agricultural land converted to built-up in District Peshawar was also considered. The study of urbanization encroachment in temporal dynamics focused on the conversion of agricultural land-use change using high-resolution satellite images (Arc GIS 10.5), a detailed questionnaire survey, and interviews, and focus group discussions were conducted to obtain more profound insight into the study area. SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), ANOVA, and regression models were applied where needed. For the agricultural land investigation, data from the landowners were also incorporated to learn the size of the lands they currently hold. To claw out the fragmentation of the land, the previous status of the land, its selling, purchasing, and the causes thereof, have also been probed. The results show that 46.35 sq. km of the land area has been built-up since the first census in 1981. In 2019, it increased by 173.3049 sq. km in District Peshawar against the total area of 1257 sq. km. In the sample area, the fertile agricultural land shows a change five times greater than the population increase. The land is continuously reduced and utilized for different purposes. The land values also appeal to the land owners for handsome returns, which is another crucial factor of urban encroachment over the fertile agricultural area. A proper and active regularity authority is recommended, and policies for land transformation from agriculture to built-up coverings should be formed. Decentralization of facilities, subsidies, and incentives to the farmers are recommended to slow down the speed of land conversion.},

Title = {Public health nurses in rural/frontier one-nurse offices},

Year = {2009},

Abstract = {Introduction: Public health nursing is the foundation of the United States' (US) public health system, particularly in rural and remote areas. Recent increasing interest in public health in the USA has highlighted that there is limited information available about public health nursing in the most isolated areas, particularly in the US. The purposes of this study were to: (1) describe the characteristics, competency levels, and practice patterns of public health nurses (PHNs) working in remote one-nurse offices; and (2) compare PHNs working in one-nurse offices with nurses working in multi-nurse offices in Idaho, in relation to their demographic characteristics, practice patterns and competency levels. Methods: Using a cross-sectional descriptive design, a statewide sample of 124 PHNs in Idaho, including 15 working in one-nurse satellite offices, were assessed in relation to their demographic characteristics, experience, educational background, job satisfaction, practice characteristics, and competency levels in March to May 2007. Results: The solo (nurses working in one-nurse offices) PHNs were based in 15 different counties, 10 frontier (population density of less than 7 persons/1.6 km(2); 7 persons/mile(2)) and 5 rural. The counties ranged in population from 2781 to 28 114 (mean = 11 013), with population densities ranging from 0.9 to 29.4 persons/1.6 km(2) (mean = 8.6; 0.9 to 29.4 persons/mile(2)). The distance from their offices to the district main office ranged from 25.8 to 241.4 km (mean = 104 km; 16 to 150 miles, mean = 64.6 miles). All the solo PHNs were Caucasian females, with a mean age of 46.9 years and a mean of 22.5 years' nursing experience. Educationally, 7 (47\%) held a bachelor degree in nursing, 6 (40\%) had associates degrees, 1 (7\%) had a diploma in nursing, and 1 (7\%) was a licensed practical nurse (LPN). These solo PHNs provided a wide array of services with support from other nurses in the district, including epidemiology, family planning/sexually transmitted disease clinics, immunization clinics, communicable disease surveillance, and school nursing. They expressed strong job satisfaction, citing the benefits of autonomy, variety, and close community ties, but also voiced some frustrations related to isolation. Their self-rated levels of competency were highest in the areas of communication, cultural competency, community dimensions of care, and leadership/systems thinking skills; and lowest in the areas of financial management, analytical assessment, policy development/program planning, and basic public health sciences skills. When the solo PHNs were compared with PHNs based in multi-nurse offices, there were no statistically significant differences between the solo and non-solo PHNs in demographics or competency levels, except in the competency area of community dimensions of practice skills. The mean self-rating for solo PHNs in relation to community dimensions of practice skills was significantly higher (3.9) than non-solo PHNs (3.2) (t = 3.547, p = .002). Conclusions: These findings suggest that US PHNs practicing in isolated one-nurse offices in rural and remote communities are comparable to PHNs working in less isolated settings; however, solo nurses may have stronger community dimensions of practice skills. Their practice is more generalized than other PHNs and they express high levels of job satisfaction. The study was limited in that it was conducted in only one state and data were collected only by self-report. Further research is indicated to describe this unique subset of PHNs, particularly in terms of factors promoting recruitment and retention. Additional study into the conceptual aspect of isolation is also indicated in relation to public health practice in rural and remote areas.},

Title = {Satellite-derived changes in floodplain productivity and freshwater habitats in northern Australia (1991-2019)},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The ecological communities supported by freshwater habitats and wetlands that persist from floodplain inundation generate numerous cultural, recreational and economic values via commercial fisheries and other human uses of these habitats. However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991-2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r = 0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r = 0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r = 0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r = 0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems).},

Title = {Chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage in human populations exposed to the processing of electronics waste},

Abstract = {It has been known that the pollutants of electronic wastes (E-wastes) can lead to severe pollution to the environment. It has been reported that about 50\% to 80\% of E-wastes from developed countries are exported to Asia and Africa. It has become a major global environmental problem to deal with `E-wastes'. E-waste recycling has remained primitive in Jinghai, China. This not only produces enormous environmental pollution but also can bring about toxic or genotoxic effects on the human body, threatening the health of both current residents and future generations living in the local environment. The concentration of lead in the blood of children in the E-waste polluted area in China is higher than that of the control area. But little is known about the cytogenetic effect to human beings caused by the pollution of E-wastes. In the present study, experiments have been performed to investigate the genetics of permanent residents of three villages with numerous E-waste disposal sites and to analyze the harmful effects of exposure to E-wastes. In total, 171 villagers (exposed group) were randomly selected from permanent residents of three villages located in Jinghai County of Tianjin, China, where there has been massive disposal of E-wastes. Thirty villagers were selected from the neighboring towns without E-waste disposal sites to serve as controls. Chromosomal aberrations and cytokinesis blocking micronucleus were performed to detect the cytogenetic effect, dic + r (dicentric and ring chromosome), monomer, fragments (acentric fragments, minute chromosomes, and acentric rings), translocation, satellite, quadriradial, total aberrations, and micronuclear rate were scored for each subject. DNA damage was detected using comet assay; the DNA percentage in the comet tail (TDNA\%), tail moment (TM), and Olive tail moment (OTM) were recorded to describe DNA damage to lymphocytes. The total chromosome aberration rates (5.50\%) and micronuclear rates (16.99\%) of the exposure group were significantly higher than in the control group (P = 0.000). The percentage of DNA in the comet tail, tail moment, and Olive tail moment detected by comet assay showed that there was a significant difference in DNA damage in the exposure group (P = 0.000). The chromosome aberration, micronucleus rate, and DNA damage observed in women were significantly higher than those in men. Chromosome aberration and micronuclear rates of both smokers and non-smokers in the exposure group are obviously higher than that in the control group (P = 0.000). The use of outdated (and unsafe) ways to deal with E-wastes can lead to exposure to a variety of substances harmful to human health. The components of pollution may enter the human body through the air, drinking water, and food chain to damage human genetic material, resulting in genomic instability. The rates of chromosomal aberration, micronucleus formation, and the degree of DNA damage in women in the group exposed to electronic waste were significantly higher than in men. The reason for this may be concerned with the traditional lifestyle of the local residents or the difference of sensitivity to the exposure to E-wastes or any others. Further investigations are needed to provide evidence to demonstrate this. Here, we report the obviously cytogenetic toxicity to the exposure population by the E-waste pollution for the first time. E-waste pollution may be a potential agent of genetic mutation, and may induce cytogenetic damage within the general population exposed to the pollution. These findings need to be considered, and steps should be taken to protect the current population and future generations from the effects of pollution with E-wastes. The above results remind us that the impact of E-waste recycling on environmental quality of Jinghai should be evaluated soon. Moreover, it is urgent for the government to prohibit E-waste import and its processing by outdated ways. The future studies such as pollutant details of drinking water, air, and soil in the area as well as epidemiological investigations on the harmful effect to children must be performed eagerly. All the data available do provide a compelling case for immediate action in both countries to address workplace health and safety and waste management.},

Abstract = {Food culture is most influenced by the locality of its origin, which will have been one of food acquisition and processing by various means. It is generally agreed, and is the basis of much United Nations, especially Food and Agriculture Organisation strategic development policy, that successful agriculture, horticulture and aquacuiture along with fishing, underpin economically viable and healthy communities with their various food cultures. We also know that this must be in tandem with maternal literacy and operational health care systems. These elements are best represented on a regional basis. There is a growing consumer interest in knowing where one's food comes from as a measure of ``food integrity{''}. However, food production alone can be a precarious business and relate to a lesser or greater extent to local food culture and to trade, which may be complementary or at-odds with each other. Likewise, the local food culture may have its strengths and weaknesses as far as its ability to meet nutritional and health needs is concerned. Local food production may be restricted because of geographical or socio-economic conditions which preclude food diversity, although this may be compensated for by trade. Where food adequacy and diversity is compromised, and soils poor, various macro-nutrient, micronutrient (from animals and plants) and phytonutrient (nutritionally-advantageous food component from plants) deficiencies may be in evidence. These food system problems may be intertwined with food culture - for example, ``rice-based and water-soluble vitamin poor{''}; ``few animal-derived foods like meat, fish, eggs and milk with associated low calcium, vitamin D, Vitamin B-12 and long chain n-3 fatty acid intakes{''}; ``low fruit and vegetable intake with limited carotenoids and other phytonutrients{''}. Geo-satellite surveillance and mopping is identifying such ``hot spots{''}: for regional food problems, as well as hot spots where most of the world's biodiversity is found (1.4\% of land on earth). On the other hand, regional food culture can confer considerable advantage for health and economic development, but does not necessarily do so. The challenge is to respect and retain traditional food knowledge and sustainable food systems, with good governance for food security. There has been a recent awakening of interest and concern about the lack of documentation of traditional and indigenous food cultures which are important not only for their own sake, but for the legacy of food knowledge which they can confer on future generations, provided they are not lost. Hence, the value of a special focus on African food cultures (www.healthyeatingclub.org/Africa), including Rift and Nile Valleys and North West African foods, which are the cradles of human food systems and habits. This is the case too with indigenous foods and food cultures (whether hunter-gatherer or subsistence agriculture); with relatively long-living food cultures in North East Asia, with food cultural distinction and fusion (FHILL and SENECA studies) and with migratory Food Habits. By and large, there is a remarkable resilience and ingenuity of people and their food systems, but monoculture and lack of diversity encourage food system failure.},

Abstract = {Due to the rapid economic growth and the heavy reliance on fossil fuels, China has become one of the countries with the highest sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, which pose a severe challenge to human health and the sustainable development of social economy. In order to cope with the serious problem of SO(2)pollution, this study attempts to explore the spatial temporal variations of industrial SO(2)emissions in China utilizing the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data. We first explored the relationship between the NSL data and the statistical industrial SO(2)emissions at the provincial level, and confirmed that there was a positive correlation between these two datasets. Consequently, 17 linear regression models were established based on the NSL data and the provincial statistical emissions to model the spatial-temporal dynamics of China's industrial SO(2)emissions from 1997 to 2013. Next, the NSL-based estimated results were evaluated utilizing the prefectural statistical industrial SO(2)emissions and emission inventory data, respectively. Finally, the distribution of China's industrial SO(2)emissions at 1 km spatial resolution were estimated, and the temporal and spatial dynamics were explored from multiple scales (national scale, regional scale and scale of urban agglomeration). The results show that: (1) The NSL data can be successfully applied to estimate the dynamic changes of China's industrial SO(2)emissions. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values of the NSL-based estimation results in most years were greater than 0.6, and the relative error (RE) values were less than 10\%, when validated by the prefectural statistical SO(2)emissions. Moreover, compared with the inventory emissions, the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj.R-Square) reached 0.61, with the significance at the 0.001 level. (2) During the observation period, the temporal and spatial dynamics of industrial SO(2)emissions varied greatly in different regions. The high growth type was largely distributed in China's Western region, Central region, and Shandong Peninsula, while the no-obvious-growth type was concentrated in Western region, Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan and Middle south of Liaoning. The high grade of industrial SO(2)emissions was mostly concentrated in China's Eastern region, Western region, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou and Shandong Peninsula, while the low grade mainly concentrated in China's Western region, Middle south of Liaoning and Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan. These results of our research can not only enhance the understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of industrial SO(2)emissions in China, but also offer some scientific references for formulating feasible industrial SO(2)emission reduction policies.},

Using collaborative techniques grounded on the premise that the workshop is unconditionally a. safe place,. a progressive conversation is established in which the matter of the self is drawn into both language that is fresh and control of language that holistically conforms to the group dynamic. In this dynamic, remarkable recoveries may take place. I will focus the discussion on the structure of the collaborative journalizing, the purpose of which is to bring structure into the very production of personal and creative recovery. The journaling is an extended process-meditation, begun on the first day of a half-semester course and finished on the day a final portfolio is submitted for grading. I argue that the dream-journaling should have a basic structure in any case, and discuss several such schema as they have been used not only in Creative Writing but also in the community and in the literature of counselling and guidance. Conclusions. The findings provide a initial but profound exploration into art facilitators' pragmatic knowledge and wisdom related to the health and recovery benefits of art making in the area of counselling and guidance. It also explores important skills and competencies required by those facilitating art making programs in mental health recovery contexts. Such data may help to inform policy and design of health recovery programs associated with Creative Writing workshops both in the college or university setting as well as the community health unit.},

Abstract = {The knowledge management, like a strategic resource, has gained great importance for business development and knowledge transfer processes became a key issue in allowing firms to get new sources of information. The study looks at the reality of industrial districts, where, normally, equality and fairness create the conditions upon which firms share their own knowledge. However, often, these contexts, in contrasts to the traditional Marshallian industrial district (Marshall, 1879, Becattini, 1981), are characterized by an asymmetric power relationship among the parties, according to the Hub and Spoke district (Markusen, 1996). The case study of Val d'Agri, the most important Italian oil district, is an example of Hub-and-spoke District, with the dominance of a bigger firm (Eni) to manage all the relationship along the chain. The discovery of the Val d'Agri was made by ENI, in 1988. Purpose - Starting from the description of Val d'Agri district, our paper aims at mapping the local relationships, in order to define the way firms relate along the district value chain, with reference to both their position, and their own ``contractual power{''}; and to understand how firms position, as well as their different contractual power, affect knowledge transfer process within the district. Taking into account the ``Hub and Spoke{''} morphology, we support the idea that knowledge transfer is deeply affected by firms' contractual power, as well as by their position within the district. Explicit knowledge transfer is mainly linked to the development of production process; on the contrary, the transfer of tacit knowledge depends, above all, by the action people place within the district; so, human capital plays a very important role in transferring knowledge through imitation, work mobility and social interaction. Design/methodology/approach - We propose an empirical approach. This work will start providing an analysis of the main characteristics of the relational structure of Val d'Agri, in order to identify the main issues that can impact the development process of knowledge transfer. The study consists of two parts: in the first part, it will develop an analysis of the main national and international literature on the field, from both economic and managerial perspectives; in the second part, an empirical analysis will be developed. For the analysis were contacted about 100 firms of satellite ENI industries (the biggest ones), both the same ENI. Were sent questionnaires for asking questions about the company structure, specialization, the typology of formal relationships exists with the leader, the company's distinctive knowledge, the existence of knowledge management systems. Originality/value - Since the importance that both industrial districts and knowledge transfer have for firms competition, the paper aims at giving a new and valuable framework useful to understand, not only the district dynamics, but also the way knowledge transfer may be fostered among all the firms related along a given value chain. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application puts in evidence the peculiarity of an oil district, because the birth of this form of district is closely related to land resources. In addition, national laws and regulations that govern the exploitation of oil in Italy, create positions of power within the production chain, which alter the relationship between the companies, compared to what happens in the traditional type of Marshallian districts.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized software, Bio\_CAP Higher biological richness was assigned to the habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated `three-tier modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid assessment of biological richness. Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to ecological habitats), with 89\% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e., proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation. Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ.

Title = {Water Loss Due to Increasing Planted Vegetation over the Badain Jaran Desert, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Water resources play a vital role in ecosystem stability, human survival, and social development in drylands. Human activities, such as afforestation and irrigation, have had a large impact on the water cycle and vegetation in drylands over recent years. The Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) is one of the driest regions in China with increasing human activities, yet the connection between human management and the ecohydrology of this area remains largely unclear. In this study, we firstly investigated the ecohydrological dynamics and their relationship across different spatial scales over the BJD, using multi-source observational data from 2001 to 2014, including: total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), lake extent from Landsat, and precipitation from in situ meteorological stations. We further studied the response of the local hydrological conditions to large scale vegetation and climatic dynamics, also conducting a change analysis of water levels over four selected lakes within the BJD region from 2011. To normalize the effect of inter-annual variations of precipitation on vegetation, we also employed a relationship between annual average NDVI and annual precipitation, or modified rain-use efficiency, termed the RUEmo. A focus of this study is to understand the impact of the increasing planted vegetation on local ecohydrological systems over the BJD region. Results showed that vegetation increases were largely found to be confined to the areas intensely influenced by human activities, such as croplands and urban areas. With precipitation patterns remaining stable during the study period, there was a significant increasing trend in vegetation greenness per unit of rainfall, or RUEmo over the BJD, while at the same time, total water storage as measured by satellites has been continually decreasing since 2003. This suggested that the increased trend in vegetation and apparent increase in RUEmo can be attributed to the extraction of ground water for human-planted irrigated vegetation. In the hinterland of the BJD, we identified human-planted vegetation around the lakes using MODIS observations and field investigations. Four lake basins were chosen to validate the relationship between lake levels and planted vegetation. Our results indicated that increasing human-planted vegetation significantly increased the water loss over the BJD region. This study highlights the value of combining observational data from space-borne sensors and ground instruments to monitor the ecohydrological dynamics and the impact of human activities on water resources and ecosystems over the drylands.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic created an extreme natural experiment in which sudden changes in human behavior and economic activity resulted in significant declines in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, immediately after strict lockdowns were imposed. Here we examined the impact of multiple waves and response phases of the pandemic on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) dynamics and the role of meteorology in shaping relative contributions from different emission sectors to NO2 pollution in post-pandemic New York City. Long term (> 3.5 years), high frequency measurements from a network of ground-based Pandora spectrometers were combined with TROPOMI satellite retrievals, meteorological data, mobility trends, and atmospheric transport model simulations to quantify changes in NO2 across the New York metropolitan area. The stringent lockdown measures after the first pandemic wave resulted in a decline in top-down NOx emissions by approx. 30 \% on top of long-term trends, in agreement with sector-specific changes in NOx emissions. Ground-based measurements showed a sudden drop in total column NO2 in spring 2020, by up to 36 \% in Manhattan and 19 \%-29 \% in Queens, New Jersey (NJ), and Connecticut (CT), and a clear weakening (by 16 \%) of the typical weekly NO2 cycle. Extending our analysis to more than a year after the initial lockdown captured a gradual recovery in NO2 across the NY/NJ/CT tri-state area in summer and fall 2020, as social restrictions eased, followed by a second decline in NO2 coincident with the second wave of the pandemic and resurgence of lockdown measures in winter 2021. Meteorology was not found to have a strong NO2 biassing effect in New York City after the first pandemic wave. Winds, however, were favorable for low NO2 conditions in Manhattan during the second wave of the pandemic, resulting in larger column NO2 declines than expected based on changes in transportation emissions alone. Meteorology played a key role in shaping the relative contributions from different emission sectors to NO2 pollution in the city, with low-speed (< 5 m s(-1)) SW-SE winds enhancing contributions from the high-emitting power-generation sector in NJ and Queens and driving particularly high NO2 pollution episodes in Manhattan, even during - and despite - the stringent early lockdowns. These results have important implications for air quality management in New York City, and highlight the value of high resolution NO2 measurements in assessing the effects of rapid meteorological changes on air quality conditions and the effectiveness of sector-specific NOx emission control strategies.},

Title = {The CanMars Mars Sample Return analogue mission},
Journal = {PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {110-130},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The return of samples from known locations on Mars is among the highest priority goals of the international planetary science community. A possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3 missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team, and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis. CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015 operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as inverted paleochannels. Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12-21), were conducted with the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020 rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22-39) was implemented without the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the Science Team prioritized 3 for ``return to Earth{''}. Various science autonomy capabilities, based on flight proven or near-future techniques intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016 CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and conditional sequencing were also employed. Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made. Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region, collected out-of simulation, have been analysed using a range of laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering large suites of geological and geochemical survey data. Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook), articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016 activities had 90\% of participants ``somewhat agreeing{''} or ``strongly agreeing{''} that participation in the mission has helped them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {The black soil area in Northeast China serves as a ``ballast{''} to ensure China's food security. Unreasonable development and utilization lead to serious black soil degradation in some areas and affect regional food production and economic and social development. In the context of the intensification of the contradiction between food supply and demand worldwide, we should pay more attention to the overall situation of regional sustainable development and seek for systematic, scientific, and economic solutions. This study establishes a regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary on the basis of the regional system of human-land relationship, customized and accurate management, agricultural system theory, and agricultural informatization with the guidance of integrated geography concept. The aim of this regional all-for-one customization model is to systematically diagnose the key problems and leading factors of black soil degradation and determine a solution that combines the commonness and individuality of black soil protection from the perspective of multiscale linkage, multifactor coupling, and multitechnology cooperation. The regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary integrates the two perspectives of ``regional{''} and ``customization{''} into the protection and comprehensive utilization of black soil for the first time. It adopts zoning, grading, and classification as the main strategy and big data and artificial intelligence as the main technical approaches. This model constructs three strategies of different scales by combining the ``satellite-air-ground-network{''} 3D monitoring system and the all-for-one customization platform driven by big data and artificial intelligence. First, the ``implementing strategies by regions{''} are implemented at the regional scale to formulate the regional agricultural resource allocation scheme and agricultural zoning, which can provide strategies to protect and utilize black soil effectively. Second, the ``determining strategies in accordance with villages{''} are implemented at the village scale to formulate a black soil protection and utilization model for different categories of villages, which can promote the organic integration of black soil protection and rural revitalization. Third, a ``one strategy for one field{''} concept is applied at the field scale to provide accurate strategies for soil restoration and yield improvement in a fixed, quantitative, and regular manner. Multiscale integrated demonstration and scheme verification of the regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary are conducted in Qiqihar City at three scales, namely, region, village, and field, to solve the key issues in black soil protection and utilization and form a replicable and popularized system solution, thereby providing a model for the sustainable development of Chinese and global black soil agriculture. The proposed regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary has important theoretical and practical value in promoting the high-quality development of regional agriculture and rural revitalization, and provides a demonstration model of land protection and utilization for the black soil area in China and the whole world.},

Title = {A multiple natural hazard analysis, SECMOL College region, near Leh, Ladakh, North India, with applications for community-based DRR},
Journal = {DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper places a college at the centreof a multi-hazard assessment (earthquake, flood and landslide). The college is within a less studied, rural area of Ladakh, North India. Research focusses on a case study (Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) College), close to Leh, Ladakh, and extends to incorporate/apply thinking from/to the wider Ladakh region. The approach adopted, centring on the hazard assessment of a single entity/local area, allows a rapid uptake of hazard recommendations within a college environment planning to continue its existence for decades ahead. A sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) documents the active involvement of college staff and students in the principles of geohazard assessment and the development of student-centric hazard assessments of the college and their home village. SECMOL is a self-sufficient, alternative, college, organised along strong environmentally sustainable principles. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This work has adopted different strategies for different hazards. Fieldwork involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. shape and size of valleys/river channels/valley sides, estimation of vegetation density, measurement of sediment clasts, angle of slopes, assessment of sediment character, stratigraphy of floodplains and identification of vulnerable elements). These data were combined with satellite image analysis to: define river catchment character and flood vulnerability (e.g. using the methodology of Collier and Fox, 2003), examine catchment connectivity, and examine landslip scars and generic terrain analysis. Literature studies and seismic database interrogation allowed the calculation of potential catchment floodwater volumes, and the collation of epicentre, magnitude, depth and date of seismic events, together with recent thinking on the return period of large Himalayan earthquakes. These data were used to develop geological-seismic and river catchment maps, the identification of vulnerable elements, and disaster scenario analyses. Findings This research concludes that SECMOL, and much of the Ladakh region, is exposed to significant seismic, flood and landslide hazard risk. High magnitude earthquakes have return periods of 100s to c. 1,000 years in the Himalayas and can produce intense levels of damage. It is prudent to maximise earthquake engineering wherever possible. The 2010 Leh floods demonstrated high levels of devastation: these floods could severely damage the SECMOL campus if storms were centred close by. This study reveals the connectivity of catchments at varying altitudes and the potential interactions of adjacent catchments. Evacuation plans need to be developed for the college. Northern ridges at SECMOL could bury parts of the campus if mobilised by earthquakes/rainfall. Slope angles can be lowered and large boulders moved to reduce risk. This work reinforces recommendations that relate to building quality and urban/rural planning, e.g. using spatial planning to keep people away from high-risk zones. Practical implications - The frequency of hazards is low, but potential impacts high to very high. Hazard mitigation actions include engineering options for hazardous slopes, buildings to be earthquake-proofed, and evacuation management for large floods. Originality/value Methodologies undertaken in this research are well-tested. Linkages between disciplines are ambitious and somewhat original. The application of this work to a specific college centre site with the capacity to rapidly take up recommendations is novel. The identification of catchment inter-connectivity in this part of Ladakh is novel. This work complements a sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) for community aspects of this study, adding to the novelty value.},
