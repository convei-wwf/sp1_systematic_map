Abstract = {Water quality degradation of freshwater bodies is a concern worldwide, particularly in Africa, where data are scarce and standard water quality monitoring is expensive. This study explored the use of remote sensing imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms as an alternative to standard field measuring for monitoring water quality in large and remote areas constrained by logistics and finance. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated with Landsat 8 imagery were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting three optically active water quality indicators observed monthly in the period from August 2016 to April 2022: turbidity (TUR), total dissolved solids (TDS) and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a). The six ML algorithms studied were the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVM), random forest regression (RF), XGBoost regression (XGB), AdaBoost regression (AB), and gradient boosting regression (GB) algorithms. XGB performed best at predicting Chl-a, with an R-2 of 0.78, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.78, mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 0.082 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.79 mu g/L. RF performed best at predicting TDS (with an R-2 of 0.79, NSE of 0.80, MARE of 0.082, and RMSE of 12.30 mg/L) and TUR (with an R-2 of 0.80, NSE of 0.81, and MARE of 0.072 and RMSE of 7.82 NTU). The main challenges were data size, sampling frequency, and sampling resolution. To overcome the data limitation, we used a K-fold cross validation technique that could obtain the most out of the limited data to build a robust model. Furthermore, we also employed stratified sampling techniques to improve the ML modeling for turbidity. Thus, this study shows the possibility of monitoring water quality in large freshwater bodies with limited observed data using remote sensing integrated with ML algorithms, potentially enhancing decision making.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The application of remote-sensing techniques for water quality assessment has become increasingly popular in China. However, existing reviews are often limited to qualitative description and are quite fragmented. Outcomes: We conducted a quantitative systematic review to display current research status and identify the existing challenges and future directions. Our review revealed that the application of remote-sensing techniques in water quality research has expanded dramatically in China, but the spatial distribution is quite uneven. Second, the ground object spectrometer is the most widely applied data source. Water color indicators such as chlorophyll a and suspended solid are the most widely investigated in China. Third, semiempirical method is the most commonly used inversion method. Existing studies rarely considered the anthropogenic factors, which limited the model robustness and its application in human-dominated aquatic ecosystems. Discussion and Conclusion: We concluded that, in the past several decades, China has made notable progresses in monitoring and evaluation of water quality using the remote-sensing techniques (especially in inland lakes). We proposed that further improvements would be needed in terms of temporal and spatial coverage, indicator list, the incorporation of human-nature interactions, inversion accuracy, and model generalization.},

Abstract = {An appropriate management of the available resources within oceans and coastal regions is vital to guarantee their sustainable development and preservation, where water quality is a key element. Leveraging on a combination of cross-disciplinary technologies including Remote Sensing (RS), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential to attain this aim. In this paper, we review methodologies and technologies for water quality assessment that contribute to a sustainable management of marine environments. Specifically, we focus on Deep Leaning (DL) strategies for water quality estimation and forecasting. The analyzed literature is classified depending on the type of task, scenario and architecture. Moreover, several applications including coastal management and aquaculture are surveyed. Finally, we discuss open issues still to be addressed and potential research lines where transfer learning, knowledge fusion, reinforcement learning, edge computing and decision-making policies are expected to be the main involved agents.},

Title = {An Appraisal of the Potential of Landsat 8 in Estimating Chlorophyll-a, Ammonium Concentrations and Other Water Quality Indicators},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In-situ monitoring of lake water quality in synergy with satellite remote sensing represents the latest scientific trend in many water quality monitoring programs worldwide. This study investigated the suitability of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) instrument onboard the Landsat 8 satellite platform in accurately estimating key water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations. As a case study the largest freshwater body of Greece (Trichonis Lake) was used. Two Landsat 8 images covering the study site were acquired on 30 October 2013 and 30 August 2014 respectively. Near concurrent in-situ observations from two water sampling campaigns were also acquired from 22 stations across the lake under study. In-situ measurements (nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations) were statistically correlated with various spectral band combinations derived from the Landsat imagery of year 2014. Subsequently, the most statistically promising predictive models were applied to the satellite image of 2013 and validation was conducted using in-situ data of 2013 as reference. Results showed a relatively variable statistical relationship between the in-situ and reflectances (R logchl-a: 0.58, R NH4+: 0.26, R chl-a: 0.44). Correlation coefficient (R) values reported of up to 0.7 for ammonium concentrations and also up to 0.5 and up to 0.4 for chl-a concentration and chl-a concentrations respectively. These results represent a higher accuracy of Landsat 8 in comparison to its predecessors in the Landsat satellites series, as evidenced in the literature. Our findings suggest that Landsat 8 has a promising capability in estimating water quality components in an oligotrophic freshwater body characterized by a complete absence of any quantitative, temporal and spatial variance, as is the case of Trichonis lake. Yet, even with the presence of a lot of ground information as was the case in our study, a quantitatively accurate estimation of water quality constituents in coastal/inland waters remains a great challenge. The launch of sophisticated spaceborne sensing systems, such as that of Landsat 8, can assist in improving our ability to estimate freshwater lake properties from space.},

Abstract = {The Water Framework Directive requires European states to monitor the ecological quality of their lakes. Detailed information on the composition and abundance of biological groups such as aquatic plants (macrophytes) and phytoplankton (including chlorophyll a) must be expressed as an ecological quality ratio (EQR), ranging from 1 (close to reference status) to 0 (bad status). Effort is often focused on gathering this detailed information on selected lakes at the expense of more synoptic approaches that could capture a more holistic assessment of a catchment's water quality. This could be rectified if remote sensing can provide predictions of ecological quality for unmonitored lakes. We found that data from Sentinel-2 satellites, based on regression model outputs of observed vs estimated results, successfully predicted the macrophyte EQR (R-2 = 0.77) and the maximum lake depth that macrophytes colonised to (R-2 = 0.80) but average chlorophyll a was less well predicted (R-2 = 0.66). Predictions for a test catchment indicated that results were within one ecological assessment class width of measured values for macrophytes. This approach can potentially estimate status for unmonitored lakes in Ireland, be integrated with results on monitored lakes and used to direct resources where needed at national and catchment scales.},

Title = {A Semi-Automated Two-Step Building Stock Monitoring Methodology for Supporting Immediate Solutions in Urban Issues},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have addressed environmental and social issues in cities, such as insecure land tenure, climate change, and vulnerability to natural disasters. SDGs have motivated authorities to adopt urban land policies that support the quality and safety of urban life. Reliable, accurate, and up-to-date building information should be provided to develop effective land policies to solve the challenges of urbanization. Creating comprehensive and effective systems for land management in urban areas requires a significant long-term effort. However, some procedures should be undertaken immediately to mitigate the potential negative impacts of urban problems on human life. In developing countries, public records may not reflect the current status of buildings. Thus, implementing an automated and rapid building monitoring system using the potential of high-spatial-resolution satellite images and street views may be ideal for urban areas. This study proposed a two-step automated building stock monitoring mechanism. Our proposed method can identify critical building features, such as the building footprint and the number of floors. In the first step, buildings were automatically detected by using the object-based image analysis (OBIA) method on high-resolution spatial satellite images. In the second step, vertical images of the buildings were collected. Then, the number of the building floors was determined automatically using Google Street View Images (GSVI) via the YOLOv5 algorithm and the kernel density estimation method. The first step of the experiment was applied to the high-resolution images of the Pleiades satellite, which covers three different urban areas in Istanbul. The average accuracy metrics of the OBIA experiment for Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3 were 92.74\%, 92.23\%, and 92.92\%, respectively. The second step of the experiment was applied to the image dataset containing the GSVIs of several buildings in different Istanbul streets. The perspective effect, the presence of more than one building in the photograph, some obstacles around the buildings, and different window sizes caused errors in the floor estimations. For this reason, the operator's manual interpretation when obtaining SVIs increases the floor estimation accuracy. The proposed algorithm estimates the number of floors at a rate of 79.2\% accuracy for the SVIs collected by operator interpretation. Consequently, our methodology can easily be used to monitor and document the critical features of the existing buildings. This approach can support an immediate emergency action plan to reduce the possible losses caused by urban problems. In addition, this method can be utilized to analyze the previous conditions after damage or losses occur.},

Abstract = {Adequate water quality management requires information on actual concentrations, spatial distribution and temporal variations of water constituents. Using passive remote sensing, synoptic information on a limited number of water parameters can regularly be obtained. Monitoring purposes and the study of the functioning of the aquatic ecosystem require quantitative processing and analysis rather than visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery. The quantitative use of remote sensing over water bodies is hampered by insufficient understanding of the physical mechanisms involved and by technical limitations of the instruments used. Items that play an important role in this respect are connected to the object characteristics, the geometry of the Sun, object and sensor, the atmosphere, the remote sensing instruments and the data processing involved. These items are critically assessed successively. Practical solutions and recommendations concerning implementation of remote sensing in operational water management practice are given.},

Title = {Optimal sampling strategy of water quality monitoring at high dynamic lakes: A remote sensing and spatial simulated annealing integrated approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {777},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {An efficient and precise spatial sampling design is critical to capture spatial and temporal water quality variations under cost and labor constraints. Therefore, it is practically essential to optimize the sampling locations using limited sampling numbers to obtain the most comprehensive water quality monitoring results considering both the spatial and temporal dynamics. Existing sampling methods were restricted due to lacking pre-information and specific sampling objective function. This paper proposed an optimal sampling strategy using remote sensing (RS) big data and spatial sampling annealing (SSA) integrated approach for sampling design. The proposed method involved spatial-temporal clustering of the total suspended sediment (TSS) using long-term remote sensing data (Terra/Aqua MODIS, 2000-2014), determining the required sampling numbers using geostatistical analysis, and SSA simulation following the objective function of minimization of the spatial-temporal mean estimation error using remote sensing data as references. Taking total suspended sediment (TSS) observations at Poyang Lake, China, as the case study and application region. Results showed that the RS + SSA sampling approach is superior to conventional sampling methods such as systematic, stratified, and expert sampling, concerning spatial and temporal sampling accuracy. TSS estimation errors of the whole lake were reduced by 18.11\% and 29.34\% on average when compared to systematic and stratified sampling under the same sample size. The annual TSS estimation errors were dropped by approximately 50\%. The sampling accuracy was affected by the synthetic effects of sampling strategy (station numbers and spatial distributions) and water quality variations (coefficient of variation, CV). Sampling optimization is more efficient to improve the sampling accuracy than increasing sampling size, which requires more cost and human resources. Remote sensing showed great potential as ideal means to provide spatially contiguous and comprehensive data as prior-knowledge for efficient sampling design. This paper provides solutions and recommendations for evaluating existing monitoring stations in their representation of water quality or optimizing a new sampling network for future implications of more efficient and precise water quality sampling and routine monitoring.

Title = {Remote Sensing Inversion of Suspended Matter Concentration Using a Neural Network Model Optimized by the Partial Least Squares and Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Suspended matter concentration is an important index for the assessment of a water environment and it is also one of the core parameters for remote sensing inversion of water color. Due to the optical complexity of a water body and the interaction between different water quality parameters, the remote sensing inversion accuracy of suspended matter concentration is currently limited. To solve this problem, based on the remote sensing images from Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and the field-measured suspended matter concentration, taking a section of the Haihe River as the study area, this study establishes a remote sensing inversion model. The model combines the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model, i.e., the PLS-PSO-BPNN model. The partial least squares algorithm is involved in screening the input values of the neural network model. The particle swarm optimization algorithm optimizes the weights and thresholds of the neural network model and it thus effectively overcomes the over-fitting of the neural network. The inversion accuracy of the optimized neural network model is compared with that of the partial least squares model and the traditional neural network model by determining the coefficient, the mean absolute error, the root mean square error, the correlation coefficient and the relative root mean square error. The results indicate that the root mean squared error of the PLS-PSO-BPNN inversion model was 3.05 mg/L, which is higher than the accuracy of the statistical regression model. The developed PLS-PSO-BPNN model could be widely applied in other areas to better invert the water quality parameters of surface water.},

Title = {A review of remote sensing applications for water security: Quantity, quality, and extremes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {585},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Water resources are critical to the sustainability of life on Earth. With a growing population and climate change, it is imperative to assess the security of these resources. Over the past five decades, satellite remote sensing has become indispensable in understanding the Earth and atmospheric processes. Satellite sensors have the capability of providing data at global scales, which is economical compared to the ground or airborne sensor acquisitions. The science community made significant advances over recent years with the help of satellite remote sensing. In view of these efforts, the current review aims to present a comprehensive review of the role of remote sensing in assessing water security. This review highlights the role of remote sensing applications to assess water quality, quantity, and hydroclimatic extreme events that play an important role in improving water security. Four water quality parameters, namely, chlorophyll-a, turbidity and Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Secchi Disk Depth (SDD), and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), are considered. Under water quantity assessment, we review three aspects, streamflow estimation, terrestrial water storage, and reservoir operations. Remote sensing applications in quantifying floods and droughts extremes are reviewed in this work. We present how satellite sensor information acquired from different spectral bands, including optical, thermal, and microwave ranges, along with gravity field measurements, have contributed towards the applications in the above areas. We also assess the role of physical models, empirical models, and data assimilation strategies, among others, in the above areas. Finally, possible future research pathways needed to address the issues faced by the science community are discussed. This work is the second of the two-part review series, wherein the first part deals with the applications of satellite remote sensing for agriculture management.},

Abstract = {This paper briefly describes the status of shrimp culture development in India, discusses its ecological and socio-economic impacts and recommends measures to achieve long term sustainability using advanced tools like remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). It highlights a selected number of remote sensing case studies on applications of remote sensing and GIS for sustainable management of shrimp culture. This paper addresses the potential capabilities of evolving satellite remote sensing technology and GIS for the sustainable management of shrimp culture through the analysis of various dataset depicting the criteria of sustainability. The need for accurate prediction of water quality parameters within the context of sustainable shrimp culture demands the application of advanced methods like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with remote sensing and GIS. These are essential in the spirit of sustainable development and management, particularly in developing countries, which are often more vulnerable to environmental degradation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The automatic assessment of barrage water quality is very restricted due to the distances, the number of biochemical parameters to be considered and the financial resources spent to obtain their values. To this scenario should be added the latency times between the sampling moment and the outcome of the laboratory analyses. Although the idea of considering sensors for remote acquisition of data is not new, there are some constraints to be addressed, like the existence of sensors to measure the pertinent parameters and their efficiency, the costs involved and the possibility of remote sensing. The application of this alternative is highly dependent on the relevance of the candidate parameters. At this point, the Data Mining (DM) approach assumes an important role, in the sense that it can reveal the relative importance of the parameters, as well the prediction models to determine the water quality and finally the associated accuracies. This paper introduces a decision framework to support the selection of biochemical parameters to be considered in remote sensing of water contained in barrages. The framework enables the comparison of the efficiency of two kinds of models, using; decision trees. The first one uses all the water quality indicators, including the time and cost consuming variables, while the second model is based only on remotely real-time acquired parameters. When comparing both strategies under several criteria (e.g., cost, time and confidence), the latter method was showed to be the best alternative.},

Abstract = {Water management in The Netherlands is of vital importance in maintaining a safe and habitable environment and has led to the establishment of Rijkswaterstaat in 1798, this year celebrating its 200(th) anniversary. Rijkswaterstaat uses remote sensing for mapping, acquiring height information, assessing water quality and for monitoring of vegetation and environmental developments. Although it is likely that the use of remote sensing will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of data acquisition, in many cases remote sensing is not yet fully integrated in an operational production process and embedded in the information need of the client. It is emphasised that it is the task of the remote sensing community to force a breakthrough in remote sensing acceptance by presenting accessible, repeatable and therefore standardised and reliable products to the client. The use of guidelines and expert systems are important in this respect. The information society offers the opportunities for increased use of remote sensing and the electronic highway can offer an important support.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing of total suspended solids (TSS) by satellite techniques in estuaries and bays plays an important role in monitoring water quality over a large area. It is valuable to the management of coastal water environment and ecosystems. In this study, remote sensing mapping of TSS was conducted to investigate the effects of rainstorm events on Apalachicola Bay. A rainstorm event (October 7-8, 2008) was selected for a period when wind speeds were weak and the river inflow was almost steady. TSS mapping of MODIS images before and after the rainstorm event showed substantial increase of TSS induced by the rainstorm. Using an image during low river discharge before the rainstorm as a reference. TSS distribution was mapped by an improved regression model using MODIS image after a rainstorm event. Two thresholds of TSS (25 and 60 mg l(-1)) were applied to delineate the rough edge of the sediment plume. The boundary separating highly turbid and relatively clear water was near Sikes Cut. The event did not influence the East Gulf Beach in the west side of East Pass. The study also shows the surface TSS concentrations can get back to their reference values (mean TSS at about 17 similar to 20 mg l(-1) and maximum TSS at about 70 mg l(-1)) after 60 h and 50 min (i.e. almost the day 2.5) of rainstorm stopping. The method developed can be used to monitor sediment load to support estuarine ecological research and water quality assessment in Apalachicola Bay. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Lake eutrophication is a critical issue in the interplay of water supply, environmental management, and ecosystem conservation. Integrated sensing, monitoring, and modeling for a holistic lake water quality assessment with respect to multiple constituents is in acute need. The aim of this paper is to develop an integrated algorithm for data fusion and mining of satellite remote sensing images to generate daily estimates of some water quality parameters of interest, such as chlorophyll a concentrations and water transparency, to be applied for the assessment of the hypertrophic Albufera de Valencia. The Albufera de Valencia is the largest freshwater lake in Spain, which can often present values of chlorophyll a concentration over 200 mg m(-3) and values of transparency (Secchi Disk, SD) as low as 20 cm. Remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhance Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images were fused to carry out an integrative near-real time water quality assessment on a daily basis. Landsat images are useful to study the spatial variability of the water quality parameters, due to its spatial resolution of 30 m, in comparison to the low spatial resolution (250/500 m) of MODIS. While Landsat offers a high spatial resolution, the low temporal resolution of 16 days is a significant drawback to achieve a near real-time monitoring system. This gap may be bridged by using MODIS images that have a high temporal resolution of 1 day, in spite of its low spatial resolution. Synthetic Landsat images were fused for dates with no Landsat overpass over the study area. Finally, with a suite of ground truth data, a few genetic programming (GP) models were derived to estimate the water quality using the fused surface reflectance data as inputs. The GP model for chlorophyll a estimation yielded a R-2 of 0.94, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 8 mg m(-3), and the GP model for water transparency estimation using Secchi disk showed a R-2 of 0.89, with an RMSE = 4 cm. With this effort, the spatiotemporal variations of water transparency and chlorophyll a concentrations may be assessed simultaneously on a daily basis throughout the lake for environmental management.

Abstract = {Spatial variations in ground water quality in the Khartoum state, Sudan, have been studied using geographic information system ( GIS) and remote sensing technique. Gegraphical informtion system a tool which is used for storing, analyzing and displaying spatial data is also used for investigating ground water quality information. Khartoum landsat mosac image aquired in 2013was used, Arc/Gis software applied to extract the boundary of the study area, the image was classified to create land use/land cover map. The land use map, geological and soil map are used for correlation between land use, geological formations, and soil types to understand the source of natural pollution that can lower the ground water quality. For this study, the global positioning system ( GPS), used in the field to identify the borehole location in a three dimentional coordinate ( Latitude, longitude, and altitude), water samples were collected from 156 borehole wells, and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters like electrical conductivity, Total dissolved solid, Chloride, Nitrate, Sodium, Magnisium, Calcium, and Flouride, using standard techniques in the laboratory and compared with the standards. The ground water quality maps of the entire study area have been prepared using spatial interpolation technique for all the above parameters. then the created maps used to visualize, analyze, and understand the relationship among the measured points. Mapping was coded for potable zones, non-potable zones in the study area, in terms of water quality sutability for drinking water and sutability for irrigation. In general satellite remote sensing in conjunction with geographical information system ( GIS) offers great potential for water resource development and management},

Abstract = {Recently, remote sensing considered as important tool in studies of water quality issues. The Aras River flows across a transboundary basin in northern Iran. In this study, the aim is to model the water quality parameters (WQPs) using remote sensing and an artificial neural network (ANN), which is a new method proposed to find WQPs based on multivariate regression approaches. The relationship between WQPs and digital data from the Sentinel-2 satellite was determined to estimate and map the WQPs in this river. Using the field data and digital image data, the obtained results show that multivariate regression approaches and high-resolution remote sensing could monitor and predict the distribution of WQPs in this basin. There was a meaningful correlation between bands calculated from image data and the river's WQPs, including electrical conductivity (EC) (R-2 = 0.91), Na+ (R-2 = 0.81), Mg2+ (R-2 = 0.90), SO42- (R-2 = 0.89), Cl- (R-2 = 0.81), and Ca2+ concentrations (R-2 = 0.60). Likewise, the WQPs including EC, SO42-, Mg2+, and Cl- in the river are predicted using ANN. This powerful model is built for the rapid assessment and forecasting of experimentally mentioned WQPs at any location in the domain of interest. The results represent the good ability of ANN to simulate the mentioned WQPs. Simulation accuracy, measured by the determination coefficient (DC), varies between 0.982 and 0. 991 for training and overfitting EC test data. It is concluded that the management of transboundary rivers can be achieved by using remote sensing techniques and machine learning methods, which help the beneficiary countries in the sustainable operation.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing has not been used extensively in southeast Asia for resource development, partly for reasons of perennial cloud cover and low image availability. However, the low level of awareness of remote sensing among planning and environmental agencies is unjustified in view of the capabilities of high spatial and spectral resolution sensors such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), coupled with a general lack of physical resources data throughout the region. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the application of Landsat MT imagery to the survey and monitoring of water quality in coastal regions affected by land drainage from peat swamp catchments, which are common in southeast Asia, thus where dissolved organic matter (yellow substance) dominates the volume reflectance of coastal water. The Thematic mapper 0.45-0.52 mum waveband was found to be capable of differentiating water with high concentration of yellow substance from nonplume water, but the addition of the 0.63-0.69 mum waveband was required for differentiating lower concentrations of yellow substance. The higher temperature of yellow substance dominated river plumes observed on the 10.5-12.5 mum waveband confirmed field observations. These findings have implications for water resource management in the region, since image derived classes of water quality can be related to environmental standards for the main types of water use.},

Abstract = {Water quality and water resource management will be a major problem in our society, which global consumption was 54\% of available water in 1995. In 2025, some countries in Africa, Middle East and Southern Asia, would have a demand reaching their available resources. In this specific field of water resource assessment, traditional network of water level gauges is reduced in some tropical countries of South and the quantification of global water resources is now less effective than in 1980. On this case, Earth Observation techniques could be a solution by providing useful EO and GIS solutions for a regular and cost effective monitoring and management of water resources. The aim of this paper is to use remote sensing information to reach a better description of the global functioning of a tropical wetland in French Guiana. Combining optical and radar data, we define spatialized <<indicators>>, expressing the water dynamic in these coastal hydrosystem.},

Abstract = {In order to study the water resources of Weihe and to maintain its ecological environment, remote sensing technology is used to study the local water resources (monitoring water quality and quantity). Weihe is not only the political and cultural center of Shaanxi Province, but also an economically active zone. It has become an important part of hydrology and water resources work in Shaanxi Province to keep abreast of the relevant situation of Weihe waters at any time, and also a prerequisite for maintaining the ecological environment of Weihe. Remote sensing technology is a high resolution tool for obtaining target information, information transmission and comprehensive utilization of information. Especially for the dynamic subject of hydrology and water resources, the depth of Weihe waters is obtained by remote sensing technology, and the pollutant concentration data are obtained according to the characteristics of pollutants. Therefore, remote sensing technology is used to monitor the water quantity and water quality of Weihe waters and to obtain effective information on Weihe waters, which provides a basis for other studies of Weihe waters, and also has a certain supporting role in the management of relevant institutions, and ultimately realizes the sustainable ecological environment of Weihe.},

Abstract = {The present study describes the urban sprawl and groundwater quality of Faridabad city of National Capital Region of Delhi. Urban sprawl was analyzed using remote sensing techniques. It was observed that since 2000, the city has experienced pronounced urban sprawl, which resulted in a substantial impact on water quality. The growth of urban areas has resulted in land use/cover changes. The analysis of the results shows the major increase (149 \%) of barren land and built-up area (65 \%) at the cost of vegetation and fallow land. Groundwater samples were analyzed for chemical parameters. The physico-chemical parameters (total hardness, F, TDS, Ca, Mn, Alkalinity and NO3) of the groundwater varied significantly between seasons and sites. Groundwater quality of site II (industrial area) is highly polluted in comparison of other sites. The impact of urban sprawl on water quality is attributed to the population growth, urbanization, rapid industrialization, and blooming of residential colonies.},

Title = {Integration of Remote Sensing and Mexican Water Quality Monitoring System Using an Extreme Learning Machine},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Remote Sensing, as a driver for water management decisions, needs further integration with monitoring water quality programs, especially in developing countries. Moreover, usage of remote sensing approaches has not been broadly applied in monitoring routines. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the efficacy of available sensors to complement the often limited field measurements from such programs and build models that support monitoring tasks. Here, we integrate field measurements (2013-2019) from the Mexican national water quality monitoring system (RNMCA) with data from Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-3 OLCI, and Sentinel-2 MSI to train an extreme learning machine (ELM), a support vector regression (SVR) and a linear regression (LR) for estimating Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Turbidity, Total Suspended Matter (TSM) and Secchi Disk Depth (SDD). Additionally, OLCI Level-2 Products for Chl-a and TSM are compared against the RNMCA data. We observed that OLCI Level-2 Products are poorly correlated with the RNMCA data and it is not feasible to rely only on them to support monitoring operations. However, OLCI atmospherically corrected data is useful to develop accurate models using an ELM, particularly for Turbidity (R-2 = 0.7). We conclude that remote sensing is useful to support monitoring systems tasks, and its progressive integration will improve the quality of water quality monitoring programs.},

Title = {Water Chlorophyll Estimation in an Urban Canal System With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data},

Abstract = {Water quality, which is a key concern associated with large-scale canal operation and management, is vulnerable to the influences from short-term weather variations and artificial activities. Chlorophyll is one of the key indicators to measure the water quality and usability for drinking and irrigation in the canal system. However, previous research designed the state-of-the-art algorithms regarding water chlorophyll estimation using medium-resolution remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat), which has insufficient resolution to capture canals that are usually narrower than one pixel in such data. High-resolution imageries covering the whole canal network might include only either visible wavebands (i.e., red, green, blue bands) or cost thousands of dollars for an effective investigation on real-time water chlorophyll monitoring. Thus, the strategy designed for water chlorophyll analysis in a canal should consider an appropriate tradeoff among spatial resolution, the spectrum helpful for chlorophyll detection, and the financial burden. This letter presents our efforts on identifying and assessing the extent of the Planet data for measuring chlorophyll degree of canal waters. The experiments show that although Planet can represent the relative variation in water chlorophyll concentration, new algorithms are still necessary for accurate results regarding water chlorophyll variations in a canal system.},

Abstract = {Updating the physicochemical properties of surface water is important to water quality researchers and decision-makers. Routine surface water quality monitoring methods are inadequate; whereas, remote sensing (RS) is a source of processing data in both spatial and temporal domains. However, RS is a good tool of monitoring freshwater ecosystems, accurate modelling of surface water quality parameters from satellite imagery is still a challenging task. High correlation between the adjacent satellite signals, which creates redundancy, is one of the main challenges that negatively affect the stability of the developed models. Therefore, this paper focuses on the development of a novel approach for modelling concentrations of both turbidity (T) and total suspended solids (TSS) using Landsat-8 tasselled cap transformation (TCT). As a result, robust models were developed between measurements from satellite-derivedTand TSS and in situ measurements with coefficient of determination values of 0.854 and 0.812, respectively. These findings confirmed the possibility of using TCT to establish strong models for assessing surface water quality due to its capability of transforming a set of correlated data onto a convenient set of uncorrelated data, which maintain the major information associated with a physical phenomenon.},

Abstract = {The quality of water resources, which are very important for environmental and human health, can now be examined together with remote sensing technology. Management of water resources is crucial for the development of countries. In our country, the quality of the water resources is getting worse due to the development of the industry and other factors. There are many spectral classification methods in remote sensing, and the applicability of two spectral classification methods is aimed to evaluate water quality in this study. Within the scope of this study, Imranli region of Kizilirmak River was examined. High resolution satellite image in operation CHRIS Proba is provided free of charge from European Space Agency. The spectroradiometer measurement points were determined to obtain the water sample. From these points, local measurements were made with the spectroradiometer simultaneously with transition of the satellite. The quality evaluation was carried out by analyzing the water samples in the laboratory. As a result of measurements made with the spectroradiometer, reflectance from the measurements was resampled at the Chris PROBA band intervals and a reference for classification was established. Using this data, applicability of a spectral classification method, Match Filtering and Spectral Information Divergence, was tested in order to evaluate water quality.},

Abstract = {Water quality products derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy show that remote sensing is a useful, demonstrated and almost operational tool for providing end-users with water quality information for inland and coastal waters. The added value lies, e.g., in the optimization of sampling networks and hydro-ecological modelling. Satellite remote sensing will soon provide the same products, albeit with lower spatial resolution. In particular, the improved spectral, radiometric and spatial resolution of MERIS will enable independent retrieval of parameters such as CHL and TSM in coastal and inland waters. Other possible parameters to be retrieved from RS are yellow substance, cyanobacterial pigments, and physical properties such as transparency and vertical attenuation. The ESA-Data User Programme Project ``Pre-operational Water and Environment Regional Service (POWERS){''} intends to develop user-oriented tools needed to estimate regional specific water-quality parameters from remote sensing observations. The POWERS End User Requirements (PEURS) results (Van der Woerd et nl., 1998) are used as input in a top down analysis, whereby starting from desired level 3 products, specific requirements for level 2 and level 1 products are formulated. Such demands affect the number of parameters at both levels, the temporal and spatial resolution and the inversion of(forward) bio-optical models.},

Abstract = {Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is the main component of phytoplankton and an important index of water quality. Pearson correlation analysis is conducted on measured Chl-a concentration and band reflectance to determine the sensitive bands or multiband combinations of the Chl-a to input to a support vector machine (SVM) model. An indicator beta is defined to evaluate the model performance of fitting and prediction. The model performs well with the lowest beta (decision coefficient, (R-2) = 0.774; root mean square error (RMSE) = 22.636 mu g/L) of the validation set. The model test results prove that the model performs well. We analyze the impact factors of the model. The seasonal factor affects the model performance significantly; thus, samples from different seasons should be combined to train the model and inverse the water quality. Noise points reduce the model accuracy significantly; therefore, obvious outliers must be excluded at first. Additionally, the sampling method affects model accuracy, and systematic sampling in the descending order of Chl-a concentration is recommended. The combination of SVM algorithm and remote sensing technology provides a convenient, scientific, and real-time method to monitor and control water quality.},

Title = {Retrieval model for total nitrogen concentration based on UAV hyper spectral remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms - A case study in the Miyun Reservoir, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Monitoring the water pollution level in real time is the most critical issue for protecting the water quality of water reservoirs. Due to the restrictions on flight areas of Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV), four sensitive regions with the area of 1-2 km2 were first selected in this study based on the spatial distribution of total nitrogen (TN) concentration changes estimated by the Landsat remote sensing data. And then twelve machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR), Lasso Regression (Lasso), Elastic Net (EN), Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), K Neighbors Regression (KNR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Extra Trees Regression (ETR), AdaBoost Regression (ABR) and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) were compared to construct a more accurate retrieval model by using the UAV hyper spectral remote sensing and ground monitoring data. And then the TN concentration was estimated after the process of dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing denoing. Finally, spatial heterogeneity of the TN concentration was analyzed in four sensitive areas of the Miyun reservoir. The results demonstrated that among the tested algorithms the Extra Trees Regression was best suitable for the construction of a TN concentration retrieval model on the basis of UAV hyper spectral data, and its absolute squared error was 0.000065. The spatial distribution of the TN showed that the concentration was highest within the water area of the Bulaotun village and the Houbajiazhuang village, while it was relatively low for the Chao river dam and Bai river dam. Additionally, no significant differences regarding the concentrations were shown in the single UAV flight area except the Houbajia village, which indicated that the water quality in Miyun reservoir was relatively stable and changed in a small interval. These conclusions can provide scientific references for water quality monitoring and management in the water reservoir.},

Title = {An advanced remote sensing retrieval method for urban non-optically active water quality parameters: An example from Shanghai},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {880},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The optical insensitivity of non-optically active water quality parameters (NAWQPs) presents a significant challenge for remote sensing-based quantitative monitoring, which is an important tool for water quality assessment and management. Based on the analysis of the samples from Shanghai, China, it was found that the spectral morphological characteristics of the water body were obviously different under the combined effect of multiple NAWQPs. In view of this, in this paper, a machine learning method was proposed for the retrieval of urban NAWQPs by using multi-spectral scale morphological combined feature (MSMCF). The proposed method integrates both local and global spectral morphological features, and employs a multi-scale approach to enhance its applicability and stability, providing a more accurate and robust solution. To explore the applicability of the MSMCF method in retrieving urban NAWQPs, different methods were tested in terms of the retrieval accuracy and stability on the measured data and three different hyperspectral data. As can be seen from the results, the proposed method has good retrieval performance, which can be applied to hyperspectral data with different spectral resolutions with certain ability to suppress noise. Further analysis indicates that the sensitivity of each NAWQP to spectral morphological features varies. The research methods and findings in this paper can promote the development of hyperspectral and remote sensing technology in the prevention and treatment of urban water quality deterioration, and provide reference for related research.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {River deltas and estuaries belong to the most significant coastal landforms on our planet and are usually very densely populated. Nearly 600 million people live in river deltas, benefiting from the large variety of locational advantages and rich resources. Deltas are highly dynamic and vulnerable environments that are exposed to a wide range of natural and man-made threats. Sustainable management of river deltas therefore requires a holistic assessment of historic and recent ongoing changes and the dynamics in settlement sprawl, land cover and land use change, ecosystem development, as well as river and coastline geomorphology, all of which is difficult to achieve solely with traditional land-based surveying techniques. This review paper presents the potential of Earth Observation for analyses and quantification of land surface dynamics in the large river deltas globally, emphasizing the different geo-information products that can be derived from medium resolution, high resolution and highest resolution optical, multispectral, thermal and SAR data. Over 200 journal papers on remote sensing related studies for large river deltas and estuaries have been analyzed and categorized into thematic fields such as river course morphology, coastline changes, erosion and accretion processes, flood and inundation dynamics, regional land cover and land use dynamics, as well as the monitoring of compliance with respect to anthropogenic activity such as industry expansion-related habitat destruction. Additionally, our own exemplary analyses are interwoven into the review to visualize related delta work.},

Abstract = {Quantifying and interpreting variability in ecological systems allows us to better understand the driving forces that determine ecosystems functioning. We utilised earth observation-based remote sensing to determine total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations for 109 lakes over 16 years. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to quantify variability of TSS at three temporal scales (monthly, annual and long-term) and at the horizontal spatial scale. CV values varied between 0.14 and 1.09. Drivers of observed variability patterns were explored using five lake morphological and catchment characteristics. Lake area was the most important variable to predict variability of TSS. De-vegetated lakes displayed significantly higher TSS concentrations than vegetated lakes; however, aquatic vegetation was found to moderate only spatial variability of TSS. As spatio-temporal variability can be assumed to drive key ecosystem functions, determining characteristic variability patterns for various attributes should be a prerequisite when setting management goals and developing monitoring regimes.},

Abstract = {1. A review is presented of types of satellite remote-sensing data currently available, and their recent uses in studies of river systems. 2. Broad-scale assessments of relative water quality may be carried out, although precise indication of water quality requires samples to be taken in situ. 3. In the event of flooding, the extent of inundation may be determined and damage assessed quickly. Some radar data allow measurements of flood water even when obscured by vegetation. 4. Riparian vegetation may be mapped over large areas, although the recognition of specific tree species remains difficult. 5. One of the most basic and widely used applications of remote-sensing data for rivers is that of mapping, both as a single event and over time to follow changes, e.g. channels in a delta. Entire catchments may be mapped, although the efficiency of detection of low-order streams is dependent upon the characteristics of the system used. 6. Remote-sensing data has been widely used in all of the above types of study, but is rarely employed on a long-term basis. Several factors can explain this situation, including, for example, the absence of reliable absolute relationships between spectral data and ecological parameters. 7. A clear definition of observational needs (e.g. spectral bands, ground resolution, acquisition frequency) of stream ecologists, together with the identification of ecological parameters that may be collected relatively easily from space, will improve remote sensing as an ecological tool in many restoration and management situations.},

Abstract = {Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is considered as a primary indicator for water quality and foods for oyster growth in Apalachicola estuarine ecosystem. Assessment of chl-a concentration variation in response to river inflow is important for estuarine environmental research and management. In this study, remote sensing analysis has been conducted to evaluate the effects of river inflow on chlorophyll concentrations in Apalachicola Bay of Florida in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. A remote sensing model for chl-a was improved and applied to map spatial distributions of chl-a by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m resolution imageries in high-flow and low-flow seasons in 2001 and 2008. Chl-a values approximately ranged from the minimum 6 mu g/l to the maximum 29 mu g/l in the study period. Maximum chl-a concentration in high-flow season was almost twice above that in low-flow season. The averaged mean and minimum chl-a level in the high-flow season were approximately 42 and 28 \% higher than those in low-flow season, respectively. The remote sensing mapping of chl-a was able to show spatial variations of chl-a in the entire bay under different flow conditions, which indicated its advantage over the traditional field data sampling for monitoring water quality over a large area of estuary. The MODIS 250-m remote sensing regression model presented from this study can be used to support monitoring and assessment of the spatial chl-a distribution in the bay for environmental research and management in Apalachicola Bay.},

Abstract = {Understanding the relationship between land use and surface water quality is necessary for effective water management. We estimated the impacts of catchment-wide land use on water quality during the dry and rainy seasons in the Dongjiang River basin, using remote sensing, geographic information systems and multivariate statistical techniques. The results showed that the 83 sites can be divided into three groups representing different land use types: forest, agriculture and urban. Water quality parameters exhibited significant variations between the urban-dominated and forest-dominated sites. The proportion of forested land was positively associated with dissolved oxygen concentration but negatively associated with water temperature, electrical conductivity, permanganate index, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and chlorophyll-a. The proportion of urban land was strongly positively associated with total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations. Forested and urban land use had stronger impacts on water quality in the dry season than in the rainy season. However, agricultural land use did not have a significant impact on water quality. Our study indicates that urban land use was the key factor affecting water quality change, and limiting point-source waste discharge in urban areas during the dry season would be critical for improving water quality in the study area.},

Abstract = {There has been a rapid growth of shrimp farm around Kung Krabaen Bay in the past decade. This has caused enormous rise in generation of domestic and industrial wastes. Most of these wastes are disposed in the Kung Krabaen Bay. There is a serious need to retain this glory by better water quality management of this river. Conventional methods of monitoring of water quality have limitations in collecting information about water quality parameters for a large region in detailed manner due to high cost and time. Satellite based technologies have offered an alternate approach for many environmental monitoring needs. In this study, the high-resolution satellite data (LANDSAT TM) was utilized to develop mathematical models for monitoring of chlorophyll-a. Comparison between empirical relationship of spectral reflectance with chl-a and band ratio between the near infrared (NIR) and red was suggested to detect chlorophyll in water. This concept has been successfully employed for marine zones and big lakes but not for narrow rivers due to constraints of spatial resolution of satellite data.

Title = {Effective coastal Escherichia coli monitoring by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) thermal infrared images},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Coastal Escherichia coli (E. coli) significantly influence ocean safety and public health, thus requiring an effective E. coli pollution monitoring. However conventional detection relying on manual field sampling is timeconsuming. Here, this study established an E. coli estimation model based on thermal remote sensing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This model was developed against one-year comprehensive field work in a representative sandy beach and further validated against 50 beaches in Hong Kong to evaluate its applicability. The estimated E. coli concentrations were in a reliable agreement with direct measurements. For this model, this study deployed the radon-222 (222Rn) as a bridging tracer to couple UAV thermal images and coastal E. coli concentrations. Coastal 222Rn can be reflected on the UAV thermal images, and there was a good positive correlation between the 222Rn activity and coastal E. coli concentration via one-year field data. Hence, coupling the 222Rn activity estimated from UAV thermal images and the relationship between 222Rn and E. coli, this study can readily monitor coastal E. coli by UAV. These findings highlighted that UAV technology is an effective approach to measure the E. coli concentrations and can further pave the way for an efficient coastal E. coli monitoring and public health risk warning.},

Title = {Monitoring Coastal Lagoon Water Quality through Remote Sensing: The Mar Menor as a Case Study},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Mar Menor is a hypersaline coastal lagoon located in the southeast of Spain. This fragile ecosystem is suffering several human pressures, such as nutrient and sediment inputs from agriculture and other activities and decreases in salinity. Therefore, the development of an operational system to monitor its evolution is crucial to know the cause-effect relationships and preserve the natural system. The evolution and variability of the turbidity and chlorophyll-a levels in the Mar Menor water body were studied here through the joint use of remote sensing techniques and in situ data. The research was undertaken using Operational Land Imager (OLI) images on Landsat 8 and two SPOT images, because cloudy weather prevented the use of OLI images alone. This provided the information needed to perform a time series analysis of the lagoon. We also analyzed the processes that occur in the salt lagoon, characterizing the different spatio-temporal patterns of biophysical parameters. Special attention was given to the role of turbidity and chlorophyll-a levels in the Mar Menor ecosystem with regard to the programs of integral management of this natural space that receives maximum environmental protection. The objective of the work has been fulfilled by answering the questions of the managers: when did the water quality in the Mar Menor begin to change? What is happening in the lagoon? Is remote sensing useful for monitoring the water quality in the Mar Menor? The answers to these questions have allowed the generation of a methodology and monitoring system to track the water quality in the Mar Menor in real-time and space. The tracking system using satellite images is open to the incorporation of images provided by new multispectral sensors.},

Abstract = {Earth-observation systems (satellites and in situ monitoring) are routinely used to collect information about water quality. Recently, smartphone-based tools and other citizen-science sensors have enabled citizens to also contribute to the collection of scientifically relevant data. This chapter describes a decision support system used to predict optical water-quality indicators in the Wadden Sea, which is an intertidal marine system, where natural processes related to sediment transport and primary production define the basis of its ecological values. As information sources, the system uses satellite data, data collected with a mobile app and physical data for the period 2003-2015. An artificial-intelligence technique, inductive learning, is used to analyze the data and provide predictions in terms of water colour represented via the Forel-Ule scale (a comparative scale for colour).},

Abstract = {Despite the enormous capital required to fund remote sensing initiatives, governments worldwide are increasingly adopting earth observation technologies to optimise operational efficiency and societal benefit. However, the value of information derived from earth observation will increase substantially if augmented by socio-economic data within contextualised focus areas of direct societal relevance. Within the framework of the key strategic development priorities designed by the South African government, the objective of this paper was to review existing and emerging remote sensing applications and their relevance to South Africa's development priorities. Whereas there is potential for adoption of remote sensing techniques in other prioritised areas, this paper identifies health, crime analysis, rural planning and agriculture, natural resource management and physical planning as areas with considerable potential. However, to realise the set strategic priorities and outcomes, decision support systems that incorporate information derived from remote sensing should be maximised. To achieve this, it will be necessary to link patterns and processes from expert knowledge to emerging and existing societal challenges identified and to develop requisite policies of governance. The paper concludes that remote sensing technology has considerable potential to support sustainable socio-economic strategic priorities set by the South African government.},

Abstract = {The Lower Manyame Sub-catchment (LMS) is one of the most heavily polluted in Zimbabwe. Its waters are valuable for irrigation, domestic and industrial purposes. LMS has serious eutrophication problems emanating from human activities within it, and lakes Manyame and Chivero upstream. Data collected from October 2018 to April 2019 were used to test an integrated methodology based on field measurements and remote sensing. This study illustrates the production of multitemporal spatialised maps of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) concentrations from satellite data acquired from Sentinel-2. The analysis confirmed the pollution (eutrophic and organic matter) status of LMS water, for the period considered by this research. As a result, careful land planning must be done through the joint operation of local authorities, regional agencies and regional institutions, since Manyame River is a tributary of the Zambezi River (a transboundary river).},

Title = {Monitoring Water Quality of Valle de Bravo Reservoir, Mexico, Using Entire Lifespan of MERIS Data and Machine Learning Approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Remote-sensing-based machine learning approaches for water quality parameters estimation, Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) and Turbidity, were developed for the Valle de Bravo reservoir in central Mexico. This waterbody is a multipurpose reservoir, which provides drinking water to the metropolitan area of Mexico City. To reveal the water quality status of inland waters in the last decade, evaluation of MERIS imagery is a substantial approach. This study incorporated in-situ collected measurements across the reservoir and remote sensing reflectance data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Machine learning approaches with varying complexities were tested, and the optimal model for SDD and Turbidity was determined. Cross-validation demonstrated that the satellite-based estimates are consistent with the in-situ measurements for both SDD and Turbidity, with R-2 values of 0.81 to 0.86 and RMSE of 0.15 m and 0.95 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). The best model was applied to time series of MERIS images to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of the reservoir's water quality from 2002 to 2012. Derived analysis revealed yearly patterns caused by dry and rainy seasons and several disruptions were identified. The reservoir varied from trophic to intermittent hypertrophic status, while SDD ranged from 0-1.93 m and Turbidity up to 23.70 NTU. Results suggest the effects of drought events in the years 2006 and 2009 on water quality were correlated with water quality detriment. The water quality displayed slow recovery through 2011-2012. This study demonstrates the usefulness of satellite observations for supporting inland water quality monitoring and water management in this region.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {171},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To examine whether a country-wide COVID-19 lockdown affected phytoplankton development, variability of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the north-western Arabian/Persian Gulf (Kuwait Bay) was investigated using remote sensing instruments Sentinel OLCI between 2018 and 2020 and compared to available in situ collected data. Satellite-retrieved chlorophyll concentrations considerably increased in inshore waters of Kuwait Bay, 1-2 months following the initiation of the 24/7 curfew. The extremely high concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients, especially ammonia, and coincided phytoplankton bloom were revealed in June-July 2020 by opportunity field sampling, supporting the satellite-derived bloom detection. Remote sensing operational monitoring with high spatial resolution sensors provides an exceptional opportunity for emergency analysis and decision making in conditions of natural or anthropogenic crises, which forces the development of regional remote sensing algorithms for the shallow marine environment of the Gulf.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Water quality of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is determined by a range of natural and anthropogenic drivers that are resolved in the eReefs coupled hydrodynamic - biogeochemical marine model forced by a process-based catchment model, GBR Dynamic SedNet. Model simulations presented here quantify the impact of anthropogenic catchment loads of sediments and nutrients on a range of marine water quality variables. Simulations of 2011-2018 show that reduction of anthropogenic catchment loads results in improved water quality, especially within river plumes. Within the 16 resolved river plumes, anthropogenic loads increased chlorophyll concentration by 0.10 (0.02-0.25) mg Chl m(-3). Reductions of anthropogenic loads following proposed Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan targets reduced chlorophyll concentration in the plumes by 0.04 (0.01-0.10) mg Chl m(-3). Our simulations demonstrate the impact of anthropogenic loads on GBR water quality and quantify the benefits of improved catchment management.},

Journal = {WATER},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Accurately identifying the source and controlling the total amount of pollutants are the basis for achieving regulation of pollution sources, which is critical for the prevention and control of surface water pollution. For this purpose, this study used the Xinjian River in Jinyun County, Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, China, as a case study to explore whether and how the tributary inflow impacts the downstream water quality. The main pollution sources in the upstream, midstream, and downstream of the Xinjian River were apportioned using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model based on the water quality data from four sample stations from January 2018 to September 2022. According to the unmatched factor in different sections, it is plausible to infer that the TN and TP are mainly caused by the tributaries. To enhance the reliability of pollution source apportionment based on the receptor model, a series of remote sensing images with high resolution were used to derive the water quality concentrations to present the spatial distribution and reveal the long-term trend of the local water environment. It is anticipated that the apportionment results could be of great assistance to local authorities for the control and management of pollution, as well as the protection of riverine water quality.},

Abstract = {Global observations and scientific expertise are becoming increasingly crucial to sound decision-making affecting a variety of economic and social challenges. Conversely, decision maker's awareness of the benefits of space-based observations is crucial to the future of the remote sensing industry. This can only be accomplished through increased availability and accessibility to support tools capable of providing decision makers with the knowledge they require. Space-based systems. and the data collected, must migrate from the purely scientific research realm into Earth observation architectures that support interoperable models. These architectures and interoperable models are the framework for the high fidelity, interoperable decision support tools of tomorrow. The NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) is placing new emphasis on exploitation of science expertise and global observations to bring these decision support systems into reality and widespread acceptance. The US Administration is taking bold steps to implement the President's vision for remote sensing and applications. Concurrently, the ESE is implementing an architecture, and aligning systems. research and resources to this ends defining six scientific themes to frame mission concept selection and system development. In parallel. applications and technologies are being initiated and expanded to advance NASA-sponsored observations and predictions into practical-use models. and decision support tools.

Abstract = {Though with a less dramatic growth compared to photogrammetry, remote sensing from multispectral imagery taken by UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) platforms is applied to vegetation health monitoring, crop management, water quality assessments, geological inspections and much more, with a sizeable number of multispectral cameras now available on the market. As for satellite images, a key point in remote sensing is calibration, both geometric and radiometric, and the modelling of disturbances, to get well co-registered reflectance data. Leaving aside radiometric calibration, this paper focuses on how to best georeference the different bands one with respect to the other. This is normally achieved by the so-called band-to-band registration (BBR). Here, a straightforward approach is proposed, that exploits the multi-camera geometry and, unlike BBR, all the information contents of the bands, as inter-band matches are searched (and possibly found) for every pair of bands and not only between a reference and a slave band. Tests on images taken with the 9-band MAIA S2 camera are presented, discussing the pro and cons of pre-calibration and on-the-job calibration of the camera parameters of each sensor. The results found show that the proposed method is at least as good as the BBR ones.},

Abstract = {Ridge-tillage is an agricultural practice where crops are planted on elevated ridges, with furrows in-between. Ridge-tillage has been shown to significantly reduce erosion from croplands, but data on the presence of ridge-tillage is sparse and challenging to collect at the landscape scale. Thus, water quality models often do not account for ridge-tillage in a spatially-explicit manner, potentially overlooking the important impacts of this practice. We have developed a novel method that exploits the spectral, radiometric and linearity shape characteristics to identify both drainage ditches and ridge-tillage furrows using remote sensing of 0.5 m satellite data. We applied the method to the Sasumua watershed in Kenya, where we had false positives in only 3\% of randomly selected polygons, and we detected the majority of ditches in 59\% of randomly selected polygons. We then assessed the potential value of including these data in sediment modelling, showing that representing these practices could reduce sediment export in the study area by roughly 80\%. Being able to readily identify the presence of ditches and furrows could enable the development of more accurate water quality models, and help identify priority areas for intervention to improve water quality (and possibly crop yields) through changing agricultural practices or policies.},

Abstract = {World will face a major fresh water crisis in the coming decades due to high contaminants in surface and subsurface water. Groundwater is ultimate and most suitable fresh water resource for human consumption in both urban as well as rural areas. The groundwater quality reflects the information about the natural and anthropogenic source of pollution. This study aims to determine the water quality status of the area and to deduce its relation to seasonal variations in land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Geographical Information System is taken into account for the enhanced interpolation of the area in terms of pollution status and mapping. The World Health Organization, Indian Council of Medical Research and Indian Standard Institution standardized water quality parameters were taken into account to compute the water quality index of the area, while IRS 1D LISS III satellite images are used for the LULC classification. This study has been carried out with the vision to get better information about groundwater quality and to design effective way for sustainable management of groundwater resources. The results show that although the district is less urbanized, nevertheless the water quality of majority of the area is unfit for consumption.},

Title = {An enhanced deep learning approach to assessing inland lake water quality and its response to climate and anthropogenic factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {620},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Remote sensing has long been used for inland water quality monitoring. However, due to the complex correlation between water quality parameters (WQPs) and water optical properties, the interactions of WQPs, and the im-pacts of climate, using remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) to adequately estimate WQPs is still a grand challenge. Deep learning has the potential in capturing the correlation among Rrs, optically active constituents (OACs), and non-OACs, and is progressively used in remote sensing retrieval of inland water quality. In this study, the enhanced multimodal deep learning (EMDL) models were proposed for Chlorophyll-a, total phosphorous, total nitrogen, Secchi disk depth, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved oxygen retrieval in Lake Simcoe (80 km north of Toronto, Canada). The EMDL models were developed and validated using the Rrs data derived from the harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, synchronized water quality measurements, water surface tempera-ture, and climate data (N = 1173). The performance of the EMDL models was compared to that of several other machine learning, deep learning, and empirical models. Using the developed EMDL models, the spatial distri-butions and long-term variations of the WQPs in Lake Simcoe from 2013 to 2019 were reconstructed. The im-pacts of 12 potential natural and anthropogenic factors on the water quality of the entire Lake Simcoe and its two most concerned estuaries were also quantitatively discussed. The results showed that the EMDL models produced satisfactory performance in estimation of the six WQPs, with the Slope being close to 1 (0.84-0.95), normalized mean absolute error <= 20.17\%, and Bias <= 14.68\%. The EMDL models had the potential to reconstruct the spatial patterns and time-series dynamics of water quality and effectively detect the gradients of spatial patterns. This study provides a novel approach to supporting the environmental management and identification of the affecting factors for the Lake Simcoe watershed.},

Abstract = {The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus influenced the world severely in the first half of 2020 caused shut down of all kind of human activities. It is reported that a word-wide ecological improvement in terms of air quality and water quality during this lock down period. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the progression in water quality through examining suspended particulate matter using remote sensing data in a tropical Ramsar site viz, Asthamudi Lake in Southern India. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the study area were analyzed and suspended particulate matter (SPM) is estimated from Landsat 8 OLI images. A comparison analysis of pre and co lockdown periods reveal that the concentration of SPM values during lockdown (mean SPM 8.01 mg/l) is lower than that of pre-lockdown (10.03 mg/l). The time series analysis of last five-year data from 2015 to 2020 also shows an average decrease of 43\% in SPM concentration during lockdown period compared to the last five-year average value of 9.1 mg/l. The reasons for improvement of SPM in water quality during the lockdown period in April-May 2020 was discussed, in terms of the role of anthropogenic activities and strategies for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources in the Asthamudi Lake were also presented.},

Abstract = {Wavelet artificial neural networks and remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate water quality variables such as Chlorophyll-a, turbidity and suspended solids. This paper describes empirical algorithms for the estimation of these variables incorporating information from the Operational Land Imager Sensor on board the Landsat-8 satellite. Neural networks are seasonally trained using data from the Cefni reservoir (Anglesey, U.K.), covering a variety of physical trophic status. Chlorophyll-a levels and the suspended solids are estimated from the reflectance in band-2 and band-4, while the turbidity values from reflectance in band-4. Experimental results show the potential of Landsat-8 as a substitute of Landsat-7 in water bodies quality monitoring. Moreover, predicted values obtained by using wavelet artificial neural networks fit well measured data and hence, such models provide accurate results therefore improving the efficiency in monitoring water quality parameters and contributing to possible decision making processes in the environmental management.},

Title = {Remote sensing of water quality based on HJ-1A HSI imagery with modified discrete binary particle swarm optimization-partial least squares (MDBPSO-PLS) in inland waters: A case in Weishan Lake},

Abstract = {Remote sensing has been recognized as an effective tool to monitor water quality in inland waters. An adaptive model coupled with a modified discrete binary particle swarm optimization algorithm utilizing the catastrophe strategy and partial least squares (MDBPSO-PLS) was developed to retrieve the water quality indexes (chlorophyll a (chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), and turbidity) in Weishan Lake. Based on the selective bands for water quality retrieval, the proposed MDBPSO algorithm was compared with original DBPSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The comparison results indicated that MDBPSO with the catastrophe strategy could avoid the premature convergence phenomenon of DBPSO algorithm. The hyperspectral data from HJ-1A Hyperspectral Imager (HSI) selected by MDBPSO were utilized to establish the PLS model by correlating the spectral data with measured water quality parameters. Then the established PLS model was compared with the PIS model established with full spectral data and measured water quality parameters. MDBPSO-PLS showed the better performance in retrieving the above-mentioned three parameters in Weishan Lake. The comprehensive errors between measured and retrieved parameters in MDBPSO-PLS (chl-a (R-2 = 0.97, CE = 3.16\%), TSM (R-2 = 0.97, CE = 5.84\%), and turbidity (R-2 = 0.97, CE = 7.40\%)) were lower than those in PLS model (chl-a (R-2 = 0.55, CE = 18.71\%), TSM (R-2 = 0.49, CE = 49.50\%), and turbidity (R-2 = 0.50, CE = 50.46\%). The three water quality parameters were mapped by using MDBPSO-PLS. Our observations indicated that the MDBPSO-PLS model showed the significantly higher retrieval accuracy than the PLS model and could provide realistic information on the distribution of chl-a, TSM, and turbidity in Weishan Lake based on HJ-1A HSI.},

Abstract = {Water quality monitoring plays an essential role in water resource management and water governance. At present, the monitoring is commonly conducted via in-situ sampling and/or by setting up gauging stations, which can be labour intensive and costly. Recently, the possibility of monitoring water quality through remote sensing with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and hyperspectral sensors has shown great promise, with the key ad-vantages of larger spatial coverage and possibly higher accuracy enabled by higher spectral resolution and more extensive data. Correspondingly, more advanced methods need to be established for hyperspectral analysis for water quality determination to capitalize on this wealth of information. In this study, a new method called Hierarchical Bayesian Model Aggregation for Optimal Multiple Band Ratio Analysis (HBMA-OMBRA) has been developed as a proof-of-concept for estimating Total Suspended Solids (TSS) concentrations from the hyper -spectral data. The method leverages on the Bayesian ensembling of competing models because there is not a single best working model for all situations. It also encompasses a new approach called Ensemble Band Ratio Selection (ENBRAS) for the identification of best candidate band ratios (BBRs) via a set of ensembling and ``bagging{''} procedures, followed by a modified Batchelor Wilkin's algorithm to cluster the candidate band ratios. A laboratory investigation was conducted in the present study to measure the hyperspectral reflectance in different experiments under various environmental conditions to verify the robustness of HBMA-OMBRA. From the experimental results, six distinct clusters of candidate BBRs were identified using ENBRAS. In particular, two clusters in the red, green, and near infrared spectrum showed the largest contribution. The significance of multi -clusters provides an explanation for previously contrasting results reported in the literature and some evidence for reconciling these findings.},

Abstract = {The accurate assessment of large-scale and complex coastal waters is a grand challenge due to the spatial nonstationarity and complex nonlinearity involved in integrating remote sensing and in situ data. We developed a water quality assessment method based on a newly proposed geographically neural network weighted regression (GNNWR) model to address that challenge and obtained a highly accurate and realistic water quality distribution on the basis of the comprehensive index of Chinese Water Quality Classification Standards. Using geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) data and observations from 1240 water quality sampling sites, we conducted experiments for a typical large-scale coastal area of the Zhejiang Coastal Sea (ZCS), People's Republic of China. The GNNWR model achieved higher prediction performance (average R-2 = 84\%) in comparison to the widely used models, and the obtained water quality classification (WQC) maps in May of 2015-2017 and August 2015 can depict intuitively reasonable spatiotemporal patterns of water quality in the ZCS. Furthermore, an analysis of WQC maps successfully illustrated how terrestrial discharges, anthropogenic activities, and seasonal changes influenced the coastal environment in the ZCS. Finally, we identified essential regions and provided targeted regulatory interventions for them to facilitate the management and restoration of large-scale and complex coastal environments.},

Abstract = {The work presents the comprehensive methodology for assessment of the state of the urban aquatic environment such as Lakes Opechen, Verbne, and Redkyne in Kyiv using the methods of system analysis. The methodology includes structural-textural analysis of the satellite images and the method based on statistical criteria. The spectral-texture analysis of the satellite images was used to get input information for remote assessment of reservoirs as index images: Normalized Difference Pond Index (NDPI), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), and Normalized Difference Algae Index (NDAI) computed from the Sentinel-2. The surface temperature distribution was estimated from the Landsat 8. The method based on statistical criteria is used for a detailed assessment of the aquatic environment using the obtained indexed images and the corresponding cartographic representation of the water quality. The probabilistic and statistical approaches were used to present the statistical criterion for recognizing classes of objects based on the results of measuring their informative features. These approaches are used to solve optimization problems in statistical theories of identification and recognition. This method allowed the cartographic representing of the change in the water quality and aquatic ecosystem in accordance with the reference areas of the state of the reservoir in 2017. temperature map.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this work, carried out in the framework of the PRISMA2 national research program (Research and Experimentation Program for the Adriatic Sea)(1) was the definition of an appropriate working methodology which allowed to estimate the impact of the Esino drainage-basin (central Italy), and of the anthropic activities lying on it, on the coastal water quality of the Adriatic sea. This aim was pursued by integrating techniques and instruments of analyses, such as GIS and remote sensing, which are often and often employed in natural resources managing and planning. They allowed to generate a database easily updating, relative to a very large area which is strongly differentiated in its natural and anthropic features. The database contains raw data, provided by local public organisations managing the territory, information derived from elaboration of the previous data and remote sensed fi ames (acquired by the hyperspectral sensor MIVIS) purposely acquired to the aim of the study. It was after all generated an ``open{''} system, continually updating with environmental information before long available; moreover, were explored the potentialities of the MIVIS sensor (102 band, from the visible to the thermic IR) in the study of marine coastal water quality.},

Title = {Chlorophyll and Suspended Solids Estimation in Portuguese Reservoirs (Aguieira and Alqueva) from Sentinel-2 Imagery},
Journal = {WATER},

Abstract = {Reservoirs have been subject to anthropogenic stressors, becoming increasingly degraded. The evaluation of ecological potential in reservoirs is remarkably challenging, and consistent and regular monitoring using the traditional in situ methods defined in the WFD is often time- and money-consuming. Alternatively, remote sensing offers a low-cost, high frequency, and practical complement to these methods. This paper proposes a novel approach, using a C2RCC processor to analyze Sentinel-2 imagery data to retrieve information on water quality in two reservoirs of Portugal, Aguieira and Alqueva. We evaluate the temporal and spatial evolution of Chl a and total suspended solids (TSS), between 2018 and 2020, comparing in situ and satellite data. Generally, Alqueva reservoir allowed lower relative (NRMSE = 8.9\% for Chl a and NRMSE = 21.9\% for TSS) and systematic (NMBE = 1.7\% for Chl a and NMBE = 2.0\% for TSS) errors than Aguieira, where some fine-tuning would be required. Our paper shows how satellite data can be fundamental for water-quality assessment to support the effective and sustainable management of inland waters. In addition, it proposes solutions for future research in order to improve upon the methods used and solve the challenges faced in this study.},

Title = {Uncertainties and applications of satellite-derived coastal water quality products},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {45-72},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent and forthcoming launches of a plethora of ocean color radiometry sensors, coupled with increasingly adopted free and open data policies are expected to boost usage of satellite ocean color data and drive the demand to use these data in a quantitative and routine manner. Here we review factors that introduce uncertainties to various satellite-derived water quality products and recommend approaches to minimize the uncertainty of a specific product. We show that the regression relationships between remote-sensing reflectance and water turbidity (in terms of nephelometric units) established for different regions tend to converge and therefore it is plausible to develop a global satellite water turbidity product derived using a single algorithm. In contrast, solutions to derive suspended particulate matter concentration are much less generalizable; in one case it might be more accurate to estimate this parameter based on satellite-derived particulate backscattering coefficient, whereas in another the nonagal particulate absorption coefficient might be a better proxy. Regarding satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration, known to be subject to large uncertainties in coastal waters, studies summarized here clearly indicate that the accuracy of classical reflectance band-ratio algorithms depends largely on the contribution of phytoplankton to total light absorption coefficient as well as the degree of correlation between phytoplankton and the dominant nonalgal contributions. Our review also indicates that currently available satellite-derived water quality products are restricted to optically significant materials, whereas many users are interested in toxins, nutrients, pollutants, and pathogens. Presently, proxies or indicators for these constituents are inconsistently (and often incorrectly) developed and applied. Progress in this general direction will remain slow unless, (i) optical oceanographers and environmental scientists start collaborating more closely and make optical and environmental measurements in parallel, (ii) more efforts are devoted to identifying optical, ecological, and environmental forerunners of autochthonous water quality issues (e.g., onsite growth of pathogens), and, (iii) environmental processes associated with the source, transport, and transformation of allochthonous issues (e.g., transport of nutrients) are better understood. Accompanying these challenges, the need still exists to conduct fundamental research in satellite ocean color radiometry, including development of more robust atmospheric correction methods as well as inverse models for coastal regions where optical properties of both aerosols and hydrosols are complex.},

Abstract = {Predicting recreational water quality is key to protecting public health from exposure to wastewater-associated pathogens. It is not feasible to monitor recreational waters for all pathogens; therefore, monitoring programs use fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), such as enterococci, to identify wastewater pollution. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict when culturable enterococci concentrations exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Recreational Water Quality Criteria (RWQC) at Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Ten years of culturable enterococci data were analyzed together with satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), direct normal irradiance (DNI), turbidity, and dew point, along with local observations of precipitation and mean sea level (MSL). The factors identified as the most relevant for enterococci exceedance predictions based on the U.S. EPA RWQC were DNI, turbidity, cumulative 48 h precipitation, MSL, and SST; they predicted culturable enterococci exceedances with an accuracy of 75\% and power greater than 60\% based on the Receiving Operating Characteristic curve and F-Measure metrics. Results show the applicability of satellite-derived data and ANNs to predict recreational water quality at Escambron Beach. Future work should incorporate local sanitary survey data to predict risky recreational water conditions and protect human health.},

Abstract = {Surface waters are a fundamental resource. They fulfil key function in global biogeochemical cycles and are core to our water, food and energy security. The rapidly increasing rate of data collection from different Earth observation (EO) missions suitable for observing water bodies has promoted satellite remote sensing (RS) as a more widely recognised source of information on a number of indicators of water quality and ecosystem condition at local and global scales. In parallel, advances in optical sensors support new and more detailed characterisation of the Earth surface and could lead to innovative EO-based products. Nonetheless, RS of water colour of inland and coastal systems, especially in larger scales and over long-term time series, faces unique challenges. This study provides an overview of the challenges and solutions of developing a global observation platform, including the diverse and complex optical properties of inland waters and guided algorithm selection procedure required to deliver reliable data. The development and validation of a global satellite data processing chain (Calimnos) has been supported by access to an extensive in situ data from more than thirty partners around the world that are now held in the LIMNADES community -owned database. This approach has resulted in a step -change in our ability to produce regional and global water quality products for optically complex waters. Local examples of the data outputs will be explored and the opportunities in how these data can be embedded within local and national monitoring schemes to facilitate better management of water will be discussed.},

Journal = {CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-64},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper proposed a semi-supervised regression model with co-training algorithm based on support vector machine, which was used for retrieving water quality variables from SPOT5 remote sensing data. The model consisted of two support vector regressors (SVRs). Nonlinear relationship between water quality variables and SPOT5 spectrum was described by the two SVRs, and semi-supervised co-training algorithm for the SVRs was established. The model was used for retrieving concentrations of four representative pollution indicators-permanganate index (CODmn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) of the Weihe River in Shaanxi Province, China. The spatial distribution map for those variables over a part of the Weihe River was also produced. SVR can be used to implement any nonlinear mapping readily, and semi-supervised learning can make use of both labeled and unlabeled samples. By integrating the two SVRs and using semi-supervised learning, we provide an operational method when paired samples are limited. The results show that it is much better than the multiple statistical regression method, and can provide the whole water pollution conditions for management fast and can be extended to hyperspectral remote sensing applications.},

Title = {Inversion and Driving Force Analysis of Nutrient Concentrations in the Ecosystem of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Bay Area},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although satellite remote sensing technology is intensively used for the monitoring of water quality, the inversion of coastal water bodies and non-optically active parameters is still a challenging issue. Few ongoing studies use remote sensing technology to analyze the driving forces of changes in water quality from multiple aspects based on inversion results. By the use of Landsat 5/8 imagery and measured in situ data of the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Bay area from 1986 to 2020, this study evaluated the modeling effects of four machine learning methods named Tree Embedding (TE), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The results show that the BPNN creates the most reliable and robust results. The values of the obtained correlation coefficients (r) are 0.83, 0.92, 0.84, and 0.90, and that of the coefficients of determination (R-2) are 0.70, 0.84, 0.70, and 0.81. The calculated mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 0.41, 0.16, 0.06, and 0.02, while the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.78, 0.29, 0.12, and 0.03. The concentrations of TN and TP (C-TN, C-TP) in the Shenzhen Bay, the Starling Inlet, and the Tolo Harbor were relatively high, fluctuated from 1986 to 2010, and decreased significantly after 2010. The C-TN and C-TP in the Mirs Bay kept continuously at a low level. We found that urbanization and polluted river discharges were the main drivers of spatial and inter-annual differences of C-TN and C-TP. Temperature, precipitation, and wind are further factors that influenced the intra-annual changes of C-TN and C-TP in the Shenzhen Bay, whilethe expansion of oyster rafts and mangroves had little effect. Our research confirms that machine learning algorithms are well suited for the inversion of non-optical activity parameters of coastal water bodies, and also shows the potential of remote sensing for large-scale, long-term monitoring of water quality and the subsequent comprehensive analysis of the driving forces.},

Title = {Hindcasting eutrophication and changes in temperature and storage volume in a semi-arid reservoir: a multi-decadal Landsat-based assessment},

Abstract = {In situ monitoring of freshwater systems is often constrained by cost and accessibility, particularly in developing countries and in remote areas. Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163\% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58\% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 degrees C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems.},

Abstract = {Omerli Reservoir is one of the major drinking water reservoirs of Greater Metropolis Istanbul, providing 40\% of the overall water demand. Istanbul where is one of the greatest metropolitan areas of the world with a population over 10 million and a rate of population increase about twice that of Turkey. As a result of population growth and industrial development, Omerli watershed is highly affected by the wastewater discharges from the residential areas and industrial plants. The main objective of this study is to investigate the temporal assessment of the land-use/cover of the Omerli Watershed and the water quality changes in the Reservoir. It is not possible to adequately control urbanization and other pollution sources affecting the water quality. Responses of these detrimental effects are due to rapidly increasing population, unplanned and illegal housing, and irrelevant industries at the protection zones of the watershed, together with insufficient infrastructure. The study is focused on the assessment of urbanization in relation to land use and water quality using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques for all the four protection zones of the Reservoir and a time variant analyzing model is obtained. IRS-1C LISS and IRS-1C PAN, LANDSAT-5 TM satellite data of 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2006 are analyzed by confirmation through the ground truth data. RS data have been transferred into UTM coordinate system and image enhancement and classification techniques were used. Raster data were converted to vector data that belongs to study area to analyze in GIS for the purpose of planning and decision-making on protected watersheds.},

Abstract = {The introduction of nutrients to lakes causing eutrophic conditions is a major problem around the world. Proper monitoring and modeling are important to effectively manage eutrophication in lake waters. The goal is to develop remote sensing models for nutrients, total phosphorus and total nitrogen, in Lake Champlain. The remote sensing models were created using multivariate linear regression with the unique band combinations of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery based on the empirical relationship with the field observations. The resulting models successfully showed nutrient distributions in the most eutrophic part of Lake Champlain, Missisquoi Bay, with reasonable adjusted coefficient of determination values (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.75 for total phosphorus and total nitrogen, respectively). The results show the feasibility and the utility of satellite imagery to detect spatial distributions of lake water quality constituents, which can be used to better understand nutrient distributions in Lake Champlain. This approach can be applicable to other lakes experiencing eutrophication assisting decision making when implementing Best Management Practices and other mitigation techniques to lakes.

Abstract = {During the past two decades there has been a dramatic increase in the development and application of hydrologic and water quality models to evaluate complex environmental processes and to assess nonpoint source pollution of soil and water resources. Recognizing that advancements in modeling continue to be driven by developments in computer technology, it is worthwhile to examine some of the current and emerging computer technologies that hold great promise for advancing the use of hydrologic and water quality models. An attempt is made to forecast and briefly discuss the impact that technologies such as geographic information systems, global positioning systems, and scientific visualization will have on the future of hydrologic and water quality modeling. Forecasting is a very risky business, not because of our chronic inability to predict what will happen in the future but also because such speculation raises questions about what we modelers and model users desire and value. The thesis of this article is that some current and most of the emerging technologies will facilitate development and widespread use of hydrologic and water quality models for water resources management and decision making in the future.},

Journal = {CATENA},

Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-18},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Water erosion creates negative impacts on agricultural production, infrastructure, and water quality across the world. Regional-scale water erosion assessment is important, but limited by data availability and quality. Satellite remote sensing can contribute through providing spatial data to such assessments. During the past 30 years many studies have been published that did this to a greater or lesser extent. The objective of this paper is to review methodologies applied for water erosion assessment using satellite remote sensing. First, studies on erosion detection are treated. This comprises the detection of erosion features and eroded areas, as well as the assessment of off-site impacts such as sediment deposition and water quality of inland lakes. Second, the assessment of erosion controlling factors is evaluated. Four types of factors are discussed: topography, soil properties, vegetation cover, and management practices. Then, erosion mapping techniques are described that integrate products derived front satellite remote sensing with additional data sources. These techniques include erosion models and qualitative methods. Finally, validation methods used to assess the accuracy of maps produced with satellite data are discussed. It is concluded that a general lack of validation data is a main concern. Validation is of utmost importance to achieve regional operational monitoring systems, and close collaboration between the remote sensing community and field-based erosion scientists is therefore required.

Title = {Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing to Monitor Water Quality in Drinking Water Reservoirs},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {At the Blankaart Water Production Center, a reservoir containing 3 million m3 of raw surface water acts as a first biologic treatment step before further processing to drinking water. Over the past decade, severe algal blooms have occurred in the reservoir, hampering the water production. Therefore, strategies (e.g., the injection of algaecide) have been looked at to prevent these from happening or try to control them. In this context, the HYperspectral Pointable System for Terrestrial and Aquatic Radiometry (HYPSTAR), installed since early 2021, helps in monitoring the effectiveness of these strategies. Indeed, the HYPSTAR provides, at a very high temporal resolution, bio-optical parameters related to the water quality, i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The present paper shows how the raw in situ hyperspectral data (a total of 8116 spectra recorded between 2021-02-03 and 2022-08-03, of which 2988 spectra passed the quality check) are processed to find the water-leaving reflectance and how SPM and Chla are derived from it. Based on a limited number of validation data, we also discuss the potential of retrieving phycocyanin (an accessory pigment unique to freshwater cyanobacteria). The results show the benefits of the high temporal resolution of the HYPSTAR to provide near real-time water quality indicators. The study confirms that, in conjunction with a few water sampling data used for validation, the HYPSTAR can be used as a quick and cost-effective method to detect and monitor phytoplankton blooms.},

Abstract = {Various protocols have been developed for trophic assessment of coastal waters but most incorporate single value compliance criteria for water quality parameters which, in reality, exhibit significant spatial variation. Application of these protocols generally requires the averaging of data recorded at discrete locations to obtain single values for comparison with compliance criteria; however, there is no guarantee that the averaged values are truly representative of overall water quality. The present approach to trophic assessment integrates measurement, remote sensing, flushing analysis and water quality modelling with the aim of identifying sub-regions in coastal waterbodies that demonstrate homogeneity. Averaged water quality data for these homogenous sub-regions should be more representative of the water quality in the sub-region as a whole making the assessment process more accurate. The integrated approach incorporates water quality classification criteria developed by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency but it can incorporate any suitable classification criteria. The approach was validated for a sub-region of Cork Harbour, Ireland and the trophic assessments agreed with previous assessments by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The approach has significant applications in the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and was adopted by the Irish EPA in convincing the EU to provide the Irish government with structural funds for water quality management within Cork Harbour.

Title = {Lake algal bloom monitoring via remote sensing with biomimetic and computational intelligence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Traditional supervised classifications for remote sensing-based water quality monitoring count on a set of classifiers to retrieve features and improve their prediction accuracies based on ground truth samples. However, many existing feature extraction methods in remote sensing are unable to exhibit multiple-instance nonlinear spatial pattern recognition at scales via ensemble learning. This paper designed for lake algal bloom monitoring presents intelligent feature extraction for harmonizing local and global features via tensor flow-based ensemble learning with integrated biomimetic and computational intelligence. To explore such complexity, an Integrated Biomimetic and Ensemble Learning Algorithm (IBELA) was developed to synthesize the contribution from different classifiers associated with the biomimetic philosophy of integrated bands. It leads to strengthened multiple-instance spatial pattern recognition in lake algal bloom monitoring via image fusion at the decision level. With the implementation of IBELA, a case study of a eutrophic freshwater lake, Lake Managua, for water quality monitoring leads to demonstrate six input visual senses showing different impacts on retrieving Chl-a concentrations in the dry and wet season, respectively. The input of total nitrogen from the watershed plays the most important role in water quality variations in both seasons in a watershed-based food-water nexus. Although ultraviolet and microwave bands are important in the dry season, Secchi disk depth is critical in the wet season for water quality monitoring.},

Title = {The impact of agricultural activities on water quality: A case for collaborative catchment-scale management using integrated wireless sensor networks},

Abstract = {The challenge of improving water quality is a growing global concern, typified by the European Commission Water Framework Directive and the United States Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water quality are economics, poor water management, agricultural practices and urban development. This paper reviews the extensive role of non-point sources, in particular the outdated agricultural practices, with respect to nutrient and contaminant contributions. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is currently undertaken through a number of data acquisition methods from grab sampling to satellite based remote sensing of water bodies. Based on the surveyed sampling methods and their numerous limitations, it is proposed that wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their own limitations, are still very attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal data collection for WQM applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface and ground water and catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends through their high resolution observations. However, these applications have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder's contributions, in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled agricultural activities and different environmental compartments for integrated water quality management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and WQM are identified. Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale is proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders (farming activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control and management.

Abstract = {The paper discusses the features and specifics of using the methods of remote sensing of the Earth when monitoring the ecological and technical state of water management process systems. A technology for monitoring surface waters according to remote sensing of the Earth is proposed. A method of satellite monitoring of algal bloom intensity (monitoring of planktonic algae clusters) has been proposed and substantiated. An approach to flood risk assessment using satellite observations is proposed. The technique of quantitative assessment of water quality according to the space monitoring of surface waters is substantiated. As a result of the research, it was found that when assessing the complex effects of pollutants on the ecological state of aquatic ecosystems using aerospace technologies, it is advisable to take into account changes in biological indicators (indicators of biomass and species composition of phytoplankton and higher aquatic plants). A method has been developed for predicting the long-term risks of emergency situations of a hydrological and hydrometeorological nature based on physical and mathematical modeling and the use of satellite observations and spatially distributed data. According to the results of further studies based on the results obtained in this work, it is planned to create flood risks distribution maps, quantitative predictions of surface water quality deterioration, as well as an assessment of the risks of air and soil pollution.},

Title = {Improving Satellite Retrieval of Coastal Aquaculture Pond by Adding Water Quality Parameters},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal aquaculture is an important supply of animal proteins for human consumption, which is expanding globally. Meanwhile, extensive aquaculture may increase nutrient loadings and environmental concerns along the coast. Accurate information on aquaculture pond location is essential for coastal management. Traditional methods use morphological parameters to characterize the geometry of surface waters to differentiate artificially constructed conventional aquaculture ponds from other water bodies. However, there are other water bodies with similar morphology (e.g., saltworks, rice fields, and small reservoirs) that are difficult to distinguish from aquaculture ponds, causing a lot of omission/commissioning errors in areas with complex land-use types. Here, we develop an extraction method with shape and water quality parameters to map aquaculture ponds, including three steps: (1) Sharpen normalized difference water index to detect and binarize water pixels by the Otsu method; (2) Connect independent water pixels into water objects through the four-neighbor connectivity algorithm; and (3) Calculate the shape features and water quality features of water objects and input them into the classifier for supervised classification. We selected eight sites along the coast of China to evaluate the accuracy and generalization of our method in an environment with heterogeneous pond morphology and landscape. The results showed that six transfer characteristics including water quality characteristics improved the accuracy of distinguishing aquaculture ponds from salt pans, rice fields, and wetland parks, which typically had F1 scores > 85\%. Our method significantly improved extraction efficiency on average, especially when aquaculture ponds are mixed with other morphological similar water bodies. Our identified area was in agreement with statistics data of 12 coastal provinces in China. In addition, our approach can effectively improve water objects when high-resolution remote sensing images are unavailable. This work was applied to open-source remote sensing imagery and has the potential to extract long-term series and large-scale aquaculture ponds globally.},

Title = {Retrieval of TP Concentration from UAV Multispectral Images Using IOA-ML Models in Small Inland Waterbodies},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Total phosphorus (TP) concentration is high in countless small inland waterbodies in Hubei province, middle China, which is threating the water environment. However, there are almost no ground-based water quality monitoring points in small inland waterbodies, because the cost of time, labor, and money is high and it does not meet the needs of spatiotemporal dynamic monitoring. Remote sensing provides an effective tool for TP concentration monitoring spatiotemporally. However, monitoring the TP concentration of small inland waterbodies is challenging for satellite remote sensing due to the inadequate spatial resolution. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been applied to quantitatively retrieve the spatiotemporal distribution of TP concentration without the challenges of cloud cover and atmospheric effects. Although state-of-the-art algorithms to retrieve TP concentration have been improved, specific models are only used for specific water quality parameters or regions, and there are no robust and reliable TP retrieval models for small inland waterbodies at this time. To address this issue, six machine learning methods optimized by intelligent optimization algorithms (IOA-ML models) have been developed to quantitatively retrieve TP concentration combined with the reflectance of original bands and selected band combinations of UAV multispectral images. We evaluated the performances of models in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD). The results showed that the R-2 of the six IOA-ML models for training, validation, and test sets were 0.8856-0.984, 0.8054-0.8929, and 0.7462-0.9045, respectively, indicating the methods had high precision and transferability. The extreme gradient boosting optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-XGB) performed best, with the highest precision for the validation and test sets. The spatial distribution of TP concentration of each flight derived from different models had similar distribution characteristics. This paper provides a reference for promoting the intelligent and automatic level of water environment monitoring in small inland waterbodies.},

Abstract = {We present a new operational algorithm for the retrieval of water quality from optical remote sensing data for both clear and turbid waters. It contains an array of neural networks providing input for the Levenberg-Marquardt multivariate optimization procedure as the final retrieval tool. With a given accuracy threshold, the developed algorithm is sufficiently robust to data with noise up to 15\% for certain hydro-optical conditions. To avoid inadequate retrieval results, the algorithm identifies and eventually discards the pixels with inadequate atmospheric correction and/or water optical properties incompatible with the applied hydro-optical model. This procedure also identifies coccolith expressions. Examples of practical applications of the developed algorithm are given.},

Abstract = {Darlik Dam supplies 15\% of the water demand of Istanbul Metropolitan City of Turkey. Water quality (WQ) in the Darlik Dam was investigated from Landsat 5 TM satellite images of the years 2004, 2005, and 2006 in order to determine land use/land cover changes in the watershed of the dam that may deteriorate its WQ. The images were geometrically and atmospherically corrected for WQ analysis. Next, an investigation was made by multiple regression analysis between the unitless planetary reflectance values of the first four bands of the June 2005 Landsat TM image of the dam and WQ parameters, such as chlorophyll-a, total dissolved matter, turbidity, total phosphorous, and total nitrogen, measured at satellite image acquisition time at seven stations in the dam. Finally, WQ in the dam was studied from satellite images of the years 2004, 2005, and 2006 by pattern recognition techniques in order to determine possible water pollution in the dam. This study was compared to a previous study done by the authors in the Kucukcekmece water reservoir, also in Istanbul City.},

Abstract = {Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS has become the ``space arm{''} for the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) vision. It is directly supporting the space-based, near-term tasks articulated in the GEO three-year work plan. This paper describes a coordinated program of demonstration projects conducted by CEOS member agencies and partners to utilize Earth observations to enhance energy management end-user decision support systems. We discuss the importance of engagement with stakeholders and understanding their decision support needs in successfully increasing the uptake of Earth observation products for societal benefit. Several case studies are presented, demonstrating the importance of providing data sets in formats and units familiar and immediately usable by decision makers. These projects show the utility of Earth observations to enhance renewable energy resource assessment in the developing world, forecast space weather impacts on the power grid, and improve energy efficiency in the built environment.

Abstract = {Stormwater management ponds are common best management practice (BMP) and green infrastructure (GI) for flood attenuation and water quality treatment in highway projects. Originally designed to provide storage volume for flood detention, stormwater ponds today often employ additional retention volume at pond bottom in a hope to improve water quality via sedimentation and other pollutant-removal mechanisms. It is commonly assumed that sediment accumulation and topographic variations (such as erosion, channelization, and in-pond plant growth and decay) over time often decrease the capacity of stormwater ponds. However, differences between design capacities and field capacities over time have never been verified and quantitatively analyzed before. This study presents such analysis using conventional topographic survey techniques and remote sensing data (topographic light detection and ranging digital elevation model {[}LIDAR DEM]) for 10 highway stormwater ponds along Interstate Highway-95 (I-95) systems in Baltimore City, Cecil County, and Harford County, Maryland, United States, with facility service life ranging from 14 to 26 years (1990-2015). Data derived from LIDAR DEM were compared with those from topographic survey; the LIDAR DEM data appear to be effective in measuring flood detention capacities and identifying silted ponds, but not in estimating the remaining retention volume for water quality treatment. Data from topographic survey indicate that the total volume in the ponds was relatively unchanged compared with the design, with increases in some instances. The increase typically occurred at the pond's upper stages. Nonetheless, the water quality treatment capacity at pond bottom (wet pool volume) was drastically less (up to 100\% of the design). As current maintenance practice of stormwater ponds relies heavily on visual inspection, the storage volume variations are often overlooked. As such, the findings prompt uncertainty on the long-term effectiveness of watershed implementation plan and models in the Chesapeake Bay watersheds, as many of them depend on wet pool volume design in BMP and GI.},

Abstract = {With the increasing importance and awareness of water quality in the small basins, the modelling system is developed for monitoring and predictions of surface water pollution. The compartment model deals with basin characteristics extended by land cover attributes. The parameters of the model are estimated by experimental data of water quality together with land cover types that serve as nutrient detention media or transformers. The study examines methodology to determine the potential areas of nitrate pollution from point and non-point sources by remote sensing techniques. Classification of water, agricultural, forest and urban areas is processed with satellite images (LANDSAT 7). Whereas the agricultural and urban areas act as sources of pollution, forest zones operate as sinks. The nitrate levels are decreased downstream, if the proportion of the forest inside contribution zones increases. The modelling system is used to simulate amounts of nitrates in each compartment of the stream during the monitored period of one year. The number of compartments and their lengths are estimated on the basis of morphology of the basin. Simulation of the dynamic model is carried out with the TabSim. Geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing tools are used to manage and estimate nitrate inflows from point and non-point sources of pollution. The article presents the spatial and time variation of the nitrate (NO3-) within the basin of the stream Rakovnicky (the west part of Bohemia, the whole area of 368 km(2)). It is shown that the model approach extended by the GIS and remote sensing can support decision-making process for better management practices in the basins. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Lake Erie has experienced dramatic changes in water quality over the past several decades requiring extensive monitoring to assess effectiveness of adaptive management strategies. Remote sensing offers a unique potential to provide synoptic monitoring at daily time scales complementing in-situ sampling activities occurring in Lake Erie. Bio-optical remote sensing algorithms require knowledge about the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the water for parameterization to produce robust water quality products. This study reports new IOP and apparent optical property (AOP) datasets for western Lake Erie that encapsulate the May-October period for 2015 and 2016 at weekly sampling intervals. Previously reported IOP and AOP observations have been temporally limited and have not assessed statistical differences between IOPs over spatial and temporal gradients. The objective of this study is to assess trends in IOPs over variable spatial and temporal scales. Large spatio-temporal variability in LOPS was observed between 2015 and 2016 likely due to the difference in the extent and duration of mid-summer cyanobacteria blooms. Differences in the seasonal trends of the specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient between 2015 and 2016 suggest differing algal assemblages between the years. Other IOP variables, including chromophoric, dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and beam attenuation spectral slopes, suggest variability is influenced by river discharge and sediment re-suspension. The datasets presented in this study show how these IOPs and AOPs change over a season and between years, and are useful in advancing the applicability and robustness of remote sensing methods to retrieve water quality information in western Lake Erie.

Title = {Evaluating Atmospheric Correction Algorithms Applied to OLCI Sentinel-3 Data of Chesapeake Bay Waters},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Satellite remote sensing permits large-scale monitoring of coastal waters through synoptic measurements of water-leaving radiance that can be scaled to relevant water quality metrics and in turn help inform local and regional responses to a variety of stressors. As both the incident and water-leaving radiance are affected by interactions with the intervening atmosphere, the efficacy of atmospheric correction algorithms is essential to derive accurate water-leaving radiometry. Modern ocean color satellite sensors such as the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3A and -3B satellites are providing unprecedented operational data at the higher spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution that is necessary to resolve optically complex coastal water quality. Validating these satellite-based radiance measurements with vicarious in situ radiometry, especially in optically complex coastal waters, is a critical step in not only evaluating atmospheric correction algorithm performance but ultimately providing accurate water quality metrics for stakeholders. In this study, a regional in situ dataset from the Chesapeake Bay was used to evaluate the performance of four atmospheric correction algorithms applied to OLCI Level-1 data. Images of the Chesapeake Bay are processed through a neural-net based algorithm (C2RCC), a spectral optimization-based algorithm (POLYMER), an iterative two-band bio-optical-based algorithm (L2gen), and compared to the standard Level-2 OLCI data (BAC). Performance was evaluated through a matchup analysis to in situ remote sensing reflectance data. Statistical metrics demonstrated that C2RCC had the best performance, particularly in the longer wavelengths (>560 nm) and POLYMER contained the most clear day coverage (fewest flagged data). This study provides a framework with associated uncertainties and recommendations to utilize OLCI ocean color data to monitor the water quality and biogeochemical dynamics in Chesapeake Bay.},

Title = {An Enhanced Water Quality Index for Water Quality Monitoring Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Water quality deterioration is a serious problem with the increase in the urbanization rate. However, water quality monitoring uses grab sampling of physico-chemical parameters and a water quality index method to assess water quality. Both processes are lengthy and expensive. These traditional indices are biased towards the physico-chemical parameters because samples are only collected from certain sampling points. These limitations make the current water quality index method unsuitable for any water body in the world. Thus, we develop an enhanced water quality index method based on a semi-supervised machine learning technique to determine water quality. This method follows five steps: (i) parameter selection, (ii) sub-index calculation, (iii) weight assignment, (iv) aggregation of sub-indices and (v) classification. Physico-chemical, air, meteorological and hydrological, topographical parameters are acquired for the stream network of the Rawal watershed. Min-max normalization is used to obtain sub-indices, and weights are assigned with tree-based techniques, i.e., LightGBM, Random Forest, CatBoost, AdaBoost and XGBoost. As a result, the proposed technique removes the uncertainties in the traditional indexing with a 100\% classification rate, removing the necessity of including all parameters for classification. Electric conductivity, secchi disk depth, dissolved oxygen, lithology and geology are amongst the high weighting parameters of using LightGBM and CatBoost with 99.1\% and 99.3\% accuracy, respectively. In fact, seasonal variations are observed for the classified stream network with a shift from 55:45\% (January) to 10:90\% (December) ratio for the medium to bad class. This verifies the validity of the proposed method that will contribute to water management planning globally.},

Abstract = {Frequent adjustment of operating strategies in a wastewater treatment plant as a situational response to water quality in the water body for effluent disposal has been facing a grand opportunity. This opportunity is emanated from transitioning the sporadic water quality monitoring in the water body for effluent disposal to the satellite-based situation-awareness, self-adaptive and fast response system. To achieve this goal, the cyber-physical system (CPS) is developed in this study to respond to the needs of smart wastewater infrastructure management. This prototype CPS is able to gather the massive volumes of water quality information via advanced remote sensing technologies to timely detect water pollution, exchange information through cyber interfaces, provide early-warning awareness with the aid of different feature extraction models, and support actionable intelligence for tuning the effluent disposal and recycling strategies for wastewater treatment. Integrated feature extraction techniques using extreme learning machine algorithms within the CPS architecture is emphasized in this study for smart wastewater infrastructure management through the interactions between the treatment facilities and satellites.},

Abstract = {Two spectral bands of the visible spectrum {[}0.45-0.52 mu m (Blue), 0.52-0.60 mu m (Green)] of satellite images obtained by LANDSAT 7 ETM + have been used in this study to follow the contaminated waters of Medrano Creek when it flows into Rio de la Plata River. The former is one of the five fresh watercourses going through the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where 13 million people live. Previous studies have shown that the water quality of Rio de la Plata at the outlet of Medrano Creek has decreased more than 50\% as a source of water for human consumption. The non-treated effluents of the textile industry probably affect the water quality. We have developed a model that predicts the water quality index (WQI) of surface waters in the study area and uses linear regression analysis. The model has been validated using a data set of 12 physicochemical parameters obtained during the last 3 years. The potentiality of using satellite images was confirmed by the results: (a) to trace the organic contamination (associated with dyes) in freshwater systems and (b) as tools for decision making in the management of water resources.

Abstract = {The management of water systems must be sustainable, something that requires systematic and comprehensive monitoring. However, the attempts to obtain a comprehensive water quality monitoring (WQM) program in developing countries are challenged due to the lack of an integrated framework and limited resources. At present, the Philippines has no systematized technical and operational monitoring approach, poor coordination and data collection system, and weak law enforcement. On the other hand, Geoinformatics promises a more convenient and cost-effective WQM to complement the traditional method. The goal of this study is to demonstrate how to maximize the use of Geonformatics in developing methods and models to address the lack of spatial trends, timely monitoring, and integrated monitoring framework that could lead to a sustainable WQM system. This study employs remote sensing and GIS technique combined with ground-based water quality data as Geoinformatics-based framework to derive water monitoring and assessment information. Results of this study showed that satellite images can be utilized to derive empirical models to estimate WQ parameters. The validation results showed that the estimated WQ values using the RS-based models have no significant difference when compared with the actual WQ values. Also, the WQ maps derived using Geographic Information System (GIS) were proven useful in providing better representation and analysis of spatial and temporal information that can provide a comprehensive and cost-effective reference for WQ monitoring and assessment.},

Abstract = {Optical water quality (OWQ) relates the composition of waters to their light transmission and thereby light availability for aquatic plants, visual range for aquatic animals, and suitability for recreational uses. This fundamental role of OWQ has led to numerous studies on the optical properties in rivers and lakes, which we overview here with a landscape perspective. International examples illustrate how the kinds and amounts of light-attenuating substances depend on landscape features on scales ranging from the river reach to the orientation of mountain ranges. OWQ is profoundly affected by increased nutrient discharges and sediment mobilization from human activities such as agriculture. Proper monitoring of OWQ is needed to fully understand and address these consequences. Remote sensing has potential for broad-scale surveys of OWQ, although currently its applications to inland waters are limited by low spatial resolution. A better understanding of OWQ will advance water management and remote sensing capabilities, as well as provide further insight into water quality impacts associated with global changes in climate, energy use, and land use.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak affected the world badly in this 21st century leading to the closure of all types of anthropogenic activities. It is declared that there was an environmental betterment in names of water quality and air quality during the COVID-19 period. In this study, we analyzed the improvement in water quality by evaluating the suspended particulate matter (SPM) using the remote sensing technique in a tropical South Sumatra wetland i.e., Musi River in Southern Sumatra, Indonesia. The SPM values were estimated from Landsat 8 images Level-2 product. A quantitative and spatial analyses of before (20th May 2019), during (22nd May 2020), and after COVID-19 (28th May 2022) periods were also calculated. Results revealed that the mean SPM values during COVID-19 period (4.56 mg/L) were lower than that before COVID-19 period (8.33 mg/L). Surprisingly, SPM showed an increase of 54\% in SPM values after COVID-19 period, compared with during COVID-19 period. The role of human activities including industrial and domestic wastes during the restriction period was the main reason for alteration of pollution loads in the river. Outputs of this study can be used to arrange policies for the sustainable management of aquatic environments and water resources.},

Abstract = {Study was conducted in Ranchi Urban Agglomeration (RUA) to assess the surface water quality of major rivers and reservoirs during pre- and post-monsoon periods. Study indicated increase in chemical contaminants and decrease in biological contaminants during monsoon periods and a positive correlation with built-up land within the catchment of surface water sources. The remote sensing-based approach indicated Swarnrekha river and tributaries as more encroached by built-up land (0.73 km(2) within 50 m buffer) than Jumar river and its tributaries (0.21 km(2)). For the proper management of the surface water sources in RUA, government attention and interventions are required to minimize the contamination and safeguard the health of local residents.},

Title = {Remote sensing modeling of environmental influences on lake fish resources by machine learning: A practice in the largest freshwater lake of China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Climate change and human interference pose a significant threat to fishery habitats and fish biodiversity, leading to changes in fishery resources. However, the impact of environmental change on lake fishery resources has been largely blurred in assessments due to the complicated variables of the lake environment. Here, taking the largest freshwater lake (Poyang Lake) in China as a study case, we first proposed a conceptual model and simulated the effect of environmental variables on fish catches based on remote sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms. We found that the hydrometeorological conditions of fishery habitats are critical controlling factors affecting the fish catches in Poyang Lake through a long time series of simulations. Among the involved hydrometeorological variables, the temperature, precipitation, and water level are strongly correlated with the fish catches in the simulation experiments. Furthermore, we tested other experiments and found that the integration with water quality variables (correlation coefficient (R) increased by 11\%, and root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 2,600 tons) and water ecological variables (R increased by 17\%, and RMSE decreased by 3,200 tons) can further improve the accuracy of fish catch simulation. The results also showed that fish catches of aquatic species in Poyang Lake are more susceptible to water ecological variables than water quality refers to the model performance improvements by different input variable selections. In addition, a multi-dimension variable combination involving hydrometeorological conditions, water quality, and water ecological variables derived from remote sensing can maximally optimize the model performance of fish catch simulation (R increased by 21\%, and RMSE decreased by 4,300 tons). The approach developed in this study can save the labor and financial costs for large-area investigation and the assessment of lake fishery resources compared to conventional methods. It is expected to demonstrate an efficient way for public authorities, stakeholders, and decision-makers to guide fishery conservation and management strategies.},

Abstract = {For the first time in the 21(st) century, many nations have been forced to conduct a lockdown that restricts their industrial, transportation, and social activities to avoid the extensive COVID-19 spread. Therefore, our study aimed to analyze the status of water quality that was measured by suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Sungai Langat, Selangor, Malaysia using the remote sensing technique. The study was concerned with rivers located in distinct land-use areas such as high-density urban, low-density urban, and agricultural areas. The study period included before and after movement control order (MCO) periods that occurred in February 2020 and February 2021, respectively. The SPM levels in each period were calculated using the remote sensing technique through Landsat-8 OLI images then they were analyzed using statistical analysis. The results of the remote sensing technique showed the highest decrease of SPM levels during the MCO period was observed in Sungai Langat within a high-density urban area (34.1\%). Then, the SPM levels in all Sungai Langat raised significantly after the MCO period with the highest change at 31.6\%. Rainfall and erosion factors had a significant impact on the SPM level through natural processes but the COVID-19 restriction had a direct impact on the SPM level due to the restriction of industrial and social activities. The suspended activities have made the lower emission compared with before the COVID-19 period in 2019.},

Title = {Retrieval of Water Quality Parameters from Hyperspectral Images Using Hybrid Bayesian Probabilistic Neural Network},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The protection of water resources is of paramount importance to human beings' practical lives. Monitoring and improving water quality nowadays has become an important topic. In this study, a novel Bayesian probabilistic neural network (BPNN) improved from ordinary Bayesian probability methods has been developed to quantitatively predict water quality parameters including phosphorus, nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chlorophyll a. The proposed method, based on conventional Bayesian probability methods, involves feature engineering and deep neural networks. Additionally, it extracts significant information for each endmember from combinations of spectra by feature extraction, with spectral unmixing based on mathematical and statistical analysis, and calculates each of the water quality parameters. The experimental results show the great performance of the proposed model with all coefficient of determination R-2 over 0.9 greater than the values (0.6-0.8) from conventional methods, which are greater than ordinary Bayesian probability analysis. The mean percent of absolute error (MPAE) is taken into account as an important statistical criterion to evaluate model performance, and our results show that MPAE ranges from 4\% (nitrogen) to 10\% (COD). The root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of phosphorus, nitrogen, COD, BOD, and chlorophyll-a (Chla) are 0.03 mg/L, 0.28 mg/L, 3.28 mg/L, 0.49 mg/L, and 0.75 mu g/L, respectively. In comparison with other deep learning methods, this study takes a relatively small amount of data as training data to train the proposed model and the proposed model is then tested on the same amount of testing data, achieving a greater performance. Thus, the proposed method is time-saving and more effective. This study proposes a more compatible and effective method to assist with decomposing combinations of hyperspectral signatures in order to calculate the content level of each water quality parameter. Moreover, the proposed method is practically applied to hyperspectral image data on board an unmanned aerial vehicle in order to monitor the water quality on a large scale and trace the location of pollution sources in the Maozhou River, Guangdong Province of China, obtaining well-explained and significant results.},

Abstract = {Phytoplankton is considered a strong predictor of the environmental quality of lakes, while Chlorophyll-a is an indicator of primary productivity. In this study, 25 LANDSAT images covering the 2014-2021 period were used to predict Chlorophyll-a in the Villarrica lacustrine system. A Chlorophyll-a recovery algorithm was calculated using two spectral indices (FAI and SABI). The indices that presented the best statistical indicators were the floating algal index (R-2 = 0.87) and surface algal bloom index (R-2 = 0.59). A multiparametric linear model for Chlorophyll-a estimation was constructed with the indices. Statistical indicators were used to validate the multiple linear regression model used to predict Chlorophyll-a by means of spectral indices, with the following results: a MBE of 0.136 mu g/L, RMSE of 0.055 mu g/L, and NRMSE of 0.019\%. All results revealed the strength of the model. It is necessary to raise awareness among the population that carries out activities around the lake in order for them to take policy actions related to water resources in this Chilean lake. Furthermore, it is important to note that this study is the first to address the detection of algal blooms in this Chilean lake through remote sensing.},

Abstract = {A large number of freshwater lakes around the world show recurring harmful algal blooms, particularly cyanobacterial blooms, that affect public health and ecosystem integrity. Prediction, early detection, and monitoring of algal blooms are inevitable for the mitigation and management of their negative impacts on the environment and human beings. Remote sensing provides an effective tool for detecting and spatiotemporal monitoring of these events. Various remote sensing platforms, such as ground-based, spaceborne, airborne, and UAV-based, have been used for mounting sensors for data acquisition and real-time monitoring of algal blooms in a cost-effective manner. This paper presents an updated review of various remote sensing platforms, data types, and algorithms for detecting and monitoring algal blooms in freshwater lakes. Recent studies on remote sensing using sophisticated sensors mounted on UAV platforms have revolutionized the detection and monitoring of water quality. Image processing algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been improved recently and predicting algal blooms based on such methods will have a key role in mitigating the negative impacts of eutrophication in the future.},

Abstract = {With the aquatic environments being excessively stressed by human activities, the need for monitoring critical quality parameters continuously and at large spatial scales is greater than ever. T. this end, the goal of this study was to exploit remote sensing data for water quality estimation towards the development of a long-term monitoring protocol for aquatic systems. High resolution, multitemporal data were employed along with in-situ measurements for key water quality parameters. After establishing relations between the satellite and in-situ data, multitemporal geospatial maps of Lake Karla were produced and validated, indicating that the observed chlorophyll-a is fluctuating throughout the year. In particular, a high correlation rate (r(2) > 89\%) for Chl-a was derived through a linear regression model while certain mismatches occurred due to frequent cyanobacterial blooms that were mainly observed in the quite shallow parts of the lake. Moreover, the spatiotemporal analysis revealed a gradual slight decline in average chlorophyll-a concentrations from the beginning of 2011 and onward. The lake regions which were affected the most were the shallow ones, so it is necessary to better distribute the sampling locations within the lake in order to better quantify the fluctuations of water quality parameters. By exploiting high resolution satellite imagery, the proposed methodology implements a low-cost water monitoring system which enables the frequent update of important water quality parameters of any relevant geo-database, towards the efficient development of water management plan for protection and restoration of sensitive aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {Hybrid Predictive Model for Water Quality Monitoring Based on Sentinel-2A L1C Data},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {65730-65749},
Abstract = {Monitoring water quality is an important challenge in both developed and developing countries. Remote sensing data can form a highly frequent dataset with acceptable spatial coverage that can be used to remotely monitor water quality. This paper presents a novel automated model for remotely monitoring water quality to address the problem of insufficient samples and save the time and cost of sample collection. The proposed model estimates both optical and non-optical water quality parameters via Sentinel-2A data. A bio-inspired hybrid model of a Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (BWOA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (BWOA-ANN) is applied to determine the relationship between extracted refiectance values from Sentinel-2A images and analyzed samples. The novelty of this model is to solve two main problems of remote water quality monitoring: poor applicability and low non-optical parameter estimation accuracy. For the first problem, a proposed fully automated model with band selection using the BWOA to automatically select the optimal features (Sentinel-2A bands) that are suitable for each water quality parameter. The second problem is addressed by automatically detecting the relationship between non-optical parameters, such as the total phosphorus, and optical parameters, such as chlorophyll-a. Three datasets with different locations, seasons, and parameters were selected to test the proposed BWOA-ANN. The experimental results demonstrated good regression with a mean R2 value of 0.916 for optical parameters and 0.890 for non-optical parameters. The proposed model was found to outperform the ANN with an R2 value higher by 40\% and 52\% for the optical and non-optical parameters, respectively.},

Abstract = {Hydraulic connectivity has great effects on water quality. Enclosure aquaculture can largely alter lake flow regime and thus deteriorate water quality. Understanding the dynamics and influencing factors of water quality in enclosure aquaculture lakes is of great significance to ecosystem restoration of degraded lakes. However, it remains challenging due to the lack of long time series data. In this study, the dynamics of water quality in aquaculture dominated lakes were captured through Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating based on sediment records. Meanwhile, the effects of landscape pattern within aquaculture lakes on water quality were revealed by long time series of remote sensing images. Results showed the Pb-210 and Cs-137 sediment dating could provide an effective way to obtain long-term series of lake water quality data in the unmonitored area. The contents of lake sediment nutrients showed an upward trend from 1960 to 2018. The transformation of lakes from agriculture dominated to aquaculture dominated had increased sediment nutrients level. The long-term changes of lake sediment nutrients could be well explained by the landscape pattern metrics within aquaculture lakes, with an average explain power of 87.6\%. The configuration metrics at class level had the most contribution (73.6\%) to the changes of lake sediment nutrients, followed by the composition metrics (48.8\%) and the configuration metrics at landscape level (33.4\%). This study can provide a promising method to understand water quality changes in lakes with no historical monitoring data available and is of great benefit to water quality management in aquaculture dominated lakes.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion associated with non-point source pollution is viewed as a process of land degradation in many terrestrial environments. Careful monitoring and assessment of land use variations with different temporal and spatial scales would reveal a fluctuating interface, punctuated by changes in rainfall and runoff, movement of people, perturbation from environmental disasters, and shifts in agricultural activities and cropping patterns. The use of multi-temporal remote sensing images in support of environmental modeling analysis in a geographic information system (GIS) environment leading to identification of a variety of long-term interactions between land, resources, and the built environment has been a highly promising approach in recent years. This paper started with a series of supervised land use classifications, using SPOT satellite imagery as a means, in the Kao-Ping River Basin, South Taiwan. Then, it was designed to differentiate the variations of eight land use patterns in the past decade, including orchard, farmland, sugarcane field, forest, grassland, barren, community, and water body. Final accuracy was confirmed based on interpretation of available aerial photographs and global positioning system (GPS) measurements. Finally, a numerical simulation model (General Watershed Loading Function, GWLF) was used to relate soil erosion to nonpoint source pollution impacts in the coupled land and river water systems. Research findings indicate that while the decadal increase in orchards poses a significant threat to water quality, the continual decrease in forested land exhibits a potential impact on water quality management. Non-point source pollution, contributing to part of the downstream water quality deterioration of the Kao-Ping River system in the last decade, has resulted in an irreversible impact on land integrity from a long-term perspective.

Abstract = {Decline of seagrasses has been documented in many parts of the world. Reduction in water clarity, through increased turbidity and increased nutrient concentrations, is considered to be the primary cause of seagrass loss. Recent studies have indicated the need for new methods that will enable early detection of decline in seagrass extent and productivity, over large areas. In this review of current literature on coastal remote sensing, we examine the ability of remote sensing to serve as an information provider for seagrass monitoring. Remote sensing offers the potential to map the extent of seagrass cover and monitor changes in these with high accuracy for shallow waters. The accuracy of mapping seagrasses in deeper waters is unclear. Recent advances in sensor technology and radiometric transfer modelling have resulted in the ability to map suspended sediment, sea surface temperature and below-surface irradiance. It is therefore potentially possible to monitor the factors that cause the decline in seagrass status. When the latest products in remote sensing are linked to seagrass production models, it may serve as an early-warning system for seagrass decline and ultimately allow a better management of these susceptible ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing monitoring of aquatic vegetation is critical to the water quality evaluation of plateau lakes. To obtain a clear understanding of the water environment status of Dianchi Lake, a GF-5 hyperspectral characteristics-based optimal NDVI approach was employed to quantify the aquatic vegetation cover and analyze water quality. By characteristic bands recognition, the optimal NDVI was obtained; the spatial distribution of aquatic plants and water quality in Dianchi Lake were then analyzed. Results showed the following: (1) For Caohai, the optimal NDVI value was calculated by B86 in the red band range and B151 in the near-infrared band range, which achieve the best spectral response. For Waihai, the respective bands were B86 in the red band range and B99 in the near-infrared band range. (2) We also found significant regional differences in aquatic plants distribution for the study area. Caohai was dominated by aquatic plants and high-quality water areas only occurred in the northern tip. While the situation for Waihai was much optimistic, areas with poor water quality were mainly found in the north and south parts. Water quality also showed a descending trend from the lakeside zone to the lake center. (3) By comparing to previous studies, we concluded that policy interventions and water protection measures carried out by the government during the past years are extremely effective. The optimal NDVI method provides a reliable evaluation and is potentially transferable to other plateau lake areas as a robust approach for the rapid assessment of water quality.},

Abstract = {Changes in land use land cover (LULC) and landscape pattern in arid areas can considerably impact water quality in small watersheds. Exploring the associations between land use, landscape pattern, and riverine water quality can inform land-use planning for water-quality security. In northwest China's Jing River Watershed (JRW), water samples were collected at 67 points in 2016-2017 and analyzed. Coupled with Sentinel-2 remote-sensing images, this study calculated the Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) to assign the water-quality category. The Random Forest classification characterized current LULC patterns and computed landscape metrics in a riparian buffer zone. The stepwise multiple linear regression and redundancy analysis methods investigated the relationships amongst LULC, eight landscape metrics, and eight water-quality parameters. The results indicated high concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in the JRW's middle and lower reaches. For CWQI, lacking evident temporal fluctuations was contrasted by noticeable spatial variations. Intense Human activities have aggravated the deterioration of the water quality of the JRW. LULC-type changes, including Waterbody, Forest-grassland, and Farmland, imposed notable impacts on seasonal water quality. For landscape metrics, patch cohesion index (COHESION) strongly correlated with chemical oxygen demand (COD), mineralization degree (MD), and TN. By contrast, patch density (PD) correlated negatively with TN. Interspersion juxtaposition index (IJI) strongly correlated with biochemical oxygen demand after five days (BOD5). COHESION, PD, and IJI can be critical factors in predicting water-quality changes at the small-watershed scale. Our findings offered a robust scientific basis to refine regional sustainable water development strategy and rational water-resource management.},

Abstract = {The use of satellite remote sensing for water quality monitoring in inland waters has substantial advantages over the in-situ sampling method since it provides the ability for overall area coverage and also for study and supervision of isolated locations. The development of algorithms for water quality monitoring using satellite data and surface measurements can be widely found in literature. Such algorithms require validation and one of the major problems faced during these attempts was the need for continuous surface measurements requiring numerous in-situ samplings that imply also very high costs due to the need of increased human labour. The development of an automatic and autonomous sensor system able to be remotely controlled, will cover this gap and will allow the real time combined analysis of satellite and surface data for the continuous monitoring of water quality in dams as well as the overall water resources management. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can provide continuous measurements of parameters taken from the field by deploying a lot of wireless sensors to cover a specific geographical area. An innovative, energy-autonomous floating sensor platform (buoy) transferring data via wireless network to a remote central database has been developed for this study which can be applied on all dams in Cyprus. Indeed this project describes the results obtained by an existing running campaign in which in-situ spectroradiometric (GER1500 field spectroradiometer) measurements, water sampling measurements (turbidity), sensor measurements (turbidity) and Landsat TM/ETM+ data have been acquired at the Asprokremmos Dam in Paphos (Cyprus). By applying several regression analyses between reflectance against turbidity for all the spectral bands that correspond to Landsat TM/ETM+ 1-2-3-4, the highest correlation was found for TM band 3 (R-2=0.83).},

Abstract = {One of the most important qualitative aspects of wetland ecosystem management is preserving the natural quality of water in such environments. This would not be achievable unless continuous water quality monitoring is implemented. With the recent advances in remote sensing technology, this technology could assist us to produce accurate models for estimating water quality variables in the ecosystem of wetlands. The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of remote sensing data to estimate the water quality variables {[}pH, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, chloride and the concentration of chlorophyll a] in Zarivar International Wetland using linear regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. For this purpose, spectral reflectance of bands 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the OLI sensor of Landsat 8 was utilized as the input data and the collected chemical and physical data of water samples were selected as the objective data for both ANN and LR models. Based on our results overall, ANN model was the proper model compared with LR model. The spectral reflectance in bands 5 and 4 of OLI sensor revealed the best results to estimate TDS, TSS, turbidity and chlorophyll in comparison with other used bands in ANN model, respectively. We conclude that OLI sensor data are an excellent means for studying physical properties of water quality and comparing its chemical properties.},

Abstract = {In 2000, Florida's fast-growing hard clam aquaculture industry became eligible for federal agricultural crop insurance through the US Department of Agriculture, but the responsibility for identifying the cause of mortality remained with the grower. Here we describe the continuous water quality monitoring system used to monitor hard clam aquaculture areas in Florida and show examples of the data collected with the system. Systems recording temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water depth, turbidity and chlorophyll at 30min intervals were installed at 10 aquaculture lease areas along Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Six of these systems sent data in real-time to a public website, and all 10 systems provided data for accessible archives. The systems documented environmental conditions that could negatively impact clam survival and productivity and identified biologically relevant water quality differences among clam aquaculture areas. Both the real-time and archived data were used widely by clam growers and nursery managers to make management decisions and in filing crop loss insurance claims. While the systems were labor and time intensive, we recommend adjustments that could reduce costs and staff time requirements.},

Abstract = {Rivers are one of the most critical and common supplies for drinking water, agricultural, and industrial uses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of land use changes on surface water quality of the Godarkhosh River as a semi-arid catchment in Iran, during dry and wet years using remote sensing, GIS and multivariate statistical techniques and compared the water quality parameters with Wilcox classification and Schuler diagram for classification of drinking water quality. Results showed that urban and barren land uses were the key factor affecting water quality variation. More minor water quality was accompanied with a more proportion of the urban and barren land uses during the wet and dry years in the catchment. No significant correlation was identified between the pH, SAR, Cl(-)and Ca(2+)values with the land use types in both wet and dry years, whereas the EC, TDS, and Mg(2+)concentrations were strongly associated with at least one land use type. A negative correlation of the most water quality parameters was obtained with grasslands and forestlands, especially in the wet year compared with other land uses. Generally, it can be concluded that the relevances between water quality parameters and land use types were stronger in the dry year than that in the wet year. Also, the correlation analysis indicated that all water quality parameters had negative relationships with the river flows. Furthermore, most of the water quality variables showed the increasing trend over time based on Mann-Kendall trend analysis. The results of this research showed that a combination of remote sensing methods, geographic information systems and multivariate statistical techniques can provide an overview of the relationship between land use and water quality and recommend that water quality can be betterment with suitable land use management.},

Abstract = {Urban black-odor water is a serious water environmental problem worldwide that seriously affects the living environment and the health of residents. The detection of black-odor water is a primary problem of centralized governance. Remote sensing is an effective means for water-quality monitoring. However, in most urban areas, with their complex underlying conditions, black-odor water always shows an uncertain distribution and small area. Furthermore, because of similar spectral characteristics, it is easily confused with dark objects such as asphalt roads, dark roofs, bridges, river levees, and building shadows. In this article, we propose a new black-odor water detection method, without shadow misjudgment, for complex urban conditions. A remote sensing image from the Chinese high-resolution satellite Gaofen-2 (GF-2) was used for detection. Using in situ water-quality measurement data for verification, the results showed that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 85.7\% while reducing the false alarm rate to 3.5\%. Compared to four other existing methods, the proposed method proved to be more practical because it can reduce the false extraction of nonblack-odor water to the greatest extent possible while ensuring accuracy The method proposed in this article has a good effect on the extraction of black-odor water in Nanjing City. Therefore, our method can be applied widely to screening and management of large-scale urban black-odor water and can provide reliable data for centralized treatment.},

Abstract = {This paper characterizes the body of knowledge on remote sensing from 1999 to 2021 by employing bibliometric techniques based on the Science Citation Index databases and the Social Science Citation Index of the Web of Science, abbreviated to ``SCI{''} and ``SSCI{''}, respectively. A total of 28,438 articles were analyzed from various aspects of the publication characteristics, such as countries, institutes, subjects, journals, and keywords. Dynamic changes in published remote sensing research were examined by segregating the 19-year period into 4 stages. Co-occurrences of keywords from three aspects were evaluated, including technology, methodology, and applications. Results show that ``hyperspectral remote sensing{''}, ``classification{''}, ``monitoring{''} and ``MODIS{''} in the category of technology have emerged more frequently in recent years, and there are strong co-occurrences of ``remote sensing{''} and ``GIS{''} in the remote sensing technology category. In addition, there was a marked shift from traditional analytical methods (i.e., geostatistics and neural networks) to a variety of emerging methods, such as support vector machines, random forests, and feature extraction. Moreover, research hotspots are identified for remote sensing applications, which have expanded significantly with improvements in technology and methodology. In particular, ``water quality{''}, ``climate change{''}, and ``urbanization{''} have become popular themes in recent years. Finally, future directions of remote sensing are identified, which would be beneficial for researchers and policy makers.},

Journal = {NORDIC HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-204},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to estimate the distributions of spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, attenuation depth and subsurface reflectance of Finnish lakes. In addition, the optimum empirical water quality interpretation algorithms employing reflectance ratios were investigated for the needs of remote sensing. Estimations of the optical properties were based on simple optical models and measured concentrations of optically active substances (the sum of chlorophyll a and phaeophytin a, total suspended solids and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) at 1670 monitoring stations representing 1113 lakes. The models were parameterized using optical data from 10 lakes. The mean diffuse attenuation coefficient in PAR was 3.5 m(-1) and the location of the maximum attenuation depth was in the range 564-714nm. The simulated reflectance spectra showed a shift of the maximum value to longer wavelengths as trophic status changed from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic. High CDOM concentrations decrease the estimation accuracy of chlorophyll a from reflectance spectra using empirical algorithms, particularly in oligotrophic lakes. The models described can be used in studying light availability for photosynthesis at different depths, in the simulation of water temperatures, in estimating how different management alternatives affect light attenuation and Secchi depth, and in various remote sensing applications.},

Abstract = {Task of soft computing for decision support in field of risk management is analyzed in this chapter. Multi-model approach is described. Interrelations between models, remote sensing data and forecasting are described. Method of water quality assessment using satellite observation is described. Method is based on analysis of spectral reflectance of aquifers. Correlations between reflectance and pollutions are quantified. Fuzzy logic based approach for decision support in field of water quality degradation risk is discussed. Decision on water quality is making based on fuzzy algorithm using limited set of uncertain parameters. It is shown that this algorithm allows estimate water quality degradation rate and pollution risks. Using proposed approach, maps of surface water pollution risk from point and diffuse sources are calculated. Conclusions concerned soft computing in risk management are proposed and discussed. It was demonstrated, that basing on spatially distributed measurement data, proposed approach allows to calculate risk parameters with resolution close to observations.},

Abstract = {Sustainable management of coastal and coral reef environments requires regular collection of accurate information on recognized ecosystem health indicators. Satellite image data and derived maps of water column and substrate biophysical properties provide an opportunity to develop baseline mapping and monitoring programs for coastal and coral reef ecosystem health indicators. A significant challenge for satellite image data in coastal and coral reef water bodies is the mixture of both clear and turbid waters. A new approach is presented in this paper to enable production of water quality and substrate cover type maps, linked to a field based coastal ecosystem health indicator monitoring program, for use in turbid to clear coastal and coral reef waters. An optimized optical domain method was applied to map selected water quality (Secchi depth, Kd PAR, tripton, CDOM) and substrate cover type (seagrass, algae, sand) parameters. The approach is demonstrated using commercially available Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data over a coastal embayment exhibiting the range of substrate cover types and water quality conditions commonly found in sub-tropical and tropical coastal environments. Spatially extensive and quantitative maps of selected water quality and substrate cover parameters were produced for the study site. These map products were refined by interactions with management agencies to suit the information requirements of their monitoring and management programs. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {An ensemble machine learning model for water quality estimation in coastal area based on remote sensing imagery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {323},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The accurate estimation of coastal water quality parameters (WQPs) is crucial for decision-makers to manage water resources. Although various machine learning (ML) models have been developed for coastal water quality estimation using remote sensing data, the performance of these models has significant uncertainties when applied to regional scales. To address this issue, an ensemble ML-based model was developed in this study. The ensemble ML model was applied to estimate chlorophyll-a (Chla), turbidity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) based on Sentinel-2 satellite images in Shenzhen Bay, China. The optimal input features for each WQP were selected from eight spectral bands and seven spectral indices. A local explanation strategy termed Shapley Additive Expla-nations (SHAP) was employed to quantify contributions of each feature to model outputs. In addition, the im-pacts of three climate factors on the variation of each WQP were analyzed. The results suggested that the ensemble ML models have satisfied performance for Chla (errors = 1.7\%), turbidity (errors = 1.5\%) and DO estimation (errors = 0.02\%). Band 3 (B3) has the highest positive contribution to Chla estimation, while Band Ration Index2 (BR2) has the highest negative contribution to turbidity estimation, and Band 7 (B7) has the highest positive contribution to DO estimation. The spatial patterns of the three WQPs revealed that the water quality deterioration in Shenzhen Bay was mainly influenced by input of terrestrial pollutants from the estuary. Correlation analysis demonstrated that air temperature (Temp) and average air pressure (AAP) exhibited the closest relationship with Chla. DO showed the strongest negative correlation with Temp, while turbidity was not sensitive to Temp, average wind speed (AWS), and AAP. Overall, the ensemble ML model proposed in this study provides an accurate and practical method for long-term Chla, turbidity, and DO estimation in coastal waters.},

Abstract = {Hansen CH, Burian SJ, Dennison PE, Williams GP. 2019. Evaluating historical trends and influences of meteoorological and seasonal climate conditions on lake chlorophyll a using remote sensing. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Evaluations of long-term water quality trends and patterns in lakes and reservoirs are often inhibited by irregular historical records. This study uses historical Landsat satellite imagery to construct a more complete historical record of algal biomass (measured via chlorophyll a {[}Chl-a]) and presents a framework for developing seasonal algal estimation models using open source tools for processing and model development. This approach is both physically based (using observed patterns of variability and algal succession in the lake) and data driven (relying on statistical methods for model development). We use a generalized linear regression modeling technique to develop lake-specific, seasonal models for each lake in the multilake Great Salt Lake system in Utah. The 32-yr constructed history of estimated Chl-a enables analysis of long-term trends within the lake system as well as evaluations of local climate influences on Chl-a concentrations. The estimated historical record exhibits a shift in seasonality (i.e., maximum Chl-a occurs earlier in the growing season), as well as increasing trends of extreme Chl-a concentrations. We also evaluated relationships between meteorological conditions and Chl-a using the enhanced historical record and found localized sensitivity to short-term weather events such as high wind, high temperatures, or precipitation events. Seasonal climate conditions including high winter precipitation, summer temperatures, and early spring snow water equivalent are consistent with higher Chl-a extremes in the historical record. Improved understanding of the trends and climate influences provides useful context and guidance for future monitoring efforts and management strategies.},

Title = {Satellite-based virtual buoy system to monitor coastal water quality},
Journal = {OPTICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {53},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There is a pressing need to assess coastal and estuarine water quality state and anomaly events to facilitate coastal management, but such a need is hindered by lack of resources to conduct frequent ship-based or buoy-based measurements. Here, we established a virtual buoy system (VBS) to facilitate satellite data visualization and interpretation of water quality assessment. The VBS is based on a virtual antenna system (VAS) that obtains low-level satellite data and generates higher-level data products using both National Aeronautics and Space Administration standard algorithms and regionally customized algorithms in near real time. The VB stations are predefined and carefully chosen to cover water quality gradients in estuaries and coastal waters, where multiyear time series at monthly and weekly intervals are extracted for the following parameters: sea surface temperature (degrees C), chlorophyll-a concentration (mg m(-3)), turbidity (NTU), diffuse light attenuation at 490 nm {[}K-d(490), m(-1)] or secchi disk depth (m), absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (m(-1)), and bottom available light (\%). The time-series data are updated routinely and provided in both ASCII and graphical formats via a user-friendly web interface where all information is available to the user through a simple click. The VAS and VBS also provide necessary infrastructure to implement peer-reviewed regional algorithms to generate and share improved water quality data products with the user community.

Title = {Quantifying Turbidity Variation for Lakes in Daqing of Northeast China Using Landsat Images From 1984 to 2018},

Abstract = {Water turbidity is an important proxy to measure water quality and environmental conditions. Based on extensive field data and Landsat data (2011-2018), this article developed a retrieval model suitable for turbidity. The determination coefficient (R-2) of the model was 0.946 and the root-mean-square error was 23.82 NTU. The model was implemented to obtain the turbidity information of hundreds of lakes in Northeast China (1984-2018). The results revealed the distinctive spatial pattern of water turbidity values of the lakes (i.e., high turbidity in the south; low turbidity in the northwest; and moderate turbidity in the east). In terms of temporal pattern, the water turbidity values of most lakes trended downward at an average rate of 1.39 NTU/a (P < 0.05) with obvious seasonal differences (i.e., decreased from May to the lowest in July, and then increased from September onward). Finally, we quantitatively examined how several typical factors affect turbidity variation at different scales. We found that water turbidity was highly correlated with NDVI (R = 0.56, P < 0.001), followed by water temperature and wind speed (0.02 < R < 0.5, P < 0.05). Water turbidity varies because of the interaction of multiple factors (e.g., area, temperature, water depth, precipitation, and land use) instead of one factor. This article highlights the potential of remote sensing in large-scale and long-term monitoring of lake water quality, and provides important information and support for water quality management in China.},

Abstract = {Water quality in the coastal area of Tripoli (Lebanon) was assessed using Landsat 7 ETM+ data. to provide a first baseline for coastal resources management. The data were geometrically rectified to a standard geographical grid and brightness values were converted to reflectance through radiometric correction. Sea-truth data, collected in the field within 6 hours before/after the time of the satellite overpass, were used to derive empirical algorithms for chlorophyll-a concentration, Secchi disk depth and turbidity. Then, maps of the distribution of the selected water quality parameters were generated for the entire area of interest, and compared with analogous results obtained from SeaWiFS data. The maps indicate that the Tripoli coastal area is exposed to moderate cutrophic conditions, along most of its shoreline (in particular along the northern stretch), in correspondence with fluvial and wastewater runoff sources. The Landsat 7 ETM+ data proved useful for the intended application, and will be used to start a national database on water quality in the Lebanese coastal environment.

Abstract = {River corridors play a crucial environmental, economic, and societal role yet also represent one of the world's most dangerous natural hazards, making monitoring imperative to improve our understanding and to protect people. Remote sensing offers a rapidly growing suite of methods by which river corridor monitoring can be performed efficiently, at a range of scales and in difficult environmental conditions. This paper aims to evaluate the current state and assess the potential future of river corridor monitoring, whilst highlighting areas that require further investigation. We initially review established methods that are used to undertake river corridor monitoring, framed by the context and scales upon which they are applied. Subsequently, we review cutting edge technologies that are being developed and focussed around unmanned aerial vehicle and multisensor system advances. We also ``horizon scan{''} for future methods that may become increasingly prominent in research and management, citing examples from within and outside of the fluvial domain. Through review of the literature, it has become apparent that the main gap in fluvial remote sensing lies in the trade-off between resolution and scales. However, prioritising process measurements and simultaneous multisensor data collection is likely to offer a bigger advance in understanding than purely from better surveying methods alone. Challenges regarding the legal deployment of more complex systems, as well as effectively disseminating data into the science community, are amongst those that we propose need addressing. However, the plethora of methods currently available means that researchers and monitoring agencies will be able to identify suitable techniques for their needs.},

Abstract = {Mapping chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is crucial for water quality management in turbid and productive case II water bodies, which are largely influenced by suspended sediment and phytoplankton. Recent developments in remote sensing technology offer new avenues for water quality assessment and chl-a detection for inland water bodies. In this study, the red to near-infrared (NIR-red) bands were tested for the Vaal Dam in South Africa to classify chl-a concentrations using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for 2014-2016 by means of stepwise logistic regression (SLR). The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were also used for validating chl-a concentration classes. The chl-a concentrations were classified into low and high concentrations. The SLR applied on 2014 images yielded an overall accuracy of 80\% and kappa coefficient (kappa) of 0.74 on April 2014 data, while an overall accuracy of 65\% and kappa=0.30 were obtained for the May 2015 Landsat data. There was a significant (p<0.05) negative correlation between chl-a classes and red band in all analyses, while the NIR band showed a positive correlation (0.0001; p<0.89) for April 2014 data set. The 2015 image classification yielded an overall accuracy of 83\% and kappa=0.43. The difference vegetation index showed a significant (p<0.003) positive correlation with chl-a concentrations for May 2015 and July 2016, with chl-a ranges of between 2.5 mu g/L and 1219 mu g/L. These correlations show that a class increase in chl-a (from low to high) is in response to an increase in greenness within the Vaal Dam. We have demonstrated the applicability of Landsat 8 OLI data for inland water quality assessment. Significance: The magnitude of the algae problem in the Vaal Dam is highlighted. Landsat 8 OLI satellite data have potential in mapping chl-a in inland water bodies. Both the red and the near infrared wavelengths were significant in mapping chl-a concentrations in the Vaal Dam. Satellite earth observation can be instrumental for water quality monitoring and decision-making.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {192},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Functional riparian areas protect water quality and conserve aquatic systems, plants, and wildlife. Laser-based remote sensing technology offers a high-resolution approach to both characterize and document changes in riparian buffer zones (RBZs). The objectives of this study were to demonstrate a rapid method and model to calculate riparian buffer widths on both sides of a stream using a LiDAR-derived slope variable, to classify riparian buffers and determine their quality, and to evaluate the appropriateness of using LiDAR in riparian buffer assessment. For this purpose, RBZs were delineated for Hunnicutt and King Creek, which are located in Oconee and Pickens counties, in South Carolina. Results show that LiDAR was effective in delineating required riparian buffer widths based on the topography slope of upstream areas, and in calculating the ratio of tree cover. This LiDAR-based assessment methodology could be applied to a wide-range of environments.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {The intensity of stormwater runoff is particularly acute across cities located in arid climates. During flash floods loose sediment and pollutants are typically transported across sun-hardened surfaces contributing to widespread degradation of water quality. Rapid, dense urbanization exacerbates the problem by creating continuous areas of impervious surfaces, perforated only by a few green patches. Our work demonstrates how the latest techniques in remote sensing can be used to routinely measure urban land cover types, impervious cover, and vegetated areas. In addition, multiple regression models can then infer relationships between urban land use and land cover types with stormwater quality data, initially sampled at discrete monitoring sites, and then extrapolated annually across an arid city; in our case, the city of Phoenix in Arizona, USA. Results reveal that from 30 storm event samples, solids and heavy metal pollutants were found to be highly related with general impervious surfaces; in particular, with industrial and commercial land use types. Repercussions stemming from this work include support for public policies that advocate environmental sustainability and the more recent focus on urban livability. Also, advocacy for new urban construction and re-development that both steer away from vast unbroken impervious surfaces, in place of more fragmented landscapes that harmonize built and green spaces.},

Abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (herein after UAVs) as a tool in forage crop management is discussed. Overfertilizing has negative effects on water quality and affects health of animals and human beings, who use it. The author conducted experiments aimed at reducing fertilizer consumption. The analysis of two different images taken before and after the harvest period clearly shows a highlighted portion of the test area that might be overfertilized. UAVs equipped with cameras using both the RGB portion of the visible light spectrum and the near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (780-2500 nm) take Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI: blue band is near infrared portion in this research) images. Comparing the images can detect possible overfertilized areas. This data can then be used to adjust future fertilizer application rates. Experiments conducted in 2017 and 2018 and upcoming experiments in 2019 are discussed. Adjusting the analysis for BNDVI intensity and comparing UAV sourced images with satellite remote sensing data began in 2018.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing for the monitoring of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is essential to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional water quality monitoring, strengthen red tide disaster monitoring and early warnings, and reduce marine environmental risks. In this study, a machine learning approach called the Gradient-Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) was employed to develop an algorithm for estimating the Chl-a concentrations of the coastal waters of the Beibu Gulf in Guangxi, using Landsat 8 OLI image data as the image source in combination with field measurements of Chl-a concentrations. The GBDT model with B4, B3 + B4, B3, B1 - B4, B2 + B4, B1 + B4, and B2 - B4 as input features exhibited higher accuracy (MAE = 0.998 mu g/L, MAPE = 19.413\%, and RMSE = 1.626 mu g/L) compared with different physics models, providing a new method for remote sensing inversion of water quality parameters. The GBDT model was used to study the spatial distribution and temporal variation of Chl-a concentrations in the coastal sea surface of the Beibu Gulf of Guangxi from 2013 to 2020. The results showed a spatial distribution with high concentrations in nearshore waters and low concentrations in offshore waters. The Chl-a concentration exhibited seasonal changes (concentration in summer > autumn > spring approximate to winter).},

Title = {Assessing temporal dynamics on pelagic Sargassum influx and its relationship with water quality parameters in the Mexican Caribbean},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since 2011, massive inflows of pelagic Sargassum have been recorded in the Caribbean region, which has affected coastal ecosystems, mainly water quality and the flora and fauna that inhabit these areas. The aim of this study is to evaluate the temporal dynamics of Sargassum arrival and its relationship on water quality in three sites of the Mexican Caribbean (Mahahual, Xahuayxol and Xcalak). We used remote sensing tools to estimate Sargassum coverage and turbidity to know if these parameters vary throughout the year and are related. We measured in situ water quality parameters to identify variations, depending on the Sargassum quantity and leachate concentration. Our results of 26 Landsat 8-OLI images show higher Sargassum coverage and turbidity during the winter months and a high relationship between Sargassum coverage and turbidity in areas near the coast. Additionally, turbidity calculated from multispectral bands complemented satellite detection of Sargassum, as high turbidity values were identified in near-shore areas where satellite images could not detect the alga. Finally, water quality parameters showed an increase in ammonium concentration and decreased pH and oxygen levels in the areas with higher Sargassum accumulation and leachate concentration. This study provides a better understanding about temporal dynamics of Sargassum influx in the southern Mexican Caribbean and its relationship with water turbidity in order to develop strategies, management plans and harvesting policies that could prevent huge masses of Sargassum reaching the coast.

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of water quality in any water body is vital for the sustainability of our water resources. Thus, investigating spatio-temporal changes of dominant water quality parameters (WQPs) in any study is indeed critical for proposing the appropriate treatment for the water bodies. Traditionally, concentrations of WQPs have been measured through intensive fieldwork. Additionally, many studies have attempted to retrieve concentrations of WQPs from satellite images using regression-based methods. However, the relationship between WQPs and satellite data is complex to be modeled accurately by using simple regression-based methods. Our study attempts to develop a machine learning model for mapping the concentrations of dominant optical and non-optical WQPs such as electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature (Temp), total dissolved solids (TDS), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and dissolved oxygen (DO). In this context, a remote sensing framework based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor with optimized hyper parameters (HPs) to quantify concentrations of different WQPs from the Landsat-8 satellite imagery is developed. We evaluated six years of satellite data stretching spatially from upstream to downstream Ankinghat to Chopan (20 stations under Central Water Commission (CWC), Middle Ganga Basin) for characterizing the trends of dominant physico-chemical WQPs across the four clusters identified in our previous study. Through the developed XGBoost and MLP regression models between measured WQPs and the reflectance of the pixels corresponding to the sampling stations, a significant coefficient of determination (R-2) in the range of 0.88-0.98 for XGBoost and 0.72-0.97 for MLP were generated, with bands B1-B4 and their ratios more consistent. Indeed, these findings indicate that from a small number of in-situ measurements, we can develop reliable models to estimate the spatio-temporal variations of physico-chemical and biological WQPs. Therefore, models generated from Landsat-8 could facilitate the environmental, economic, and social management of any waterbody.},

Title = {An ecological function and services approach to total maximum daily load (TMDL) prioritization},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2014},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Prioritizing total maximum daily load (TMDL) development starts by considering the scope and severity of water pollution and risks to public health and aquatic life. Methodology using quantitative assessments of in-stream water quality is appropriate and effective for point source (PS) dominated discharge, but less so in watersheds with mostly nonpoint source (NPS) related impairments. For NPSs, prioritization in TMDL development and implementation of associated best management practices should focus on restoration of ecosystem physical functions, including how restoration effectiveness depends on design, maintenance and placement within the watershed. To refine the approach to TMDL development, regulators and stakeholders must first ask if the watershed, or ecosystem, is at risk of losing riparian or other ecologically based physical attributes and processes. If so, the next step is an assessment of the spatial arrangement of functionality with a focus on the at-risk areas that could be lost, or could, with some help, regain functions. Evaluating stream and wetland riparian function has advantages over the traditional means of water quality and biological assessments for NPS TMDL development. Understanding how an ecosystem functions enables stakeholders and regulators to determine the severity of problem(s), identify source(s) of impairment, and predict and avoid a decline in water quality. The Upper Reese River, Nevada, provides an example of water quality impairment caused by NPS pollution. In this river basin, stream and wetland riparian proper functioning condition (PFC) protocol, water quality data, and remote sensing imagery were used to identify sediment sources, transport, distribution, and its impact on water quality and aquatic resources. This study found that assessments of ecological function could be used to generate leading (early) indicators of water quality degradation for targeting pollution control measures, while traditional in-stream water quality monitoring lagged in response to the deterioration in ecological functions.},

Title = {Satellite-based water quality monitoring for improved spatial and temporal retrieval of chlorophyll-a in coastal waters},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {158},

Abstract = {The coastal zones are the most inhabited areas of the world and are therefore strongly affected by humans, leading to undesirable environmental changes that may alter the ecosystems, such as eutrophication. In order to evaluate changes in the environment an effective water quality monitoring system for the coastal zones must be in place. The chlorophyll-a concentration is commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and as indicator for eutrophication and it can be retrieved from ocean colour remote sensing data. Several operational monitoring systems based on remote sensing are in place to monitor the open sea and, to some extent, the coastal zones. However, evaluations of coastal monitoring systems based on satellite data are scarce. This paper compares the chlorophyll-a concentrations retrieved from an operational satellite system based on MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer) data with ship-based monitoring for the productive seasons in 2008 and 2010, in a coastal area in the Baltic Sea. The comparisons showed that the satellite-based monitoring system is reliable and that the estimations of chlorophyll-a concentration are comparable to in situ measurements in terms of accuracy and quantitative retrieval. A very strong correlation was found between measurements from satellite-derived chlorophyll-a compared to in situ measurements taken close in time (0-3 days), with RMSE of 64\% and a MNB of 17\%. The comparison of the monthly means showed improved RMSE and a MNB of only 8\%. Furthermore, this study shows that MERIS is better at capturing spatial dynamics and the extent of phytoplankton blooms than ship-based monitoring, since it has a synoptic view and higher temporal resolution. Satellite-based monitoring also increases the frequency of chlorophyll-a observations considerably, where the degree of improvement is dependent on the sampling frequency of the respective monitoring programme. Our results show that ocean colour remote sensing can, when combined with field sampling, provide an improved basis for more effective monitoring and management of the coastal zone. These results are important for eutrophication assessment and status classifications of water basins and can be applied to a larger extent within national and international agreements considering the coastal zones, e.g. the European Commission's Water Framework Directive.

Abstract = {Directives and legislations worldwide aim at representatively and continuously monitoring the ecological status of surface waters. In many countries, chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL) are used as an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and the trophic level of lakes or reservoirs. In-situ measurements of water quality parameters, however, are time-consuming, costly and of unknown but naturally limited spatial representativeness. In addition, the variety of the involved lab and field measurement methods and instruments complicates comparability and reproducibility. Taking Lake Geneva as an example, 1234 satellite images from the MERIS sensor on the Envisat satellite from 2002 to 2012 are used to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of CHL concentrations. Based on histograms of spring, summer and autumn CHL estimates, the spatial representativeness of two existing in-situ measurement locations is analysed. Appropriate sampling frequencies to capture CHL peaks are examined by means of statistical resampling. The approaches proposed allow determining optimal in-situ sampling locations and frequencies. Their generic nature allows for adaptation to other lakes, especially to establish new survey programmes where no previous records are available. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {667-680},
Abstract = {Water quality problems continue on a global scale and this creates the need for regular monitoring using cheaper technologies to inform management. The objective of this study was to test for significant relationships between the field-measured and Landsat 8 OLI sensor-retrieved water quality parameters. The study was carried out in two reservoirs with contrasting trophic states in Zimbabwe. Results show that the Blue/Red ratio had strong predictive relationships with Secchi disc transparency (R-2>0.70) and turbidity (R(2)0.65). The Near-infrared/Red ratio was a strong predictor of chlorophyll-a in Mazvikadei (R-2>0.84) whereas in Lake Chivero, which is more polluted, the red band was the most useful predictor (R-2=0.69). Overall, our work demonstrates the utility of using Landsat 8 band ratios for remote assessment of water quality in African reservoirs as a value-addition to the traditional field-based methods, which are expensive resulting in data scarcity.},

Title = {Mapping Long-Term Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Pen Aquaculture in a Shallow Lake: Less Aquaculture Coming along Better Water Quality},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Pen aquaculture is the main form of aquaculture in some shallow lakes in eastern China. It is valuable to map the spatiotemporal changes of pen aquaculture in eutrophic lakes to assess its effect on water quality, thereby helping the relevant decision-making agencies to manage the water quality (WQ) of lakes. In this study, an automatic approach for extracting the pen aquaculture area was developed based on Landsat data. The approach integrates five algorithms, including grey transformation, discrete wavelet transform, fast Fourier transform, singular value decomposition and k-nearest neighbor classification. It was successfully applied in the automatic mapping of the pen aquaculture areas in Lake Yangcheng from 1990 to 2016. The overall accuracies were greater than 92\%. The result indicted that the practice of pen aquaculture experienced five stages, with the general area increasing in the beginning and decreasing by the end of the last stage. Meanwhile, the changes of nine WQ parameters observed from 2000 to 2016, such as ammonia (NH3-N), pH, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemiluminescence detection of permanganate index (CODMn), Secchi disk depth (SDD) and dissolved oxygen (DO), were analyzed in the lake sectors of Lake Yangcheng, and then their relationships were explored with the percentage of pen aquaculture area. The result suggested that the percentage of pen aquaculture area exhibits significantly positive correlations with NH3-N, TN, TP, chlorophyll a, BOD and CODMn, but significantly negative correlations with SDD and DO. The experimental results may offer an important implication for managing similar shallow lakes with pen aquaculture expansion and water pollution problems.},

Title = {Merging of the Case 2 Regional Coast Colour and Maximum-Peak Height chlorophyll-a algorithms: validation and demonstration of satellite-derived retrievals across US lakes},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {Water quality monitoring is relevant for protecting the designated, or beneficial uses, of water such as drinking, aquatic life, recreation, irrigation, and food supply that support the economy, human well-being, and aquatic ecosystem health. Managing finite water resources to support these designated uses requires information on water quality so that managers can make sustainable decisions. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a, mu g L-1) concentration can serve as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and may be used as an indicator of increased anthropogenic nutrient stress. Satellite remote sensing may present a complement to in situ measures for assessments of water quality through the retrieval of chl-a with in-water algorithms. Validation of chl-a algorithms across US lakes improves algorithm maturity relevant for monitoring applications. This study compares performance of the Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) chl-a retrieval algorithm, a revised version of the Maximum-Peak Height (MPH(P)) algorithm, and three scenarios merging these two approaches. Satellite data were retrieved from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), while field observations were obtained from 181 lakes matched with U.S. Water Quality Portal chl-a data. The best performance based on mean absolute multiplicative error (MAE(mult)) was demonstrated by the merged algorithm referred to as C-15-M-10 (MAE(mult) = 1.8, bias(mult) = 0.97, n = 836). In the C-15-M-10 algorithm, the MPH(P) chl-a value was retained if it was > 10 mu g L-1; if the MPH(P) value was <= 10 mu g L-1, the C2RCC value was selected, as long as that value was < 15 mu g L-1. Time-series and lake-wide gradients compared against independent assessments from Lake Champlain and long-term ecological research stations in Wisconsin were used as complementary examples supporting water quality reporting requirements. Trophic state assessments for Wisconsin lakes provided examples in support of inland water quality monitoring applications. This study presents and assesses merged adaptations of chl-a algorithms previously reported independently. Additionally, it contributes to the transition of chl-a algorithm maturity by quantifying error statistics for a number of locations and times.},

Abstract = {Aquatic color radiometry remote sensing of coastal and inland water bodies is of great interest to a wide variety of research, management, and commercial entities as well as the general public. However, most current satellite radiometers were primarily designed for observing the global ocean and not necessarily for observing coastal and inland waters. Therefore, deriving coastal and inland aquatic applications from existing sensors is challenging. We describe the current and desired state of the science and highlight unresolved issues in four fundamental elements of aquatic satellite remote sensing namely, mission capability, in situ observations, algorithm development, and operational capacity. We discuss solutions, future plans, and recommendations that directly affect the science and societal impact of future missions with capability for observing coastal and inland aquatic systems.

Abstract = {Applications of the remote sensing to the coastal environmental monitoring as a main tool of an Integrate coastal management includes certain types of imagery on the coastal ecosystem/habitats changes, as well synoptic data on sea water, temperature, salinity, and components for a better understanding of the chlorophyll/plankton and fish/invertebrate distributions, as well as marine modeling forecast data. A system of RS\&GIS techniques can be a dynamic tool for the coastal managers and decision makers. Such system is one of the main results of recent/ongoing national projects, and certain results of it will be presented in relation with several data and information evaluation activities {[}3]. Also, the work presents several approaches and results on coastal remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques implementation in a certain case studies, towards an erosion and coastal waters quality control. The coastal variability at the sea-land interface, for a period of several decades, has been revisited on the basis of the historical remote sensing images/maps, and obtained results were the base of an online Coastal Atlas for the Romanian Black Sea Coast.},

Title = {Assessing the effects of landscape pattern on river water quality at multiple scales: A case study of the Dongjiang River watershed, China},

Abstract = {Understanding how land use and land cover change influences the flow and water quality of rivers is critically important for river management and restoration. Human activities have transformed the landscapes in southern China where damaged river systems need to be restored and better managed for achieving environmental sustainability. Toward this end, we quantified the land use and land cover pattern of the Dongjiang River watershed, China between 1990 and 2006 based on remote sensing data and field measurements. We then analyzed how river flow and several water quality variables were related to landscape attributes at three scales: subwatershed, catchment, and buffer. Our results show that the water quality of the Dongjiang River differed among the upper, middle, and lower reaches and also changed significantly during the recent decades. These changes in space and time indicate a trend of accelerating deterioration in water quality. Also, land use and land cover pattern had major impacts on the flow and water quality of the Dongjiang River at multiple spatial scales. In particular, urban land use, although small in percent cover, exerted a disproportionately large influence both locally and over distance. We also found that most water quality variables (Cl-, EC, NH3-N, and NO3-N) were correlated with landscape pattern on all three spatial scales although the correlation was stronger at the subwatershed scale than at the catchment and buffer scales. This scale multiplicity suggests that, while water-monitoring and river restoration need to adopt a multi-scale perspective, particular attention should be paid to the subwatershed scale. In addition, the control of pollution sources associated with socioeconomic activities ought to be explicitly incorporated in landscape management practices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {An advanced operational semi-empirical algorithm for processing satellite remote sensing data in the visible region is described. Based on the Levenberg-Marquardt multivariate optimization procedure, the algorithm is developed for retrieving major water colour producing agents: chlorophyll-a, suspended minerals and dissolved organics. Two assurance units incorporated by the algorithm are intended to flag pixels with inaccurate atmospheric correction and specific hydro-optical properties not covered by the applied hydro-optical model. The hydro-optical model is a set of spectral cross-sections of absorption and backscattering of the colour producing agents. The combination of the optimization procedure and a replaceable hydro-optical model makes the developed algorithm not specific to a particular satellite sensor or a water body. The algorithm performance efficiency is amply illustrated for SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS images over a variety of water bodies.},

Abstract = {Secchi disk depth (SDD) is a simple but particularly important indicator for characterizing the overall water quality status and assessing the long-term dynamics of water quality for diverse global waters. For this reason, countless efforts have been made to collect SDD data from the field and through remote sensing systems. Many empirical and semianalytical algorithms have been proposed to estimate SDD from different satellite images for a specific or regional water. However, the construction of a robust global SDD estimation model is still challenging due to the nonlinear response of SDD to optical properties and the complex physical and biogeochemical processes of different waters. Therefore, machine learning methods to better interpret nonlinear processes were used to improve remote sensing estimations of SDD for global lakes and reservoirs based on a global matchup dataset from Landsat TM (N = 4099), ETM+ (N = 2420), and OLI (N = 1249) covering in situ SDD from 0.01 m to over 18 m. Overall, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) had better SDD retrievals than back propagation neural network, support vector regression, empirical and quasi-analytical models showing high precision with mean relative error of approximately 30\% and good agreements with the long-term in situ SDD in different waters with various optical properties. Our results can support long-term global-level water quality evaluation and thus making informed decisions about development policy.},

Abstract = {Cities across the world are struggling to address flooding and water quality pollution from stormwater runoff, in part because of a lack of technologies that can effectively support management actions. Drones, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, are a technology that have the potential to address this challenge through rapid, on-demand, high-resolution data. Drones have seen an emergence among water resources and environmental researchers and practitioners; however, less attention has been given to their potential for stormwater management. Therefore, this paper presents a review of drone studies that have applications for urban stormwater management and provides future perspectives on their role as an emerging technology. A case is made for drones as a tool that can support asset management, conduct flow and water quality monitoring, collect high spatial resolution data for improved model parameterization, and support the smart and connected cities of the future.},

Abstract = {Significant recent advances in satellite remote sensing allow environmental managers to detect and monitor cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB), and these capabilities are being used more frequently in water quality management. A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately \$370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly (\$55,000-\$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.},

Title = {Remote Sensing Retrieval of Total Nitrogen in the Pearl River Delta Based on Landsat8},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Pearl River Delta in South China is subject to severe eutrophication, which is significantly exacerbated by the total nitrogen (TN). Remote sensing technology with large-scale synchronous observations in the Pearl River Delta can effectively monitor organic pollution. Statistical methods based on remote sensing images have been widely used in water quality parameter retrieval for inland rivers, reservoirs, and lakes, but have seldom been applied in the Pearl River Delta. TN is also a non-optically active substance, so it is difficult to retrieve TN through analysis methods. This study retrieves the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) based on Landsat8 images of the Pearl River Delta using a statistical method. The stepwise regression function is built by analyzing the TN concentration and the single-band, two-band, and three-band spectral information groups measured by an ASD FieldSpec3 spectrometer. The retrieval results show that the proposed method performs well with a small mean absolute error (MAE) (0.36 mg/L for TN) and high agreement (R-2 = 0.61 for TN) between the in situ data and the retrieval concentration. The results demonstrate that the concentration of TN in the east of the Pearl River Delta was higher than in the west. Dachan Bay and Shenzhen Bay had the highest TN concentrations, which were around 3.02 mg/L and 3.67 mg/L. The 750-850 nm band could be an important reference for further exploring the spectral characteristics and retrieval of TN. The retrieval method in this study is easy to implement and convenient for local TN distribution capture, which can provide a timely reference for daily water quality supervision and management in the Pearl River Delta.},

Abstract = {Accurate classification for land use/cover with remote sensing image is the premise of monitoring land use/cover change, as well as temporal and spatial change analysis, which can distinguish the number, location and type of changed land during monitoring years. This paper presents a decision tree classification method based on expert knowledge for temporal and spatial variation analysis of land use/cover, which takes advantage of new water index (NWI), normalization construction index (NDBI) and transformational vegetation index (TNDVI). It takes Qingpu District in Shanghai for example. Effective classification and information extraction are realized by using multi-temporal Landsat5 TM images from the year 1987 to 2007. It combines available ancillary geographical data, field survey data and statistical yearbook data to verify the analysis results, and then analyzes profoundly area variation trend of each classification and relative proportion during these years. Meanwhile, multi-temporal change monitoring results are used for the temporal and spatial variation analysis of water resources information, combining with existing relevant data of water quality. On the basis of buffer analysis for water quality and land use/cover in city-level water quality monitoring stations of Qingpu District, a correlation coefficient matrix has been calculated to analyze the relevance between land resources changes and water resources. In conclusion, the scale of urban area and water area are the primary driving force factors of LUCC, which also have an effect on water resource change of Qingpu District. This research represents the application of image recognition technology in the spatio-temporal changes of environment monitoring, and how to carry on deep analysis combined with various non-spatial data. It also provides objective reference about how to protect and improve water quality by controlling land use allocation in water source protection zones.},

Abstract = {Monitoring seagrass habitats is required by many agencies and jurisdictions including Natural Resource Management (NRM) regions in Australia. Baseline mapping of seagrass habitats is proceeding in Tasmania, Australia and the next stage will be to conduct regular monitoring of extent and condition. This paper presents a summary of the results of recent research that addressed outstanding issues in reliable measurement of seagrass condition with optical remote sensing. The results enable the proposal of a new monitoring methodology based on sampling habitats with ``mega-quadrats{''} (around 200 m x 200 m) extracted from ``low tech{''} imagery and present a prototype image visualisation comparison matrix (IVCM).},

Title = {Living up to the Hype of Hyperspectral Aquatic Remote Sensing: Science, Resources and Outlook},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Intensifying pressure on global aquatic resources and services due to population growth and climate change is inspiring new surveying technologies to provide science-based information in support of management and policy strategies. One area of rapid development is hyperspectral remote sensing: imaging across the full spectrum of visible and infrared light. Hyperspectral imagery contains more environmentally meaningful information than panchromatic or multispectral imagery and is poised to provide new applications relevant to society, including assessments of aquatic biodiversity, habitats, water quality, and natural and anthropogenic hazards. To aid in these advances, we provide resources relevant to hyperspectral remote sensing in terms of providing the latest reviews, databases, and software available for practitioners in the field. We highlight recent advances in sensor design, modes of deployment, and image analysis techniques that are becoming more widely available to environmental researchers and resource managers alike. Systems recently deployed on space- and airborne platforms are presented, as well as future missions and advances in unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) and autonomous in-water survey methods. These systems will greatly enhance the ability to collect interdisciplinary observations on-demand and in previously inaccessible environments. Looking forward, advances in sensor miniaturization are discussed alongside the incorporation of citizen science, moving toward open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data. Advances in machine learning and cloud computing allow for exploitation of the full electromagnetic spectrum, and better bridging across the larger scientific community that also includes biogeochemical modelers and climate scientists. These advances will place sophisticated remote sensing capabilities into the hands of individual users and provide on-demand imagery tailored to research and management requirements, as well as provide critical input to marine and climate forecasting systems. The next decade of hyperspectral aquatic remote sensing is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way we assess and monitor aquatic environments and detect changes relevant to global communities.},

Title = {Northern Gulf of Mexico estuarine coloured dissolved organic matter derived from MODIS data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2219-2237},
Abstract = {Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is relevant for water quality management and may become an important measure to complement future water quality assessment programmes. An approach to derive CDOM using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was developed that may be more accessible to water quality managers by selecting an off-the-shelf software and algorithm with standard atmospheric correction. This study focused on demonstrating the transferability of a remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) band ratio algorithm, R-rs(667)/R-rs(488), previously developed to derive CDOM absorption (a(g(lambda))) at multiple MODIS wavebands in open ocean and coastal waters to the United States northern Gulf of Mexico estuaries. In situ calibration regressions at 412, 443, 469, and 488 nm had coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.76, 0.71, 0.69, and 0.57, respectively. Waveband calibrations at 531, 547, and 555 nm were below R-2 = 0.50, and therefore were not considered further. MODIS R-rs, from the standard atmospheric correction, followed nearly identical spectral shapes to the in situ HyperSAS R-rs, but were on average 0.002 + 0.0004 sr(-1) less. A satellite to in situ validation match-up window of <= 1 hour was selected with an R-2 = 0.82 and root mean square error (RMSE = 1.79) at 412 nm. An in situ water quality mooring demonstrated that the overall response and range of MODIS a(g(412)) were similar, with relative mean error from -32\% to 42\%. The advantage to managers was synoptic coverage across multiple estuaries and the ability to provide estimates of derived water quality parameters between the water quality assessment programme sample collection periods, which could offer more holistic assessment.},

Title = {Water Quality Sampling and Multi-Parameter Monitoring System Based on Multi-Rotor UAV Implementation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Water quality sampling and monitoring are fundamental to water environmental protection. The purpose of this study was to develop a water quality sampling and multi-parameter monitoring system mounted on a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system consisted of the UAV, water sampling and multi-parameter detection device, and path planning algorithm. The water sampling device was composed of a rotating drum, a direct current (DC) reduction motor, water suction hose, high-pressure isolation pump, sampling bottles, and microcontroller. The multi-parameter detection device consisted of sensors for potential of hydrogen (pH), turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and a microcontroller. The flight path of the UAV was optimized using the proposed layered hybrid improved particle swarm optimization (LHIPSO) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) obstacle avoidance path planning algorithm, in order to improve the sampling efficiency. Simulation experiments were conducted that compared the LHIPSO algorithm with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the dynamic adjustment (DAPSO) algorithm. The simulation results showed that the LHIPSO algorithm had improved global optimization capability and stability compared to the other algorithms, validating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Field experiments were conducted at an aquaculture fish farm, and the device achieved real-time monitoring of three water quality parameters (pH, TDS, turbidity) at depths of 1 m and 2 m. A rapid analysis of three parameters (ammonia nitrogen, nitrite, dissolved oxygen) was performed in the laboratory on the collected water samples, and validated the feasibility of this study.},

Abstract = {Water environment is associated with many disciplinary fields including sciences and management which makes it difficult to study. Timely observation, data getting and analysis on water environment are very important for decision makers who play an important role to maintain the sustainable development. This study focused on developing a plateform of water environment management based on remote sensing and GIS technology, and its main target is to provide with necessary information on water environment through spatial analysis and visual display in a suitable way. The work especially focused on three points, and the first one is related to technical issues of spatial data organization and communication with a combination of GIS and statistical software. A data-related model was proposed to solve the data communication between the mentioned systems. The second one is spatio-temporal analysis based on remote sensing and GIS. Water quality parameters of suspended sediment concentration and BOD5 were specially analyzed in his case, and the results suggested an obvious influence of land source pollution quantitatively in a spatial domain. The third one is 3D visualization of surface feature based on RS and GIS technology. The Pearl River estuary and HongKong's coastal waters in the South China Sea were taken as a case in this study. The software ARCGIS was taken as a basic platform to develop a water environmental management system. The sampling data of water quality in 76 monitoring stations of coastal water bodies and remote sensed images were selected in this study.},

Title = {Hydrodynamic investigation of surface hydrological connectivity and its effects on the water quality of seasonal lakes: Insights from a complex floodplain setting (Poyang Lake, China)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {660},

Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Small, seasonal lakes that exist in floodplains are rarely investigated, and yet they play an important role in the protection of biodiversity and are highly susceptible to modification due to human activities. This study presents a first attempt to combine hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods to investigate hydrological connectivity and its relationship with the water quality of nine seasonal lakes within the floodplains of Poyang Lake (China). The hydrodynamic model reproduced reasonably well the hydrological regime of the lake and surrounding floodplains, based on field measurements and remote sensing data. Floodplain lakes exhibit similar water-level dynamics to the main lake during connected periods of flooding, while they decouple from the main lake during recession periods. Geostatistical results reveal that although the north-south hydrological connectivity extends over a longer pathway than the west-east connectivity, the rapid reduction in the west-east connectivity indicates a more sensitive response. The west-east connectivity tends to play a dominant role in affecting the interactions between the main lake and floodplains, as expected. Statistical methods indicate that surface hydrological connectivity across the floodplain results in an enhanced spatial similarity in the water quality of the floodplain lakes, in terms of a multitude of water quality parameters (TN, TP, NH4+-N, NO3--N, NO2--N, PO43-, CODMn, and Chl alpha), while surface hydrological isolation was observed to increase the water quality differences between the seasonal lakes. Additionally, enhanced hydrological connectivity may lead to improved water quality of the seasonal lakes from low connectivity to high connectivity condition. Hydrological connectivity may be a key factor controlling the dynamics in water quality between seasonal lakes. The findings of this study support the management of both Poyang Lake and the floodplain wetlands by providing important information on both water resource and water quality, and proposals to better manage the impacts of intensive human activities.

Title = {Terra incognita: The unknown risks to environmental quality posed by the spatial distribution and abundance of concentrated animal feeding operations},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {642},
Pages = {887-893},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) pose wide ranging environmental risks to many parts of the US and across the globe, but datasets for CAFO risk assessments are not readily available. Within the United States, some of the greatest concentrations of CAFOs occur in North Carolina. It is also one of the only states with publicly accessible location data for classes of CAFOs that are required to obtain water quality permits from the US. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); however, there are no public data sources for the large number of CAFOs that do not require EPA water quality permits. We combined public records of CAFO locations with data collected in North Carolina by the Waterkeeper and Riverkeeper Alliances to examine the distribution of both permitted and non-permitted CAFOs across the state. Over half (55\%) of the state's 6646 CAFOs are located in the Coastal Plain, a low-lying region vulnerable to flooding associated with regular cyclonic and convective storms We identified 19\% of CAFOs <= 100 m of the nearest stream, and some as close as 15 m to the nearest stream, a common riparian butler width for water quality management. Future climate scenarios suggest large storm events are expected to become increasingly extreme, and dry interstorm periods could lengthen. Such extremes could exacerbate the environmental impacts of CMOs. Understanding the potential impacts of CAFO agroecosystems will require remote sensing to identify CAFOs, fieldwork to determine the extent of environmental footprints, and modeling to identify thresholds that determine environmental risk under changing conditions.

Title = {Oyster Aquaculture Site Selection Using Landsat 8-Derived Sea Surface Temperature, Turbidity, and Chlorophyll a},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Remote sensing data is useful for selection of aquaculture sites because it can provide water-quality products mapped over large regions at low cost to users. However, the spatial resolution of most ocean color satellites is too coarse to provide usable data within many estuaries. The Landsat 8 satellite, launched February 11, 2013, has both the spatial resolution and the necessary signal to noise ratio to provide temperature, as well as ocean color derived products along complex coastlines. The state of Maine (USA) has an abundance of estuarine indentations (similar to 3,500 miles of tidal shoreline within 220 miles of coast), and an expanding aquaculture industry, which makes it a prime case study for using Landsat 8 data to provide products suitable for aquaculture site selection. We collected the Landsat 8 scenes over coastal Maine, flagged clouds, atmospherically corrected the top-of-the-atmosphere radiances, and derived time varying fields (repeat time of Landsat 8 is 16 days) of temperature (100 m resolution), turbidity (30 m resolution), and chlorophyll a (30 m resolution). We validated the remote-sensing-based products at several in situ locations along the Maine coast where monitoring buoys and programs are in place. Initial analysis of the validated fields revealed promising new areas for oyster aquaculture. The approach used is applicable to other coastal regions and the data collected to date show potential for other applications in marine coastal environments, including water quality monitoring and ecosystem management.},

Title = {A Review of Wetland Remote Sensing},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Wetlands are some of the most important ecosystems on Earth. They play a key role in alleviating floods and filtering polluted water and also provide habitats for many plants and animals. Wetlands also interact with climate change. Over the past 50 years, wetlands have been polluted and declined dramatically as land cover has changed in some regions. Remote sensing has been the most useful tool to acquire spatial and temporal information about wetlands. In this paper, seven types of sensors were reviewed: aerial photos coarse-resolution, medium-resolution, high-resolution, hyperspectral imagery, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This study also discusses the advantage of each sensor for wetland research. Wetland research themes reviewed in this paper include wetland classification, habitat or biodiversity, biomass estimation, plant leaf chemistry, water quality, mangrove forest, and sea level rise. This study also gives an overview of the methods used in wetland research such as supervised and unsupervised classification and decision tree and object-based classification. Finally, this paper provides some advice on future wetland remote sensing. To our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive and detailed review of wetland remote sensing and it will be a good reference for wetland researchers.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Xiong'an New Area is defined as the future city of China, and the regulation of water resources is an important part of the scientific development of the city. Baiyang Lake, the main supplying water for the city, is selected as the study area, and the water quality extraction of four typical river sections is taken as the research objective. The GaiaSky-mini2-VN hyperspectral imaging system was executed on the UAV to obtain the river hyperspectral data for four winter periods. Synchronously, water samples of COD, PI, AN, TP, and TN were collected on the ground, and the in situ data under the same coordinate were obtained. A total of 2 algorithms of band difference and band ratio are established, and the relatively optimal model is obtained based on 18 spectral transformations. The conclusion of the strength of water quality parameters' content along the four regions is obtained. This study revealed four types of river self-purification, namely, uniform type, enhanced type, jitter type, and weakened type, which provided the scientific basis for water source traceability evaluation, water pollution source area analysis, and water environment comprehensive treatment.},

Abstract = {Estimation and mapping of surface water quality are vital for the planning and sustainable management of inland reservoirs. The study aimed at retrieving and mapping water quality parameters (WQPs) of Owabi Dam reservoir from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data, using random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. Water samples from 45 systematic plots were analysed for pH, turbidity, alkalinity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen. The performances of all three models were compared in terms of adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2.adj), and the root mean square error (RMSE) using repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure. To determine the status of water quality, pixel-level predictions were used to compute model-assisted estimates of WQPs and compared with reference values from the World Health Organization. Generally, all three models produced more accurate results for S2 compared to L8. On average, the inter-sensor relative efficiency showed that S2 outperformed L8 by 67\% in retrieving WQPs of the Owabi Dam reservoir. S2 gave the highest accuracy for RF (R-2.adj = 95-99\%, RMSE = 0.02-3.03) and least for MLR (R-2.adj = 55-9 1\%, RMSE = 0.03-3.14). Compared to RF, SVM showed similar results for S2 but with slightly higher RMSEs (0.03-3.99). The estimated pH (7.06), total dissolved solids (39.19 mg/L) and alkalinity (179.60 mg/L) were within acceptable limits, except for turbidity (33.49 mg/L) which exceeded the reference thresholds. The S2 and RF models are recommended for the monitoring of surface water quality of the Owabi Dam reservoir. (c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

Abstract = {In this paper, an ensemble-based system (EBS) for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) in inland water bodies using downscaled MODIS images was developed. Seeking additional opinions before making a decision is part of human nature, particularly for decisions involving health issues. The general concept behind EBS algorithms is based on this principle. Forty-six Chl-a measurements, collected over four water bodies between 2000 and 2008, were used to calibrate the EBS. Measurements ranged from 2.7 (oligotrophic waters) to 91 000 mg Chl-a m(-3) (hypertrophic waters). The EBS performance was evaluated by cross validation, and also using an independent database (Chl-a ranging from 1 to 14 mg m(-3)). Cross-validation results were satisfactory both under high-blooming conditions (R-2 = 0.98, relative RMSE ( RMSEr) = 15\%, relative Bias (BIASr) = -2\%, and relative Nash (NASHr) = 0.95) and at the initialization of blooms (R-2 = 0.77, RMSEr = 37\%, BIASr = -8\%, and NASHr = 0.70). The EBS also performed well on the independent database (R-2 = 0.93, RMSEr = 50\%, BIASr = -27\%, and NASHr = 0.70). A visual comparison mapping Chl-a on the Missisquoi Bay of Lake Champlain additionally illustrates the potential of the EBS to detect early phases of algal growth contrary to other models (adaptive model, Kharu, and APProach by Elimination). This approach is a proof of concept for a more efficient way to quantify algal biomass from remote sensing and could be exported to any types of satellite imagery in a context of water quality monitoring.},

Abstract = {India's public funded earth observation (EO) program over the decades had evolved into a multidimensional program aiming to fulfill widely diverse application objectives. Remote Sensing Data Policy was first adopted by the Government of India in the year 2000 and subsequently revised in 2011. These policies placed strong emphasis on government funding of space infrastructure and also several downstream development activities relating to applications. In recent decade, however, commercial EO systems made rapid strides in providing access to high-quality data as well as information to users all over the globe. Through active role of private sector, several New Space initiatives have also been undertaken in different parts of the globe. In view of some unique opportunities arising in the Indian market due to the transforming economic, demographic, and social structure, the opportunities and challenges for commercial space had been studied. In the context of growing middle-income markets, the Indian private sector had also been showing increasing interest to invest into global initiatives and also explore new segments of value chain in the Indian market. This has already begun to happen in the field of satellite communications and it would also extend into other areas such as EOs and applications, which are now driven by national initiatives such as Digital India announced by the Indian Prime Minister recently and a nationalgeographic information system (GIS). The major drivers that would create burgeoning demands for space-based products and services are the decision support needs arising from diverse requirements of large-scale infrastructure developments and trends such as urban shift of the population, land use change, huge needs ofinformation and communication technologies (ICT)-based services addressing the demands of education, health, mobility, and environment sectors, robust demands for disaster warning and mitigation, national security, and natural resources management. An attempt has been made to analyze different policy paradigms. The article will also discuss the perspectives of private industry in India on policy issues and the perceptions of market opportunities in such a rapidly transforming environment and presents a portfolio of models to derive greater economic benefits. Since government policies had invariably played a major role in triggering investment and participation by private sector in this field, an avant-garde policy and regulatory changes to attract greater private sector participation are presented in conclusion.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing coupled with the measurement of physical, chemical and biological variables is an important tool in water resource management. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the dynamics of the physical, chemical and biological variables of the waters of an intermittent river and an artificial surface reservoir using multivariate analysis and in response to land use and occupation in the hydrographic basin. The study was carried out in the hydrographic basin of the River Cruxati in four study areas (three river areas and one artificial reservoir), with images obtained from the OLI sensor of the Landsat-8 satellite. The limnological variables measured were pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and chlorophyll a. The limnological variables were analysed using Principal Component Analysis - PCA, Tukey's test and Cluster Analysis. Eutrophication of the areas under study was calculated using the Trophic State Index. The PCA allowed three components to be selected that indicated the quality of the surface water, river and artificial reservoir, explaining 88.57\% of the total variance. The limnological variables responsible for the grouping were electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Land use and occupation has influenced water quality in the stretches of river. Anthropisation has had an influence on the levels of dissolved oxygen, and the presence of agricultural areas has caused an increase in turbidity. However, the most conserved landscape (artificial reservoir) had the highest degree of eutrophication due to the difference in water dynamics between the lentic and lotic environments.},

Abstract = {The contamination of shellfish harvesting areas by fecal bacteria in the Annapolis Basin of Nova Scotia, Canada, is a recurring problem which has consequences for industry, government, and local communities. This study contributes to the development of an integrated water quality forecasting system to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of industry management. The proposed integrated forecasting framework is composed of a database containing contamination sources, hydrodynamics of the Annapolis Basin, Escherichia coli (E. coli) loadings and watershed hydrology scenarios, coupled with environmental conditions of the region (e. g., temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and ultraviolet light). For integration into this framework, this study presents a viable methodology for assessing the contribution of fecal bacteria originating from a watershed. The proposed methodology investigated the application of high resolution remote sensing, coupled with the commercially available product, MIKE 11, to monitor watershed land use and its impact on water quality. Remote sensing proved to be an extremely useful tool in the identification of sources of fecal bacteria contamination, as well as the detection of land use change over time. Validation of the MIKE 11 model produced very good agreement (R-2 = 0.88, E = 0.85) between predicted and observed river flows, while model calibration of E. coli concentrations showed fair agreement (R-2 = 0.51 and E = 0.38) between predicted and observed values. A proper evaluation of the MIKE 11 model was constrained due to limited water sampling. However, the model was very effective in predicting times of high contamination for use in the integrated forecasting framework, especially during substantial precipitation events.},

Title = {Aggregating land use quantity and intensity to link water quality in upper catchment of Miyun Reservoir},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {329-339},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Eutrophication resulting from nutrient enrichment decreases water quality and harms ecosystem structure and function, and its degree is significantly affected by land use in the catchment. Quantifying the relationship between eutrophication and land use can help effectively manage land use to improve water quality. Previous studies principally utilized land use quantity as an indicator to link water quality parameters, but these studies lacked insight into the impact of land use intensity. Taking the upper catchment of Miyun Reservoir as a case study, we developed a method of aggregating land use quantity and intensity to build a new land use indicator and tested its explanatory power on water quality. Six nutrient concentrations from 52 sub-watersheds covering the whole catchment were used to characterize the spatial distribution of eutrophication. Based on spatial techniques, empirical conversion coefficients, remote sensing data, and socio-economic statistical data, land use intensity was measured and mapped visually. The new land use indicator was calculated and linked to nutrient concentrations by Pearson correlation coefficients. Results demonstrated that our new indicator incorporating intensity information can quantify the different nutrient-exporting abilities of different land use areas. Compared to traditional indicators that only incorporate land use quantity, most Pearson correlation coefficients between the new indicator and water nutrient concentrations increased. This new information enhanced the explanatory power of land use on water nutrient concentrations, and so will be able to help us understand the impact of land use on water quality and guide decision making for better land use management.

Title = {Dynamic Analysis of Risk to Water Quality in the Baimei Reservoir Conservation Area, Fujian Province, China},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {The security of drinking water resources is an important concern for human survival. The extensive use of geographic information system and remote sensing data in risk assessments of water quality from a spatiotemporal perspective can complement water resource management. In this study, we investigated Baimei reservoir conservation area, Fujian Province, China. The quantitatively inversed leaf area index was used to represent the vegetation growth condition in simulations of the hydrological process using soil and water assessment tool. According to the simulation results, the spatial distribution of the risk to water quality was mainly related to the land-use condition, and the temporal distribution of the risk to water quality was mainly related to the precipitation dynamics. Single factor analysis of various scenarios showed that uncontrolled expansion of agricultural land (scenario A) would lead to an overall average increase of 231.9\% in the total nitrogen (TN) load in the basin. By contrast, if agricultural lands are all transformed into forests (scenario B), then the overall TN load in the basin would decrease by an average of 20.8\%. In practical terms, conversion of sloping agricultural lands to forests (scenario C) could reduce the overall TN load by 17.0\%. Thus, moderate conversion of agricultural lands to forests can reduce the pollution load effectively. The simulation results obtained for scenarios with adjustments to the fertilization time and amount showed that applying fertilizer on rainy days would increase the risk to water quality compared with days without rain. The method developed in this study can be applied for dynamic analysis in water quality risk assessments of water conservation areas and can provide a scientific reference for promoting ecological management strategies and sustainable development at the regional scale.},

Title = {Water Quality of Four Major Lakes in Mississippi, USA: Impacts on Human and Aquatic Ecosystem Health},
Journal = {WATER},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs), harmful microorganisms (pathogens) and toxic metals represent three major agents of water quality deterioration. Water quality of three northern lakes (Sardis, Enid, and Grenada) and a central lake (Ross Barnett Reservoir) of Mississippi, USA were examined in this study. While all these lakes are heavily used for recreational purposes, the Ross Barnett Reservoir serves additionally as the primary water supply for the City of Jackson, the capital city of Mississippi. The main goal of this study was to comprehensively assess the water quality of these lakes employing field and satellite data, and evaluate the potential human and aquatic health impacts. A time-series of true color images derived from satellite data indicated that algal blooms have been a recurring phenomenon in these lakes. Cyanobacteria, the algal group that predominantly occur in freshwater and form toxic blooms, were always present in these lakes and were most abundant on many occasions. The most toxic cyanotoxin, microcystin-LR, was found in all lakes, and its concentrations exceeded federal drinking water guidelines for children under six years of age many times. Potential bioaccumulation and biomagnification of microcystin-LR may pose serious risk to the aquatic ecosystem and human health including adults. Nutrient measurements indicated that all four lakes were eutrophic. Among bacterial populations, total coliforms and enterococci exceeded guideline values on several occasions. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead were found in the water of all the lakes, with arsenic exceeding the guideline values at two sites in Ross Barnett Reservoir. While it is apparent from this study that these lakes face many water quality issues, data across all seasons will be required to document potential trends and to devise management strategies. Use of remote sensing technology is recommended to monitor some of the water quality parameters such as suspended particulate matter and algal blooms, especially cyanobacterial blooms.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {751},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Some wastewater sources, such as agricultural waste and runoff, and industrial sewage, can degrade water quality. This study summarises the sources and corresponding mechanisms that trigger eutrophication in lakes. Additionally, the trophic status index and water quality index (WQI) which are effective tools for evaluating the degree of eutrophication of lakes, have been discussed. This study also explores the main nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) driving transformations in the water body and sediment. Lake Erhai was used as a case study, and itwas found to be in a mesotrophic state, with N and P co-limitation before 2006, and only P limitation since 2006. Finally, effective measures to maintain sustainable development in the watershed are proposed, along with a framework for an early warning system adopting the latest technologies (geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS)) for preventing eutrophication.

This method was adapted from a protocol developed for mapping coral reef areas. Georeferenced spot check field-survey data were obtained across Moreton Bay, covering areas of differing water quality, and categorized into either substrate or >= 25\% seagrass cover. These point data with coincident Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery (30 m resolution; pulled directly from Google Earth Engine's public archive) and a bathymetric layer (30 m resolution) were incorporated to train a random forest classifier. The semiautomated machine learning algorithm was applied to map seagrass in shallow areas of variable water quality simultaneously, and a bay-wide map was created for Moreton Bay. The output benthic habitat map representing seagrass presence/absence was accurate (63\%) as determined by validation with an independent data set.},

Abstract = {The current generation of space-borne sensors are generating nearly continuous streams of massive earth observation datasets. These huge multi-modal streams increase at astonishing rates, reaching currently several petabytes in many satellite archives. Shortly, high-resolution multispectral images will be available almost once a week and in some regions twice per week. However, it is estimated that most of datasets in existing archives have never been accessed and processed outside high-end supercomputing and data-center environments. To this end, a scalable geospatial platform has been designed, developed and evaluated for the online and real-time harvesting of valuable information from big earth observation data. The core of our platform consists of the Rasdaman Array Database Management System for big raster data storage, and the Open Geospatial Consortium Web Coverage Processing Service for data querying. The WebGIS client is based on the OpenLayers and GeoExt javascript libraries, while advanced remote sensing and computer vision libraries like GDAL, Orfeo Toolbox and OpenCV have been integrated as well. Currently, the system is fully covering Greece with LANDSAT 8 multispectral data, from the beginning of the satellite's mission. Datasets are stored and pre-processed automatically in our hardware. The developed system has been validated for the efficient and automated processing of high resolution satellite data and in particular for key geospatial, environmental, agriculture and water engineering applications like precision agriculture, water quality monitoring and land cover mapping.},

Abstract = {The Oder (Odra) river is the most important nutrient source and pollutant for the southwestern Baltic Sea. Adjacent German-Polish coastal waters, the Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon and the Oder (Pomeranian) Bight therefore suffer from severe eutrophication and water quality problems. At the same time, summer (bathing) tourism is the most important economical factor in this coastal zone, especially on the islands of Usedom and Wolin. On the basis of model simulations and remote sensing data we analysed the spatial extent and variability of the Oder river plume in the lagoon and the Balic Sea in common summer situations and during the extreme Oder flood in August 1997. Water quality shows pronounced gradients between coastal waters and open Baltic Sea. In the lagoon, it usually takes more than 6 weeks until Oder water enters the large western bay, the Kleines Haff. During transport, degradation, transformation and sedimentation processes alter the water quality and prevent the inner coast of Usedom from direct impact of polluted Oder water. Ongoing nutrient supply promotes intensive algal proliferation in all parts of the lagoon and contributes to the low water transparency. Oder water passing the lagoon and entering the Baltic Sea is transported over long distances in narrow bands along the shore. Under easterly winds the water quality near well-known spas on Usedom is reduced due to Oder river plume impact. Upwelling effects can have negative impact on water quality, too. Intensive blooms of potentially, toxic blue-green algae species, are the rule in the lagoon and frequent in the Oder Bight in summer. They are a hazard and limit the acceptance of swimming beaches at the inner coast of Usedom. Practical consequences of variable water quality gradients e.g. on hygienic water sampling are discussed.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of catchment water quality monitoring using a tiered framework of integrated sensing technologies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {765},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Due to the growing threat of climate change, new advances in water quality monitoring strategies are needed now more than ever. Reliable and robust monitoring practices can be used to improve and better understand catchment processes affecting the water quality. In recent years the deployment of long term in-situ sensors has increased the temporal and spatial data being obtained. Furthermore, the development and research into remote sensing using satellite and aerial imagery has been incrementally integrated into catchments for monitoring areas that previously might have been impossible to monitor, producing high-resolution data that has become imperative to catchment monitoring. The use of modelling in catchments has become relevant as it enables the prediction of events before they occur so that strategic plans can be put in place to deal with or prevent certain threats. This review highlights the monitoring approaches employed in catchments currently and examines the potential for integration of these methods. A framework might incorporate all monitoring strategies to obtain more information about a catchment and its water quality. The future of monitoring will involve satellite, in-situ and air borne devices with data analytics playing a key role in providing decision support tools. The review provides examples of successful use of individual technologies, some combined approaches and identifies gaps that should be filled to achieve an ideal catchment observation system.

Abstract = {An overview of geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) is the main focus of this work, that emphasizes their application to obtain water body information. This information is integrated to the Framework Directive, and in this way, seeks to propose the linkage of these information to the Resolution 357/2005, in order to serve as a tool for decision making in strategic management of water quality mainly in large reservoirs. Thus, a review that integrates geotechnology to limnological science and to reservoirs management was done, highlighting the possible potential of interdisciplinary integration. At the end, an integration model of GIS, RS and limnology is schematized for monitoring and management of water quality standards according to the Resolution 357/2005.},

Abstract = {Hurricanes that damage lives and property can also impact pollutant sources and trigger poor water quality. Yet, these water quality impacts that affect both human and natural communities are difficult to quantify. We developed an operational remote sensing-based hurricane flood extent mapping method, examined potential water quality implications of two ``500-year{''} hurricanes in 2016 and 2018, and identified options to increase social-ecological resilience in North Carolina. Flooding detected with synthetic aperture radar (>91\% accuracy) extended beyond state-mapped hazard zones. Furthermore, the legal floodplain underestimated impacts for communities with higher proportions of older adults, disabilities, unemployment, and mobile homes, as well as for headwater streams with restricted elevation gradients. Pollution sources were repeatedly affected, including similar to 55\% of wastewater treatment plant capacity and swine operations that generate similar to 500 M tons/y manure. We identified similar to 4.8 million km(2) for possible forest and wetland conservation and similar to 1.7 million km(2) for restoration or altered management opportunities. The results suggest that current hazard mapping is inadequate for resilience planning; increased storm frequency and intensity necessitate modification of design standards, land-use policies, and infrastructure operation. Implementation of interventions can be guided by a greater understanding of social-ecological vulnerabilities within hazard and exposure areas.},

Abstract = {Reservoirs are aquatic environments with complex interactions between bio-chemical and physical components. Many of those parameters can be estimated from remote sensing tools, especially since increasing technological progress allows the analysis of those environments in high spatial and temporal resolutions. This work aimed to analyze the water quality of four reservoirs, with high energy productivity, located in the center-southern region of Brazil from bio-optical and thermal water parameters. Therefore, hundreds of Landsat 5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 (OLI) satellite images were processed by the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to estimate water surface temperature, chlorophyll-a density (chl-a), Secchi depth (SD), and trophic state index (TSI). To calibrate the equations, 11 in situ monitoring points were used in 27 scenes from the TM and ETM+ sensors and 30 from the OLI sensor, within 6 days interval between the monitoring date and the image acquisition. Additionally, records from two weather stations near the reservoirs were analyzed to evaluate meteorological influences on water parameters. SD has influenced TSI in three reservoirs, while chl-a has acted as a proxy in only one. Moderate correlations were observed between air temperature, rainfall, and global radiation and the bio-optical and thermal water parameters. Remote sensing has detected a clear spatio-temporal variation, which allowed regionalizing the reservoirs. Reservoir regionalization based on the mapped parameters may be able not only to visualize the spatial dynamics of the waters but also as a tool for the management of water bodies with multiple users and issues.},

Title = {Coupling remote sensing and particle tracking to estimate trajectories in large water bodies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Propelled by the rapid development of equipment, technology and computational power, the monitoring and simulation of the hydrodynamics in lakes have steadily advanced. In contrast, water quality simulations are more difficult to implement, due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale, spatially resolved field observations for model validation and the number of interacting processes to be parameterized. Here we demonstrate that remote sensing data can be used to inform Lagrangian particle tracking in a large lake, and vice versa. We used total suspended matter (TSM) as a parameter that can be both estimated from the backscattering in satellite images and modelled in terms of particle abundance. Specifically, we compared TSM concentrations in Lake Geneva deduced from images taken by Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites to those estimated from Delft3D hydrodynamic and particle tracking models. TSM concentrations obtained from both methods were compared over a time span of up to 5 days in several scenario studies, including instantaneous and continuous point sources and large-scale TSM simulations. The results demonstrate that remote sensing images can serve to calibrate and validate particle tracking models with independent observations. The model was able to capture both the position of a TSM cloud arising 5 days after an instantaneous point source release, and the direction of particle transport and TSM plume size resulting from a continuous source. Even when simulating the whole lake domain, model results closely approximated the satellite-derived TSM concentrations along lake transects within 9\%. In return, the particle tracking model was able to complete partially impaired satellite images, and fill in a four-day image gaps between satellite revisits. The synergy of remote sensing techniques and particle tracking modelling allows a rapid, continuous and more accurate analysis on solute transport in lakes.},

Abstract = {For effective lakes' management, high-frequent water quality data on a synoptic scale are essential. The aim of this study is to test the suitability of the latest generation of satellite sensors to provide information on lake water quality parameters for the five largest Italian subalpine lakes. In situ data of phytoplankton composition, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration and water reflectance were used in synergy with satellite observations to map some algal blooms in 2016. Chl-a concentration maps were derived from satellite data by applying a bio-optical model to satellite data, previously corrected for atmospheric effects. Results were compared with in situ data, showing good agreement. The shape and magnitude of water reflectance from different satellite data were consistent. Output chl-a concentration maps, show the distribution within each lake during blooming events, suggesting a synoptic view is required for these events monitoring. Maps show the dynamic of bloom events with concentration increasing from 2 up to 7mgm(-3) and dropping again to initial value in less than 20days. Latest generation sensors were shown to be valuable tools for lakes monitoring, thanks to frequent, free of charge data availability over long time periods.},

Title = {Use of remote sensing to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on soil salinity in a semi-arid area},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The global water crisis, driven by water scarcity and water quality deterioration, is expected to continue and intensify in dry and overpopulated areas, and will play a critical role in meeting future agricultural demands. Sustainability of agriculture irrigated with low quality water will require a comprehensive approach to soil, water, and crop management consisting of site- and situation-specific preventive measures and management strategies. Other problem related with water quality deterioration is soil salinization. Around 1Bha globally are salinized and soil salinization may be accelerating for several reasons including the changing climate. The consequences of climate change on soil salinization need to be monitored and mapped and, in this sense, remote sensing has been successfully applied to soil salinity monitoring. Although many issues remain to be resolved, some as important as the imbalance between ground-based measurements and satellite data. The main objective of this paper was to determine the influence of environmental factors on salinity from natural causes, and its effect on irrigated agriculture with degraded water. The study was developed on Campo de Cartagena, an intensive water-efficient irrigated area which main fruit tree is citrus (30\%), a sensible crop to salinity. Nine representative citrus farms were selected, soil samples were analysed and different remote sensing indices and sets of environmental data were applied. Despite the heterogeneity between variables found by the descriptive analysis of the data, the relationship between farms, soil salinity and environmental data showed that applied salinity spectral indices were valid to detect soil salinity in citrus trees. Also, a set of environmental characterization provided useful information to determine the variables that most influence primary salinity in crops. Although the data extracted from spatial analysis indicated that to apply soil salinity predictive models, other variables related to agricultural management practices must be incorporated.},

Abstract = {Water quality models are important in predicting the changes in surface water quality for environmental management. A range of water quality models are wildly used, but every model has its advantages and limitations for specific situations. The aim of this review is to provide a guide to researcher for selecting a suitable water quality model. Eight well known water quality models were selected for this review: SWAT, WASP, QUALs, MIKE 11, HSPF, CE-QUAL-W2, ELCOM-CAEDYM and EFDC. Each model is described according to its intended use, development, simulation elements, basic principles and applicability (e.g., for rivers, lakes, and reservoirs and estuaries). Currently, the most important trends for future model development are: (1) combination models-individual models cannot completely solve the complex situations so combined models are needed to obtain the most appropriate results, (2) application of artificial intelligence and mechanistic models combined with nonmechanistic models will provide more accurate results because of the realistic parameters derived from nonmechanistic models, and (3) integration with remote sensing, geographical information and global position systems (3S) - 3S can solve problems requiring large amounts of data.},

Abstract = {Monitoring chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations is important for the management of water quality, because it is a good indicator of the eutrophication level in an aquatic system. Thus, our main purpose was to develop an alternative technique to monitor chl-a in time and space through remote sensing techniques. However, one of the limitations of remote sensing is the resolution. To achieve a high temporal resolution and medium space resolution, we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m reflectance product, MOD09GA, and limnological parameters from the Itumbiara Reservoir. With these data, an empirical (O14a) and semi-empirical (O14b) algorithm were developed. Algorithms were cross-calibrated and validated using three datasets: one for each campaign and a third consisting of a combination of the two individual campaigns. Algorithm O14a produced the best validation with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 30.4\%, whereas O14b produced an RMSE of 32.41\% using the mixed dataset calibration. O14a was applied to MOD09GA to build a time series for the reservoir for the year of 2009. The time-series analysis revealed that there were occurrences of algal blooms in the summer that were likely related to the additional input of nutrients caused by rainfall runoff. During the winter, however, the few observed algal blooms events were related to periods of atmospheric meteorological variations that represented an enhanced external influence on the processes of mixing and stratification of the water column. Finally, the use of remote sensing techniques can be an important tool for policy makers, environmental managers and the scientific community with which to monitor water quality.},

Abstract = {Flood disasters are closely associated with an increased risk of infection, particularly from waterborne diseases. Most studies of waterborne diseases have relied on the direct determination of pathogens in contaminated water to assess disease risk. In contrast, this study aims to use an indirect assessment that employs a back propagation neural network (BPNN) for modelling diarrheal outbreaks using data from remote sensing and dissolved-oxygen (DO) measurements to reduce cost and time. Our study area is in Ayutthaya province, which was very severely affected by the catastrophic 2011 Thailand flood. BPNN was used to model the relationships among the parameters of the flood and the water quality and the risk of people becoming infected. Radarsat-2 scenes were utilized to estimate flood area and duration, while the flood water quality was derived from the interpolation of DO samples. The risk-ratio function was applied to the diarrheal morbidity to define the level of outbreak detection and the outbreak periods. Tests of the BPNN prediction model produced high prediction accuracy of diarrheal-outbreak risk with low prediction error and a high degree of correlation. With the promising accuracy of our approach, decision-makers can plan rapid and comprehensively preventive measures and countermeasures in advance.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Various spatial interrelationships among sampling stations are not well explored in the spatial modeling of water quality literature. This research explores the relationship between water quality and various social, demographic, and topographic factors in an urbanizing watershed of Nepal with a comparison of different connectivity matrices to conceptualize spatial interrelationships. We collected electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen data from surface water bodies using a handheld probe and used the data to establish relationships with land use, topography, and population density-based explanatory variables at both watershed and 100-m buffer scales. The linear regression model was compared with different eigenvector-based spatial filtering models. These spatial filtering models were constructed using five different spatial conceptualizations based on different graph types generated from the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites. Population density, elevation, and percentage of sand in the watershed and riparian regions are most important in explaining dissolved oxygen concentration and electric conductivity. A human signature as population density and increased sand and gravel cover can be detected in this watershed impacting water quality. Among different graph types compared, the relative graph type provided the highest model strength signifying a stronger upstream-downstream relationship of dissolved oxygen, while k-nearest graph types with four neighbors provided the strongest model performance, indicating the impact of local factors on electrical conductivity. The relationships between socio-environmental factors and water quality and their spatial interrelationships identified in this work shed light on the source, mobilization, and transport of dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity and can assist the water quality management endeavor.},

Abstract = {Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) are generally accepted as proxies for water quality. They can be easily retrieved in a quasi-near real time mode through satellite remote sensing and, as such, they provide an overview of the water quality on a synoptic scale in open waters. Their distributions evolve in space and time in response to local and remote forcing, such as winds and currents, which however have much finer temporal and spatial scales than those resolvable by satellites in spite of recent advances in satellite remote-sensing techniques. Satellite data are often characterized by a moderate temporal resolution to adequately catch the actual sub-grid physical processes. Conventional pointwise measurements can resolve high-frequency motions such as tides or high-frequency wind-driven currents, however they are inadequate to resolve their spatial variability over wide areas. We show in this paper that a combined use of near-surface currents, available through High-Frequency (HF) radars, and satellite data (e.g., TERRA and AQUA/MODIS), can properly resolve the main oceanographic features in both coastal and open-sea regions, particularly at the coastal boundaries where satellite imageries fail, and are complementary tools to interpret ocean productivity and resource management in the Sicily Channel.

Title = {Mapping inland lake water quality across the Lower Peninsula of Michigan using Landsat TM imagery},

Abstract = {The number, size, and distribution of inland freshwater lakes present a challenge for traditional water-quality assessment due to the time, cost, and logistical constraints of field sampling and laboratory analyses. To overcome this challenge, Landsat imagery has been used as an effective tool to assess basic water-quality indicators, such as Secchi depth (SD), over a large region or to map more advanced lake attributes, such as cyanobacteria, for a single waterbody. The overarching objective of this research application was to evaluate Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for mapping nine water-quality metrics over a large region and to identify hot spots of potential risk. The second objective was to evaluate the addition of landscape pattern metrics to test potential improvements in mapping lake attributes and to understand drivers of lake water quality in this region. Field-level in situ water-quality measurements were collected across diverse lakes (n=42) within the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. A multicriteria statistical approach was executed to map lake water quality that considered variable importance, model complexity, and uncertainty. Overall, band ratio radiance models performed well (R-2 = 0.65-0.81) for mapping SD, chlorophyll-a, green biovolume, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) with weaker (R-2 = 0.37) ability to map total suspended solids (TSS) and cyanobacteria levels. In this application, Landsat TM and pattern metrics showed poor ability to accurately map non-purgable organic carbon (NPOC) and diatom biovolume, likely due to a combination of gaps in temporal overpass and field sampling and lack of signal sensitivity within broad spectral channels of Landsat TM. The composition and configuration of croplands, urban, and wetland patches across the landscape were found to be moderate predictors of lake water quality that can complement lake remote-sensing data. Of the 4071 lakes, over 4 ha in the Lower Peninsula, approximately two-thirds, were identified as mesotrophic (n=2715). This application highlights how an operational tool might support lake decision-making or assessment protocols to identify hot spots of potential risk.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) play a key role in all geospatial aspects of the assessment and management of water resources for inland fisheries and aquaculture. Lake, wetland, and reservoirs are some of the important inland water resources for potential fish production and help improve the rural economy on large scale. Fisheries development perspective reservoirs of the Tarai region are Naitaal, Tumaria, Haripura, Baur, Baigul, Dhaura, Nanaksagar, and Sardasagar, which are located at 28 degrees 25'-29 degrees 550' latitude and 78 degrees 18'-79 degrees 55'E longitude. Waterre-source assessment such as spread area, water quality, nutrient analysis, chlorophyll content, and other physico-chemica properties may be done through the mapping. Hence, remote sensing and GIS software and images like Landsat-ETM+, Landsat-8 and other multi spectral images utilization at short time frame for potential fishing zone identification, rate of sedimentation, geomorphological changes such as land cover, erosion and accretion in reservoirs as well. Thus it will help in decision making and blueprint preparation for sustainable water resource management at a cost-effective rate. The current review emphasizes the potential of high-resolution satellite images for mapping and analysis of water resources at Tarai region of Uttarakhand.},

Abstract = {Lake water quality monitoring has the potential to be improved through integrating detailed spatial information from new generation remote sensing satellites with high frequency observations from in situ optical sensors (WISPstation). We applied this approach for Lake Trasimeno with the aim of increasing knowledge of phytoplankton dynamics at different temporal and spatial scales. High frequency chlorophyll-a data from the WISPstation was modeled using non-parametric multiplicative regression. The `day of year' was the most important factor, reflecting the seasonal progression of a phytoplankton bloom from July to September. In addition, weather factors such as the east-west wind component were also significant in predicting phytoplankton seasonal and diurnal patterns. Sentinel 3-OLCI and Sentinel 2-MSI satellites delivered 42 images in 2018 that successfully mapped the spatial and seasonal change in chlorophyll-a. The potential influence of localized inflows in contributing to increased chlorophyll-a in mid-summer was visualized. The satellite data also allowed an estimation of quality status at a much finer scale than traditional manual methods. Good correspondence was found with manually collected field data but more significantly, the greatly increased spatial and temporal resolution provided by satellite and WISPstation sensors clearly offers an unprecedented resource in the research and management of aquatic resources.},

Title = {Detecting turbid plumes from satellite remote sensing: State-of-art thresholds and the novel PLUMES algorithm},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {Turbid coastal plumes carry sediments, nutrients, and pollutants. Satellite remote sensing is an effective tool for studying water quality parameters in these turbid plumes while covering a wide range of hydrological and meteorological conditions. However, determining boundaries of turbid coastal plumes poses a challenge. Traditionally, thresholds are the approach of choice for plume detection as they are simple to implement and offer fast processing (especially important for large datasets). However, thresholds are site-specific and need to be re-adjusted for different datasets or when meteorological and hydrodynamical conditions differ. This study compares state-of-the-art threshold approaches with a novel algorithm (PLUMES) for detecting turbid coastal plumes from satellite remote sensing, tested for Patos Lagoon, Brazil. PLUMES is a semi-supervised, and spatially explicit algorithm, and does not assume a unique plume boundary. Results show that the thresholds and PLUMES approach each provide advantages and limitations. Compared with thresholds, the PLUMES algorithm can differentiate both low or high turbidity plumes from the ambient background waters and limits detection of coastal resuspension while automatically retrieving metrics of detected plumes (e.g., area, mean intensity, core location). The study highlights the potential of the PLUMES algorithm for detecting turbid coastal plumes from satellite remote sensing products, which can have significantly positive implications for coastal management. However, PLUMES, despite its demonstrated effectiveness in this study, has not yet been applied to other study sites.},

Abstract = {The surplus of phosphorus leads to water eutrophication. Huge input of fertilizers in agricultural activities enriches nutrition in soil. The superfluous nutrient moves easily to riparian water by rainfall and surface runoff; leads to water eutrophication of riparian wetlands and downstream water; and consequently affects ecological balance. Thus it is significant to investigate the risk of phosphorus loss in agricultural land, to identify high concentration areas and guide the management of nutrition loss. This study was implemented mainly in the area of agricultural use in southern Western Australia, where a three-year period preliminary monitoring of water quality showed that the concentration of different forms of phosphorus in water had far exceeded the standard. Due to the large scale surface runoff caused by occasional storms in Western Australia, soil erosion was selected as the main driving factor for the loss of phosphorus. Remote sensing and ground truth data were used to reflect the seasonal changes of plants. The spatial distribution of available phosphorus was then predicted and combined with the evaluation matrix to evaluate the loss risk of phosphorus. This evaluation was based on quantitative rather than qualitative data to make better precision. It could help making decision support for monitoring water quality of rivers and riparian wetlands.},

Abstract = {The pristine aquatic ecosystems in the Himalayas are facing an ever increasing threat from various anthropogenic pressures which necessitate better understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of pollutants, their sources, and possible remedies. This study demonstrates the multi-disciplinary approach utilizing the multivariate statistical techniques, data from remote sensing, lab, and field-based observations for assessing the impact of massive land system changes on water quality of the river Jhelum. Land system changes over a period of 38 years have been quantified using multi-spectral satellite data to delineate the extent of different anthropogenically driven land use types that are the main non-point sources of pollution. Fifteen water quality parameters, at 12 sampling sites distributed uniformly along the length of the Jhelum, have been assessed to identify the possible sources of pollution. Our analysis indicated that 18 \% of the forested area has degraded into sparse forest or scrublands from 1972 to 2010, and the areas under croplands have decreased by 24 \% as people shifted from irrigation-intensive agriculture to orchard farming while as settlements showed a 397 \% increase during the observation period. One-way ANOVA revealed that all the water quality parameters had significant spatio-temporal differences (p < 0.01). Cluster analysis (CA) helped us to classify all the sampling sites into three groups. Factor analysis revealed that 91.84 \% of the total variance was mainly explained by five factors. Drastic changes in water quality of the Jhelum since the past three decades are manifested by increases in nitrate-nitrogen, TDS, and electric conductivity. The especially high levels of nitrogen (858 +/- 405 mu gL(-1)) and phosphorus (273 +/- 18 mu gL(-1)) in the Jhelum could be attributed to the reckless application of fertilizers, pesticides, and unplanned urbanization in the area.},

Abstract = {The traditional in-situ water quality monitoring methods that are normally used in Africa are complex with low spatial and temporal coverage. This results in inadequate estimation of the conditions in water bodies. These methods are also time consuming and expensive. However, the quality of inland water bodies in Africa continuous to deteriorate rapidly in varying degrees due to the enormous anthropogenic pressure on these water bodies. This has made water quality issues one of the crucial challenges to water management in Africa. Hence, there is the need for improved water quality monitoring techniques to ensure effective monitoring which is critical for water management and sustainability. Fortunately, remote sensing (RS) technique is a potential tool for monitoring inland water quality and other environmental phenomena. This technique provides efficient monitoring because it offers an opportunity for data collection on systematic, synoptic and temporal scales. The present study sought to assess the feasibility of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) RS technique in the effective monitoring of inland water quality in Africa. Specifically, a simplified step-by-step approach for the quantification of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in water bodies using the Integrated Land and Water Information System was presented. The study showed that water leaving reflectance (WLR) could be determined after a series of processes that included atmospheric correction. Once the WLR have been obtained, appropriate models could be employed to retrieve the spatial distribution of the concerned water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a. For instance, the present study adopted the radiative transfer model to illustrate the retrieval of the spatial distribution of SPM concentrations. It was found that for SPM retrieval in inland water bodies, it is recommended to use band 2 for the ASTER data processing. This is because this band is where the sensitivity to suspended sediment concentration is high, while effects e.g. by chlorophyll and organic particles are limited. It must be emphasized that the focus on ASTER RS techniques used in this study lies in the fact that the high spatial resolution of ASTER has advantages for studying small aquatic areas, such as bay and lakes. This makes it highly applicable for the situation in Africa. It was evident in this study that ASTER RS is feasible in ensuring proper water quality monitoring in Africa. Hence, this technique could be taken as an independent measurement tool for effective water management in Africa and other parts of the world with similar challenges.},

Abstract = {Transboundary water sharing policy between Pakistan and Afghanistan along with emerging issues over the Transboundary Kabul River have been discussed incorporating long-term hydrological trend analysis, water quality issues and temporal changes in land cover/land use. The annual (1977-2015) mean river flow of 26.32 billion (109) cubic metres (BCM) with a range of 13.77 to 42.2 BCM and standard deviation of 6.026 BCM revealed no significant trend in annual inflow data of the Kabul River. Afghanistan planned developments in the basin were analysed in the light of reduction in the transboundary flow. Faecal coliforms, pH (7.90 to 8.06), Escherichia coli and other water quality parameters were found to be within permissible limits, however, dissolved oxygen was just above the permissible limits to sustain aquatic life. Water was found unsuitable for drinking while suitable for agriculture and aquatic life. Remote sensing data used for temporal change detection showed an increase in built-up-areas and cultivated areas along Kabul River inside Pakistan by 50 and 47\%, respectively. Significant changes were observed at two locations in the river course. Insights of emerging Kabul River issues and a way forward have been discussed which could serve as the basis for formulation of adaption strategies leading to a `Kabul River Water Treaty'.},

Title = {A ground-based remote sensing system for high-frequency and real-time monitoring of phytoplankton blooms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {439},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {The worldwide expansion of phytoplankton blooms has severely threatened water quality, food webs, habitat stability and human health. Due to the rapidity of phytoplankton migration and reproduction, high-frequency information on phytoplankton bloom dynamics is crucial for their forecasting, treatment, and management. While several approaches involving satellites, in situ observations and automated underwater monitoring stations have been widely used in the past several decades, they cannot fully provide high-frequency and continuous observations of phytoplankton blooms at low cost and with high accuracy. Thus, we propose a novel ground -based remote sensing system (GRSS) that can monitor real-time chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla) in inland waters with a high frequency. The GRSS mainly consists of three platforms: the spectral measurement platform, the data-processing platform, and the remote access control, display and storage platform. The GRSS is capable of obtaining a remote sensing irradiance ratio (R(lambda)) of 400-1000 nm at a high frequency of 20 s. Eight different Chla retrieval algorithms were calibrated and validated using a dataset of 481 pairs of GRSS R(lambda) and in situ Chla measurements collected from four inland waters. The results showed that random forest regression achieved the best performance in deriving Chla (R-2 = 0.95, root mean square error = 13.40 mu g/L, and mean relative error = 25.7\%). The GRSS successfully captured two typical phytoplankton bloom events in August 2021 with rapid changes in Chla from 20 mu g/L to 325 mu g/L at the minute level, highlighting the critical role that this GRSS can play in the high-frequency monitoring of phytoplankton blooms. Although the algorithm embedded into the GRSS may be limited by the size of the training dataset, the high-frequency, continuous and real-time data acquisition capabilities of the GRSS can effectively compensate for the limitations of traditional observations. The initial application demonstrated that the GRSS can capture rapid changes of phytoplankton blooms in a short time and thus will play a critical role in phytoplankton bloom management. From a broader perspective, this approach can be extended to other carriers, such as aircraft, ships and unmanned aerial vehicles, to achieve the networked monitoring of phytoplankton blooms.},

Title = {Determination of inactive water quality variables by MODIS data: A case study in the Kizilirmak Delta-Balik Lake, Turkey},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {260},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {This study aims to apply Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to monitor water quality parameters of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in Balik Lake since TP and TN are important factors for eutrophication as well as it is essential to monitor TP and TN concentrations accurately for the management of water environments. Water chemical variables, including TN and TP, are soluble and optically inactive. For such a purpose, remote sensing (RS) enables an alternative way to monitor the optical activity of water with some limitations. In this study, TN and TP concentrations of Balik Lake are examined by RS data. The artificial neural networking (ANN) model was used to reveal the relation between the reflectance bands of MODIS along with the water quality parameters of TP and TN concentrations in aquatic environments by utilizing ground truth water samples collected concurrently with the MODIS overpass. The dataset used in the study consists of MODIS Aqua bands from 1 to 7 and ground truth observations of TP and TN from the study area of Balik Lake during 2017-2019. The development and testing of a feedforward back-propagation multilayer perceptron artificial neural network were performed by using the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm to predict TP and TN. The accuracy of the ANN model was determined to be relatively higher in the testing stage of TP prediction with R = 0.59 for Model-1 (3-10-1) and R = 0.56 for Model-2 (7-10-1) while it is lower in the testing stage of TN prediction with R = 0.36 for Model-1 and Model-2. The findings of this study indicated that the reflectance bands of MODIS have a moderate potential to monitor the solubility variables of the water quality for the management of the lake. However, the ANN model introduced in this study is expected to ensure an improvement in the prediction accuracy of inactive water quality variables based on the RS data.},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, the increased spectral and spatial resolution of remote sensing equipment has promoted the investigation of new techniques for inland and coastal water monitoring. The availability of new high-resolution data has allowed improvements in models based on the radiative transfer theory for assessing optical water quality parameters. In this study, we fine-tuned a physical model for the highly turbid Venice lagoon waters and developed an inversion technique based on a two-step optimization procedure appropriate for hyperspectral data processing to retrieve water constituent concentrations from remote data. In the first step, the solution of a linearized analytical formulation of the radiative transfer equations was found. In the second step, this solution was used to provide the initial values in a non-linear least squares-based method. This effort represents a first step in the construction of a feasible and timely methodology for Venice lagoon water quality monitoring by remote sensing, especially in view of the existing experimental hyperspectral satellite (Hyperion) and the future missions such as PRISMA, EnMap and HyspIRI. The optical properties of the water constituents were assessed on the basis of sea/lagoon campaigns and data from the literature. The water light field was shaped by an analytical formulation of radiative transfer equations and the application of numerical simulations (Hydrolight software). Once the optical properties of the Venice lagoon bio-optical model were validated, the inverse procedure was applied to local radiometric spectra to retrieve concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter and tripton. The inverse procedure was validated by comparing these concentrations with those measured in the laboratory from in situ water samples, then it was applied to airborne (CAST and MMS) and satellite (Hyperion) sensors to derive water constituent concentration maps. The consistent results encourage the use of this procedure using future missions satellite (PRISMA, EnMap and HyspIRl). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60 (Integrated River Basin Management for Europe) establishes the importance of preserving water quality through policies applied at watershed level given the strong links existing among ecological, hydrological, and hydrogeological systems. Therefore, monitoring campaigns of river water quality should be planned with multidisciplinary approaches starting from a landscape perspective. In this paper, the effects of the basin hydrology on the river water quality and, in particular, the impacts caused by the runoff production coming from agricultural areas are investigated. The fluvial segments receiving consistent amount of pollutant loads (due to the runoff routing over agricultural areas) are assumed more critical in terms of water quality and thus, they require more accurate controls. Starting from this perspective, to evaluate the runoff productions coming from agricultural areas, we applied a semi-distributed hydrological model that adopts satellite data, pedological and morphological information for the watershed description. Then, the river segments receiving critical amount of runoff loads from the surrounding cultivated areas were identified. Finally, in order to validate the approach, water quality for critical and non critical segment was investigated seasonally, by using river macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality because of their effectiveness in preserving in time a memory of pollution events. Biomonitoring data showed that river water quality strongly decreases in correspondence of fluvial segments receiving critical amount of runoff coming from agricultural areas. The results highlight the usefulness of such a methodology to plan monitoring campaigns specifically devoted to non-point pollution sources and suggest the possibility to use this approach for water quality management and for planning river restoration policies.},

Title = {Modelling of Acid Mine Drainage in Open Pit Lakes Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series: A Case Study from Lusatia, Germany},
Journal = {MINERALS},

Abstract = {Strong acid mine drainage (AMD) processes in the flooded, formerly open pits in the Lusatia area present an enormous environmental challenge for the rehabilitation of the post-mining landscape. Extensive and costly monitoring is required for optimal AMD management and remediation planning and control. Because of the large size of the area and the dimension of the problem, the regular sampling can only provide limited point data, which needs to be extrapolated to the entire area. Consequently, the search for effective approaches for extrapolating the point data to the area of all water bodies is essential for rehabilitation success monitoring and for understanding the dependencies between AMD and environmental factors such as land use, weather conditions, geology, and hydrogeology. The main aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the quantitative mapping of acid mine drainage (AMD) constituents, such as dissolved iron, pH value, and sulfate in large water bodies, for an area of approximately 7220 km(2) (the area of the pit lakes is about 185 km(2)). Correlations between different chemical water parameters were also investigated. An extensive water monitoring dataset was used to train artificial neural networks for the identification of dependencies between the multispectral remote sensing data and the water quality ground measurements. Respective relationships have been identified, especially for dissolved iron and pH. These trained ANNs have been used to produce water quality maps with high spatial (10 x 10 m) and temporal (any cloud-free period) resolution, which show the wide variability of water quality in the different parts of the mining region. Concrete sources of AMD can be identified using the water quality maps of single lakes, and the success of sanitation measures such as liming was visualized. The approach opens many doors for the optimization of both the monitoring program and sanitation technology.},

Abstract = {Effective water quality management requires careful consideration of pollutant fate and transport, proper estimation of non-point source loadings, and maximum allowable allocation of point source discharges. A decision support system (DSS) that addresses all these issues is developed in this study by embedding mass-balance expressions, GIS, and a remote-sensing-based non-point source loading scheme into a hybrid goal-programming approach and is applied to the rapidly growing Arroyo Colorado River watershed along the US-Mexico border. The model components were favorably evaluated against field data and previous studies. The DSS was used to evaluate the carrying capacity of the river, defined based on the water quality standards for biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and minimum in-stream flow requirements. The results indicated that on a macro-scale, the current stresses utilize about 40 \% of the maximum carrying capacity. However, the most upstream and downstream sub-watersheds are currently over stressed and need to reduce their loadings. The assimilative capacity of the river is not sufficient to carry current flows at their permitted discharge concentrations implying an inequity among discharges with regard to treatment cost burden. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the carrying capacity was more affected by policy choices made for water quality standards then where they were to be enforced (i.e., compliance locations). Urban areas currently cover 13 \% of the watershed but contribute nearly 45 \% of the total non-point source loadings. Therefore, the urbanization in this watershed must be carefully planned with emphasis on stormwater treatment and management to sustain this valuable resource for future generations.},

Abstract = {Interactions among global change stressors and their effects at large scales are often proposed, but seldom evaluated. This situation is primarily due to lack of comprehensive, sufficiently long-term, and spatially extensive datasets. Seagrasses, which provide nursery habitat, improve water quality, and constitute a globally important carbon sink, are among the most vulnerable habitats on the planet. Here, we unite 31 years of high-resolution aerial monitoring and water quality data to elucidate the patterns and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera marina) abundance in Chesapeake Bay, USA, one of the largest and most valuable estuaries in the world, with an unparalleled history of regulatory efforts. We show that eelgrass area has declined 29\% in total since 1991, with wide-ranging and severe ecological and economic consequences. We go on to identify an interaction between decreasing water clarity and warming temperatures as the primary drivers of this trend. Declining clarity has gradually reduced eelgrass cover the past two decades, primarily in deeper beds where light is already limiting. In shallow beds, however, reduced visibility exacerbates the physiological stress of acute warming, leading to recent instances of decline approaching 80\%. While degraded water quality has long been known to influence underwater grasses worldwide, we demonstrate a clear and rapidly emerging interaction with climate change. We highlight the urgent need to integrate a broader perspective into local water quality management, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the many other coastal systems facing similar stressors.},

Title = {Remote sensing to detect harmful algal blooms in inland waterbodies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {851},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are an issue of concern for water management worldwide. As such, effective monitoring strategies of HAB spatio-temporal variability in waterbodies are needed. Remote sensing has become an increasingly important tool for HAB detection and monitoring in large lakes. However, accurate HAB detection in small-medium waterbodies via satellite data remains a challenge. Current barriers include the waterbody size, the limited freely available high resolution satellite data, and the lack of field calibration data. To test the applicability of remote sensing for detecting HABs in small-medium waterbodies, three satellites (Planetscope, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) were used to understand how spatial resolution, the availability of spectral bands, and the waterbody size itself effect HAB detection skill. Different algorithms and a non-parametric method, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), were tested. Curvature Around Red and NIR minus Red had the best HAS detection skill of the 20 existing algorithms that were tested. Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 were the best satellites for HAS detection in small to medium waterbodies. The most critical attribute for detecting HABs were the available satellite bands, which determine the detection algorithms that can be used. Importantly, algorithm performance was mostly unrelated to waterbody size. However, there remain some barriers in utilizing satellite data for HAB detection, including algae dynamics, macrophyte cover within the waterbody, weather effects, and the correction models for satellite data. Moreover, it is important to consider the match time between satellite overpass and sampling activities for calibration. Given these challenges, integrating regular sampling activities and remote sensing is recommended for monitoring and managing small-medium waterbodies.},

Abstract = {Multi-model approach for remote sensing data processing and interpretation is described. The problem of satellite data utilization in multi-modeling approach for socio-ecological risks assessment is formally defined. Observation, measurement and modeling data utilization method in the framework of multi-model approach is described. Methodology and models of risk assessment in framework of decision support approach are defined and described. Method of water quality assessment using satellite observation data is described. Method is based on analysis of spectral reflectance of aquifers. Spectral signatures of freshwater bodies and offshores are analyzed. Correlations between spectral reflectance, pollutions and selected water quality parameters are analyzed and quantified. Data of MODIS, MISR, AIRS and Landsat sensors received in 2002-2014 have been utilized verified by in-field spectrometry and lab measurements. Fuzzy logic based approach for decision support in field of water quality degradation risk is discussed. Decision on water quality category is making based on fuzzy algorithm using limited set of uncertain parameters. Data from satellite observations, field measurements and modeling is utilizing in the framework of the approach proposed. It is shown that this algorithm allows estimate water quality degradation rate and pollution risks. Problems of construction of spatial and temporal distribution of calculated parameters, as well as a problem of data regularization are discussed. Using proposed approach, maps of surface water pollution risk from point and diffuse sources are calculated and discussed.},

Title = {A New Method for Spatial Estimation of Water Quality Using an Optimal Virtual Sensor Network and In Situ Observations: A Case Study of Chemical Oxygen Demand},

Abstract = {Accurate water quality estimation is important for water environment monitoring and water resource management and has emerged as a pivotal aspect of ecological rehabilitation and sustainable development. However, due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of water quality parameters, it is still challenging to obtain highly accurate spatial patterns of them. Taking chemical oxygen demand as an example, this study proposes a novel estimation method for generating highly accurate chemical oxygen demand fields in Poyang Lake. Specifically, based on the different water levels and monitoring sites in Poyang Lake, an optimal virtual sensor network was first established. A Taylor expansion-based method with integration of spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity was developed by considering environmental factors, the optimal virtual sensor network, and existing monitoring stations. The proposed approach was evaluated and compared with other approaches using a leave-one cross-validation process. Results show that the proposed method exhibits good performance in estimating chemical oxygen demand fields in Poyang Lake, with mean absolute error improved by 8\% and 33\%, respectively, on average, when compared with classical interpolators and remote sensing methods. In addition, the applications of virtual sensors improve the performance of the proposed method, with mean absolute error and root mean squared error values reduced by 20\% to 60\% over 12 months. The proposed method provides an effective tool for estimating highly accurate spatial fields of chemical oxygen demand concentrations and could be applied to other water quality parameters.},

Title = {Data Integration for Investigating Drivers of Water Quality Variability in the Banja Reservoir Watershed},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is increasingly important to know the water quality of a reservoir, given the prospect of an environment poor in water reserves, which are based on intense and short-lived precipitation events. In this work, vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI) and bio-physical parameters of the vegetation (LAI, FC), meteorological variables, and hydrological data are considered as possible drivers of the spatial and temporal variability of water quality (WQ) of the Banja reservoir (Albania). Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images are analyzed to derive WQ parameters and vegetation properties, while the HYPE model provides hydrological variables. Timeseries of the considered variables are examined using graphical and statistical methods and correlations among the variables are computed for a five-year period (2016-2022). The added-value of integrating earth observation derived data is demonstrated in the analysis of specific time periods or precipitation events. Significant positive correlations are found between water turbidity and hydrological parameters such as river discharge or runoff (0.55 and 0.40, respectively), while negative correlations are found between water turbidity and vegetation descriptors (-0.48 to -0.56). The possibility of having easy-to-use tools (e.g., web portal) for the analysis of multi-source data in an interactive way, facilitates the planning of hydroelectric plants management operations.},

Abstract = {Lakes are very important in freshwater supply. At present, most of the lakes in the world are suffering from eutrophication with industrialization, economic growth, and human activities. Frequent monitoring and integrated management are necessary for lakes. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is the important indicator of phytoplankton and water quality. However, conventional methods for monitoring chl-a in lakes will waste more manpower and material resources and can't provide water quality information of the whole lake. Remote sensing technique is suitable to obtain spatial and temporal information quickly and frequently, and it will be widely applied in water quality monitoring for lakes in future because of its advantage of efficiency and long-term dynamic monitoring. The images covering the Tai Lake for the study are TM of 1991-07-23 and ETM+ of 2001-07-26. The chlorophyll-a concentration has been extracted from the two-period images of the Tai Lake based on a statistical model and the spatial distribution maps with three levels based on chlorophyll-a concentration have been made to display the distribution regularity of concentration.},

Abstract = {At present, owing to the advanced remote sensing technology, a great lot of marine raster data has been acquired. With the marine data's keep-rising, it turns out more and more necessary to be organized, managed and displayed data effectively so as to serve people's daily life and production. The current methods are difficult to storage and management of the massive data efficient. And there are lots of problems with the raster data publication on the network because of its features such as massiveness, real-time and variety. In this paper, after analyzing the related technologies of raster spatial database engine, WebGIS and J2EE, a three-tier-structured real-time publication system of massive marine remote sensing data is put forward. This system has been made available to users to browse, query, analyze, download, and manage of marine remote sensing data efficiently. It was used throughout the marine water quality real-time inspecting project on Zhejiang Province of China.},

Abstract = {There are a multitude of satellite-derived water clarity and turbidity indicators to support the decision making of environmental managers and policy makers. However, water quality dynamic ranges addressed by these indicators can differ significantly, subjecting non-expert users to potential pitfalls. Here we propose a satellite water clarity-turbidity index (CTI) as a simplified way to capture major changes in water clarity/turbidity across all water types in the Great Lakes. The CTI is defined to merge key information from three prerequisite variables derived from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements, namely, the Secchi disk depth, the particulate backscattering coefficient, and the nephelometric turbidity, which are suitable for clear, intermediate, and turbid waters, respectively. Application to the Great Lakes shows that with one parameter, the CTI can illustrate major spatial and temporal patterns that are not entirely visible with each of the three original indicators alone. Using the CTI, we identified significant decrease in water turbidity in Lakes Michigan and Huron from 2000 to 2005, during which daily variability of CTI in August initially spiked and then gradually decreased most likely owing to diminishing whiting events. The CTI is a convenient and holistic assessment tool for water quality management. (c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Remote sensing of cyanobacterial blooms in a hypertrophic lagoon (Albufera of Valencia, Eastern Iberian Peninsula) using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {698},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Eutrophy in Albufera of Valencia (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) is a quite old problem since after the intense eutrophication processes throughout the 1960s. The system shifted to a turbid stable state consolidated by the virtual disappearance of macrophytes by the early 1970s. The lagoon has been studied extensively since the 1980s, but efforts to revert the system to a dear state have not yielded the expected results because cultural eutrophication due to the growth of population in its area of influence and the effects of climate change, decreasing rainfall and increasing evaporation. This has driven to an increase in water retention times in the lagoon in recent years, resulting in a phytoplanktonic shift towards potentially toxic cyanobacteria species, often forming blooms. Cyanobacterial blooms severely affect water quality for human use, ranging from recreation and fishing to drinking water resources, as indicated in the surveillance protocol of World Health Organization (WHO). The current state of the lake requires constant monitoring and remote sensing is an optimal tool for the continuous monitoring of the whole water mass. This work is included in the ESAQS project (Ecological Status of AQuatic systems with Sentinel satellites), to establish a protocol for regular and frequent monitoring of the ecological status of reservoirs, lakes and lagoons. Algorithms are developed using the images provided by the Sentinel-2 (A and B), provided with a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal frequency of 5 days. In this work we demonstrate that using this new earth observation satellite is possible to develop a consistent and suitable algorithm to estimate the phycocyanin concentration {[}PC) and establish a protocol for regular and frequent monitoring. Calibrating (R-2 = 0.841; n = 21; p < 0.001) and validating (R-2 = 0.775: n = 55; p < 0.001; RMSE\% = 40) the algorithm with field data are also demonstrated. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Use of the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Satellites for Water Quality Monitoring: An Early Warning Tool in the Mar Menor Coastal Lagoon},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {During recent years, several eutrophication processes and subsequent environmental crises have occurred in Mar Menor, the largest hypersaline coastal lagoon in the Western Mediterranean Sea. In this study, the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites are jointly used to examine the evolution of the main water quality descriptors during the latest ecological crisis in 2021, resulting in an important loss of benthic vegetation and unusual mortality events affecting different aquatic species. Several field campaigns were carried out in March, July, August, and November 2021 to measure water quality variables over 10 control points. The validation of satellite biogeochemical variables against on-site measurements indicates precise results of the water quality algorithms with median errors of 0.41 mg/m(3) and 2.04 FNU for chlorophyll-a and turbidity, respectively. The satellite preprocessing scheme shows consistent performance for both satellites; therefore, using them in tandem can improve mapping strategies. The findings demonstrate the suitability of the methodology to capture the spatiotemporal distribution of turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration at 10-30 m spatial resolution on a systematic basis and in a cost-effective way. The multitemporal products allow the identification of the main critical areas close to the mouth of the Albujon watercourse and the beginning of the eutrophication process with chlorophyll-a concentration above 3 mg/m(3). These innovative tools can support decision makers in improving current monitoring strategies as early warning systems for timely assistance during these ecological disasters, thus preventing detrimental conditions in the lagoon.},

Journal = {RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS},

Abstract = {Calibration and validation are two important steps in the application of sediment models requiring observed data. This study aims to investigate the potential use of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water quality and remote sensing data to calibrate and validate a large-scale sediment model. Observed data from across 108 stations located in the Doce River basin was used for the period between 1997-2010. Ten calibration and validation experiments using the MOCOM-UA optimization algorithm coupled with the MGB-SED model were carried out, which, over the same period of time, resulted in 37 calibration and 111 validation tests. The experiments were performed by modifying metrics, spatial discretization, observed data and parameters of the MOCOM-UA algorithm. Results generally demonstrated that the values of correlation presented slight variations and were superior in the calibration step. Additionally, increasing spatial discretization or establishing a background concentration for the model allowed for improved results. In a station with high quantity of SSC data, calibration improved the ENS coefficient from -0.44 to 0.44. The experiments showed that the spectral surface reflectance, total suspended solids and turbidity data have the potential to enhance the performance of sediment models.},

Title = {Evaluation of remote sensing techniques-based water quality monitoring for sustainable hydrological applications: an integrated FWZIC-VIKOR modelling approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 13},
Abstract = {Evaluating remote sensing techniques (RST)-based water quality monitoring systems in hydrological applications is a complex multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem due to several integrated issues. These issues include the need to consider 15 evaluation criteria, the importance of these criteria in relation to their application and network infrastructure, data variation, and trade-offs and conflicts between them. Therefore, this study proposes an MADM integrated modelling approach to weight these criteria and rank the selected RSTs using the ``Fuzzy Weighted with Zero Inconsistency{''} (FWZIC) method coupled with the ``Vlse-kriterijumska Optimizcija I Kaompromisno Resenje{''} (VIKOR) method. First, a decision matrix was developed for the evaluation criteria and their intersection with various RSTs in different network categories. Next, the assessment criteria were weighted using FWZIC, followed by ranking the RSTs for each category using VIKOR. The findings reveal that the criteria weighting varied across categories, as assigned by specialists-based FWZIC. For example, the ``data acquisition system complexity{''} criterion received the maximum weight (w = 0.081) for mesh-based sensing and the lowest (w = 0.057) for cellular-based sensing. Using the obtained weights and based on the ascending order of the performance score value (Q), various RSTs were benchmarked using VIKOR. This includes (n = 22) RSTs in fixed star, (n = 8) RSTs in mesh sensing, (n = 6) RSTs in cellular sensing, (n = 3) RSTs in fixed cable sensing, and (n = 2) RSTs in movable sensing. Finally, the evaluation process for the benchmarked RSTs involved systematic ranking, sensitivity analysis, and comparison analysis, which confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach across all RST categories.},

Abstract = {Nowadays remote sensing plays a very important role in many different study fields, i.e. environmental studies, hydrology, mineralogy, ecosystem studies, etc. One of the key areas of remote sensing applications is water quality monitoring. Understanding and monitoring of the water quality parameters and detecting different water contaminants is an important issue in water management and protection of whole environment and especially the water ecosystem. There are many remote sensing methods to monitor water quality and detect water pollutants. One of the most widely used method for substance detection with remote sensing techniques is based on usage of spectral reflectance coefficients. They are usually acquired using discrete methods such as spectrometric measurements. These however can be very time consuming, therefore image-based methods are used more and more often. In order to work out the proper methodology of obtaining spectral reflectance coefficients from hyperspectral and multispectral images, it is necessary to verify the impact of cameras radiometric resolution on the accuracy of determination of them. This paper presents laboratory experiments that were conducted using two monochromatic XEVA video sensors (400-1700nm spectral data registration) with two different radiometric resolutions (12 and 14 bits). In view of determining spectral characteristics from images, the research team used set of interferometric filters. All data collected with multispectral digital video cameras were compared with spectral reflectance coefficients obtained with spectroradiometer. The objective of this research is to find the impact of cameras radiometric resolution on reflectance values in chosen wavelength. The main topic of this study is the analysis of accuracy of spectral coefficients from sensors with different radiometric resolution. By comparing values collected from images acquired with XEVA sensors and with the curves obtained with spectroradiometer it's possible to determine accuracy of image-based spectral reflectance coefficients and decide which sensor will be more accurate to determine them for protection of water aquatic environment purpose.},

Abstract = {Forest fires, soil erosion, and land use changes in watersheds nearby Lake Mead and inflows from Las Vegas Wash into the lake are considered as sources of the lake's water quality impairment. These conditions result in higher concentration of Total Organic Carbon (TOC). TOC in contact with Chlorine which is often used for disinfection purposes of drinking water supply causes the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs). THM is one of the toxic carcinogens controlled by the EPA's disinfection by-product rule. As a result of the threat posed to the drinking water used by the 25 million people downstream, recreational area, and wildlife habitat of Lake Mead, it is necessary to develop a method for near real-time monitoring of TOC in this area. Monitoring through a limited number of ground-based monitoring stations on a weekly/monthly basis is insufficient to capture both spatial and temporal variations of water quality changes. In this study, the multi-sensor remote sensing technology linking those ground-based TOC analyzers and two satellites with the aid of data fusion and mining techniques provides us with near real time information about the spatiotemporal distribution of TOC for the entire lake on a daily basis. A data fusion method was applied to bridge the gap of poor 250/500m spatial resolution for the land bands of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imageries with the 30 m enhanced spatial resolution of Landsat's imageries which suffers from long overpass of 16 days. Consequently, near-real time Integrated Multi-sensor Fusion and Mining (IDFM) techniques produce synthetic fused images of MODIS and Landsat satellites with both high spatial and temporal resolution in order to create near-real time TOC distribution maps updated by ground-based TOC analyzers and lead to sustainable water quality management with the aid of IDFM in Lake Mead watershed.},

Title = {Predicting basin water quality using source-sink landscape distribution metrics in the Danjiangkou Reservoir of China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Land use and land cover changes due to human development are a concern for water-resource managers as they increase the spread of non-point source pollution to rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, impacting the quality of freshwater resources. Danjiangkou Reservoir is the largest inter-regional water transfer project in China and provides water services to cities along the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project and Beijing. Hence, watershed management decisions that may affect the water quality of the reservoir are particularly important. This study investigated the land use and land cover of a typical agricultural basin near the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The basin was divided into 13 sub-basins and the water quality was sampled six times during 2018 to determine the water quality index (WQI) for each sub-basin. The land use type and digital elevation model of each sub-basin were derived from remote-sensing data and then used to determine source-sink landscape distribution metrics; including the flow accumulation index (FAI), location-weighted landscape contrast index (LWLI), and landscape capacity distribution index (LCDI). Correlation and regression analysis were then used to compare these indices with the WQI. The WQI had a significant negative correlation with both the LWLI and LCDI, and a weak correlation with the FAI. Results indicated that the land use classification, proportion of source and sink landscape types, landscape flow path length, and landscape nutrient inputs were the main explanatory factors for river water quality in the basin. The biggest challenge in the research process is to obtain the parameters of landscape pattern index and its tedious calculation formula. The most successful part of the study is that it takes into account the flow path, roughness coefficient of land, nutrient input and other factors, more truly simulates the rainfall runoff process under natural conditions, and obtains better regression results between each evaluation index and water quality index. These findings show that remote-sensing data can be used in lieu of direct sampling to evaluate basin-water quality. Furthermore, these data can be used to predict the impact of future land use changes on water quality and facilitate more effective watershed management.},

Abstract = {Riparian buffer zone management is an area of increasing relevance as human modification of the landscape continues unabated. Land and water resource managers are continually challenged to maintain stream ecosystem integrity and water quality in the context of rapidly changing land use, which often offsets management gains. Approaches are needed not only to map vegetation cover in riparian zones, but also to monitor the changes taking place, target restoration activities, and assess the success of previous management actions. To date, these objectives have been difficult to meet using traditional techniques based on aerial photos and field visits, particularly over large areas. Recent advances in remote sensing have the potential to substantially aid buffer zone management. Very high resolution imagery is now available that allows detailed mapping and monitoring of buffer zone vegetation and provides a basis for consistent assessments using moderately high resolution remote sensing (e.g., Landsat). Laser-based remote sensing is another advance that permits even more detailed information on buffer zone properties, such as refined topographic derivatives and multidimensional vegetation structure. These sources of image data and map information are reviewed in this paper, examples of their application to riparian buffer mapping and stream health assessment are provided, and future prospects for improved buffer monitoring are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, in situ data and hyperspectral MIVIS (Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer) images collected over a period of 14 years were used to assess changes in submerged macrophytes colonization patterns in southern Lake Garda. Macrophytes colonization patterns were obtained converting the MIVIS at-sensor radiances into remote sensing reflectances and adopting a bio-optical model inversion technique. The inversion is performed by optimization techniques implemented within the software package BOMBER (Bio-Optical Model Based tool for Estimating water quality and bottom properties from Remote sensing images). The results show a considerable modification in terms of macrophyte structural complexity and colonized areas. The study indicates that macrophytes distribution along the littoral zone of the Sirmione Peninsula is certainly linked to water transparency and water level fluctuation.},

Abstract = {Frequent adjustment of the drinking water treatment process as a simultaneous response to climate variations, and the impact those variations have on water quality, has been a grand challenge in water resource management in recent years. An early warning system with the aid of satellite remote sensing and local sensor networks, which provides timely and quantitative knowledge to monitor the quality of water, may be a soluition to this challenge. The development of such an early warning system is addressed to discover and evaluate the severity in a discrete event mode in this paper. The early warning system in the current study is able to empower the urban water ifrastructure systems with the integration of advanced data science, environmental monitoring, computational intelligence, and satellite remote sensing data. By developing a graphical user interface, end-users who do not have knowledge or skill in the field of integrated sensing, monitoring, networking, modeling can take advantage of the user-friendly early warning system. Practical implementation of the proposed early warning system was assessed at the largest resrvoir, Lake Mead, in Las Vegas in the United States. It uniquely demonstrates how such a system can benefit the drinking water treatment plant throughout decision support actions via multi-sensor acquisition, data fusion, criteria mining and alarm trigerring.},

Abstract = {Global Earth Observation (GEO) is one of the most important sources of information for environmental resource management and disaster prevention. With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder-oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from `in situ' measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.

Title = {Spatiotemporal dynamics and anthropologically dominated drivers of chlorophyll-a, TN and TP concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary based on retrieval algorithm and random forest regression},

Abstract = {Estimation of large-scale and high-precision water quality parameters is critical in explaining the spatiotemporal dynamics and the driving factors of water quality variability, especially in areas with environmental complexity (e.g., crisscrossing waterways, high flood risk in rainy season and seawater invasion). Thus, in this study, a retrieval algorithm was developed to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) based on a large amount of in situ measurements and Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Random Forest (RF) machine learning was conducted to identify the relationship between environmental indicators (pH, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids and water temperature), Chla, TN and TP. The results showed that the NIR/R Binomial algorithm for Chl-a estimation presented appreciable reliability with R2 of 0.7429, root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.2089 and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 15.33\%. The water quality variation in the PRE showed a characteristic of overall improvement and regional deterioration with average concentrations of 7.28 mu g/L, 1.15 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L for Chl-a, TN, and TP respectively. Turbidity and pH were identified as the most important indicators to explain Chl-a (52.86\%, 39.91\%), TN (52.38\%, 40.57\%) and TP (55.23\%, 40.03\%) variation. Agricultural pollution was the main pollution source due to the intensive application of fertilizer and increased field size. Besides, land use patterns (e.g., increasing farmland but decreasing forest) greatly influenced water quality from 2010 to 2020. Moreover, light limitation caused by high turbidity reduced the algae productivity and further lowered the Chl-a concentration. The driving factors for regional water quality variations were anthropologically dominated and supplemented by climate change. This study improved the monitoring accuracy of regional water environment and provided quantitative early warning of water pollution events for environmental practitioners, so as to achieve long-term monitoring, precise pollution management and efficient water resources management.},

Abstract = {Compared to historical levels, the oyster population in North Carolina has remained low, especially when compared with neighboring regions (e.g., Virginia). Therefore, to enable efficient aquaculture siting for shellfish fisheries, accurate measurement information about the suitability for a targeted location is needed to promote efficient use of resources. Currently available commercial measurement products are often expensive, which limits the amount of measurement points that can be achieved for a given cost point. There are some software-based aquaculture siting tools available, but they are limited in accuracy and utility by the amount of available and current measurement data in a particular area. To help promote data driven decision making, additional measurements are desirable. An internet of things (IoT) approach has been used effectively in other sectors, such as agriculture. This paper presents a similar IoT approach for aquaculture via a proposed water quality monitoring system with design features that are targeted for aquaculture siting applications (i.e., shellfish fisheries). The current challenges associated with aquaculture siting applications are discussed with a survey of currently available resources (e.g., commercial measurement systems and siting tools). This work presents the design requirements for the proposed water quality monitoring system, the design features, and analysis of the design features that validates the design requirements are satisfied.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to accurately model relationships between spectral reflectance and water-quality parameters, including blue-green algae phycocyanin, chlorophyll a, total suspended solids, turbidity, and total dissolved solids; evaluate feature-level fusion to spectral data for water-quality modeling; and evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning regression techniques and decision-level fusion for water-quality variable prediction. We introduce the application of canonical correlation analysis fusion as a method for water-based spectral analysis to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data. Water-quality variables and spectral reflectance were used to create predictive models via machine learning regression models, including multiple linear regression, partial least-squares regression, Gaussian process regression, support vector machine regression, and extreme learning machine regression. The models were then combined using decision-level fusion. Results indicate that canonical correlation analysis feature-level fusion and machine learning techniques are superior to traditional methods.},

Abstract = {Citizen science is a promising way to increase temporal and spatial coverages of in-situ data, and to aid in data processing and analysis. In this paper, we present how citizen science can be used together with Earth observation, and demonstrate its value through three pilot projects focusing on forest biomass analysis, data management in emergencies and water quality monitoring. We also provide recommendations and ideas for follow-up activities. In the forest biomass analysis pilot, in the state of Durango (Mexico), local volunteers make in-situ forest inventory measurements with mobile devices. The collected data is combined with Landsat-8 imagery to derive forest biomass map of the area. The study area includes over 390 permanent sampling plots that will provide reference data for concept validation and verification. The emergency data management pilot focuses in the Philippines, in the areas affected by the typhoons Haiyan in November 2013 and Hagupit in December 2014. Data collected by emergency workers and citizens are combined with satellite data (Landsat-8, VHR if available) to intensify the disaster recovery activities and the coordination efforts. Simple processes for citizens, non-governmental organisations and volunteers are developed to find and utilize up to date and freely available satellite imagery for coordination purposes and for building new not-for-profit services in disaster situations. In the water quality monitoring pilot, citizens around the Baltic Sea area contribute to the algae situation awareness by collecting algae observations using a mobile application. In-situ observations are compared with surface algal bloom products based on the satellite imagery, e.g. Aqua MODIS images with 500 meter resolution. As an outcome, the usability of the citizen observations together with satellite data in the algae monitoring will be evaluated.},

Abstract = {In this chapter we address some of the recent developments in marine coastal remote sensing with regards to the evaluation of water quality from space usingmulti-temporal data. Most chapters in this book are devoted to terrestrial applications, whereas aquatic remote sensing requires a completely different approach in terms of mission and sensor design as well as data analysis and processing. Therefore, the first section is a general introduction to marine remote sensing. Then we report recent results from remote sensing of the Baltic Sea, which is optically dominated by the absorption of light by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and during summer months, by high standing stocks of filamentous cyanobacteria. Results both from basin-wide as well as coastal applications in the north-western Baltic Sea are presented. In next section we report results from the Bay of Biscay in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean west of France, which is an area highly influenced by river discharge and dinoflagellate blooms, and the subsequent section is about a coastal area in the eastern Beaufort Sea in the Arctic that's influenced by a pool of CDOM. In all sections we discuss the relevance of regional remote sensing for ecological analysis and coastal management. The chapter concludes with a synthesis on merging of satellite data from different ocean colour missions and the limitations for coastal applications are discussed.},

Title = {Assessing the value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs: An example from the Great Barrier Reef},

Abstract = {The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reef protection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5-10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {277-304},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to propose the use of a functional data analysis approach as an alternative to the classical statistical methods most commonly used in oceanography and water quality management. In particular we consider the prediction of total suspended solids (TSS) based on remote sensing (RS) data. For this purpose several functional linear regression models and classical non-functional regression models are applied to 10 years of RS data obtained from medium resolution imaging spectrometer sensor to predict the TSS concentration in the coastal zone of the Guadalquivir estuary. The results of functional and classical approaches are compared in terms of their mean square prediction error values and the superiority of the functional models is established. A simulation study has been designed in order to support these findings and to determine the best prediction model for the TSS parameter in more general contexts.},

Abstract = {Impervious surfaces (IS) produced by urbanization can facilitate pollutants' movement to nearby water bodies through stormwater. This study mapped and estimated the IS changes in Chattanooga, Tennessee, using satellite imagery acquired in 1986 and 2016. A model was developed utilizing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index coupled with density slicing to detect and map urbanization through IS growth. Urban growth was quantified at USGS HUC12 watershed level including stream riparian areas. The obtained results show a net growth of 45.12 km(2) of IS with a heterogeneous distribution. About 9.96 km(2) of this growth is within 90 m of streams, about 6\% of the study site's land cover. The Lower South Chickamauga Creek watershed experienced the largest urban growth with a change from 24.2 to 48.5 km(2). Using the riparian zone percent imperviousness, a stream risk assessment model was developed to evaluate potential stream impairment due to this growth. Approximately 87, 131, and 203 km lengths of streams identified as potentially at high, very high, and extreme risks, respectively, to be impaired due to urban growth from the last 30 years. These findings would benefit to proactively implement sustainable management plans for the streams near rapidly urbanizing areas in the study site.},

Title = {Baseline assessment of coastal water quality, in Vanuatu, South Pacific: Insights gained from in-situ sampling},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {160},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Nearshore deterioration of water quality in Pacific coastal waters is a growing problem, associated with increasing urban and industrial sewage discharges, and agricultural runoff. Published water quality studies in the Pacific region are limited in both number and scope, making it difficult to resolve the extent of the issue or quantify the variability of water quality across Pacific islands and countries. This study collected water quality measurements over three years in the coastal waters around the Island of Efate (Vanuatu) with majority of work carried out in Port Vila, its capital. Port Vila is the key urban centre for Vanuatu where the increasing population and pollution inputs are placing substantial pressure on the coastal environment. Highest concentrations of dissolved nutrients and suspended sediments were measured adjacent or near the urban drains that enter the coastal areas along the capital's seafront, highlighting many of the issues around anthropogenic inputs are linked to the increasing urbanisation in Port Vila Bay. We provide baseline data that explores variability of coastal water quality and these types of datasets for Pacific islands are a first step towards facilitating development of long-term monitoring programmes and informing coastal zone management decision making.},

Abstract = {Environmental security is an increasing issue in world affairs. Environmental security is the state of human-environment dynamics that includes restoration of the environment damaged by military actions, and amelioration of resource scarcities, environmental degradation and biological threats that could lead to social disorder and conflict NATO continues to list environmental security as among its most important priorities. Without greater measures to insure environmental security, continued population and economic growth will diminish natural life support systems leading to migration and conflict. With half the world clustering into urban environments, natural disasters and global environmental change affect greater numbers of people who are dependent on civil systems for water, power, transportation, food and other manufactured systems. Security for environment, water management and information is becoming major necessity due to terrorism and heighten level for the quality of human life. New advanced methodologies which are Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) important tool to determine and help to solve described problems to monitor environment for risk assessment and management are needed to meet new challenges including terrorist attacks. Some projects using remote sensing methods with satellite data and GIS software which are subjected to monitor water quality and urban chancing up to time at the drinking water basin and dam will be shown, giving examples on how this integration of multisource information works now and advise the new technologies in the near future.},

Title = {Application of satellite remote sensing in monitoring dissolved oxygen variabilities: A case study for coastal waters in Korea},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the critical parameters representing water quality in coastal environments. However, it is labor- and cost-intensive to maintain monitoring systems of DO since in situ measurements of DO are needed in high spatial and temporal resolution to establish proper management plans of coastal regions. In this study, we applied statistical analyses between long-term monitoring datasets and satellite remote sensing datasets in the eastern coastal region of the Yellow Sea. Pearson correlation analysis of long-term water quality monitoring datasets shows that water temperature and DO are highly correlated. Stepwise multiple regression analysis among DO and satellite-derived environmental variables shows that the in situ DO can be estimated by the combination of the present sea surface temperature (SST), the chlorophyll-a, and the SST in the month prior. The high skill score of our proposed model to derive DO is validated by two error measures, the Absolute Relative Error, 1-ARE (89.2\%), and Index of Agreement, IOA (78.6\%). By applying the developed model to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) products, spatial and temporal changes in satellite-derived DO can be observed in Saemangeum offshore in the Yellow Sea. The analysis results show that there is a significant decrease in estimated DO between summer of 2003 versus 2012 indicating summer coastal deoxygenation due probably to the Saemangeum reclamation. This study shows the potential capability of satellite remote sensing in monitoring in situ DO in both high temporal and spatial resolution, which will be beneficial for effective and efficient management of coastal environments.},

Abstract = {Suspended particulate matter concentration (C-SPM) is a key parameter describing case-II water quality. Empirical and semi-empirical models are frequently developed and applied for estimating C-SPM values from remote sensing images; however, they are usually region- or season-dependent. This study aimed to develop a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based retrieval model of C-SPM for Poyang and Dongting Lake together. The 89 C-SPM measurements in Poyang and Dongting Lake as well as their corresponding MODIS Terra images were used to calibrate C-SPM retrieval models, and the calibration results showed that the exponential models of MODIS red band and red minus shortwave infrared (SWIR) band at 1240 nm both explained about 76\% of the variation of C-SPM of Poyang and Dongting Lake together. When the two models were applied to the validation datasets, the results indicated that the exponential model of red band obtained more stable C-SPM estimations with no bias at a significance level of 0.05 in both lakes. The MODIS red-band-based model achieved acceptable results for estimating C-SPM in both Poyang and Dongting Lake, and it provided a foundation for obtaining comparable spatiotemporal information of C-SPM, which will be helpful for comparing, understanding, managing, and protecting the two aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {How Accurate Is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Data-Based Model Applied on Satellite Imagery for Chlorophyll-a Estimation in Freshwater Bodies?},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Optical sensors are increasingly sought to estimate the amount of chlorophyll a (chl\_a) in freshwater bodies. Most, whether empirical or semi-empirical, are data-oriented. Two main limitations are often encountered in the development of such models. The availability of data needed for model calibration, validation, and testing and the locality of the model developed-the majority need a re-parameterization from lake to lake. An Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data-based model for chl\_a estimation is developed in this work and tested on Sentinel-2 imagery without any re-parametrization. The Ensemble-based system (EBS) algorithm was used to train the model. The leave-one-out cross validation technique was applied to evaluate the EBS, at a local scale, where results were satisfactory (R-2 = Nash = 0.94 and RMSE = 5.6 mu g chl\_a L-1). A blind database (collected over 89 lakes) was used to challenge the EBS' Sentine-2-derived chl\_a estimates at a regional scale. Results were relatively less good, yet satisfactory (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE= 2.4 mu g chl\_a L-1, and Nash = 0.79). However, the EBS has shown some failure to correctly retrieve chl\_a concentration in highly turbid waterbodies. This particularity nonetheless does not affect EBS performance, since turbid waters can easily be pre-recognized and masked before the chl\_a modeling.},

Title = {Secondary impacts of eutrophication control activities in shallow lakes: Lessons from aquatic macrophyte dynamics in Lake Taihu from 2000 to 2015},

Abstract = {Aquatic macrophytes in lakes and rivers are highly sensitive to changes in water quality and ecological conditions. Satellite remote sensing of aquatic macrophyte distributions can map changes in freshwater ecosystem dynamics. However, macrophyte mapping by remote sensing is challenging in lakes dominated by algal blooms or with high turbidity. In this study, we mapped the composition and distribution of emergent/floating and submerged macrophytes in the large turbid and eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. We used a novel classification method and 16 y of MODIS images to map these data. The inter-annual trends in macrophyte distribution and cover show complex dynamics in this heavily-managed lake. The area occupied by emergent/floating macrophytes increased from 39.3 km(2) in 2000 to 90.3 km(2) in 2015 (a 230\% increase), whereas the area dominated by submerged macrophytes decreased from 404.6 km(2) in 2001 to 167.5 km(2) in 2015 (a 59\% decrease). We also used the annual date of initial macrophyte occurrence and growth period to examine temporal variation in species composition and biodiversity of macrophytes. Aquatic macrophytes in different parts of the lake responded differently to temporal trends in water quality (Secchi disk and nutrient concentrations), hydrology (water level), and meteorological data (daily temperature, precipitation, and h of sunlight). Changes in lake transparency occurred over the study period, reducing the availability of underwater solar irradiance. Light availability was the most influential local environmental factor for macrophyte dynamics. We also found that eutrophication control projects indirectly reduced lake ecosystem quality in some bays. These control projects included water transfers from the Yangtze River (dilution), aquaculture management actions, macrophyte removal, and dredging. Our findings suggest the species composition and area covered by aquatic macrophytes in this shallow lake are driven by multiple mechanisms. These results highlight that efforts to manage the increase in algal-dominated lake areas require a more complete understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of management activities. We also show that satellite-based remote sensing measurements of macrophyte spatial and temporal dynamics provide a useful indicator to evaluate the impacts of these activities.},

Abstract = {The sediment concentration in river flow is very important in monitoring of water quality, operation of the hydraulic facilities, and management of water resources. Commonly used sampling method is time consuming, labor intensive, and providing only point data at gauging station. This study is presenting a remote sensing approach to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of the high turbid flow in the Yellow River in China, where the high sediment transportation from severe soil erosion is a big environmental concern. The approach was based on public accessible satellite images and surface networking monitoring data. With the longest time series records, the Landsat EMT+ images were chosen to establish the remote sensing approach. Daily sediment records from 2 hydrological stations from 1999 to 2008 in the middle part Yellow River were associated with available satellite imaginary. The water reflectance was retrieved from the Landsat images by using an effective easy-to-use atmospheric correction method. Correlation among water reflectance at band 1 to 4, particle size of suspended sediment and SSC are analyzed to establish the SSC indices. According to the significance of relation between SSC and the water reflectance at different bands of Landsat data, regression models between SSC and water reflectance was developed. The model was calibrated by the daily sediment records from surface observation.},

Abstract = {Due to accelerated urbanization trend across the globe, unsustainable planning and management has consequently led to tremendous deterioration of ecosystem especially vegetation cover and water resources. Subsequently, posing a great challenge to sustainable urban advancement. Detection and evaluation of such variations would assist the planners to apprehend the factors, which are responsible for land use land cover change (LULCC) to adopt effective measures. GIS and remote sensing techniques have proved to be an effective tool for the assessment of land use changes. This study was conducted to assess the water quality index and analyze the major change in land cover types, vegetation cover, rate of urbanization and its possible impact on ground water resources vegetation, barren land and water lands have been decreased by -101.77 km(2), -2.90 km(2) and -1.10 km(2), while built-up lands expanded from 51.10 km(2) to 105.77 km(2). 16 Sites in Islamabad were categorized as unsuitable (with < 300 WQI value) for drinking water due to highly anthropogenic activities. Decreasing water quality and vegetation cover with alarming rate is posing a pressure on the limiting ground water resource as well. This study would be helpful for the decision makers and planners to take proper sustainable measure to address the repercussions of unplanned urbanization and land use changes to protect the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Suspended matter in inland waters is related to total primary production and fluxes of heavy metals and micropollutants such as PCBs. Synoptic information on suspended matter cannot be obtained from an in situ monitoring network since suspended matter is a spatially inhomogeneous parameter. This problem can be solved by the integrated use of remote sensing data, in situ data and water quality models. To enable retrospective model and remote sensing data comparison of suspended matter concentration and distribution, a methodology is required for processing satellite images that is independent of in situ measurements. Analytical optical modelling, based on knowledge of the in situ inherent optical properties, leads to reliable multi-temporal algorithms for estimating suspended matter concentration in lakes for the data from the SPOT and Landsat TM sensors. This methodology allows multi-temporal, multi-site and multi-instrument comparison of TSM maps derived from satellite imagery. This means that satellite sensor data can now become an independent measurement tool for water management authorities. The remote sensing maps showed that large gradients in TSM were observed for the various lakes as well as temporal changes of these spatial gradients. In situ point samples are shown to be not representative for suspended matter in the lakes.},

Title = {A Regression-Based Prediction Model of Suspended Sediment Yield in the Cuyahoga River in Ohio Using Historical Satellite Images and Precipitation Data},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urbanization typically results in increased imperviousness which alters suspended sediment yield and impacts geomorphic and ecological processes within urban streams. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the ability to predict suspended sediment yield. This study assesses the combined impact of urban development and increased precipitation on suspended sediment yield in the Cuyahoga River using statistical modeling. Historical satellite-based land-cover data was combined with precipitation and suspended sediment yield data to create a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for the Cuyahoga watershed. An R-2 value of 0.71 was obtained for the comparison between the observed and predicted results based on limited land-use and land-cover data. The model also shows that every 1 mm increase in the mean annual precipitation has the potential to increase the mean annual suspended sediment yield by 860 tons/day. Further, a 1 km(2) increase in developed land area has the potential to increase mean annual suspended sediment yield by 0.9 tons/day. The framework proposed in this study provides decision makers with a measure for assessing the potential impacts of future development and climate alteration on water quality in the watershed and implications for stream stability, dam and flood management, and in-stream and near-stream infrastructure life.},

Title = {Coastal Bathymetry Estimation from Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery: Comparing Deep Learning and Physics-Based Approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The ability to monitor the evolution of the coastal zone over time is an important factor in coastal knowledge, development, planning, risk mitigation, and overall coastal zone management. While traditional bathymetry surveys using echo-sounding techniques are expensive and time consuming, remote sensing tools have recently emerged as reliable and inexpensive data sources that can be used to estimate bathymetry using depth inversion models. Deep learning is a growing field of artificial intelligence that allows for the automatic construction of models from data and has been successfully used for various Earth observation and model inversion applications. In this work, we make use of publicly available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and multiple bathymetry surveys to train a deep learning-based bathymetry estimation model. We explore for the first time two complementary approaches, based on color information but also wave kinematics, as inputs to the deep learning model. This offers the possibility to derive bathymetry not only in clear waters as previously done with deep learning models but also at common turbid coastal zones. We show competitive results with a state-of-the-art physical inversion method for satellite-derived bathymetry, Satellite to Shores (S2Shores), demonstrating a promising direction for worldwide applicability of deep learning models to inverse bathymetry from satellite imagery and a novel use of deep learning models in Earth observation.},

Title = {Stakeholder-driven development of a cloud-based, satellite remote sensing tool to monitor suspended sediment concentrations in major Bangladesh rivers},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental decision-support tools often fail to be effectively applied in society because tools are ``use-inspired{''} rather than ``user-ready.{''} Stakeholder engagement by researchers is frequently the missing, critical component. Here, university researchers collaborated with the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in developing a cloud-based, satellite remote sensing tool for monitoring suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in major Bangladesh rivers. Bangladesh faces complex river erosion and sediment management challenges. The tool helps to overcome BWDB's constraints of limited resources and ground-based monitoring capacity. The tool maps estimated SSC over satellite images and provides long-term estimated SSC time series at user-designated points. The key elements of success in the engagement process were the partnership and trust between the researchers and stakeholder; stakeholder leadership and ownership; diversity of stakeholder roles engaged; researcher's understanding of the stakeholder, problem, and context; and open-source, easy-to-use tool. Weaknesses in the engagement process can be improved on in future work.},

Title = {Calibration of Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance for Water Quality Modelling in Binh Dinh's Coastal Zone of Vietnam},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coastal zones are critically important ecosystems that are closely tied to human activities, such as tourism, urbanization, transport, and aquaculture. However, managing and monitoring sea water in the coastal areas is often challenging due to the diversity of the pollution sources. Traditional approaches of onsite measurement and surveys have limitations in terms of cost, efficiency and productivity compared with modern remote sensing methods, particularly for larger and longer observations. Optical remote sensing imagery has been proven to be a good data source for water quality assessment in general and for seawater studies in particular with the use of advanced techniques of data processing such as machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, optical remote sensing data also have their own disadvantages as they are much affected by climatic conditions, atmospheric gas and particles as a source of noise in the data. This noise could be reduced, but it is still unavoidable. This study aims to model seawater quality parameters (total suspended solids (TSS), chlorophyll-a (chla), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved oxygen (DO)) along a 134 km sea coastal area of the Binh Dinh province by applying the current robust machine learning models of decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and Ada boost regression (ABR) using Sentinel-2 imagery. To reduce the atmospheric effects, we conducted onsite measurements of sea surface reflectance (SSR) using the German RAMSES-TriOS instrument for calibration of the Sentinel-2 level 2A data before inputting them to the ML models. Our modeling results showed an improvement of the model accuracy using calibrated SSR compared with the original Sentinel-2 level 2A SSR data. The RF predicted the most accurate seawater quality parameters compared with in situ field-measured data (mean R-2 = 0.59 using original Sentinel-2 level 2A SSR and R-2 = 0.70 using calibrated SSR). The chla was the most precise estimate (R-2 = 0.74 when modelled by the RF model) flowing by DO, COD and TSS. In terms of seawater quality estimation, this accuracy is at a good level. The results of the seawater quality distributions were strongly correlated with coastal features where higher values of TSS, chla, COD, and DO are near the river mouths and urban and tourist areas. These spatial water quality data could be extremely helpful for local governments to make decisions when the modelling is continuously conducted (using big data processing), and it is highly recommended for more applications.},

Title = {A flood of information: Using Sentinel-3 water colour products to assure continuity in the monitoring of water quality trends in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {248},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {An operational method to assess trends in marine water composition and ecosystem health during flood periods has been developed for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Queensland, Australia. This method integrates satellite water colour data with field water quality and ecosystem monitoring data and involves the classification of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS satellite) pixels into six distinct water bodies using a ``wet season{''} colour scale developed specifically for the GBR. Using this information, several monitoring and reporting products have been derived and are operationally implemented into a long-term water quality monitoring program for the GBR. However, MODIS sensors are aging and a long-term monitoring solution is needed. This study reviewed the water colour monitoring products currently used in the GBR. It tested the feasibility to transition these methods from historical MODIS satellite imagery to the new Sentinel-3 satellite of the European Space Agency and from the wet season colour scale to the historical Forel-Ule colour scale, using a freely-distributed Forel Ule (FU) Satellite Toolbox. Monitoring products derived from both satellites and colour scales showed very similar patterns across two case study regions of the GBR, the Wet Tropics and Burdekin marine regions, over the 2017-18 wet season. The results obtained in this study highlighted the potential of using FU Sentinel-3 imagery for the mapping of GBR marine water bodies, including flood conditions. Furthermore, the operational monitoring products and frameworks developed for the GBR are likely to provide valuable foundations for analysis of FU Sentinel-3 data in the future. Such satellite water colour datasets and frameworks will be instrumental to better understand the impact of floods and reduced water clarity on marine ecosystems, as well as to support water quality management and facilitate catchment management policy in the GBR and worldwide.},

Abstract = {The continuous water quality monitoring (WQM) of watersheds and the existing water supplies is a crucial step in realizing sustainable water development and management. However, the conventional approaches are time-consuming, labor intensive, and do not give spatial-temporal variations of the water quality indices. The advancements in remote sensing techniques have enabled WQM over larger temporal and spatial scales. This study used satellite images and an Empirical Multivariate Regression Model (EMRM) to estimate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity. Furthermore, ordinary Kriging was applied to generate spatial maps showing the distribution of water quality parameters (WQPs). For all the samples, turbidity was estimated with an R-2 and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.763 and 0.818, respectively while TSS estimation gave respective R-2 and r values of 0.809 and 0.721. Chl-a was estimated with accuracies of R-2 and r of 0.803 and 0.731, respectively. Based on the results, this study concluded that WQPs provide a spatial-temporal view of the water quality in time and space that can be retrieved from satellite data products with reasonable accuracy.},

Abstract = {Malacca River water quality is affected due to rapid urbanization development. The present study applied LULC changes towards water quality detection in Malacca River. The method uses LULC, PCA, CCA, HCA, NHCA, and ANOVA. PCA confirmed DS, EC, salinity, turbidity, TSS, DO, BOD, COD, As, Hg, Zn, Fe, E. coli, and total coliform. CCA confirmed 14 variables into two variates; first variate involves residential and industrial activities; and second variate involves agriculture, sewage treatment plant, and animal husbandry. HCA and NHCA emphasize that cluster 1 occurs in urban area with Hg, Fe, total coliform, and DO pollution; cluster 3 occurs in suburban area with salinity, EC, and DS; and cluster 2 occurs in rural area with salinity and EC. ANOVA between LULC and water quality data indicates that built-up area significantly polluted the water quality through E. coli, total coliform, EC, BOD, COD, TSS, Hg, Zn, and Fe, while agriculture activities cause EC, TSS, salinity, E. coli, total coliform, arsenic, and iron pollution; and open space causes contamination of turbidity, salinity, EC, and TSS. Research finding provided useful information in identifying pollution sources and understanding LULC with river water quality as references to policy maker for proper management of Land Use area.},

Abstract = {The environmental impacts of agricultural policies must be quantified to perform full cost-benefit analyses and make informed policy decisions. In this paper I use a unique panel data set to estimate the effect of changes in cropland on lake water quality. Fifteen years of water quality measurements across over 100 lakes are combined with satellite imagery and weather data. Using a dynamic panel data model, I find that the elasticity of water quality to cropland is 0.0535. To understand the policy implications, I estimate a second model to find the elasticity of cropland to crop prices. I combine these estimates to analyze the effect of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). I find that the RFS decreased lake water quality; however, the magnitude of this effect is negligible.(1)},

Title = {Ground-based remote sensing provides alternative to satellites for monitoring cyanobacteria in small lakes},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {242},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the most prevalent bloom-forming harmful algae in freshwater systems around the world. Adequate sampling of affected systems is limited spatially, temporally, and fiscally. Remote sensing using spaceor ground-based systems in large water bodies at spatial and temporal scales that are cost-prohibitive to standard water quality monitoring has proven to be useful in detecting and quantifying cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. This study aimed to identify a regional `universal' multispectral reflectance model that could be used for rapid, remote detection and quantification of cyanoHABs in small- to medium-sized productive reservoirs, such as those typical of Oklahoma, USA. We aimed to include these small waterbodies in our study as they are typically overlooked in larger, continental wide studies, yet are widely distributed and used for recreation and drinking water supply. We used Landsat satellite reflectance and in-situ pigment data spanning 16 years from 38 reservoirs in Oklahoma to construct empirical linear models for predicting concentrations of chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin, two key algal pigments commonly used for assessing total and cyanobacterial algal abundances, respectively. We also used ground-based hyperspectral reflectance and in-situ pigment data from seven reservoirs across five years in Oklahoma to build multispectral models predicting algal pigments from newly defined reflectance bands. Our Oklahoma-derived Landsat- and ground-based models outperformed established reflectance-pigment models on Oklahoma reservoirs. Importantly, our results demonstrate that ground-based multispectral models were far superior to Landsat-based models and the Cyanobacteria Index (CI) for detecting cyanoHABs in highly productive, small- to mid-sized reservoirs in Oklahoma, providing a valuable tool for water management and public health. While satellite-based remote sensing approaches have proven effective for relatively large systems, our novel results indicate that ground-based remote sensing may offer better cyanoHAB monitoring for small or highly dendritic turbid lakes, such as those throughout the southern Great Plains, and thus prove beneficial to efforts aimed at minimizing public health risks associated with cyanoHABs in supply and recreational waters.},

Title = {Modeling Coastal Water Clarity Using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding and attributing changes to water quality is essential to the study and management of coastal ecosystems and the ecological functions they sustain (e.g., primary productivity, predation, and submerged aquatic vegetation growth). However, describing patterns of water clarity-a key aspect of water quality-over meaningful scales in space and time is challenged by high spatial and temporal variability due to natural and anthropogenic processes. Regionally tuned satellite algorithms can provide a more complete understanding of coastal water clarity changes and drivers. In this study, we used open-access satellite data and low-cost in situ methods to improve estimates of water clarity in an optically complex coastal water body. Specifically, we created a remote sensing water clarity product by compiling Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 reflectance data with long-term Secchi depth measurements at 12 sites over 8 years in a shallow turbid coastal lagoon system in Virginia, USA. Our satellite-based model explained \& SIM;33\% of the variation in in situ water clarity. Our approach increases the spatiotemporal coverage of in situ water clarity data and improves estimates from bio-optical algorithms that overpredicted water clarity. This could lead to a better understanding of water clarity changes and drivers to better predict how water quality will change in the future.},

Abstract = {Anomaly detection from remote sensing images is to detect pixels whose spectral signatures are different from their background. Anomalies are often man-made targets. With such target signatures being unknown, anomaly detection has many important applications, such as water quality monitoring, crop stress surveying, and law enforcement-related uses, where prior information of targets is often unavailable. The key to success is accurate background modeling. Anomaly detection from remote sensing images is challenging because spatial coverage is very large and the background is highly heterogeneous. For pixel-based anomaly detection, computing cost in background modeling and a spatial-convolution-type detection process is very expensive. Thus, parallel and distributed computing is critical in reducing execution time, which can fit the need for real-time or near real-time detection from airborne and spaceborne platforms in support of immediate decision-making. This article reviews the recent advances in anomaly detection from hyperspectral remote sensing images and their implementation using parallel and distributed systems. The classical methods, i.e., the Reed-Xiaoli (RX) algorithm and its variants, including its real-time processing version, are illustrated in commodity graphic processing units (GPUs), cloud, and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations. Practical issues and future development trends are also discussed.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the most significant indicators of water quality in the inland water systems. Maintaining DO monitoring systems is time and money consuming since in situ DO data with high spatial and temporal resolution is needed to design appropriate coastal management plans. In this study, we mapped the spatiotemporal changes of DO in the Little Miami River (LMR) using 10-m Sentinel-2 images. We trained two machine learning algorithms - Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - to predict DO concentrations using spectral predictors derived from the satellite images. Moreover, we calculated several metrics, which include Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Amount of Variance Explained (AVE), Coefficient of Efficiency (COE), and Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) to assess the performance of the models and accuracy of the DO maps. Our results showed a good agreement between modeled and measured DO concentrations with minimal residual errors ranging between 0.201 mg/L and 0.241 mg/L. Furthermore, RF and SVM revealed to be the reliable and effective algorithms to estimate DO concentrations with bands 5 (B5, vegetation red edge) and 8 (B8, NIR) as important predictors. We found the DO concentrations in the LMR to be in good to excellent range (7.3 mg/L to 14.7 mg/L for August and 10.8 mg/L to 14.5 mg/L for October), based on the minimum criterion for warm water habitat in the Ohio Water Quality Standards (WQS). Our findings have provided spatial insight to the current status of DO and the success of the management steps taken to manage and prevent eutrophic problems in the LMR.},

Title = {A GIS Methodology to Determine the Critical Regions for Mitigating Eutrophication in Large Territories: The Case of Jalisco, Mexico},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Inadequate management practices for solid waste and wastewater are some of the main causes of eutrophication globally, especially in regions where intensive livestock, agricultural, and industrial activities are coupled with inexistent or ineffective waste and wastewater treatment infrastructure. In this study, a methodological approach is presented to spatially assess the trophic state of large territories based on public water quality databases. The trophic state index (TSI) includes total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll A, chemical oxygen demand, and Secchi disk depth values as water quality indicators. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatiotemporal attributes of the water quality data, in addition to spatially displaying the results of TSI calculations. As a case study, this methodological approach was applied to determine the critical regions for mitigating eutrophication in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Although a decreasing trend was observed for the TSI values over time for most subbasins (2012-2019), a tendency for extreme hypereutrophication was observed in some regions, such as the Guadalajara metropolitan area and the Altos region, which are of high economic relevance at the state level. A correlation analysis was performed between the TSI parameters and rainfall measurements for all subbasins under analysis, which suggested a tendency for nutrient wash-off during the rainy seasons for most subbasins; however, further research is needed to quantify the real impacts of rainfall by including other variables such as elevation and slope. The relationships between the water quality indicators and land cover were also explored. The GIS methodology proposed in this study can be used to spatially assess the trophic state of large regions over time, taking advantage of available water quality databases. This will enable the efficient development and implementation of public policies to assess and mitigate the eutrophication of water sources, as well as the efficient allocation of resources for critical regions. Further studies should focus on applying integrated approaches combining on-site monitoring data, remote sensing data, and machine learning algorithms to spatially evaluate the trophic state of territories.},

Title = {Interactions of E. coli with algae and aquatic vegetation in natural waters},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Both algae and bacteria are essential inhabitants of surface waters. Their presence is of ecological significance and sometimes of public health concern triggering various control actions. Interactions of microalgae, macro algae, submerged aquatic vegetation, and bacteria appear to be important phenomena necessitating a deeper understanding by those involved in research and management of microbial water quality. Given the longstanding reliance on Escherichia coli as an indicator of the potential presence of pathogens in natural waters, understanding its biology in aquatic systems is necessary. The major effects of algae and aquatic vegetation on E. coli growth and survival, including changes in the nutrient supply, modification of water properties and constituents, impact on sunlight radiation penetration, survival as related to substrate attachment, algal mediation of secondary habitats, and survival inhibition due to the release of toxic substances and antibiotics, are discussed in this review. An examination of horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic resistance potential, strain specific interactions, effects on the microbial, microalgae, and grazer community structure, and hydrodynamic controls is given. Outlooks due to existing and expected consequences of climate change and advances in observation technologies via high-resolution satellite imaging, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), and mathematical modeling are additionally covered. The multiplicity of interactions among bacteria, algae, and aquatic vegetation as well as multifaceted impacts of these interactions, create a wide spectrum of research opportunities and technology developments.},

Title = {Removal of Chlorophyll-a Spectral Interference for Improved Phycocyanin Estimation from Remote Sensing Reflectance},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Monitoring cyanobacteria is an essential step for the development of environmental and public health policies. While traditional monitoring methods rely on collection and analysis of water samples, remote sensing techniques have been used to capture their spatial and temporal dynamics. Remote detection of cyanobacteria is commonly based on the absorption of phycocyanin (PC), a unique pigment of freshwater cyanobacteria, at 620 nm. However, other photosynthetic pigments can contribute to absorption at 620 nm, interfering with the remote estimation of PC. To surpass this issue, we present a remote sensing algorithm in which the contribution of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) absorption at 620 nm is removed. To do this, we determine the PC contribution to the absorption at 665 nm and chl-a contribution to the absorption at 620 nm based on empirical relationships established using chl-a and PC standards. The proposed algorithm was compared with semi-empirical and semi-analytical remote sensing algorithms for proximal and simulated satellite sensor datasets from three central Indiana reservoirs (total of 544 sampling points). The proposed algorithm outperformed semi-empirical algorithms with root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 25 mu g/L for the three analyzed reservoirs and showed similar performance to a semi-analytical algorithm. However, the proposed remote sensing algorithm has a simple mathematical structure, it can be applied at ease and make it possible to improve spectral estimation of phycocyanin from space. Additionally, the proposed showed little influence from the package effect of cyanobacteria cells.},

Title = {Evaluating Remote Sensing Model Specification Methods for Estimating Water Quality in Optically Diverse Lakes throughout the Growing Season},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Spectral images from remote sensing platforms are extensively used to estimate chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations for water quality studies. Empirical models used for estimation are often based on physical principles related to light absorption and emission properties of chl-a and generally relying on spectral bands in the green, blue, and near-infrared bands. Because the physical characteristics, constituents, and algae populations vary widely from lake to lake, it can be difficult to estimate coefficients for these models. Many studies select a model form that is a function of these bands, determine model coefficients by correlating remotely-measured surface reflectance data and coincidentally measured in-situ chl-a concentrations, and then apply the model to estimate chl-a concentrations for the entire water body. Recent work has demonstrated an alternative approach using simple statistical learning methods (Multiple Linear Stepwise Regression (MLSR)) which uses historical, non-coincident field data to develop sub-seasonal remote sensing chl-a models. We extend this previous work by comparing this method against models from literature, and explore model performance for a region of lakes in Central Utah with varying optical complexity, including two relatively clear intermountain reservoirs (Deer Creek and Jordanelle) and a highly turbid, shallow lake (Utah Lake). This study evaluates the suitability of these different methods for model parameterization for this area and whether a sub-seasonal approach improves performance of standard model forms from literature. We found that while some of the common spectral bands used in literature are selected by the data-driven MLSR method for the lakes in the study region, there are also other spectral bands and band interactions that are often more significant for these lakes. Comparison of model fit shows an improvement in model fit using the data-driven parameterization method over the more traditional physics-based modeling approaches from literature. This suggests that the sub-seasonal approach and exploitation of information contained in other bands helps account for lake-specific optical characteristics, such as suspended solids and other constituents contributing to water color, as well as unique (and season-specific) algae populations, which contribute to the spectral signature of the lake surface, rather than only relying on a generalized optical signature of chl-a. Consideration of these other bands is important for development of models for long-term and entire growing season applications in optically diverse water bodies.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to diagnose erosions in a hydrographic basin and to evaluate conservationist soil management practices for degradation recovery, by monitoring water quality indicators and satellite images. Monitoring was done for 14 years in 14,076 ha of the basin of Rio do Peixe, which was selected for being the most degraded one in the state of Salo Paulo, Brazil, circumscribing 176 farms, basically explored with pastures and coffee. Out of these farms, 82 showed some kind of erosion, besides 12 stretches of municipal roads that contributed to the erosion processes in the agricultural areas. The conservationist soil and water management practices established in 86 of the farms at the basin allow positive changes on the landscape and on the income from agricultural activity, which were shown in the aerial photos and by the water quality indicators. The adopted monitoring and agri-environmental rehabilitation methodologies are viable and may contribute to managing and monitoring microbasins.},

Abstract = {Fresh and clean water is a vital commodity of need for the well-being of human societies, and damage of these aquifers is one of the most serious environmental problems of the past century. The regular monitoring and management of groundwater resources is very important for the sustainable development. The present study monitors the groundwater quality relation to the land use/land cover (LULC) using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Physicochemical analysis data of groundwater samples collected at different locations forms the attribute database for the study. LULC categories, such as agricultural and built-up area, associated with human activities, incorporated maximum change in groundwater quality. In this study, weighting analysis of Water Quality Index (WQI) and Land Cover Index (LCI) have been performed to map the Suitability Index ( SI) of water for drinking purpose in the area. Spatial interpolation technique was used for generation of pollution potentiality map of the area. Cluster analysis was performed for delineating and grouping the similar pollution causing area. The overall view of the results indicates that most of the study area exhibited very low SI for the drinking purpose due to very high groundwater pollution.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic eutrophication is a global environmental problem threatening the ecological functions of many inland freshwaters and diminishing their abilities to meet their designated uses. Water authorities worldwide are being pressed to improve their abilities to monitor, predict, and manage the incidence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). While most water quality management decisions are still based on conventional monitoring programs that lack the needed spatio-temporal resolution for effective lake/reservoir management, recent advances in remote sensing are providing new opportunities towards better understanding water quality variability in these important freshwater systems. This study assessed the potential of using the Sentinel 2 Multispectral Instrument to predict and assess the spatio-temporal variability in the water quality of the Qaraoun Reservoir, a poorly monitored Mediterranean hypereutrophic monomictic reservoir that is subject to extensive periods of HABs. The work first evaluated the ability to transfer and recalibrate previously developed reservoir-specific Landsat 7 and 8 water quality models when used with Sentinel 2 data. The results showed poor transferability between Landsat and Sentinel 2, with most models experiencing a significant drop in their predictive skill even after recalibration. Sentinel 2 models were then developed for the reservoir based on 153 water quality samples collected over 2 years. The models explored different functional forms, including multiple linear regressions (MLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forests (RF), and support vector regressions (SVR). The results showed that the RF models outperformed their MLR, MARS, and SVR counterparts with regard to predicting chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, Secchi disk depth, and phycocyanin. The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the RF models varied between 85\% for TSS up to 95\% for SDD. Moreover, the study explored the potential of quantifying cyanotoxin concentrations indirectly from the Sentinel 2 MSI imagery by benefiting from the strong relationship between cyanotoxin levels and chlorophyll-a concentrations.},

Abstract = {As the mother river of the famous Chinese people, the Yellow River has nurtured the people living on both sides of the river basin for many years. However, in recent years, rivers have severely polluted industry, agriculture and climate, and some waters have suffered serious droughts, floods and floods. In this way, the hydrology and flood control of the Yellow River Basin become particularly important. In this paper, research and design are carried out on this background, and a set of information construction schemes for hydrological monitoring and water quality detection are proposed and related systems are formed. Specifically, the system conducts detailed analysis around the overall structure design, plan, function, etc., and integrates the traditional monitoring system, water quality remote sensing system, mobile management system and other multi-functions to promote the degree of informatization of the Yellow River governance. After practice Demonstration, the system construction plan is forward-looking and usable.},

Abstract = {Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments have been extensively modified over the past 150 years for agricultural production, leading to a decline in water quality entering the GBR lagoon. A joint Queensland and Australian government initiative produced the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (Reef Plan) in 2003 in response to the decline in water quality, updating the plan in 2009 and most recently in 2013. The Reef Plan outlines a clear set of water quality and management practice targets for sediment, nutrients and pesticides. Improvement in water quality is achieved through government and landholder investment into improved agricultural management practices. A Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring and Modelling, Reporting program (Paddock to Reef) has been established to measure and report progress towards meeting Reef Plan goals and targets, and to assess the benefits of improved land management practices on water quality discharged to the reef lagoon. The program integrates five lines of evidence including: monitoring of practice effectiveness, prevalence of adoption of improved practices and catchment indicators through time, paddock and catchment modelling, and catchment and marine monitoring and remote sensing. Paddock to Reef is an innovative program where paddock and catchment modelling is an essential component used to report on progress towards meeting reef water quality targets. An important innovation is the linking from paddock through to catchment scale models to assess the impact of changes in management practices on end of system loads},

Title = {Probabilistic Prediction of Satellite-Derived Water Quality for a Drinking Water Reservoir},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A Bayesian network-based modelling framework was proposed to predict the probability of exceeding critical thresholds for chlorophyll-a and turbidity in an Australian subtropical drinking water reservoir, based on Sentinel-2 data and prior knowledge. The model was trained with quasi-synchronous historical in situ and satellite data for 2018-2023 and achieved satisfactory accuracy (Brier score < 0.27 for all models) despite limited poor water quality events in the final dataset. The graphical output of the model (posterior probability maps of high turbidity or chlorophyll-a) provides an effective means for the user to evaluate both the prediction, and the uncertainty behind the predictions in a single map. This avoids loss of trust in the model and can trigger spatially targeted data collection in order to reduce uncertainty. Future work will focus on refining the modelling methodology and its automation, as well as including other data such as in situ high-frequency sensors.},

Title = {Monitoring cyanoHABs and water quality in Laguna Lake (Philippines) with Sentinel-2 satellites during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {788},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Laguna Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines, is permanently subject to nutrient-driven eutrophication and pollution and experiences harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) periodically with serious socio-economic implications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the suitability of the Sentinel-2 imagery of the European Commission's Copernicus Earth Observation programme for lake monitoring during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season (September-November 2020). The Case-2 Regional Coast Colour processor is used to atmospherically correct Level 1 data and generate water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) at 10 m. Results show that Super Typhoon Goni and Typhoon Vamco delivered high suspended sediment loads to the reservoir at concentrations above 170 g/m(3) compared to pre-storm situations (0-35 g/m(3)). The typhoons also affect Chl-a, with a mean concentration of 10 mg/m(3) and 30 mg/m(3) for pre- and post-typhoons, respectively. In addition, the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) is used in the Google Earth Engine platform for near-real time monitoring of cyano HABs at 20 m spatial resolution. Satellite maps are key for detecting the distribution of the blooms due to the patchiness of the green algae species, which usually form scum and elongated slicks in the lake. Maximum records of bloom detection during the study period occur in the Central Bay, one of the lake sections with major aquaculture and fisheries activities. The Sentinel-2 mission improves synoptic mapping of cyanoHABs and enables trends in their extent and severity to be documented. These available methods provide an essential tool for rapid detection after extreme events and for regularwater quality monitoring, which will assist and benefit the cost-effective management of Laguna Lake.

Title = {Efficient Monitoring of Total Suspended Matter in Urban Water Based on UAV Multi-spectral Images},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 11},
Abstract = {Water is not only an indispensable part of the natural environment but also an important component and basic guarantee of the urban ecological environment. Total Suspended Matter (TSM) is an important parameter to measure urban water quality. Therefore, it is essential to carry out real-time and efficient monitoring of the total suspended matter of urban water bodies to ensure water quality safety of urban water bodies. In this paper, the inversion model of TSM concentration of urban water is constructed using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multi-spectral images and measured TSM concentration data. The results show that: (1) The NIR band of the UAV image is highly sensitive to TSM concentration. (2) When the sample size is small, it is found that the TSM regression model is more stable and explanatory than the machine learning model. (3) The overall water quality of urban water bodies is poor, especially in areas with intense human activities such as shipping and construction. The TSM concentration in the river reaches is high, and the TSM concentration in the wider river reaches is higher than that in the narrow river channels and Landscape Lakes, and the TSM concentration remains stable in a certain length of river reaches. It can lay a foundation for further realizing real-time and efficient water quality parameter inversion in the future, and also provide an important scientific reference value for other water quality parameter inversion research, and provide theoretical basis and technical support for the scientific management of water ecological environment in urban water bodies.},

Title = {Hybridisation of fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms for water quality characterisation using remote sensing data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-196},
Abstract = {We propose the characterisation of a coastal water scheme using a combination of remote sensing data and in situ measurements. The characterisation is performed using most discriminate water-mapped parameters, such as concentration of suspended particulate matter `SPM', suspended chlorophyll `Chl', water turbidity `Turb' and water transparency `SDD'. The relation between these parameters and the multispectral reflectance is non-linear. Hybridisation of fuzzy model and genetic algorithm (GA) using remote sensing data allows the estimation of these parameters. The principle of our estimation is mainly based on a set of fuzzy rules extracted automatically from the training data in a two-step procedure. First, fuzzy rules are generated using an unsupervised fuzzy clustering of the input data. Second, a GA is applied to tune these rules. Our contribution consists in providing global and partial optimisation rules, in which a proposed chromosome structure adapted to our database achieves a correlation coefficient close to 98.42. In addition to that, we propose a valuable tool to evaluate the pollution degree through estimated indices maps. From these maps, a pollution signature draw is constructed and examples from specific sites are compared to highlight their pollution degree, then the most polluted case is retrieved. This approach is tested in two sites having different pollution properties, namely ETM+ of Landsat 7 and MODIS data covering, respectively, Algiers and Manche sea.},

Title = {Current and Future Remote Sensing of Harmful Algal Blooms in the Chesapeake Bay to Support the Shellfish Industry},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in the Chesapeake Bay can negatively impact fish, shellfish, and human health via the production of toxins and the degradation of water quality. Due to the deleterious effects of HAB species on economically and environmentally important resources, such as oyster reef systems, Bay area resource managers are seeking ways to monitor HABs and water quality at large spatial and fine temporal scales. The use of satellite ocean color imagery has proven to be a beneficial tool for resource management in other locations around the world where high-biomass, nearly monospecific HABs occur. However, remotely monitoring HABs in the Chesapeake Bay is complicated by the presence of multiple, often co-occurring, species and optically complex waters. Here we present a summary of common marine and estuarine HAB species found in the Chesapeake Bay, Alexandrium monilatum, Karlodinium veneficum, Margalefidinium polykrikoides, and Prorocentrum minimum, that have been detected from space using multispectral data products from the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) sensor on the Sentinel-3 satellites and identified based on in situ phytoplankton data and ecological associations. We review how future hyperspectral instruments will improve discrimination of potentially harmful species from other phytoplankton communities and present a framework in which satellite data products could aid Chesapeake Bay resource managers with monitoring water quality and protecting shellfish resources.},

Title = {Estimating Suspended Sediment Concentration Using Remote Sensing for the Teles Pires River, Brazil},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {Improving environmental sustainability involves measuring indices that show responses to different production processes and management types. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in water bodies is a parameter of great importance, as it is related to watercourse morphology, land use and occupation in river basins, and sediment transport and accumulation. Although already established, the methods used for acquiring such data in the field are costly. This hinders extrapolations along water bodies and reservoirs. Remote sensing is a feasible alternative to remedy these obstacles, as changes in suspended sediment concentrations are detectable by satellite images. Therefore, satellite image reflectance can be used to estimate SSC spatially and temporally. We used Sentinel-2 A and B imagery to estimate SSC for the Teles Pires River in Brazil's Amazon. Sensor images used were matched to the same days as field sampling. Google Earth Engine (GEE), a tool that allows agility and flexibility, was used for data processing. Access to several data sources and processing robustness show that GEE can accurately estimate water quality parameters via remote sensing. The best SSC estimator was the reflectance of the B4 band corresponding to the red range of the visible spectrum, with the exponential model showing the best fit and accuracy.},

Title = {Integration of sensors for dam water quality analysis - a prototype},

Abstract = {Water consumed is stored in several water bodies in and around us, out of which dams accommodate a major portion of water. The quantity and quality monitoring of water in Dams is troublesome due to its large surface area and high depths. Though groundwater resources are the primary water source in India, Dams plays a vital role in water distribution and storage network. Central Water Commission in India has identified more than 5,000 dams of which a major portion is persistently consumed by the rural and urban population for drinking and irrigation. The water quality of these reservoirs is of serious concern as it would not only affect the socio-economic status of the nation but the aquatic systems as well. Water quality control and management are vital for delivering clean water supply to the common society. Because of their size, collecting, assessing, and managing a vast volume of water quality data is critical. Water quality data is primarily obtained through manual field sampling; however, real-time sensor monitoring is increasingly being used for more efficient data collection. The literature depicts that the methods involving remote sensing and image processing of water quality analysis consume time, require sample collection at various depths, analysis of collected samples, and manual interpretations. The objective of this study is to propose a novel cost-effective method to monitor water quality devoid of considerable human intervention. The sensor-based online monitoring aids in assessing the sample with limited technology, at various depths of water in the dam to analyze turbidity which gives the major indication of pure water. The quality analysis of the dam water is worthy if the water is assessed at the distribution end before consumption. Hence, to enhance the water management system, other quality parameters like pH, conductivity, temperature are sensed and monitored in the distribution pipeline. The unstable pH can alter the chemical and microbiological aspects of water resulting in a variation of other water quality parameters Temperature variations affect the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water bodies which results in unstable quality parameters. The change in dissolved solvents and the ionic concentration alters the electrical conductivity of the water and the increased concentration of salts also results in turbidity. The data from all the sensors are processed by the microcontroller, transmitted, and displayed in a mobile application comprehensible to the layman.},

Title = {Feasibility of the Spatiotemporal Fusion Model in Monitoring Ebinur Lake's Suspended Particulate Matter under the Missing-Data Scenario},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {High-frequency monitoring of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration can improve water resource management. Missing high-resolution satellite images could hamper remote-sensing SPM monitoring. This study resolved the problem by applying spatiotemporal fusion technology to obtain high spatial resolution and dense time-series data to fill image-data gaps. Three data sources (MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2) and two spatiotemporal fusion methods (the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF)) were used to reconstruct missing satellite images. We compared their fusion accuracy and verified the consistency of fusion images between data sources. For the fusion images, we used random forest (RF) and XGBoost as inversion methods and set ``fusion first `` and ``inversion first `` strategies to test the method's feasibility in Ebinur Lake, Xinjiang, arid northwestern China. Our results showed that (1) the blue, green, red, and NIR bands of ESTARFM fusion image were better than FSDAF, with a good consistency (R-2 >= 0.54) between the fused Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 images, and their original images; (2) the original image and fusion image offered RF inversion effect better than XGBoost. The inversion accuracy based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 were R-2 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. The correlation of SPM distribution maps of the two data sources attained a good consistency of R-2 0.51; (3) in retrieving SPM from fused images, the ``fusion first `` strategy had better accuracy. The optimal combination was ESTARFM (Landsat 8)\_RF and ESTARFM (Sentinel 2)\_RF, consistent with original SPM maps (R-2 = 0.38, 0.41, respectively). Overall, the spatiotemporal fusion model provided effective SPM monitoring under the image-absence scenario, with good consistency in the inversion of SPM. The findings provided the research basis for long-term and high-frequency remote-sensing SPM monitoring and high-precision smart water resource management.},

Abstract = {In order to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural changes in an ecosystem, the environmental parameters and the driving forces need to be monitored in different temporal and spatial scales. The limitation of conventional monitoring methods particularly with regard to temporal and spatial resolution is often a serious hindrance to a better understanding of marine ecosystems and the underlying biogeochemical processes. The use of unattended automatic observing systems onboard of ships of opportunity offers a cost-effective and reliable possibility to obtain regular observations of near-surface parameters with a high spatial coverage and temporal resolution. In the Southern North Sea the application of the so called FerryBox systems has been proved since 2002. FerryBoxes have been installed on different ferries and cargo ships as well. The system allows high frequent monitoring of oceanographic parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity) as well as biological relevant parameters such as chlorophyll, nutrients, oxygen and pH along a transect. In combination with remote sensed data the spatial limitation to a certain transect can be overcome. On the other hand the data from the FerryBox can be used as ground truth data for the remote sensing data. Special events like strong short-term algae blooms, which will be detected only occasionally by standard monitoring methods, can be studied in detail and related to variations in influencing factors such as temperature, wind and nutrient load. However, due to its limitations (surface measurements, certain ship tracks only) only a combination of research ship cruises, buoy measurements at strategic locations, remote sensing and numerical modeling will give the deep insights needed for an understanding of the ecosystem as a prerequisite for future management options.},

Title = {A Meta-Analysis on Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Detection and Monitoring: A Remote Sensing Perspective},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Algae serves as a food source for a wide range of aquatic species; however, a high concentration of inorganic nutrients under favorable conditions can result in the development of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Many studies have addressed HAB detection and monitoring; however, no global scale meta-analysis has specifically explored remote sensing-based HAB monitoring. Therefore, this manuscript elucidates and visualizes spatiotemporal trends in HAB detection and monitoring using remote sensing methods and discusses future insights through a meta-analysis of 420 journal articles. The results indicate an increase in the quantity of published articles which have facilitated the analysis of sensors, software, and HAB proxy estimation methods. The comparison across multiple studies highlighted the need for a standardized reporting method for HAB proxy estimation. Research gaps include: (1) atmospheric correction methods, particularly for turbid waters, (2) the use of analytical-based models, (3) the application of machine learning algorithms, (4) the generation of harmonized virtual constellation and data fusion for increased spatial and temporal resolutions, and (5) the use of cloud-computing platforms for large scale HAB detection and monitoring. The planned hyperspectral satellites will aid in filling these gaps to some extent. Overall, this review provides a snapshot of spatiotemporal trends in HAB monitoring to assist in decision making for future studies.},

Abstract = {Reservoir water quality is traditionally monitored and evaluated based on field data. Collecting and analyzing field water quality data are costly and time consuming tasks, and whether a limited number of field data truly characterize the spatial variation of the trophic state within a vast water body is often disputed. In this study we utilize Landsat TM data to estimate the water quality and trophic state of the Te-Chi reservoir in Central Taiwan. A modified multi-parameter model of Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) was developed for the Te-chi reservoir. Water quality parameters (concentration of chlorophyll-a, total phosphorous measurement, and secchi disk depth) required by the model are found to have high correlations with combinations of TM bands. Therefore, TM data are used to map the trophic state of the reservoir. TM-derived TSI maps of the reservoir reveal that, in summer, the trophic state in the reservoir generally improves from upstream to downstream and that zones of distinct trophic state exist. Atrophic state index based on secchi disk depth may give erroneous values in the upstream section of the reservoir pool due to high sediment concentration in the reservoir inflow. We conclude that the Te-Chi reservoir is eutrophic or worse in summer and meso-eutrophic in winter. Implementation of best management practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution in the upstream watershed is highly recommended. This study demonstrates the capability of mapping the trophic state in impounded water bodies using the Landsat TM data.},

Title = {Monitoring of regional lake water clarity using Landsat imagery},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},
Number = {5},
Pages = {661-670},
Abstract = {The application of remote sensing technology to water quality monitoring has special significance for lake management at regional scale. Water clarity expressed in terms of Secchi disk transparency (SDT) is a highly useful indicator of trophic status and ecosystem health. In this study, we related Landsat TM and ETM+ data with ground observations to develop a model for the estimation of SDT which can be used as a standardized procedure for regional-scale lake clarity assessment in the central region of Argentina. Samples were taken from two reservoirs of the region. Pearson correlation coefficients and step-wise multiple regression analysis were used to evaluate correlation between Landsat bands and measured SDT. Results suggested that Landsat band 3 plus the ratio 1/3 was a consistent and reliable predictor of SDT (R-2 = 0.80). The algorithm was validated (R-2 = 0.81) and applied to the November 10, 2010 ETM+ image obtaining a map that characterized water clarity of reservoirs within the study area. The procedure presented here could become a low cost measurement tool for water management authorities and decision-makers, obtaining simpler and practical results for regional water clarity monitoring.},

Abstract = {Landscape characteristics of a watershed are important variables that influence surface water quality. Understanding the relationship between these variables and surface water quality is critical in predicting pollution potential and developing watershed management practices to eliminate or reduce pollution risk. To understand the impacts of landscape characteristics on water quality in mine waste-located watersheds, we conducted a case study in the Tri-State Mining District which is located in the conjunction of three states (Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma). Severe heavy metal pollution exists in that area resulting from historical mining activities. We characterized land use/land cover over the last three decades by classifying historical multi-temporal Landsat imagery. Landscape metrics such as proportion, edge density and contagion were calculated based on the classified imagery. In-stream water quality data over three decades were collected, including lead, zinc, iron, cadmium, aluminum and conductivity which were used as key water quality indicators. Statistical analyses were performed to quantify the relationship between landscape metrics and surface water quality. Results showed that landscape characteristics in mine waste-located watersheds could account for as much as 77\% of the variation of water quality indicators. A single landscape metric alone, such as proportion of mine waste area, could be used to predict surface water quality; but its predicting power is limited, usually accounting for less than 60\% of the variance of water quality indicators.

Abstract = {This paper reports on the validation of bio-optical models in estuarine and nearshore (case 2) waters of New Jersey-New York to retrieve accurate water leaving radiance spectra and chlorophyll concentration from the NASA Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data complemented with in situ measurements. The study area-Hudson/Raritan Estuary-is a complex estuarine system where tidal and wind-driven currents are modified by freshwater discharges from the Hudson, Raritan, Hackensack, and Passaic rivers. Over the last century the estuarine water quality has degraded, in part due to eutrophication, which has disrupted the pre-existing natural balance, resulting in phytoplankton blooms of both increased frequency and intensity, increasing oxygen demand and leading to episodes of hypoxia. During 1999-2001 data acquisitions by NASA AVIRIS field measurements were obtained to establish hydrological optical properties of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary: (1) concurrent above- and below-surface spectral irradiance; (2) sampling for laboratory determination of inherent optical properties; and (3) concentrations of optically-important water quality parameters. We used a bio-optical model based on Gordon et al. to predict the sub-surface irradiance reflectance from optically important water constituents. Modelling of reflectance is a prerequisite for processing remote sensing data to desired thematic maps for input into the geographical information system (GIS) for use as a management too] in water quality assessment. A Radiative Transfer Code-MODTRAN-4-was applied to remove the effects of the atmosphere so as to infer the water leaving radiance from the AVIRS data. The results of this procedure were not satisfactory, therefore an alternative approach was tested to directly correct the AVIRIS image using modelled spectra based on measured optical characteristics. The atmospherically corrected AVIRIS ratio image was used to calculate a thematic map of water quality parameters (i.e. chlorophyll-a) concentration, which subsequently were integrated into a GIS for management of water quality purposes.},

Abstract = {Traditional field techniques to monitor water quality in large estuaries, such as boat-based surveys and autonomous moored sensors, generally provide limited spatial coverage. Satellite imagery potentially can be used to address both of these limitations. Here, we show that satellite-based observations are useful for inferring total- suspended-solids (TSS) concentrations in estuarine areas. A spectra-matching optimization algorithm was used to estimate the particle backscattering coefficient at 400 nm, b(bp)(400), in Chesapeake Bay from Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite imagery. These estimated values of b(bp)(400) were compared to in situ measurements of TSS for the study period of September 1997-December 2003. Contemporaneous SeaWiFS b(bp)(400) values and TSS concentrations were positively correlated (N = 340, r(2) = 0.4, P < 0.0005), and the satellite-derived b(bp)(400) values served as a reasonable first-order approximation for synoptically mapping TSS. Overall, large-scale patterns of SeaWiFS b(bp)(400) appeared to be consistent with expectations based on field observations and historical reports of TSS. Monthly averages indicated that SeaWiFS bbp(400) was typically largest in winter (> 0.049 m(-1), November-February) and smallest in summer (< 0.031 m(-1), June-August), regardless of the amount of riverine discharge to the bay. The study period also included Hurricanes Floyd and Isabel, which caused large-scale turbidity events and changes in the water quality of the bay. These results demonstrate that this technique can provide frequent synoptic assessments of suspended solids concentrations in Chesapeake Bay and other coastal regions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Lagoon water quality monitoring based on digital image analysis and machine learning estimators},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {172},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Lagoon has been widely used to treat animal wastewater. However, because lagoon effluent often fluctuates in water quality, land application of the effluent may pose a risk to the environment and/or public health. It is necessary to monitor the quality of lagoon water to reduce the risk of its land application. This paper proposes an innovative monitoring method for animal wastewater in lagoons. We implemented spectral processing techniques to analyze the reflectivity of wastewater samples from lagoons, and applied machine learning methods to estimate the water quality parameters of the effluents, including the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria (total coliform and E. Coli), and total solids. This study found significant correlations between the spectral rate of emission and above water quality parameters. We used machine learning to train three types of estimators, normal equation linear regression (LR), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and Ridge regression to quantify these relations. The model performance was evaluated by weight coefficient, function intercept, and mean squared error (MSE). The model showed that TS level and the blue band of spectral reflectance of samples have a relatively good linear relationship, and the MSE of prediction set and decision coefficient were 0.57 and 0.98, respectively. For bacteria level, the MSE of prediction set was 0.63, and coefficient R-2 was 0.96. The results from this study could provide a versatile method for remote sensing of animal waste water.

Abstract = {Water quality of the Nansi Lake drainage area has caused great concern due to the construction of the China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project. In order to investigate the effects of the ``treating{''}, ``using{''} and ``protecting{''} comprehensive management measures and strategies of the Nansi Lake drainage area, accumulating complete and precious water quality data before water transfer and carrying out the Nansi Lake water quality spatial distribution monitoring work are imperative. Using grid distribution method, remote sensing image covers technology and GPS satellite positioning system, meanwhile also combining the local survey of lake area covering type, we determined two sets of monitoring point locations of the in-lake area and the estuarine into the lake, then set up the monitoring plan as: the hydrology monitoring elements such as water depth and flow rate of estuary; 11 water quality monitoring objects as water temperature, pH, CODCr, NH3-N, T-P, T-N, CODMn, transparency, conductivity, SS and chlorophyll-a; 9 sediment monitoring objects including organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, Cr, Cu, Pb, As, Cd and Hg; as well as the methods of sample collection, storage, transportation and data analysis. This Nansi Lake water quality spatial distribution plan has been revised and improved for four times since first setting up and well explains the factors need to be considered in lakes water quality spatial distribution monitoring work. It provides a set of good technical solutions for other similar lakes' water quality spatial distribution monitoring planning. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Increasing water salinity in coastal areas is a concern for the coastal environment. Increased salinity is affecting water quality, freshwater availability, and water-related ecosystems in the southwest coastal region of the Bengal Delta. The study used a synergies and robust approach to assess the possible factors for increasing water salinity in an embanked coastal island in the southwest Bengal Delta. The hydrochemical analysis revealed that surface and groundwater are enriching with Na+ and Cl- concentration, also controlling by seawater through the ion ex- change mechanism (Ca2+ and Mg2+ replacing by Na+, and Cl-), mixing stage of water solution (freshwater-saltwater), and anthropogenic salt contamination by human activities (e.g., saltwater shrimp cultivation and excessive irrigation). Piper diagram showed that river water is occupying at the mixing stage of solution, where pond and groundwater are occupying at seawater (saline) zone. The water quality index showed that surface water is not fresh anymore and unsuitable for drinking purposes. The isotope analyses exposed the presence of strong precipita- tion variance in the study area Cluster observation analysis showed a strong correlation between Na+, Cl-, and TDS (similarity is 97\% to 99\%). The remote sensing application illustrated that high salinity zones are in the northern part, and groundwater salinity is higher (7.5 to 8 ppt) in the northern part of polder 32. The salinity of both groundwater and surface water showed a positive correlation with land surface temperature and potential evapotranspiration. The study exposed four responding factors for increasing groundwater salinity in this region, which are - regional surface geological settings, hydrological settings, hydraulic head gradient, and human activities. A conceptual model illustrated the presence of lateral recharge of saltwater from the surrounding tidal rivers to the groundwater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The collapse of mining tailing dams in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil, that occurred in 2019 was one of the worst environmental and social disasters witnessed in the country. In this sense, monitoring any impacted areas both before and after the disaster is crucial to understand the actual scenario and problems of disaster management and environmental impact assessment. In order to find answers to that problem, the aim of this study was to identify and analyze the spatiality of the impacted area by rupture of the tailing dam of the Corrego do Feijao mine in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, by using orbital remote sensing. Land use and land occupation, phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, water turbidity, total suspended solids on water, and carbon sequestration efficiency by vegetation (CO(2)Flux) were estimated by orbital imagery from the Landsat-8/OLI and MSI/Sentinel-2 sensors in order to assess the environmental impacts generated by the disaster. Data were extracted from spectral models in which the variables that best demonstrated the land use variation over the years were sought. Mean comparison by t-test was performed to compare the time series analyzed, that is, before and after the disaster. Through the analysis of water quality, it was observed that the environmental impact was calamitous to natural resources, especially water from Corrego do Feijao.},

Title = {Water Quality Retrieval from PRISMA Hyperspectral Images: First Experience in a Turbid Lake and Comparison with Sentinel-2},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A new era of spaceborne hyperspectral imaging has just begun with the recent availability of data from PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) launched by the Italian space agency (ASI). There has been pre-launch optimism that the wealth of spectral information offered by PRISMA can contribute to a variety of aquatic science and management applications. Here, we examine the potential of PRISMA level 2D images in retrieving standard water quality parameters, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a turbid lake (Lake Trasimeno, Italy). We perform consistency analyses among the aquatic products (remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and constituents) derived from PRISMA and those from Sentinel-2. The consistency analyses are expanded to synthesized Sentinel-2 data as well. By spectral downsampling of the PRISMA images, we better isolate the impact of spectral resolution in retrieving the constituents. The retrieval of constituents from both PRISMA and Sentinel-2 images is built upon inverting the radiative transfer model implemented in the Water Color Simulator (WASI) processor. The inversion involves a parameter (g(dd)) to compensate for atmospheric and sun-glint artifacts. A strong agreement is indicated for the cross-sensor comparison of R-rs products at different wavelengths (average R approximate to 0.87). However, the R-rs of PRISMA at shorter wavelengths (<500 nm) is slightly overestimated with respect to Sentinel-2. This is in line with the estimates of g(dd) through the inversion that suggests an underestimated atmospheric path radiance of PRISMA level 2D products compared to the atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate the high potential of PRISMA level 2D imagery in mapping water quality parameters in Lake Trasimeno. The PRISMA-based retrievals agree well with those of Sentinel-2, particularly for TSM.},

Title = {Inherent and apparent optical properties of the complex estuarine waters of Tampa Bay: What controls light?},

Abstract = {Inherent and apparent optical properties (IOPs and AOPs) of Tampa Bay (Florida, USA) were measured during fourteen cruises between February 1998 and October 2010 to understand how these properties relate to one another and what controls light absorption and diffuse attenuation in this moderately sized (similar to 1000 km(2)), shallow estuary (average depth similar to 4 m). The IOPs and AOPs included: 1) absorption coefficients of three optically significant constituents: phytoplankton pigments, detrital particles, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM); 2) particulate backscattering coefficients; 3) chlorophyll-a concentrations; 4) above-water remote sensing reflectance; 5) downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficients (k(d)) at eight wavelengths and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Results showed substantial variability in all IOPs and AOPs in both space and time, with most IOPs spanning more than two orders of magnitude and showing strong co-variations. Of all four bay segments, Old Tampa Bay showed unique optical characteristics. During the wet season, the magnitude of blue-green-light absorption was dominated by CDOM, while during the dry season all three constituents contributed significantly. However, the variability in K-d (PAR, 490 nm, 555 nm) was driven mainly by the variability of detrital particles and phytoplankton as opposed to CDOM. This observation explained, at least to first order, why a nutrient reduction management strategy used by the Tampa Bay Estuary Program since the 1990s led to improved water clarity in most of Tampa Bay. The findings of this study provided the optical basis to fine tune existing or develop new algorithms to estimate the various optical water quality parameters from space. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Validation of a remote sensing based index of forest disturbance using streamwater nitrogen data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {476-484},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Vegetation disturbances are known to alter the functioning of forested ecosystems by contributing to export ({''}leakage{''}) of dissolved nitrogen (N), typically nitrate-N, from water-sheds that can contribute to acidification of acid-sensitive streams, leaching of base cations, and eutrophication of downstream receiving waters. Yet, at a landscape scale, direct evaluation of how disturbance is linked to spatial variability in N leakage is complicated by the fact that disturbances operate at different spatial scales, over different timescales, and at different intensities. In this paper we explore whether data from synoptic stream-water surveys conducted in an Appalachian oak-dominated forested river basin in western MD (USA) can be used to test and validate a scalable, synthetic, and integrative forest disturbance index (FDI) derived from Landsat imagery. In particular, we found support for the hypothesis that the interannual variation in spring baseflow total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and nitrate-N concentrations measured at 35 randomly selected stream stations varied as a linear function of the change in FDI computed for the corresponding set of subwatersheds. Our results demonstrate that the combined effects of forest disturbances can be detected using synoptic water quality data. It appears that careful timing of the synoptic baseflow sampling under comparable phenological and hydrometeorological conditions increased our ability to identify a forest disturbance signal.

Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of the quantity and quality of urban runoff from various land uses by remote-sensing and GIS technology coupled with hydrological and chemical monitoring. The study areas were located in the cities of Herzliya and Ra'anana, in Israel's coastal plain, where extensive urbanization has taken place over the last 30 years. Different image-processing methodologies were developed to establish a relationship between the land-use maps and field measurements of runoff quality and quantity. The advantages of the abovementioned remote-sensing means, used separately and together, were analyzed for the generation of suitable maps for decision-makers from the research area. The obtained land-use maps provide an understanding of the influence of surface-cover information on facilitated analysis of runoff-land cover relationships and can serve as a tool in other urban environments.},

Abstract = {The effective management of suspended solids and their accompanying contaminants in water bodies requires information on the sources of sediments. Clear water reflects small amounts of solar irradiance, while water loaded with suspended materials (SM) has the potential of reflecting large amounts of sunlight. This study focused on the analysis of SM in Lake Mead, which lies on the Colorado River, using remote sensing spectral indices. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) satellite images were used to determine the spectral indices such as normalized suspended material index (NSMI), normalized difference suspended sediment index (NDSSI), and band ratio (BR). This paper established relationship between the satellite image and ground truth data obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) data. A map of spatial distribution of suspended sediments in Lake Mead was produced. The map showed that high suspended sediments were generally identified at the entry points of Lake Mead, with lower suspended sediments being concentrated at the basins of the lake. Results also showed that an increase in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) produces a corresponding increase in NSMI values. An exponential relationship between SSC and NSMI values, with coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of approximately 0.96, was developed in this study.},

Abstract = {Limited input data per desired simulation area challenges watershed models capabilities. Weather input is essential for accurate modelling of hydrological processes, yet many world regions do not have these data readily available. The Agricultural Policy eXtender Model (APEX) offers a spatial weather generator to assist these data scarce regions. APEX can also simulate small landscape to large scale watersheds with steep rainfall gradients. The APEX weather generator creates daily weather values that are correlated in time and space, based on monthly weather statistics using a probabilistic method, that are then linked to flow, water quality and soil properties. Recent developments in APEX on streamflow routing methods include the addition of two new routing methods: Storage with Variable Slope and Variable Storage Coefficient. These methods improve flow and in-stream water quality simulation results by incorporating the diffusive momentum in streamflows and channels that are mildly sloped or affected by flashy floods. The alterations in routing allow for proper accounting of the new algorithms in development for contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) including hormones, metals and insects/pests, in addition to improving wetland/riparian zone impacts on these constituents. The CECs are being linked to soil physical and chemical properties (i.e. metals linked to soil saturation and clay content). Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools have also been altered.},

Title = {Process-oriented estimation of column-integrated algal biomass in eutrophic lakes by MODIS/Aqua},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {99},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Algal blooms happen widely in eutrophic lakes. The satellite-derived surface algal bloom area and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration are commonly used as indicators to judge the water quality. However, vertical migration of phytoplankton may seriously affect the assessment accuracy of water quality with the surface status as an indicator. In fact, the water column-integrated algal biomass is better for describing the water quality. To remotely estimate the algal biomass considering the vertical Chl-a profile (uniform or otherwise), this paper proposed a novel process-oriented algorithm applied successfully in Lake Chaohu, China. First, we built a decision tree to identify the pixel-based Chl-a profile types using the floating algae index, surface Chl-a concentration, and wind speed. Then, the nonuniform profile was expressed as a power decay function (Chl-a(z) = n1 ? zn2) and parameterized using the surface Chl-a concentration. Finally, the algal biomass was derived from MODIS/Aqua satellite data. The estimation results were acceptable and the bias was -19.95\%. The monthly mean algal biomass varied significantly and exhibited two peaks in spring and summer. The annual mean algal biomass increased from 2003 to 2010 (Pearson r = 0.82; p < 0.05) and then decreased from 2012 to 2018 (r = -0.71; p = 0.07). Monthly variations were determined by the air temperature (77.09\%), but annual variations were primarily influenced by ammonia nitrogen level (44.61\%). With known algal biomass and wind speed, the pixelbased algal bloom probability could be forecasted. The developed process-oriented algorithm was also applicable to eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. This study is of great significance for scientifically assessing water quality and effectively managing aquatic environmental disasters.},

Abstract = {This chapter reviews the Remote Sensing (RS) technologies that are particularly appropriate for marine and coastal ecosystem research and management. RS techniques are used to perform analysis of water quality in coastal water bodies; to identify, characterize and analyze river plumes; to extract estuarine/coastal sandy bodies; to identify beach features/patterns; and to evaluate the changes and integrity (health) of the coastal lagoon habitats. For effective management of these ecosystems, it is essential to have satellite data available and complementary accurate information about the current state of the coastal regions, in addition to well-informed forecasts about its future state. In recent years, the use of space, air and ground-based RS strategies has allowed for the rapid data collection, Image processing (Pixel-Based and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) classification) and dissemination of such information to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards, anthropic pressures, and to monitoring essential ecological processes, life support systems and biological diversity.},

Abstract = {The San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary watershed is a major source of freshwater for California and a profoundly human-impacted environment. The water quality monitoring that is critical to the management of this important water resource and ecosystem relies primarily on a system of fixed water-quality monitoring stations, but the limited spatial coverage often hinders understanding. Here, we show how the latest technology in visible/near-infrared imaging spectroscopy can facilitate water quality monitoring in this highly dynamic and heterogeneous system by enabling simultaneous depictions of several water quality indicators at very high spatial resolution. The airborne portable remote imaging spectrometer (PRISM) was used to derive high-spatial-resolution (2.6 x 2.6 m) distributions of turbidity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a concentrations in a wetland-influenced region of this estuary. A filter-passing methylmercury vs DOC relationship was also developed using in situ samples and enabled the high-spatial-resolution depiction of surface methylmercury concentrations in this area. The results illustrate how high-resolution imaging spectroscopy can inform management and policy development in important inland and estuarine water bodies by facilitating the detection of point- and nonpoint-source pollution, and by providing data to help assess the complex impacts of wetland restoration and climate change on water quality and ecosystem productivity.},

Abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the marine activities and all the anthropogenic activities along the coast have been shut off for several months. The total suspended matter (TSM) was analyzed before and during COVID-19 lockdown in the coast of Morocco. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess all the changes reflected through the coast in April of 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. In the absence of the ground observations during this period, the remote sensing data was used in this study. The results showed a gradual reduction in TSM concentration, indicating a positive improvement during the lockdown period. The TSM concentrations during this period decreased by 40.59\% on average compared with the pre-lock-down period. Further, the turbidity in the water has reduced at each stretch of the rivers. Remote sensing is a powerful tools for analyzing turbidity over the whole littoral areas, even in the absence of field observations. The ongoing pandemic shows that an ocean with cleaner water is possible. These findings provide a general reference on the state of the Moroccan coast that could contribute to improve policy and future monitoring program.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing need to document the impacts of conservation-related best management practices (BMPs) on water quality within a watershed. However, this impact analysis depends upon accurate geospatial locations of existing practices, which are difficult to obtain. This study demonstrates and evaluates three different methods for obtaining geospatial information for BMPs. This study was focused on the Eagle Creek Watershed, a mixed use watershed in central Indiana. We obtained geospatial information for BMPs through government records, producer interviews, and remote-sensing aerial photo interpretation. Aerial photos were also used to validate the government records and producer interviews. This study shows the variation in results obtained from the three sources of information as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each method. Using only one method for obtaining BMP information can be incomplete, and this study demonstrates how multiple methods can be used for the most accurate picture.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal monitoring of water quality parameters such as turbidity in inland waters is desirable to better understand productivity and mitigate the negative impacts of pollution induced by increasing anthropogenic activities. However, precise retrieval of water quality parameters in complex turbid waters from the remote sensing reflectance R-rs remains a challenging task due to the varying optical complexity of the water body. In this study, a modified version of the Atmospheric Correction for OLI-lite (ModACO) scheme for turbid inland waters, which implements a linear extrapolation of MR aerosol reflectance in the visible bands instead of a nonlinear function, is presented. The performance of the proposed method and other existing algorithms such as the Atmospheric Correction for OLI-lite (ACOLITE), Management Unit of the Noth Seas Mathematical Models (MUMM) scheme, SeaDAS standard processing, and SWIRL were evaluated. The R-rs retrievals from these models were then used as input for turbidity estimation and mapping of Laguna de Bay. Results show lowest R-rs error in all five spectral bands (443, 482, 561, 655, and 865 nm) on ModACO-based retrievals. Relative to the ACOLITE and other atmospheric correction schemes, the proposed method reduced the R-rs retrieval errors in terms of RMSE and MAPE by more than 50\% Similarly, significant improvements in turbidity retrievals were achieved from ModACO-based R-rs values, wherein comparable accuracy was observed from red/green ratio and the single MR band turbidity models. Turbidity maps of Laguna de Bay show elevated values from the mid of dry season, which may be associated with point source discharge and wind-induced resuspension of bottom sediments. The lake turbidity then drops by the end of dry season, which is linked to the absence of prevailing strong winds that may increase in-water mixing. Using the aforementioned method, accurate monitoring of turbidity can be done to determine and mitigate possible degradation on the water quality of Laguna de Bay and other productive turbid inland waters.},

Title = {Environmental monitoring of spatio-temporal changes using remote sensing and GIS in a Mediterranean wetland of Northern Greece},

Abstract = {Loss and degradation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats and degraded water quality are major environmental concerns worldwide. Especially wetlands are sensitive ecosystems that are subject to stress from human activities. Remote sensing techniques have been primarily used to generate information on land cover/use changes. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing can be used to provide a rapid or a large-scale understanding of lake change and in developing lake management strategies. The principal objectives of this study are to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal changes in land cover/use by using GIS, and to determine the main environmental factors affecting these changes. This paper presents a case study for the application of integrated remote sensing and GIS data for the classification and monitoring of the spatial and temporal changes in land use types. The study was conducted in a small natural wetland of Lake Cheimaditida, located in the East Mediterranean region of Northern Greece. Data analysis was conducted using GIS software. During the past several decades Lake Cheimaditida wetland has been influenced by many anthropogenic activities. The variables chosen for the assessment included condition of wetland and lake areas, present extent of wetlands relative to historic area, cover of natural habitat, wetland disturbances, etc. These variables address catchments properties that are important for maintaining and improving wetland habitats and water quality and assessment of trends useful for environmental monitoring. Land cover/land use patterns were assessed and compared using aerial photographs taken in 1945, 1969, 1982, and 1996. Over this period, reed beds enormously increased by 1,655.19\%, while open-water areas and peat lands decreased by 74.05 and 99.5\%, respectively. The significance of the changes in land cover distribution within the Lake Cheimaditida wetland are discussed in relation to the historical pattern of reed beds colonization, the importance of Phragmites australis in the process and the implications for strategic management of freshwater wetland resources.},

Abstract = {The chemical composition of a freshwater surface depends on the sources of input that can be of natural or anthropogenic origin. This study examined the spatial variability of the water quality from Chapala Lake and discussed the possible sources to this freshwater surface which is the largest rift lake in Mexico. The methodology included multivariate statistical techniques to analyze the possible relationship between water quality and the natural and anthropogenic factors of the area. The outcome showed the existence of four groups of water mixture in the lake. Each one showed two or three end members that characterized its chemical nature. The different groups showed a spatial distribution and a particular spectral behavior was detected from the analysis of a Landsat 7 ETM+ image. The spectral signatures extracted from the satellite image showed a high reflectivity in the range of 830 - 1300 nm for the water provided by the Lerma-Chapala (group IV) system, which represents the most polluted water in the lake. This spectral behavior is not present in the rest of the group. The Western portion of the lake is fed mainly by open water. Contributions from groundwater dominate the Central part, and in the Eastern region, the primary source is the contaminated water from the Lerma river system. A high hydraulic head (hydraulic barrier) prevents the highest level of pollution from the Lerma river. This hydraulic barrier constituted by a significant portion of groundwater is at the Central part of the lake. Furthermore, the most polluted water flows directly to the Metropolitan Region of Guadalajara through the Santiago river. The predominant role played by the groundwater in the dynamics of Chapala Lake is explained, in part, from its tectonic origin. The dynamics of water in the Chapala Lake suggest the need to implement some management plans considering the tectonic origin of the Lake as an advantage for the control of pollution because of the significant contribution of groundwater in the Chapala Lake freshwater system.},

Abstract = {The exploration for groundwater in hard rock terrains is a complex task. To overcome this complexity, the integrated approach based on advanced applications of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) lends itself as an efficient and effective result-oriented method for studying the development and management of water resources. Chittoor area, comprised of a hard rock terrain, is located in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, India. Using remote sensing and GIS technology, groundwater potential zones, along with zones of water quality suitable for domestic purposes, were delineated and classified. Results indicated that, for the town of Chittoor, 1.64\% of the area was classified to have very high groundwater potential, with groundwater quality suitable or moderately suitable for domestic purposes; and 31.68\% of the area was classified as high potential, with over 31\% being suitable or moderately suitable. Most (62.05\%) of the area is of moderate groundwater potential, with groundwater quality mostly suitable or moderately suitable for domestic purposes.},

Abstract = {A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations is proposed and deployed. The core of the method is the analysis of outcomes of hypothetical fire suppression scenarios generated using a coupled atmosphere-fire behaviour model, based on decisions made by an experienced wildfire incident management team with and without the benefits of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite observations and the WRF-SFIRE wildfire behaviour simulation system. The scenarios were based on New Mexico's 2011 Las Conchas fire. For each scenario, fire break line location decisions served as inputs to the model, generating fire progression outcomes. Fire model output was integrated with a property database containing thousands of coordinates and property values and other asset values to estimate the total losses associated with each scenario. An attempt to estimate the socioeconomic impact of satellite and modelling data used during the decision-making process was made. We analysed the impact of Earth observations and include considerations for estimating other socioeconomic impacts.},

Abstract = {The earth observation data sets were employed to study the land use/land cover change in study area from year 2000-2010. Vegetation, built-up area and agriculture classes had shown maximum changes. The lake water samples were analyzed, and further, Water Quality Index (WQI) was computed to categorize the lake water. The average value of WQI is 64.52, 52.23 and 42.45 in pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Generally, pre-monsoon samples have higher number of polluted samples. Moreover, we applied the multivariate statistical techniques for handling large and complex data sets in order to get better information about the lake water quality. Factor analysis and principal component analysis are applied to understand the latent structure of the data sets, and we have identified a total of four factors in pre-monsoon, three factors in monsoon and three factors in post-monsoon season, which are responsible for the whole data structure. These factors have explained that 90.908, 89.078 and 85.456 \% of the cumulative percentage variance of the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon data sets. Overall analysis reveals that the agricultural runoff, waste disposal, leaching and irrigation with wastewater, land transformation in the surrounding areas are the main causes of lake water pollution followed by some degree of pollution from geogenic sources such as rock weathering. Hence, there is an urgent need of proper attention and management of resources.},

Abstract = {Model-derived relationships between chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and nutrients and temperature have fundamental implications for understanding complex interactions among water quality measures used for lake classification, yet accuracy comparisons of different approaches are scarce. Here, we (1) compared Chl-a model performances across linear and nonlinear statistical approaches; (2) evaluated single and combined effects of nutrients, depth, and temperature as lake surface water temperature (LSWT) or altitude on Chl-a; and (3) investigated the reliability of the best water quality model across 13 lakes from perialpine and central Balkan mountain regions. Chl-a was modelled using in situ water quality data from 157 European lakes; elevation data and LSWT in situ data were complemented by remote sensing measurements. Nonlinear approaches performed better, implying complex relationships between Chl-a and the explanatory variables. Boosted regression trees, as the best performing approach, accommodated interactions among predictor variables. Chl-a-nutrient relationships were characterized by sigmoidal curves, with total phosphorus having the largest explanatory power for our study region. In comparison with LSWT, utilization of altitude, the often-used temperature surrogate, led to different influence directions but similar predictive performances. These results support utilizing altitude in models for Chl-a predictions. Compared to Chl-a observations, Chl-a predictions of the best performing approach for mountain lakes (oligotrophic-eutrophic) led to minor differences in trophic state categorizations. Our findings suggest that both models with LSWT and altitude are appropriate for water quality predictions of lakes in mountain regions and emphasize the importance of incorporating interactions among variables when facing lake management challenges.},

Abstract = {Increased impervious surfaces pose significant threats to the hydrologic cycle of the Xiangjiang River basin as a consequence of urbanization. Quantifying the percentage of imperviousness within the Xiangjiang River basin is important to pollution control and watershed management. Per-pixel and sub-pixel methods have been widely used for analyzing impervious surface changes, but these methods are considered as complicated, computationally intensive, and sometimes subjective, especially when applied to a large geographic area. In this paper, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI) were respectively used to estimate impervious surfaces in Chang-ZhuTan region (CZT) of the Xiangjiang River basin, and a comparative analyses was conducted. Then the optimum spectral index was chosen to map the percentage of impervious surfaces for the study area. The results show that the spectral index of NDBI has the optimum estimation of large-scale impervious surfaces, and the percentage of imperviousness in CZT was 13.87\%. The water quality in CZT was characterized as ``protected{''}, indicating that water quality protection in the plain areas of CZT is imperative.},

Abstract = {Representative spatial patterns of eutrophication variables cannot be produced using traditional in situ sampling techniques. Spatial heterogeneity complicates the study of seasonal and long-term trends and the evaluation of water management policies. Remote sensing, however, with its broad view has the potential to deliver the relevant information. This paper will address the added value of synoptic eutrophication maps to the standard monitoring program of two large, spatially and temporally variable lakes in the Netherlands, Lakes IJssel and Marken. Remote sensing images were obtained from SeaWiFS; and combined with hyperspectral reflectance data from the airborne EPS-a sensor and the shipboard PR-650 spectroradiometer. The PR-650 data were used in selecting the most appropriate algorithms for ScaWiFS and EPS-a. A special algorithm for case 11 waters with high chlorophyll content was applied to SeaWiFS data to obtain chlorophyll concentrations. Synoptic maps of suspended matter were retrieved using inversion of a model for irradiance reflectance. For the airborne sensor inversion of reflectance was used for both suspended matter and chlorophyll. Satellite and airborne sensors clearly are complementary to each other. Comparison of satellite data with the airborne data and the (scarcely available) in situ data reveal underlying problems with: (i) validation of remote sensing images; and (ii) comparing data at different spatial and temporal scales. In our study, we found a reasonable agreement between different data sources at seasonal time scales, but at shorter time scales the differences can be (much) larger. In situ data suffer from poor reproducibility, related to the natural variability at small spatial scales (patchiness), combined with a significant temporal variability. The standard in situ monitoring program in Lakes IJssel and Marken lacks both the necessary spatial coverage as well as an appropriate sampling frequency. This indicates that for reliable monitoring, a synoptic data set, sampled at a high frequency is required. Remote sensing can partially fulfil this demand but still lacks the demanded frequency, mainly due to regular cloud cover. The answer may be in a multiplatform monitoring approach, as used in our study (combining in situ data with shipboard, airborne and satellite optical data) and in combining monitoring data with models. Satellite remote sensing is most powerful in determining properties that are inherent to the whole take system, like the overall mean chlorophyll-a concentration.

Abstract = {Airborne remote sensing methods are needed to assess spatial patterns of stream temperature at scales relevant to issues in water quality and fisheries management. In this study, we developed an airborne remote sensing method to measure spatially continuous patterns of stream temperature and evaluated the physical factors that influence the accuracy of thermal remote sensing of Bowing waters. The airborne thermal infrared (TIR) system incorporated an internally calibrated thermal imager (8-12 mum) aligned with a visible band camera in a vertically mounted, gimbaled pad attached to the underside of a helicopter High-resolution imagery (0.2-0.4 m) covering the entire channel and adjacent floodplains was recorded digitally and georeferenced in-flight along 50- to 60-km river sections ranging from 2 to 110 m in width. Radiant water temperature corresponded to kinetic water temperature (5-27 degreesC) in a range of stream environments within +/-0.5 degreesC. Longitudinal profiles of radiant water temperature ti-om downstream to headwater reaches provided a spatial context for assessing large-scale patterns of thermal heterogeneity and fine-scale thermal features such as tributaries and groundwater inputs. Potential sources of error in remote measurements of stream temperature included reflected longwave radiation, thermal boundary layer effects at the water surface, and vertical thermal stratification. After taking into account the radiative properties of the surrounding environment and the physical qualities of the stream, thermal remote sensing proved highly effective for examining spatial patterns of stream temperature at a resolution and extent previously unattainable through conventional methods of stream temperature measurement using in-stream data recorders.

Abstract = {Measurements of chlorophyll a (chl-a), along with various transformations such its the trophic state indices of Carlson (1977), are widely used to indicate trophic state of lakes by lake management agencies and organizations. The integration of water quality models, in situ data and remote sensing data provide a new method to measure the content of chl-a, which can also provide spatial distribution information. This paper focused on developing and applying remote sensing algorithms to determine the chl-a content of such turbid, mesotrophic to highly eutrophic lake waters, using Lake Taihu, China as it case study. Landsat-5 TM data and synchronous in situ measurements were used. A Pearson correlation matrix indicated that the ratio of TM4 to TM3 has the strongest relationship with chl-a. A four-coefficient regression model using TM4/TM3 ratio and TM1, TNU was a reliable predicator of chl-a (r(2) = 0.837) for, waters with chl-a concentration between 5 mgm(-3) and 100 mgm(-3). This model will underpredict the values at very high chl-a concentration values (higher than 100 mgm-3), while overpredicting the values at very low chl-a concentration (lower than 5 mgm(-3)).},

Title = {Application of Remote Sensing in Water Resource Management: The Case Study of Lake Trasimeno, Italy},

Abstract = {Satellite multi-sensor data were used to investigate the evolution in time and space of Lake Trasimeno, a shallow and turbid lake in central Italy. Large-swath MERIS and MODIS sensors were proposed for regular broad scale monitoring of water quality, having compared the retrieved chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, Secchi disk (SD) depth and surface water temperature with the 2005-2008 time-series of the in situ data. Although, in a shorter time span, also the MERIS-derived total suspended matter (TSM) matched the in situ data. MERIS-derived water quality products confirmed the meso-eutrophic conditions of Lake Trasimeno (average Chl-a = 8.5 mg/m(3)) and the low levels of transparency (average SD = 1 m). A negative correlation found between water levels and Chl-a suggest the importance of maintaining water levels as close as possible to the hydrometric zero. A spatial analysis of TSM also reveals how small tributaries may affect the load of suspended solids in the southern part of the lake. Higher spatial resolution satellite images were exploited both to describe land use/cover transformation from 1978 to 2008 and to assess the recent changes in macrophyte colonisation patterns. Land cover change detection analysis results showed a decrease in cultivated areas starting from the early Nineties and the subsequent increase in unproductive terrain (bare land and pastures) and natural woods as well as the changing fragmentation of agricultural areas through time. A reduction in macrophyte beds from 2003 to 2008 was also observed. We expect the results of this study to support local water authorities in redrawing the management plan of Lake Trasimeno.},

Abstract = {The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) offers the coastal environmental monitoring community an unprecedented opportunity to observe changes in coastal and estuarine water quality across a range of spatial scales not feasible with traditional field-based monitoring or existing ocean colour satellites. HICO, an Office of Naval Research-sponsored programme, is the first space-based maritime hyperspectral imaging instrument designed specifically for the coastal ocean. HICO has been operating since September 2009 from the Japanese Experiment Module - Exposed Facility on the International Space Station (ISS). The high pixel resolution (approximately 95m at nadir) and hyperspectral imaging capability offer a unique opportunity for characterizing a wide range of water colour constituents that could be used to assess environmental condition. In this study, we transform atmospherically corrected ISS/HICO hyperspectral imagery and derive environmental response variables routinely used for evaluating the environmental condition of coastal ecosystem resources. Using atmospherically corrected HICO imagery and a comprehensive field validation programme, three regionally specific algorithms were developed to estimate basic water-quality properties traditionally measured by monitoring agencies. Results indicated that a three-band chlorophyll a algorithm performed best (R-2=0.62) when compared with in situ measurement data collected 2-4hours of HICO acquisitions. Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (R-2=0.93) and turbidity (R-2=0.67) were also highly correlated. The distributions of these water-quality indicators were mapped for four estuaries along the northwest coast of Florida from April 2010 to May 2012. However, before the HICO sensor can be transitioned from proof-of-concept to operational status and its data applied to benefit decisions made by coastal managers, problems with vicarious calibration of the sensor need to be resolved and standardized protocols are required for atmospheric correction. Ideally, the sensor should be placed on a polar orbiting platform for greater spatial and temporal coverage as well as for image synchronization with field validation efforts.},

Title = {Empirical modelling of suspended solids in a subtropical lagoon (Brazil) using linear spectral mixing algorithm},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) technique has been used in remote sensing applications and allows the estimation of the proportional contribution of different constituents in the pixel reflectance. Despite the great potential for vegetation and land cover studies, there are few studies examining the LSMM efficiency for optically complex inland waters. In addition, LSMM-derived images have shown a promising application in water quality mapping. In this context, Mirim lagoon (Brazil) presents seasonal variability of suspended solids (SS) influenced by sediment yield from tributaries and surrounding areas (e.g.: croplands). While negative impact on water quality makes relevant the SS mapping for management of this ecosystem, there is no studies using remote sensoing in this lagoon. This study develops an empirical model for SS concentration in the Northern Mirim lagoon using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The framework applies the linear spectral mixing algorithm in two MSI images and the empirical model was developed using the multiple linear regression. We validated the model performance using Monte Carlo simulation method. The mapping of SS was satisfactory in both images: the estimated concentrations are consistent with in-situ measurements. The results show that LSMM application supports the mapping of SS and its spatial distribution. Finally, this study is the first application of Sentinel-2 MSI images in the Mirim lagoon and the results present the potential of this empirical modelling for sediment mapping. The spatial information supports the local managers to understand the sources of degradation of water quality and protect this aquatic ecosystem.},

Abstract = {This article presents a case study of the design of an autonomous wireless sensor network for environmental monitoring to provide data for understanding the relationships among food, energy, and water systems in suburban areas in Long Island New York. The study focuses on the existing water quality data for the two counties on Long Island, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, to understand the impact of energy and food production on the coastal waters of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. The analysis of existing data from the US Environmental Protection Agency database reveals the challenges in using such data to understand the relationships between water quality, weather events and identified point sources of pollutants. Maintaining on-going data collection programs is expensive, time-consuming and personnel intensive which is why this project examines new ways to obtain and utilize environmental data. The researchers propose the design of an autonomous wireless sensor network environmental monitoring system with an optimal sensor placement strategy to identify targeted locations for water quality monitoring. The goal is to provide environmental data that can facilitate a better understanding of the interactions of farming activities and energy production resulting in undesirable impacts on water quality. The proposed design can be used to provide real-time data to help stakeholders improve efficiency in resource management and advance early detection of potential hazardous events.

Abstract = {The pristine waters of Kashmir Himalaya are showing signs of deterioration due to multiple reasons. This study researches the causes of deteriorating water quality in the Lidder River, one of the main tributaries of Jhelum River in Kashmir Himalaya. The land use and land cover of the Lidder catchment were generated using multi-spectral, bi-seasonal IRS LISS III (October 2005 and May 2006) satellite data to identify the extent of agriculture and horticulture lands that are the main non-point sources of pollution at the catchment scale. A total of 12 water quality parameters were analyzed over a period of 1 year. Water sampling was done at eight different sampling sites, each with a varied topography and distinct land use/land cover, along the length of Lidder River. It was observed that water quality deteriorated during the months of June-August that coincides with the peak tourist flow and maximal agricultural/horticultural activity. Total phosphorus, orthophosphate phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, and ammoniacal nitrogen showed higher concentration in the months of July and August, while the concentration of dissolved oxygen decreased in the same period, resulting in deterioration in water quality. Moreover, tourism influx in the Lidder Valley shows a drastic increase through the years, and particularly, the number of tourists visiting the valley has increased in the summer months from June to September, which is also responsible for deteriorating the water quality of Lidder River. In addition to this, the extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides in the agriculture and horticulture lands during the growing season (June-August) is also responsible for the deteriorating water quality of Lidder River.},

Abstract = {The following article outlines a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to remote sensing in Southwest Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta that combines ethnographic inquiry and remote sensing to monitor, detect and preserve cultural resources for Alaskan Native communities. Because distinctive vegetation differences are readily visible on cultural sites during the summer months, the analysis of multispectral imagery obtained from remote sensing is particularly useful. In turn, we demonstrate the efficacy of this protocol on pre-contact settlement sites along the Ayakulik River system on Kodiak Island using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) raster of the study area. Here, support vector machine (SVM) supervised classification was highly effective at identifying spectral patterns associated with anthropogenic activity while ethnographic data helped rule out false-positive cases. In addition, we provide the results of a 2019 archaeological prospection survey carried out in conjunction with the ongoing Nunalleq Project in Quinhagak, Alaska, to further highlight the value of ethnographic data collection, ethnobotanical surveys and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based spectroscopy alongside SVM supervised classification. Finally, we propose three suggestions for future research on Yup'ik landscapes in the Y-K Delta regarding citizen science, language preservation and the use of collaborative online maps for community-based decision making.},

Abstract = {The concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) is an important parameter for evaluating lake water quality. We determined in situ hyperspectral data and TSM concentration data for Changdang Lake, China, to establish a TSM concentration inversion model. The model was applied using 60 Sentinel-2 images acquired from 2016 to 2021 to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of TSM concentration. Remote sensing images were also utilized to monitor the effect of ecological dredging in Changdang Lake. The following results were obtained: (1) Compared with four existing models, the TSM concentration inversion model established in this study exhibited higher accuracy and was suitable for Changdang Lake. (2) TSM concentrations obtained for the period 2016-2021 were higher in spring and summer, and lower in autumn and winter. (3) The dredging process influenced a small area of the surrounding water body, resulting in higher TSM concentrations. However, a subsequent reduction in TSM concentrations indicated that the ecological dredging project might improve the water quality of Changdang Lake to a considerable extent. Therefore, it was inferred that the use of Sentinel-2 images was effective for the long-term monitoring of water quality changes in small and medium-sized lakes.},

A historical perspective of hydrologic modeling is provided, and new developments and challenges in watershed models are discussed. These include data acquisition by remote sensing and space technology, digital terrain and elevation models, chemical tracers, geographic information and data management systems, topographic representation, upscaling of hydrologic conservation equations, spatial variability of hydraulic roughness, infiltration and precipitation, spatial and temporal scaling, model calibration, and linking with water quality models. Model construction, calibration, and data processing have received a great deal of attention, while model validation, error propagation, and analyses of uncertainty, risk, and reliability have not been treated as thoroughly. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for watershed hydrology modeling.},

Abstract = {Monitoring changes in land cover and the subsequent environmental responses are essential for water quality assessment, natural resource planning, management, and policies. Over the last 75 years, the Lake Issaqueena watershed has experienced a drastic shift in land use. This study was conducted to examine the changes in land cover and the implied changes in land use that have occurred and their environmental, water quality impacts. Aerial photography of the watershed (1951, 1956, 1968, 1977, 1989, 1999, 2005, 2006, and 2009) was analyzed and classified using the geographic information system (GIS) software. Seven land cover classes were defined: evergreen, deciduous, bare ground, pasture/grassland, cultivated, and residential/other development. Water quality data, including sampling depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, fecal coliform levels, inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and turbidity, were obtained from the South Carolina (SC) Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) for two stations and analyzed for trends as they relate to land cover change. From 1951 to 2009, the watershed experienced an increase of tree cover and bare ground (+17.4 \% evergreen, +62.3 \% deciduous, +9.8 \% bare ground) and a decrease of pasture/grassland and cultivated land (-42.6 \% pasture/grassland and -57.1 \% cultivated). From 2005 to 2009, there was an increase of 21.5 \% in residential/other development. Sampling depth ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 m. Water temperature fluctuated corresponding to changing air temperatures, and dissolved oxygen content fluctuated as a factor of water temperature. Inorganic nitrogen content was higher from December to April possibly due to application of fertilizers prior to the growing season. Turbidity and fecal coliform bacteria levels remained relatively the same from 1962 to 2005, but a slight decline in pH can be observed at both stations. Prior to 1938, the area consisted of single-crop cotton farms; after 1938, the farms were abandoned, leaving large bare areas with highly eroded soil. Starting in 1938, Clemson reforested almost 30 \% of the watershed. Currently, three fourths of the watershed is forestland, with a limited coverage of small farms and residential developments. Monitoring water quality is essential in maintaining adequate freshwater supply. Water quality monitoring focuses mainly on the collection of field data, but current water quality conditions depend on the cumulative impacts of land cover change over time.},

Title = {Subsurface tile drained area detection using GIS and remote sensing in an agricultural watershed},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},
Number = {B},
Pages = {370-379},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Subsurface tile drainage has been used around the globe to lower the water table and drain soils that are seasonally or perennially wet making them suitable for agriculture and/or increasing productivity. However, tile drainage systems have a negative impact on water quality of adjacent streams and ditches due to the transport of excess fertilizer nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from fields. To support nutrient management and conservation practices like drain water management (DWM), accurate delineation of the agricultural area drained by tiles is critical for quantifying nutrient yields (nutrient mass per area per time) to downstream water bodies. In this study, we tested Geographic Information System decision tree classification (GIS DTC) and satellite remote sensing based methods (i.e., image differencing) to determine tile drainage area in an agricultural watershed, Shatto Ditch Watershed (SDW) in Indiana, USA. Using these techniques, we estimated that 79\% of the cultivated area of SDW is tile drained with 94\% accuracy according to the image differencing approach whereas 55\% is classified as tile drained with an accuracy of 75\% based on estimates from the DTC approach with the most relaxed rule thresholds (where tiles exist on <= 4\% slope with poorly and moderately well drained soils). Using satellite imagery to characterize tile drained area at a high resolution over large geographical extent shows promise and will be important for accurately quantifying nutrient yields from tiles which will inform management and conservation efforts to reduce excess nutrient export to downstream water bodies.

Abstract = {Remote sensing has been extensively used for water delineation and has played an important role in water quality evaluation and environmental management strategies. Suspended sediments are important determinants of water quality in coastal zones. Remote sensing enables the effective monitoring of total suspended sediments (TSS) and the detection of areas with critical water quality issues. This study aims to develop and implement regression models for estimating and mapping TSS concentrations from Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) images over the coastal waters of Langkawi Island, Malaysia. The algorithm was developed based on the water reflectance model, which is a function of the inherent optical properties of water. Such properties can then be linked to TSS concentration. In this study, an ALOS Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 device was used as the imaging sensor system. Concurrent complementary in-situ water samples were collected within the area coverage of the sensor, and digital numbers (DN) for each band corresponding to the sea-truth locations were determined. The extracted DN values were converted into reflectance values and then regressed with their respective sea-truth data. An algorithm was proposed to obtain the regression coefficient. This algorithm can estimate TSS concentrations with a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.96) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE = 1.98 mg/l). Finally, a map of the TSS concentration was generated by using the proposed algorithm. This study found that TSS mapping can be conducted by using ALOS data over the coastal waters of Langkawi Island, Malaysia.},

Abstract = {The present study was conducted using secondary database, remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS) and multivariate analysis tools in order to develop Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models that could be able to predict level of water quality variables using compositional and spatial attributes of land cover in the river basins. The study encompasses 21 river basins with 32 000 Km(2) area, located in the Chugoku district in West Japan. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Suspended Solid (SS), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP) were considered as water quality variables of the stream. Satellite data was used to generate the land cover map of the study area. MLR models were developed using the compositional (\%) and spatial attributes (landscape metrics) of the land cover at watershed and class levels for representing the land cover-stream water quality linkage. The results of the MLR modeling using the land cover data at the class level revealed that 92\%, 74\% and 62\% of the total variations in concentration of DO, pH and TP were explained by changes in the measure of the spatial attributes of the land cover at the class level in the study area. These models can help local and regional land managers to understand the relationships between the compositional attribute (\%) and the spatial features of the land cover and river water quality and would be applied in formulating plan for watershed-level management.},

Title = {Phycocyanin Monitoring in Some Spanish Water Bodies with Sentinel-2 Imagery},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Remote sensing is an appropriate tool for water management. It allows the study of some of the main sources of pollution, such as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. These species are increasing due to eutrophication and the adverse effects of climate change. This leads to water quality loss, which has a major impact on the environment, including human water supplies, which consequently require more expensive purification processes. The application of satellite remote sensing images as bio-optical tools is an effective way to monitor and control phycocyanin concentrations, which indicate the presence of cyanobacteria. For this study, 90 geo-referenced phycocyanin measurements were performed in situ, using a Turner C3 Submersible Fluorometer and a laboratory spectrofluorometer, both calibrated with phycocyanin standard, in water bodies of the Iberian Peninsula. These samples were synchronized with Sentinel-2 satellite orbit. The images were processed using Sentinel Application Program software and corrected with the Case 2 Regional Coast color-extended atmospheric correction tool. To produce algorithms that would help to obtain the phycocyanin concentration from the reflectance measured by the multispectral instrument sensor of the satellite, the following band combinations were tested, among others: band 665 nm, band 705 nm, and band 740 nm. The samples were equally divided: half were used for the algorithm's calibration, and the other half for its validation. With the best adjustment, the algorithm was made more robust and accurate through a recalculation, obtaining a determination coefficient of 0.7, a Root Mean Square Error of 8.1 mu g L-1, and a Relative Root Mean Square Error of 19\%. In several reservoirs, we observed alarming phycocyanin concentrations that may trigger many environmental health problems, as established by the World Health Organization. Remote sensing provides a rapid monitoring method for the temporal and spatial distribution of these cyanobacteria blooms to ensure good preventive management and control, in order to improve the environmental quality of inland waters.},

Title = {Supervised Classifications of Optical Water Types in Spanish Inland Waters},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Remote sensing of lake water quality assumes there is no universal method or algorithm that can be applied in a general way on all inland waters, which usually have different in-water components affecting their optical properties. Depending on the place and time of year, the lake dynamics, and the particular components of the water, non-tailor-designed algorithms can lead to large errors or lags in the quantification of the water quality parameters, such as the suspended mineral sediments, dissolved organic matter, and chlorophyll-a concentration. Selecting the most suitable algorithm for each type of water is not a simple matter. One way to make selecting the most suitable water quality algorithm easier on each occasion is by knowing ahead of time the type of water being handled. This approach is used, for instance, in the Lake Water Quality production chain of the Copernicus Global Land Service. The objective of this work is to determine which supervised classification approach might give the most accurate results. We use a dataset of manually labeled pixels on lakes and reservoirs in Eastern Spain. High-resolution images from the Multispectral Instrument sensor on board the ESA Sentinel-2 satellite, atmospherically corrected with the Case 2 Regional Coast Colour algorithm, are used as the basis for extracting the pixels for the dataset. Three families of different supervised classifiers have been implemented and compared: the K-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and support vector machine. Based on the results, the most appropriate for our study area is the random forest classifier, which was selected and applied on a series of images to derive the temporal series of the optical water types per lake. An evaluation of the results is presented, and an analysis is made using expert knowledge.},

Abstract = {Historical ecology can teach us valuable lessons on the processes and drivers of environmental change that can inform future monitoring priorities and management strategies. Environmental data to study environmental history, however, is often absent or of low quality. Even when studying changes occurring during the last few decades, monitoring efforts are scarce due to logistical and cost limitations, leaving large areas unassessed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of estuarine water colour as an indicator of historical environmental change in catchments. Water colour change was assessed in estuaries in Australia from 1987 to 2015 using satellite remote sensing. Random points were selected for each estuary and applied to the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (based on Landsat images) to obtain reflectance data through time. We propose a framework where (i) water colour is used to detect historical changes in catchments using generalised additive models, (ii) possible stressors and pressures driving those changes are evaluated using other available historical data, and (iii) lessons learned inform appropriate monitoring and management actions. This framework represents a novel approach to generate historical data for large-scale assessments of environmental change at catchment level, even in poorly studied areas. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Title = {Multi-sensor analysis to study turbidity patterns in the Guadalquivir estuary},
Journal = {REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION},
Year = {2016},
Number = {46},
Pages = {1-17},
Abstract = {A detailed study of the mechanisms generated through the turbidity plume and its variability at the Guadal-quivir estuary has been carried out with remote sensing and in situ data. Several sensors with different characteristics have been required (spatial, temporal and spectral resolution), thereby providing information for a multi-sensor analysis. The main objective was to determine the water quality parameters (suspended solids and chlorophyll) and implement the methodology to define the empirical and semi-analytical algorithms from satellite data (MODIS, METIS, Deimos-1). The processes occurred in the estuary and adjacent region have been examined identifying those involved in the different variability scales. The forcings associated with rainfall and discharge from Alcala del Rio dam in addition to the climatic NAO index control seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations, while tide effects (semi-daily and fortnightly cycles) modulate the plume at the mouth throughout the year with significant variability. Special emphasis is focused on diagnosing the role of these mechanisms on the continental shelf ecosystems, constituting a powerful tool for the water quality management and coastal resources.},

Title = {Waterbody information extraction from remote-sensing images after disasters based on spectral information and characteristic knowledge},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1404-1422},
Abstract = {This article proposes a post-disaster waterbody information extraction method based on spectral information from remote-sensing images and characteristic knowledge that can resist interference from factors such as changes in water quality, waves caused by accelerated water flow, and varying water levels. The method first analyses the display characteristics of waterbodies from remote-sensing images (their spectral characteristics, geometric features, and textural features), forming a decision tree of rules that represent characteristic knowledge for waterbody information extraction. This rule set is added to the various processing stages of waterbody information extraction after disasters to construct a waterbody information extraction model. Second, an object-oriented method is used for image segmentation. A rough initial waterbody information extraction is performed based on spectral information, and then refined based on the characteristic knowledge. Third, noise is eliminated and holes are filled in the images of the refined waterbody information extraction results. Finally, the accuracy of this new waterbody information extraction method is evaluated from both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Accuracy assessments of the experimental results obtained using remote-sensing images from the Wenchuan earthquake and a 2010 flood in Pakistan show that the proposed method is both efficient and accurate at extracting post-disaster waterbody information even when the background is complex.},

Abstract = {Water-quality monitoring for small urban waterbodies by remote sensing gets to be difficult due to the coarse spatial resolution of remotesensing imagery. The recently launched Sentinel-2 produces imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 m and a temporal resolution of 5 days. It provides an opportunity to conduct high-frequency waterquality monitoring for small waterbodies. Since illegal discharges are an important issue for urban water management, total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were chosen as the target water-quality parameters. TP, TN and COD, however, are non-optically active parameters. There are fairly limited previous studies on retrieving these parameters in comparison with optically active parameters, e.g. Chlorophyll-a etc. Based on the fact that non-optically active parameters may be highly correlated with optically active parameters, this study compared 255 possible Sentinel-2 imagery band compositions to identify the most appropriate ones for TP, TN and COD retrieval. Three machine-learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks (NN), were compared to seek the most robust ones for retrieving the above nonoptically active parameters. Results showed that the most appropriate band (hereafter termed as `B-index' for brevity) compositions for TP, TN, and COD retrieval were `B-3 + B-4 + B-5 + B-6 + B-7 + B-8', `B-3 + B-4 + B-5 +B-6 + B-7 + B-8', and `B-2 + B-3 + B-5 + B-6 + B-7 + B-8' respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of TP, TN, and COD estimations by NN, RF and SVR was 0.94, 0.88, and 0.86, respectively. The retrieval performances of these non-optically active parameters were hence significantly improved by the optimized machine-learning models and imagery band selection. The developed models have limitations in applying to other areas, thus band selection and tuning parameters with new data are necessary for different areas. The water-quality mapping obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery provided a full spatial coverage of the water-quality characterization for the entire water surface, and helped identify illegal discharges to urban waterbodies. This study provides a new practical and efficient water-quality monitoring strategy for managing small waterbodies.},

Abstract = {The permanganate index (CODMn), defined as a comprehensive index to measure the degree of surface water pollution by organic matter and reducing inorganic matter, plays an important role in indicating water pollution and evaluating aquatic ecological health. However, remote sensing monitoring of water quality is presently focused mainly on phytoplankton, suspended particulate matter, and yel-low substance, while there is still great uncertainty in the retrieval of CODMn. In this study, the Landsat-8 surface reflectance data set from Google Earth Engine and in situ CODMnmeasurements were matched. The support vector regression (SVR) machine learning model was calibrated using the matchups. With the SVR model, this study estimates the CODMn in Hongze Lake, presents the historical spatiotemporal CODMn distributions, and discusses the affecting fac-tors of the change trend of the CODMn in Hongze Lake. The results showed that the SVR model adequately estimated CODMn, with a sum squared error of 1.49 mg2/L2, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, and a root mean square error of 0.15 mg/L. CODMn in Hongze Lake was high in general and showed a decreasing trend in the past decade. Huai River, Xinsu River, and Huaihongxin River were still the main sources of oxygen-consuming pollutants in Hongze Lake. The wetland natural reserve near Yugou had a significant effect on reducing CODMn. This study provides not only a scientific reference for the management of CODMn in Hongze Lake, but also a feasible scheme for remote sensing monitoring of CODMn in inland water.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Assessing, implementing and monitoring ecosystem restoration can be a labor intensive process, often short term (<3 years), and potentially destructive to the habitat. Advances in remote sensing technology are generating rapid, non-destructive methods for siting, executing and monitoring restoration efforts, particularly in fragile marine environments. Unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS), or drones, are a highly flexible method for accessing and remote sensing ecosystems with on-demand capabilities, greater resolution than sensors from satellites and occupied aircraft, and the ability to cover large areas quickly. With the variety of platforms and payloads available, UASs are providing a suite of tools for conservation practitioners to properly plan marine ecosystem restoration projects and evaluate their success. Both conventional and specialized sensors coupled with image processing techniques can be used to gauge impact to and recovery of entire ecological communities. For example, high-resolution, multispectral imaging allows for discernment of population changes across trophic levels, concurrent with the discrimination of species (including rare) across a landscape, and detection of vegetation stress. Structure from Motion photogrammetric processing provides centimeter-scale three-dimensional models of habitat structure to measure ecologically significant aspects like rugosity and assess their change through time. Water quality around a broad impacted area can be remotely monitored via a number of payloads before and after restoration. Additionally, specially designed payloads can be used to manually disperse seeds or materials for restoration applications without disturbing the habitat. UASs have increasing potential to reduce the costs (both time and money) associated with restoration efforts, making site assessment and long-term, broad-scale monitoring more achievable. Here we present a review of the applications of UASs in marine ecosystem restoration with an overview of the special considerations of using this technology in the marine environment.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing has been used since the 1980s to study parameters in relation with coastal zones. It was not until the beginning of the twenty-first century that it started to acquire imagery with good temporal and spectral resolution. This has encouraged the development of reliable imagery acquisition systems that consider remote sensing as a water management tool. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution that it provides is not adapted to carry out coastal studies. This article introduces a new methodology for estimating the most fundamental physical property of intertidal sediment, the grain size, in coastal zones. The study combines hyperspectral information (CASI-2 flight), robust statistic, and simultaneous field work (chemical and radiometric sampling), performed over Santander Bay, Spain. Field data acquisition was used to build a spectral library in order to study different atmospheric correction algorithms for CASI-2 data and to develop algorithms to estimate grain size in an estuary. Two robust estimation techniques (MVE and MCD multivariate M-estimators of location and scale) were applied to CASI-2 imagery, and the results showed that robust adjustments give acceptable and meaningful algorithms. These adjustments have given the following R-2 estimated results: 0.93 in the case of sandy loam contribution, 0.94 for the silty loam, and 0.67 for clay loam. The robust statistic is a powerful tool for large dataset.},

Title = {Pen Culture Detection Using Filter Tensor Analysis with Multi-Temporal Landsat Imagery},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aquaculture plays an important role in China's total fisheries production nowadays, and it leads to a few problems, for example water quality degradation, which has damaging effect on the sustainable development of environment. Among the many forms of aquaculture that deteriorate the water quality, disorderly pen culture is especially severe. Pen culture began very early in Yangchenghu Lake and Taihu Lake in China and part of the pen culture still exists. Thus, it is of great significance to evaluate the distribution and area of the pen culture in the two lakes. However, the traditional method for pen culture detection is based on the factual measurement, which is labor and time consuming. At present, with the development of remote sensing technologies, some target detection algorithms for multi/hyper-spectral data have been used in the pen culture detection, but most of them are intended for the single-temporal remote sensing data. Recently, a target detection algorithm called filter tensor analysis (FTA), which is specially designed for multi-temporal remote sensing data, has been reported and has achieved better detection results compared to the traditional single-temporal methods in many cases. This paper mainly aims to investigate the pen culture in Yangchenghu Lake and Taihu Lake with FTA implemented on the multi-temporal Landsat imagery, by determining the optimal time phases combination of the Landsat data in advance. Furthermore, the suitability and superiority of FTA over Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) in the process of pen culture detection were tested. It was observed in the experiments on the data of those two lakes that FTA can detect the pen culture much more accurately than CEM with Landsat data of selected bands and of limited number of time phases.},

Abstract = {Satellite remote-sensing data are essential for monitoring and quantifying water properties in the Great Lakes, providing useful monitoring and management tools for understanding water optical, biological, and ecological processes and phenomena. However, during the winter season, large parts of the Great Lakes are often covered by ice, which can cause significant uncertainties in satellite-measured water quality products. Although some developed radiance-based ice-detection algorithms for satellite ocean color data processing can eliminate most of the ice pixels in a region, there are still some significant errors due to misidentification of ice-contaminated pixels, particularly for the thin ice-covered regions. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the ice-detection methods for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. In this paper, impacts of ice contamination on satellite-derived ocean color products in the Great Lakes are investigated, and a refined regional ice-detection algorithm which is based on the radiance spectra and normalized water-leaving radiance at the wavelength of 551 nm, nLw(551), is developed and assessed for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. Results show that this proposed ice-detection method can reasonably identify ice-contaminated pixels, including those in very thin ice-covered regions, and provide accurate satellite ocean color products for the winter season in the Great Lakes.},

Title = {Regularized estimation of bathymetry and water quality using hyperspectral remote sensing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-289},
Abstract = {Coastal water mapping from remote-sensing hyperspectral data suffers from poor retrieval performance when the targeted parameters have little effect on subsurface reflectance, especially due to the ill-posed nature of the inversion problem. For example, depth cannot accurately be retrieved for deep water, where the bottom influence is negligible. Similarly, for very shallow water it is difficult to estimate the water quality because the subsurface reflectance is affected more by the bottom than by optically active water components. Most methods based on radiative transfer model inversion do not consider the distribution of targeted parameters within the inversion process, thereby implicitly assuming that any parameter value in the estimation range has the same probability. In order to improve the estimation accuracy for the above limiting cases, we propose to regularize the objective functions of two estimation methods (maximum likelihood or ML, and hyperspectral optimization process exemplar, or HOPE) by introducing local prior knowledge on the parameters of interest. To do so, loss functions are introduced into ML and HOPE objective functions in order to reduce the range of parameter estimation. These loss functions can be characterized either by using prior or expert knowledge, or by inferring this knowledge from the data (thus avoiding the use of additional information). This approach was tested both on simulated and real hyperspectral remote-sensing data. We show that the regularized objective functions are more peaked than their non-regularized counterparts when the parameter of interest has little effect on subsurface reflectance. As a result, the estimation accuracy of regularized methods is higher for these depth ranges. In particular, when evaluated on real data, these methods were able to estimate depths up to 20 m, while corresponding non-regularized methods were accurate only up to 13 m on average for the same data. This approach thus provides a solution to deal with such difficult estimation conditions. Furthermore, because no specific framework is needed, it can be extended to any estimation method that is based on iterative optimization.},

Abstract = {Since open sea cage culture sites are far from shore, the sea situation is complex and changeable, and the monitoring of cage culture water quality, fish behaviour, cage operation and other states is the basis of intelligent control of cage casting, feeding, capture, and cage washing to achieve high yield, high efficiency, and safety of cage farming. First, a cage farming model is introduced for analysis of the needs of intelligent monitoring and control technology. The applications of underwater robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, online monitoring networks and other technologies involved in aquaculture water environment information monitoring are summarized. Secondly, the intelligent management of cages is summarized. This paper demonstrates that cage farming is the trend of aquaculture. In the future, applications will combine information monitoring technology, intelligent control technology, and intelligent equipment technology to realize intelligent, digital, automatic and unmanned operation of cage aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Data from Earth observation systems are used extensively in managing and monitoring natural resources, natural hazards, and the impacts of climate change, but the value of such data can be difficult to estimate, particularly when it is available at no cost. Assessing the socioeconomic and scientific value of these data provides a better understanding of the existing and emerging research, science, and applications related to this information and contributes to the decision-making process regarding current and future Earth observation systems. Recent USGS research on Landsat data has advanced the literature in this area by using a variety of methods to estimate value. The results of a 2012 survey of Landsat users, a 2013 requirements assessment, and a 2013 case studies of applications of Landsat imagery are discussed.},

Title = {Satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll a in support of nutrient management in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River (North Carolina) estuaries},

Abstract = {The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) has adopted as a water quality standard that chlorophyll a concentration should not exceed 40 mu g/L in sounds, estuaries and other slow-moving waters. In 1996, nutrient load reductions were placed into North Carolina (NC) law to reduce the extent and duration of algal blooms in the Neuse and Tar River estuaries (Session Law 1995, Section 572). The chlorophyll a criterion was used as the endpoint to manage total nitrogen concentrations, and compliance would be achieved if chl a exceedances occurred in fewer than 10\% of the samples collected in a specified area and time (known as the 10/40 criterion). In 2009, discussions were held between the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (NCDENR) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning the practicality of using satellite-derived chl a concentrations to monitor water quality, enforce water quality-related environmental regulations, and understand the environmental impacts of the watershed land-use practices on coastal waters. In this study, the MERIS chlorophyll a data product was used to conduct a retrospective analysis of the NC standard for water quality and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for total nitrogen in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River estuaries from 2006 to 2009. From daily MERIS images, compliance and chlorophyll exceedances in the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River estuaries were assessed at daily and aggregated to annual time scales. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Total Suspended Matter Distribution in the Hooghly River Estuary and the Sundarbans: A Remote Sensing Approach},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {9064-9070},
Abstract = {Monitoring of total suspended matter (TSM) concentration in the coastal waters is vital for water quality monitoring and coastal management. In this study, TSM over the highly dynamic Hooghly estuary region is derived using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectances at 645 nm and in situ TSM observations. MODIS TSM products show a correlation of 0.95, root-mean-square error of 24.72 g/m(3), and mean absolute and percentage errors of 18.25 g/m(3) and 23.2\%, respectively, when compared with in situ measurements. Subsequently, TSM variability in the Hooghly estuary from the derived TSM maps was analyzed during the period 2003-2018 on monthly and seasonal time scales. The annual cycle of TSM showed peak concentration (>250 g/m(3)) during the southwest monsoon season that could be attributed to large-scale river discharge as compared with the northeast and intermonsoon seasons (similar to 100-150 g/m(3)). Interannual variability showed higher TSM during the years 2004, 2012, and 2013 and low during 2005 and 2015. It could be concluded that the fine tuning of the existing TSM retrieval algorithm is essential based on the long-term earth observation data for monitoring the sediment distribution in the coastal and estuarine regions utilizing available satellite observations, particularly in the highly turbid estuaries, such as the Hooghly estuary.},

Abstract = {With the impact of human engineering activities, groundwater pollution has seriously threatened the health of human life. Accurate water quality assessment is the basis of controlling groundwater pollution and improving groundwater management, especially in specific regions. A typical semi-arid city in Fuxin Province of China is taken as an example. We use remote sensing and GIS to compile four environmental factors, such as rainfall, temperature, LULC, and NDVI, to analyze and screen the correlation of indicators. The differences among the four algorithms were compared by using hyperparameters and model interpretability, including random forest (RF), support vector machine support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The groundwater quality of the city during the dry and wet periods was comprehensively evaluated. The results show that the RF model has higher integrated precision (MSE = 0.11, 0.035; RMSE = 0.19,0.188; R-2 = 0.829,0.811; ROC = 0.98, 0.98). The quality of shallow groundwater is poor in general, 29\%, 38\%, 33\% of the groundwater quality in low-water period is III, IV, V water. Thirty-three percent and 67\% of the groundwater quality in the high-water period were IV and V water. The proportion of poor water quality in high-water period was higher than that in low-water period, which was consistent with the actual investigation. This study provides a kind of machine learning method for the semi-arid area, which cannot only promote the sustainable development of groundwater in this area, but also provide reference for the management policy of related departments.},

Abstract = {River Beas originates in the Himalayas in Central Himachal Pradesh, and merges with river Sutlej at Harike in the state of Punjab and this river is a habitat of the endangered freshwater dolphin, Platanista gangetica minor R. The pollution of water bodies is a significant environmental jeopardy as the river is the prime source of water for the consumption by human beings and aquatic species residing in the river. The water quality indices (WQI) of the river Beas using nine standard parameters recommended by National Sanitation Foundation, were determined for pre-monsoon, post-monsoon and winter seasons at three sampling sites between the towns of Beas and Harike over a stretch of 63 km. The results of WQI of river Beas at Harike before confluence with river Sutlej and at Goindwal Sahib is superior to those at the Beas bridge. This is due to self-purification of the water downstream from Beas bridge to Harike. Season-wise, water quality during the pre-monsoon season was somewhat superior at Harike and Beas. This is attributed to fast degradation of organic matter in river during the summer season. Bioassay for appraising the toxicity of river water was also determined by using Girardinus guppii fish and their results indicate that the water of river Beas is not toxic. Toxicity bioassay using Girardinus guppii fish indicates that the water of river Beas is not toxic. Digital number (DN) values of the river water were obtained from Landsat-TM imagery. PO43-, TDS and turbidity of the river water were regressed on the reflectance values. Using multiple and beta-regression analysis, it was found that PO43-, TDS and turbidity contribute positively to band 2(G) and negatively to band 3(R). Multiple linear regression and beta-regression analysis showed that PO43- and turbidity are regressed on the normalized difference water index negatively and positively respectively. Correlations between the target and output values from artificial neural network for PO43-, TDS and turbidity were highly significant. It is suggested that removal strategies like introduction of aquatic phytoremediation plants must be involved in land management policies in order to mitigate the anthropogenic jeopardy. We affirm that the significance of applying water quality management tools using nature dependent solutions and well-organized management policies.},

Title = {Monitoring oyster culture rafts and seagrass meadows in Nagatsura-ura Lagoon, Sanriku Coast, Japan before and after the 2011 tsunami by remote sensing: their recoveries implying the sustainable development of coastal waters},

Abstract = {Background. Coastal ecosystems are blue infrastructures that support coastal resources and also aquaculture. Seagrass meadows, one of coastal ecosystems, provide substrates for epiphytic diatoms, which are food resources for cultured filter feeder organisms. Highly intensive coastal aquaculture degrades coastal environments to decrease seagrass meadows. Therefore, efficient aquaculture management and conservation of seagrass meadows are necessary for the sustainable development of coastal waters. In ria-type bays, non-feeding aquaculture of filter feeders such as oysters, scallops, and ascidians are actively practiced along the Sanriku Coast, Japan. Before the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the over-deployment of oyster culture facilities polluted the bottom environment and formed an hypoxic bottom water layer due to the organic excrements from cultured oysters. The tsunami in 2011 devastated the aquaculture facilities and seagrass meadows along the Sanriku Coast. We mapped the oyster culture rafts and seagrass meadows in Nagatsura-ura Lagoon, Sanriku Coast before and after the tsunami and monitored those and environments after the tsunami by field surveys. Methods. We conducted field surveys and monitored the environmental parameters in Nagatsura-ura Lagoon every month since 2014. We used high-resolution satellite remote sensing images to map oyster culture rafts and seagrass meadows at irregular time intervals from 2006 to 2019 in order to assess their distribution. In 2019, we also used an unmanned aerial vehicle to analyze the spatial variability of the position and the number of ropes suspending oyster clumps beneath the rafts. Results. In 2013, the number and distribution of the oyster culture rafts had been completely restored to the pre-tsunami conditions. The mean area of culture raft increased after the tsunami, and ropes suspending oyster clumps attached to a raft in wider space. Experienced local fishermen also developed a method to attach less ropes to a raft, which was applied to half of the oyster culture rafts to improve oyster growth. The area of seagrass meadows has been expanding since 2013. Although the lagoon had experienced frequent oyster mass mortality events in summer before the tsunami, these events have not occurred since 2011. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami deepened the sill depth and widened the entrance to enhance water exchange and improve water quality in the lagoon. These changes brought the expansion of seagrass meadows and reduction of mass mortality events to allow sustainable oyster culture in the lagoon. Mapping and monitoring of seagrass meadows and aquaculture facilities via satellite remote sensing can provide clear visualization of their temporal changes. This can in turn facilitate effective aquaculture management and conservation of coastal ecosystems, which are crucial for the sustainable development of coastal waters.},

Title = {Monitoring the Bio-optical State of the Baltic Sea Ecosystem with Remote Sensing and Autonomous In Situ Techniques},

Note = {Special Symposium on Baltic Sea Basin, Oslo, NORWAY, AUG 11, 2008},
Abstract = {This chapter focuses on recent advances in water quality monitoring of the Baltic Sea using remote sensing techniques in combination with optical in situ measurements. Here the Baltic Sea ecosystem is observed through its bio-optical properties, which are defined by the concentration of optical in-water constituents governing the spectral attenuation of light. In the introduction, typical geographical patterns and seasonal variations of optical properties and the cause of the mass occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in summer are discussed. The optical characteristic of Baltic Sea waters is clearly dominated by a relatively high load of dissolved organic matter and, during the productive season, by phytoplankton growth, stimulated by nutrients mostly originating from land. In the coastal zone, inorganic suspended matter also has a significant effect on the light attenuation, which increases with proximity to land. The ecological status of the coastal zone may be synthesized using a bio-optical model, summarizing important ecosystem state variables such as terrestrial runoff and phytoplankton production. The optical properties can also be observed with visible, spectral satellite remote sensing providing repetitive and optically consistent data for the whole Baltic Sea basin. Such observations have already significantly influenced our understanding of Baltic Sea dynamics and provide us with a new look into this brackish ecosystem. The focus in this chapter is on the ocean colour sensor `Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer' (MERIS), which since 2002 is flying continuously onboard the European Environmental Satellite ENVISAT, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). The advantage of MERIS data is its good spatial resolution of 300 m allowing the analysis of coastal features and bays of the Baltic Sea. Algorithms to retrieve bio-optical parameters from MERIS data are continuously improved and extended. The MERIS mission will be continued with the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), an optically similar sensor which will be flown on SENTINEL-3, scheduled to be operational until 2023, to assure long-term monitoring of water quality from space. The wide aerial coverage, the frequent repetition and continuity of the satellite observations, the consistency of the measured data, and a relative cost-effectiveness clearly respond to the demands of a modern operational monitoring system, and the requirements of effective Baltic Sea management. An overview of existing monitoring approaches is given, and operational online systems that combine remote sensing and autonomous in situ measurements are discussed.},

Abstract = {The African continent hosts some of the largest freshwater systems worldwide, characterized by a large distribution and variability of surface waters that play a key role in the water, energy and carbon cycles and are of major importance to the global climate and water resources. Freshwater availability in Africa has now become of major concern under the combined effect of climate change, environmental alterations and anthropogenic pressure. However, the hydrology of the African river basins remains one of the least studied worldwide and a better monitoring and understanding of the hydrological processes across the continent become fundamental. Earth Observation, that offers a cost-effective means for monitoring the terrestrial water cycle, plays a major role in supporting surface hydrology investigations. Remote sensing advances are therefore a game changer to develop comprehensive observing systems to monitor Africa's land water and manage its water resources. Here, we review the achievements of more than three decades of advances using remote sensing to study surface waters in Africa, highlighting the current benefits and difficulties. We show how the availability of a large number of sensors and observations, coupled with models, offers new possibilities to monitor a continent with scarce gauged stations. In the context of upcoming satellite missions dedicated to surface hydrology, such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), we discuss future opportunities and how the use of remote sensing could benefit scientific and societal applications, such as water resource management, flood risk prevention and environment monitoring under current global change.},

Abstract = {Groundwater occurrence in semi-arid regions is variable in space and time due to climate patterns, terrain features, and aquifer properties. Thus, accurate delineation of Groundwater Potential Zones (GWPZs) is essential for sustainable water resources management in these environments. The present research aims to delineate and assess GWPZs in a semi-arid basin of San Luis Potosi (SLP), Mexico, through the integration of Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Seven thematic layers (geology, lineament density, land use and land cover, topographic wetness index (TWI), rainfall, drainage density, and slope) were generated in raster format. After the AHP procedure and rank assignment, the thematic layers were integrated using the raster calculator to obtain the GWPZs map. The results indicated that 68.21\% of the area is classified as low groundwater potential, whereas 26.30\% is classified as moderate. Validation was done by assessing the water residence time data from 15 wells distributed in the study area. Furthermore, the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve was obtained, indicating a satisfactory accuracy prediction (AUC = 0.677). This study provides valuable information for decision-makers regarding the conservation and sustainable management of groundwater resources.},

Abstract = {Marine aquaculture has been expanding rapidly in recent years, driven by the growing demand for marine products. However, this expansion has led to increased competition for space and resources with other coastal zone activities, which has resulted in the need for larger facilities and the relocation of operations to offshore areas. Moreover, the complex environment and exposure to environmental conditions and external threats further complicate the sustainable development of the sector. To address these challenges, new and innovative technologies are needed, such as the incorporation of remote sensing and in-situ data for comprehensive and continuous monitoring of aquaculture facilities. This study aims to create an integrated monitoring and decision support system utilizing both satellite and in-situ data to monitor aquaculture facilities on various scales, providing information on water quality, fish growth, and warning signs to alert managers and producers of potential hazards. This study focuses on identifying and estimating parameters that affect aquaculture processes, establishing indicators that can act as warning signs, and evaluating the system's performance in real-life scenarios. The resulting monitoring tool, called ``Aquasafe{''}, was evaluated for its effectiveness and performance by test users through real-life scenarios. The results of the implemented models showed high accuracy, with an R-2 value of 0.67. Additionally, users were generally satisfied with the usefulness of the tool, suggesting that it holds promise for efficient management and decision making in marine aquaculture.},

Abstract = {Global change has a significant impact on the lives of humankind. Earth observation can help to better understand our earth and cope with global change. With the availability of more reliable environmental data sets, digital earth is becoming a popular way to monitor the Earth and provide information to researchers and decision makers on environment protection, disaster mitigation, and social benefits. Therefore, accessing data with lowering costs is essential for digital earth. Nevertheless, there are big challenges in ensuring the feasibility of access to Chinese remote sensing data. This paper outlines some of the main challenges in realizing data sharing, provides an analysis of the core reasons leading to these challenges, and proposes recommendations to overcome the challenges. Amongst the main challenges are differences in data policy to gain access to satellite data, diverse data formats, and delivery mechanisms. The major challenge for the decision makers is to define a more open policy and for the scientist the challenge is to implement these polices for the benefit of all. This paper proposes that governments should adopt policies encouraging more open distribution and access to their data, in order to generate an improved digital earth with increased benefits to human society.},

Abstract = {The movement of residential and commercial land use to rural areas at the periphery of metropolitan areas has long been considered as sing of regional economic vitality. But it is benefits are increasingly balanced against ecosystem impacts, including degradation of air and water quality loss of form land and forests, and socioeconomic effects of economic disparities, social fragmentation and infrastructure costs. In this paper, we used Multitemporal Land sat Thematic Maper (TM) and Spot data for analyzing land use changes in Bonab County for 1989 and 2005. The compared of data maps showed that between 1989 and 2005 the urban land and build areas increased. So, if this process is continued at this trends, we will faced with an environmental crisis in this area and will be destroyed its beautiful natural landscape. The result quantify the land use change patterns in this area and demonstrate the potential of satellite images to provided an accurate, economical means to map and analyze changes in land use cover time that can be used as inputs to land management and policy decisions.},

Abstract = {Land cover and land use change have long been known to influence the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of streams. This study makes use of land cover maps derived from fine resolution satellite imagery and an extensive stream quality dataset to determine the relationship between small watershed health rankings and land cover composition and configuration. Landscape metrics were derived from digital impervious surface area (ISA), tree cover (percent), and agricultural crop maps within Montgomery County, Maryland. Watershed rankings were developed by state and county collaborators (MD-DNR and MCDEP) using extensive biological and chemical measurements. In stepwise logistic regression models the factors accounting for the most variation in stream health ranking were the percent ISA, followed by the percent of tree cover. Riparian buffer zone tree cover was also a significant predictor. Of the metrics that considered the spatial configuration of the landscape, a contagion index and the percent of ISA in the flow path from the ISA to the stream were also found to be significant predictors of stream health. Despite limited ability to characterize landscape configuration or narrow riparian buffer zone vegetation with coarser resolution imagery (from Landsat), model results were not significantly different from those based on the use of fine-resolution ISA information, suggesting that broader area applications of the approach are possible. The results indicate that management practices designed to improve stream water quality should focus on the amount of ISA and tree cover in both the watershed and within the buffer zone.},

Under this water quality risk scenario, long term monitoring arises as a need to recognize, understand and anticipate the HABs outbreaks. However, existing monitoring methodologies are limited when dealing with HABs, thus forcing to make assumptions and decisions based on interpolated and inconsistent data. This conceptual paper attempts to highlight the importance of moving towards an integrated water monitoring methodology, where manual sampling, on-site automatic high-frequency monitoring (AHFM) and remote sensing are aligned to facilitates decision-making. In addition, because of the key role of microbial communities on the drift of aquatic ecosystems and water quality, they should be considered as a key element in HABs monitoring and management programs. In this manner, the biotic knowledge could be integrated into coordinated response plans as ecosystem management tools. Therefore, this holistic approach could provide decision makers and stakeholders an adaptive water resource management grounded on the theory of ecohydrology.

Abstract = {The Group on Earth Observations, GEO, has identified the need to improve disaster risk management by providing timely information relevant to the full disaster management cycle of mitigation, preparedness/warning, response and recovery. The Committee on Earth Observing Satellites, CEOS, as the satellite arm of GEO, has recognized the important role that remote sensing contributes to all phases of the disaster management cycle. Activities to address the satellite information needs and gap analysis for disaster management systems are ongoing. This paper reports on results from two such activities, the southern Africa Flood and Health Pilot addressing annual floods in Namibia, and the GEOSS Architecture for Disasters analysis to enhance the use of satellite data. Direct interaction with Namibian hydrologists to experiment with satellite and in situ data products has helped inform the disasters architecture, providing lessons learned and best practices for the GEO societal benefit areas.},

Abstract = {The use of satellite remote sensing to estimate coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and identify its potential sources is important for monitoring lake water quality and implementing management strategies. In this study, taking Erhai Lake as an example and based on MODIS/Aqua satellite images and in-situ measured data, we used empirical and semi-empirical methods to develop algorithms for CDOM and the fluorescence index (FI370) from remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)). The temporal and spatial distributions of the CDOM concentration and FI370 in Erhai Lake during 2013-2019 were retrieved. The results show the following. (1) The band ratio (Rrs (469)+Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) model could estimate the CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (aCDOM(412)) (R2=0.507), and it was relatively stable. Using the band ratio Rrs(645)/Rrs(469) combined with the chlorophylla (Chl-a) APProach by ELimination (APPEL) model, a semi-empirical inversion model of FI370 performed with satisfactory accuracy (R2=0.550) and was more accurate than the empirical algorithm (R2=0.505). (2) During the period of 2013-2019, the CDOM concentration in Erhai Lake generally decreased from the northern to the central to the southern parts of the lake, and the CDOM concentration was higher in summer and autumn than in spring and winter. FI370 was higher in the northern and western coastal waters and lower in the central, southern and eastern parts of the lake. FI370 in autumn and winter was higher than that in spring and summer. CDOM was affected by both terrestrial and internal sources, and their relative contributions were not the same in different seasons. (3) For different Chl-a concentrations, different CDOM concentration models had better retrieval effects, i.e., Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) and (Rrs(469)+Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) had the best performance when Chl-a 10 mu g/L and Chl-a 10 mu g/L, respectively. The inversion models established in this study offer improved quantifications of the CDOM concentration and the FI370 in Erhai Lake, providing important support for monitoring water quality and implementing efficient management strategies.},

Abstract = {Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been becoming more popular in a variety of industries in recent years, and their popularity is growing continually. These UAVs' rapid development and implementations offer an efficient solution and emerging possibilities for environmental monitoring. UAVs have become a common method for tracking complex environmental processes due to flight scheduling versatility, cost-effectiveness, and high spatial resolution. UAVs are being used in a variety of new applications. Cities all over the world are failing to combat water quality issues due to a shortage of technology capable of successfully supporting management actions. Water quality control and forecasting improvements in water characteristics necessitate the prompt storage of water samples. Drones have the ability to solve this problem. Drones have gained popularity among environmental researchers and water resources, but fewer attentions got for their ability for water sampling payloads. This paper aims to provide a systematic overview of recent contributions of drones with the capability of trapping water from bodies of water, such as drone-based sampling water payloads. The review's solutions are aimed at appealing to these limitations of drones to handle water samples, involving adapted drones with higher payload capacity, trying to simplify an arrest of more significant volumes of water, organizing fieldwork for operation outside visible sight, and integrating sustainable scientific investigative designs. It ends with discussing the problems and potential for possible exploration and applications concerning drone-based water sampling payloads. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatial and Temporal Variations in Water Quality and Land Use in a Semi-Arid Catchment in Bolivia},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Increasing pressures caused by human activities pose a major threat to water availability and quality worldwide. Water resources have been declining in many catchments during recent decades. This study investigated patterns of river water quality status in a peri-urban/rural catchment in Bolivia in relation to land use during a 26 year period. Satellite images were used to determine changes in land use. To assess water quality, data in the dry season from former studies (1991-2014), complemented with newly collected data (2017), were analysed using the National Sanitation Foundation-Water Quality Index method and the Implicit Pollution Index method. The highest rates of relative increase in land use area were observed for forest, urban, and peri-urban areas, whereas relative decreases were observed for water infiltration zones, bare soil, shrubland, and grassland areas. The water quality indices revealed clear water quality deterioration over time, and from catchment headwaters to outlet. Statistical analyses revealed a significant relationship between decreasing water quality and urban expansion. These results demonstrate the need for an effective control programme, preferably based on water quality index approaches as in the present study and including continuous monitoring of runoff water, mitigation of pollution, and water quality restoration, in order to achieve proper water management and quality.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing offers an increasingly wide array of imagery with a broad variety of spectral and spatial resolution, but there are relatively few comparisons of how different sources of data impact the accuracy, cost, and utility of analyses. We evaluated the impact of satellite image spatial resolution (1m from Digital Globe; 30m from Landsat) on land use classification via ArcGIS Feature Analyst, and on total suspended solids (TSS) load estimates from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Camboriu watershed in Southeastern Brazil. We independently calibrated SWAT models, using both land use map resolutions and short-term daily streamflow (discharge) and TSS load data from local gauge stations. We then compared the predicted TSS loads with monitoring data outside the model training period. We also estimated the cost difference for land use classification and SWAT model construction and calibration at these two resolutions. Finally, we assessed the value of information (VOI) of the higher-resolution imagery in estimating the cost-effectiveness of watershed conservation in reducing TSS at the municipal water supply intake. Land use classification accuracy was 82.3\% for 1m data and 75.1\% for 30m data. We found that models using 1m data better predicted both annual and peak TSS loads in the full study area, though the 30m model did better in a sub-watershed. However, the 1m data incurred considerably higher costs relative to the 30m data (\$7000 for imagery, plus additional analyst time). Importantly, the choice of spatial resolution affected the estimated return on investment (ROI) in watershed conservation for the municipal water company that finances much of this conservation, although it is unlikely that this would have affected the company's decision to invest in the program. We conclude by identifying key criteria to assist in choosing an appropriate spatial resolution for different contexts.},

Abstract = {A water quality monitoring and control (WQMC) system is an important tool designed to maintain good water quality in aquaculture. A variety of events could cause WQMC equipment to malfunction. Such a problem would in turn result in the generation of unreliable monitoring information and reduced water quality control. The high-dimensional dataset generated by the WQMC equipment makes fault identification difficult. To solve the problem of fault identification, this paper reduced the effects of autocorrelation on the variables and determined feature space based on dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA). Based on cross-correlation analysis, 24 support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were developed for the multi-SVM model. A vote procedure was proposed to identify fault types and conflicts. To solve the conflicts and reduce incorrect diagnosis results, an amendment based on D-S theory determined which fault contributed more to causing the corresponding symptoms. Experimental results showed that the single-pass accuracy of the multi-SVM model in random sample tests varied from 90\% to 94\% and the combined method could effectively solve the conflicts. Furthermore, the fault identification accuracy could be improved by 3-5\%. Incorrect fault diagnosis results remained, and the successful amendment ratio required further improvement. However, the proposed method was helpful for the maintenance and management of WQMC equipment. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared data provided estimates of surface temperature for delineation of repletion zones in portions of Chincoteague Bay, Virginia. ASTER high spatial resolution sea-surface temperature imagery in conjunction with in situ observations and tidal predictions helped determine the optimal seasonal data for analyses. The selected time series ASTER satellite data sets were analyzed at different tidal phases and seasons in 2004-2006. Skin surface temperatures of ocean and estuarine waters were differentiated by flood tidal penetration and ebb flows. Spatially variable tidal flood penetration was evaluated using discrete seed-pixel area analysis and time series Principal Components Analysis. Results from these techniques provide spatial extent and variability dynamics of tidal repletion, flushing, and mixing, important factors in eutrophication assessment, water quality and resource monitoring, and application of hydrodynamic modeling for coastal estuary science and management.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are an important feature for our society that provides versatile benefits, such as habitat for diverse wildlife, shoreline erosion protection, flood control, and mitigation of climate change through capture and storage of carbon. The aim of this work was to assess the application of nanotechnologies for the restoration of the water quality in the Cascajo Wetlands, Peru, where the water quality was deteriorated. Ceramic-based bio-filters (CBBFs) were used to reduce and buffer the contamination rates of pollutants, whereas micro-nano bubbles (MNBs) were applied to increase the dissolved oxygen and release free radicals in water. Additionally, bio-fence was implemented to prevent water intrusion from the ocean. Remote sensing data through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was used to monitor the water surface condition. With treatment of CBBFs and MNBs for 13 months, we observed reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphate (TP) in the water body, showing removal percentages of 98.5\%, 97.5\%, 98.1\%, 98.5\%, and 94.6\%, respectively, in comparison with values before starting the implementation. The trends of NDVI and EVI over seasons are not completely aligned with the results taken from the wetlands treated with MNBs, CBBFs and bio-fence. While TN was highly correlated with the empirical value of TN based on remote sensing, no correlation was observed between COD and empirical COD. The use of eco-friendly techniques has performed efficiently to remove the pollutant.},

Abstract = {The discussion of environmental issues and sustainable development of society has been growing worldwide in the past decades. The application of remote sensing - the technology of observing, collecting and analyzing the data of planet Earth and its immediate environment from air and space altitudes - has enriched human knowledge of our globe and enhanced our survival therein. Remote sensing continues to be gainfully employed as major tool of international cooperation. Most Remote Sensing education programs worldwide have pointed toward interdisciplinarity, providing a balanced experience for students spanning the domains of engineering, theory, data analysis, applications, and policy. Established in 1984, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) coordinates civil space-borne observations of the Earth, where the participating agencies strive to enhance international coordination and data exchange and to optimize societal benefit. Within CEOS, the Working Group on Capacity Building and Data Democracy (WGCapD) aims at building upon the CEOS Data Democracy Initiative in an effort to increase the capacity of institutions in less developed countries for effective use of Earth Observation data for the benefit of society and to achieve sustainable development. CEOS Agencies have joined efforts to put forward an e-learning course named International e-learning course on Introduction to Remote Sensing Technology. The objective of this paper is to present the results and lessons learned from this first initiative for Anglophone countries in Africa. With a multicultural perception, the article discusses the online education experience and gives some perspectives on further developments to be implemented in a possible second version of the course. The course was free of charge and targeted at University Lecturers who can enhance the multiplier effect and help preparing the practitioners to use remote sensing in Earth sciences. The students came from various backgrounds and application interest areas. The main goal was to create collaborative learning opportunities, providing the learners with an appreciation of current remote sensing issues, the geologic and human processes that impact remotely-gathered data, and how those processes can be measured using remote sensing. The 19 voluntary instructors came from seven space agencies in different countries including Argentina, Brazil, Austria, France, India, South Africa and the US. Over 70 people signed up, 30 participated (South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania) throughout the 16 weeks that the course ran, and 16 undertook all assessments and received the certificate. Course materials included well-organized tutorials, selected datasets and internet links. Two live classroom sessions per week were held, recorded and made available afterwards for downloading. Students were exposed to a variety of resources, software tools and datasets, all of open and free access. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to students and instructors seeking at information that would enable assessment of the contribution of the course as well as suggestions for improvement. Overall, this has been a successful multicultural experience for accessing education in Remote Sensing in developing countries. Despite some limitations, the delivery methodology has proved to be efficient and the outcomes of this online course have been encouraging to pursue other courses in the future.},

Abstract = {Estuaries worldwide are experiencing stress due to increased droughts, which often prompt intervention by environmental managers and government agencies. Effective management of water resources in estuarine systems can be enhanced by new technologies and methodologies to support decision-making processes. Here, we evaluate the use of high-frequency, high-resolution satellite remote sensing within two management-relevant case studies in the San Francisco Estuary and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. We used a remote sensing-derived time series of turbidity maps to (1) identify favorable turbidity conditions for the endangered fish species, delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), during the height of the great California drought in the dry season of 2015, and (2) evaluate changes in turbidity following the installation of an emergency saltwater intrusion barrier. The mapping results indicate several persistent areas of turbidity refugia throughout the summer in the north and west Delta; however, there was infrequent connectivity. A comparison of images captured during ebb tides before and after barrier installation showed a mean increase of 6.6 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) in the San Joaquin River and 4 NTU in Fisherman's Cut. Our assessment of the barrier supports previous findings, which used field samples to conclude barrier installation may have resulted in increased turbidity near the barrier and enhances these findings by providing spatial context.},

Title = {Applications of Remote Sensing and GIS to the Assessment of Riparian Zones for Environmental Restoration in Agricultural Watersheds},
Journal = {GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {263-268},
Abstract = {Geographical design of riparian buffers with long-term vegetation cover for environmental restoration in agricultural watersheds needs to assess how much farmland is located in the buffers of a concerned watershed. Traditionally, this assessment was done by field surveying and manual mapping, which was a time-consuming and costly process for a large region. In this paper, remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) as cost-effective techniques were used to develop a catchments-based approach for identifying critical sites of agricultural riparian buffer restoration. The method was explained through a case study of watershed with 11 catchments and results showed that only four of the catchments were eligible in terms of higher priority for riparian buffer restoration. This research has methodological contributions to the spatial assessment of farming intensities in catchments-based riparian buffers across a watershed and to the geographical designs of variable buffering scenarios within catchments. The former makes the catchments-based management strategy possible, and the latter provides alternative restoration scenarios to meet different management purposes, both of which have direct implementations to the environmental restoration of riparian buffers in the real world. This study, thus, highlights the great potential of RS and GIS applications to the planning and management of riparian buffer restoration in agricultural watersheds.},

Abstract = {Satellite observations provide elements about the environmental status of the major lagoons in northern Egypt (i.e. Lakes Maryut, Edku, Burullus, Manzala and Bardawil) and the adjacent marine area off the Nile River delta, in the southwestern Mediterranean region. Examples are shown of data collected by various sensors onboard the Landsat, Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and EgyptSat-1 satellite series, and by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). The remote sensing-derived parameters (e.g. lagoon size, aquatic vegetation patterns and other water quality parameters) allow to evaluate evolution and degradation of the near-coastal water bodies in the last four decades. The basic ecosystem indicators delivered by the satellite surveys are considered important contributions for the establishment of a sound decision-making process for environmental management purposes, aiming to ensure protection of natural systems and sustainability of human activities.},

Abstract = {United Arab Emirates (UAE) ranks among the list of most water-stressed countries. Various sustainable water policies are suggested and adopted to tackle water scarcity issues. One of them is the implication of Artificial Groundwater Recharge (AGR) sites.

This research scrutinizes the primary thematic layers required for AGR zonation in the Central Northern Emirates and parts of Oman integrating with Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). Several factors, which involve hydrological, geological, water quality measured in terms of total dissolved solids (TDS), groundwater level, euclidean distance from residential areas, were weighted using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), and the weighted overlay was applied to derive the potential AGR map. The AGR map depicts the three best locations within the study area. Geology and geomorphology were the most influential factors affecting the AGR.},

Title = {Middle-term metropolitan water availability index assessment based on synergistic potential of multi-sensor data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {The impact of recent drought and water pollution episodes results in an acute need to project future water availability to assist water managers in water utility infrastructure management within many metropolitan regions. Separate drought and water quality indices previously developed might not be sufficient for the purpose of such an assessment. This paper describes the development of the ``Metropolitan Water Availability Index (MWAI){''} and its potential applications in assessing the middle-term water availability at the watershed scale in a fast growing metropolitan region - the Manatee County near Tampa Bay, Florida, U. S. A. The MWAI framework is based on a statistical approach that seeks to reflect the continuous spatial and temporal variations of both water quantity and quality using a simple numerical index. Such a trend analysis will surely result in the final MWAI values for regional water management systems within a specified range. By using remote sensing technologies and data processing techniques, continuous monitoring of spatial and temporal distributions of key water availability variables, such as evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation, is made achievable. These remote sensing technologies can be ground-based (e. g., radar estimates of rainfall), or based on remote sensing data gathered by aircraft or satellites. Using a middle term historical record, the MWAI was applied to the Manatee County water supplies. The findings clearly indicate that only eight out of twelve months in 2008 had positive MWAI values during the year. Such numerical findings are consistent with the observational evidence of statewide drought events in 2006-2008, which implies the time delay between the ending of severe drought period and the recovery of water availability in MWAI. It is expected that this forward-looking novel water availability forecasting platform will help provide a linkage in methodology between strategic planning, master planning, and the plant operation and adaptations in response to the MWAI implications.},

Title = {A Framework for Sharing and Integrating Remote Sensing and GIS Models Based on Web Service},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Abstract = {Sharing and integrating Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System/Science (GIS) models are critical for developing practical application systems. Facilitating model sharing and model integration is a problem for model publishers and model users, respectively. To address this problem, a framework based on a Web service for sharing and integrating RS and GIS models is proposed in this paper. The fundamental idea of the framework is to publish heterogeneous RS and GIS models into standard Web services for sharing and interoperation and then to integrate the RS and GIS models using Web services. For the former, a ``black box{''} and a visual method are employed to facilitate the publishing of the models as Web services. For the latter, model integration based on the geospatial workflow and semantic supported marching method is introduced. Under this framework, model sharing and integration is applied for developing the Pearl River Delta water environment monitoring system. The results show that the framework can facilitate model sharing and model integration for model publishers and model users.},

Title = {Satellite Remote Sensing of Water Quality Variation in a Semi-Enclosed Bay (Yueqing Bay) under Strong Anthropogenic Impact},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The semi-enclosed bays impacted by heavy anthropogenic activities have weak water exchange and purification capacities. Most of the sea bays have suffered severe eutrophication, water quality deterioration, ecosystem degradation and other problems. Although many countries and local governments have carried out corresponding environmental protection actions, the evaluation of their effectiveness still requires monitoring technology and data support for long-term water environment change. In this study, we take Yueqing Bay, the fourth largest bay in China, as a case to study the satellite-based water quality monitoring and variation analysis. We established a nutrient retrieval model for Yueqing Bay to produce a long-term series of nutrient concentration products in Yueqing Bay from 2013 to 2020, based on Landsat remote sensing images and long-term observation data, combined with support vector machine learning and water temperature and satellite spectra as input parameters, and then we analyzed its spatiotemporal variations and driving factors. In general, nutrient concentrations in the western part of the bay were higher than those in the eastern part. Levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were lower in summer than in spring and winter, and reactive phosphate (PO4-P) levels were lower in summer and higher in autumn. In terms of natural factors, physical effects (e.g., seasonal variations in flow field) and biological effects (e.g., seasonal differences in the intensity of plankton photosynthesis) were the main causes of seasonal differences in nutrient concentration in Yueqing Bay. Nutrient concentration generally increased from 2013 to 2015 but decreased slightly after 2015. Over the past decade, the economy and industry of Yueqing Bay basin have developed rapidly. Wastewater resulting from anthropogenic production and consumption was transported via streams into Yueqing Bay, leading to the continuous increase in nutrient concentrations (the variation rates: a(DIN)> 0, a(PO4-P)> 0), which directly or indirectly caused high nutrient concentrations in some areas of the bay (e.g., Southwest Shoal at the mouth of Yueqing Bay). After 2015, the various ecological remediation policies adopted by cities around Yueqing Bay have mitigated, to some extent, the increasing nutrient concentration trends (the variation rates: a(DIN)< 0, a(PO4-P)< 0), but not significantly (P > 0.1). The environmental restoration of Yueqing Bay also requires continuous and long-term ecological protection and restoration work to be effective. This research can provide a reference for ecological environment monitoring and remote sensing data application for similar semi-enclosed bays, and support the sustainable development of the bay.},

Title = {Groundwater in the Arab region: making the invisible visible},

Abstract = {The Arab region is one of the most water scarce regions in the world with 19 states below the water scarcity threshold including 13 states below the absolute water scarcity. Groundwater is heavily relied upon and it is the primary source of freshwater in more than 11 Arab States, yet the invisible and complex character of groundwater being underground and out of sight has not given it the due attention it deserves. Hence, this report explores the importance of groundwater and the challenges it is facing, with the aim of bolstering its status to a strategic resource for the Arab region. Amid the water scarcity situation, limited renewable groundwater resources continue to be exploited at an unsustainable rate, exceeding the natural recharge rates. Excessive use of groundwater, especially by the agricultural sector combined with low efficiency, has led to the decline in groundwater storage in more than two thirds of the Arab region, where the area of decline has doubled in 2018-2019 compared to 2002. In some countries over 88\% of all irrigation water comes from groundwater compared to a global average of just over 37\%. Moreover, it is projected that by 2050, available groundwater per capita will have decreased by more than half since the beginning of the century and 17 Arab States, accounting for 79\% of the total population, will be below the absolute water scarcity threshold. In addition to their excessive use, groundwater resources are also threatened by anthropo-genic pollution sources, from agricultural and industrial practices and from sea water intrusion in coastal cities. The deterioration in the quality of groundwater resources, both due to overexploita-tion and pollution is aggravating the problem of water scarcity. For example, in Beirut, seawater intrusion has shifted inland between 500 and 1,200 m from 1970 reference point. In Gaza, only 25\% of wastewater is treated due the lack of proper wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which is further complicated by the occupation that has restricted access to natural resources. This is alarming knowing that groundwater is central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the region. It is directly linked to SDG6 and central to achieving many other SDGs such as SDG2 for ending hunger. It is also an important component of climate change adaptation, having a high buffer capacity against drought. Accordingly, the projected impacts of climate change on water resources in the region, will further increase dependency on groundwater at a time when groundwater recharge is also projected to decrease, necessitating conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater. The impacts of climate change on groundwater at the aquifer level is showcased by ESCWA on the Beni-Amir aquifer, Morocco and the Eocene aquifer, Palestine. Results from the study on Beni-Amir aquifer indicate that the water table is expected to decrease 10 to 25 m (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) by end of century, resulting in partial depletion of resources in the top three layers of the aquifer system, particularly in the northern Beni-Amir area. In the case of Palestine, the results on the Eocene aquifer showed that in the 2041-2060 horizon, the average precipitation is expected to decrease in all scenarios between 3\% and 12\%, whereas the recharge in 5 out of 6 precipitation scenarios showed a reduction by 12\%-16\%. Consequently, with no decrease in the aquifer pumping, the water levels in all scenarios will drop. The declining availability of groundwater resources due to increased consumption, develop-ment demands, inefficient use and climate change should prompt Arab States to explore innova-tive and integrated governance frameworks to improve groundwater resources management and ensure equitable access for current and future generations to this strategic resource. Groundwater governance has been historically weak in the Arab region, characterized by fragmented legislations and policies, limited funding, lack of coordination and lack of data and knowledge. More recent evaluation of the management of groundwater resources through the SDG indicator 6.5.1 report-ing mechanisms on the degree of implementation of IWRM has unfortunately reinforced some of the main challenges listed above in the Arab region mainly in terms of lack of implementation of management tools and proper financing. In response to the lack or fragmentation of groundwater management policies, ESCWA developed regional groundwater abstraction management guidelines offering a unified approach to deal with uncontrolled groundwater exploitation and use. Groundwater governance is further complicated by transboundary aquifers. In fact, all coun-tries, except for Comoros, share at least one aquifer with their neighboring countries. These trans-boundary aquifers cover almost 58\% of the Arab region's total area. Some of these aquifers are directly connected to surface-water hydrological systems and should also be conjunctively man-aged. Other transboundary aquifers contain fossil groundwater reserves requiring specialized legal, policy and management frameworks that consider their non-renewable character. The status of regional transboundary water cooperation is captured in a recent regional report prepared by ESCWA on the progress on SDG indicator 6.5.2 in the Arab region for the year 2021. The report revealed the challenges faced by the Arab states that hinder the establishment of well-developed cooper-ation frameworks which are mainly linked to lack of knowledge and data exchange and financial constraints. However, there are encouraging signs where cooperation on transboundary aquifers has progressed, including a Joint Authority for the Nubian sandstone Aquifer, a cooperation framework for the Senegalo-Mauritanian Aquifer, a signed agreement for the Saq-Ram Aquifer, and a consulta-tion mechanism on the North Western Sahar Aquifer System. These cooperation agreements should be maintained and further developed by holding regular meetings, coordinating objectives and management plans, and regularly exchanging data and information. Regional knowledge exchange around these agreements should be enforced. Advances in technologies provide an opportunity to fill the data and information gap that hin-ders the management of groundwater. Integrated remote sensing data offer a solution to assess the groundwater status. In addition, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is one of the most important solutions to consider for securing water supply and for improving groundwater quality where it is deteriorating. MAR is already used in more than 44 sites across the Arab region. Technologies can assist in selection of where MAR can be a potential solution for the region and for improving the water security. Furthermore, in response to the need for availing more data and information on groundwater and improving access to such data as established through the reporting on SDG indicators 6.5.1 and 6.5.2, ESCWA will be initiating an Arab Groundwater Digital Knowledge Platform. This platform aims to increase access to regional knowledge and information on groundwater resources through a dedicated digital interactive platform. Finally, the relation of groundwater to water scarcity, human activity, transboundary water cooperation, climate change, and water governance is highlighted in the following key findings.},

Abstract = {A strategy for developing sediment transport information for storm water planning and management is described. The strategy links location-based and intensity-based development scenarios with potential water quality impacts to a stream system and at a watershed outlet and (1) is based on sediment transport calculations; (2) develops information that supports community decision making; and (3) is consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Phase II storm water requirements and other guidance on watershed management. The strategy is an effort to incorporate the impact of site-specific watershed characteristics into storm water ordinances. This effort was undertaken to provide a rational means for a community to differentiate the sediment contributions from alternative scenarios at alternative locations. One of the options available with differentiation information is the ability to negotiate and approve pollutant ``trades{''} between different development practices in different locations such that water quality standards are maintained throughout the trading area. The Agricultural Non-Point Source (AGNPS) pollutant modeling system was used in the community of Ashland, Mo. to provide an example of the methodology.},

Title = {Landscape index for indicating water quality and application to master plan of regional lake cluster restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding the relation between landscape pattern and water quality is essential to making a master plan for restoration of regional lake and wetland clusters, which has not yet been well resolved. Here, we studied the impacts of landscape pattern changes on water quality over lake clusters, taking the aquaculture area in the Lixia River hinterland of China as a case. Multi-temporal Landsat series of remote sensing data from 1985 to 2018 was used and space-for-time substitution (SFTS) method was applied to explore the relationship between landscape pattern and water quality. Results showed that wetland and free water surface were the dominant classes of the lake cluster in 1985 and 1990, but they began to rapidly decrease from 1995 to 2000. The enclosure aquaculture increased rapidly since 1995 and became the dominant class between 1995 and 2018. The patch density of aquaculture water (PD\_A) increased from 0.09n/km2 in 1985 to 0.34n/km2 in 2018, with the largest degree of fragmentation in 2000. However, the growth rate of PD\_A declined significantly after the enactment of the lake ecological protection policies. The SFTS results showed that PD\_A had positive correlation with total nitrogen (TN) (r = 0.26), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) (r = 0.21), and Chlorophyta (r = 0.33), and the water quality degraded with increasing PD\_A. Hence, PD\_A could be a water quality indicator of lakes in the Lixia River hinterland. The study is expected to provide a viable method to design regional restoration plan for degraded and over-developed wetland areas.},

Title = {Validity of SeaDAS water constituents retrieval algorithms in Australian tropical coastal waters},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {This paper reports an assessment of the performance of the seven global empirical and semi-analytical chlorophyll and bulk IOP retrieval algorithms implemented in SeaDAS, for the local conditions in tropical waters off the Australian northeast coast. An approach based on radiative transfer simulations was used providing systematic assessments. The study shows that when coloured dissolved organic matter ( CDOM) and non- algal particle ( NAP) concentrations are low, the seven algorithms tested, as expected, can retrieve chlorophyll with an error of, at best, 75\% for 80 - 90\% of the cases. The accuracy generally degrades rapidly with increasing CDOM and NAP concentrations. For the semianalytical algorithms ( bulk IOP retrieval enabled), the QAA algorithm achieved a better result at retrieving the total absorption, a, backscattering, bb and backscattering by particles, bb(p). However, none of the algorithms can break down the total absorption into components with reasonable accuracy. The study indicates that without incorporating regional and seasonal knowledge of specific IOPs the accuracy in water constituent retrievals from remote sensing is poor, hindering the use of remote sensing in water quality management.},

Title = {Prediction of chlorophyll a concentration using HJ-1 satellite imagery for Xiangxi Bay in Three Gorges Reservoir},
Journal = {WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-80},
Abstract = {Since the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir in 2003, algal blooms have frequently been observed in it. The chlorophyll a concentration is an important parameter for evaluating algal blooms. In this study, the chlorophyll a concentration in Xiangxi Bay, in the Three Gorges Reservoir, was predicted using HJ-1 satellite imagery. Several models were established based on a correlation analysis between in situ measurements of the chlorophyll a concentration and the values obtained from satellite images of the study area from January 2010 to December 2011. Chlorophyll a concentrations in Xiangxi Bay were predicted based on the established models. The results show that the maximum correlation is between the reflectance of the band combination of B4/(B2+B3) and in situ measurements of chlorophyll a concentration. The root mean square errors of the predicted values using the linear and quadratic models are 18.49 mg/m(3) and 18.52 mg/m(3), respectively, and the average relative errors are 37.79\% and 36.79\%, respectively. The results provide a reference for water bloom prediction in typical tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir and contribute to large-scale remote sensing monitoring and water quality management.},

Abstract = {Efficient analysis and interpretation of satellite imagery can contribute to rapid mapping for disaster management. Earth observation capabilities from national, European and international community actors are used to respond to major disasters around the world, for humanitarian aid and security. Satellite derived information needs to be used in combination with additional data to be presented in a proper geospatial context for the work of civil protection agencies and relief organizations. When disasters happen, reliance is placed on any type of geoinformation that might be available in a short period of time. The paper presents the main goal to be achieved by implementing the project Platform for GeoInformation in Support of Disaster Management (GEODIM) under the frame of PCCA 2012 Programme, coordinated by the National Meteorological Administration of Romania, University of Agronomical Sciences and Veterinary Medicine being a partner. The GEODIM project is focused to develop a downstream emergency response service for contributing to current disaster and risk management approach based on Earth observation data. The service will enable socioeconomic benefits for Romania in terms of future decisions on disaster and risk management policies by providing decision makers with better, more complete, timely and reliable information.},

Abstract = {The increasing availability of Earth Observation (EO) technologies has provided new opportunities for a wide range of urban applications, such as mapping and monitoring of the urban environment, socio-economic estimations, characterization of urban climate, analysis of regional and global impacts and urban security and emergency preparedness. However, a gap exists between the research-focused results offered by the urban EO community and the application of these data and products by urban planners and decision makers. Hence, the main objective of the GEOURBAN (ExploitinG Earth Observation in sUstainable uRBan plAnning \& maNagement) project is to bridge this gap by demonstrating the ability of current and future EO systems to depict parameters of urban structure and urban environmental quality at detailed level. This paper introduces the conceptual approach towards the integration of EO-based geo-information into urban and spatial planning and presents and discusses first results of the indicators developed and evaluated by using remote sensing data.},

Title = {Comparative Data Mining Analysis for Information Retrieval of MODIS Images: Monitoring Lake Turbidity Changes at Lake Okeechobee, Florida},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {3},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {In the remote sensing field, a frequently recurring question is: Which computational intelligence or data mining algorithms are most suitable for the retrieval of essential information given that most natural systems exhibit very high non-linearity. Among potential candidates might be empirical regression, neural network model, support vector machine, genetic algorithm/genetic programming, analytical equation, etc. This paper compares three types of data mining techniques, including multiple non-linear regression, artificial neural networks, and genetic programming, for estimating multi-temporal turbidity changes following hurricane events at Lake Okeechobee, Florida. This retrospective analysis aims to identify how the major hurricanes impacted the water quality management in 2003-2004. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra 8-day composite imageries were used to retrieve the spatial patterns of turbidity distributions for comparison against the visual patterns discernible in the in-situ observations. By evaluating four statistical parameters, the genetic programming model was finally selected as the most suitable data mining tool for classification in which the MODIS band 1 image and wind speed were recognized as the major determinants by the model. The multi-temporal turbidity maps generated before and after the major hurricane events in 2003-2004 showed that turbidity levels were substantially higher after hurricane episodes. The spatial patterns of turbidity confirm that sediment-laden water travels to the shore where it reduces the intensity of the light necessary to submerged plants for photosynthesis. This reduction results in substantial loss of biomass during the post-hurricane period.},

Abstract = {Assessing and monitoring water quality status through timely, cost effective and accurate manner is of fundamental importance for numerous environmental management and policy making purposes. Therefore, there is a current need for validated methodologies which can effectively exploit, in an unsupervised way, the enormous amount of earth observation imaging datasets from various high-resolution satellite multispectral sensors. To this end, many research efforts are based on building concrete relationships and empirical algorithms from concurrent satellite and in-situ data collection campaigns. We have experimented with Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 multi-temporal satellite data, coupled with hyperspectral data from a field spectroradiometer and in-situ ground truth data with several physico-chemical and other key monitoring indicators. All available datasets, covering a 4 years period, in our case study Lake Karla in Greece, were processed and fused under a quantitative evaluation framework. The performed comprehensive analysis posed certain questions regarding the applicability of single empirical models across multi-temporal, multi-sensor datasets towards the accurate prediction of key water quality indicators for shallow inland systems. Single linear regression models didn't establish concrete relations across multi-temporal, multi-sensor observations. Moreover, the shallower parts of the inland system followed, in accordance with the literature, different regression patterns. Landsat 7 and 8 resulted in quite promising results indicating that from the recreation of the lake and onward consistent per-sensor, per-depth prediction models can be successfully established. The highest rates were for chl-a ( r(2) = 89.80\%), dissolved oxygen ( r(2) = 88.53\%), conductivity ( r(2) = 88.18\%), ammonium ( r(2) = 87.2\%) and pH ( r(2) = 86.35\%), while the total phosphorus ( r(2) = 70.55\%) and nitrates ( r(2) = 55.50\%) resulted in lower correlation rates.},

Abstract = {Satellite Earth Observation plays a fundamental role within the context of integrated monitoring of coastal and marine waters, providing quantitative estimates of oceanographic and bio-geophysical parameters. Water quality parameters estimated from satellite optical multispectral imaging allow to identify spatial variability of bio-geophysical variables, like near-surface concentrations of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter (TSM), which is higher in coastal areas due to riverine freshwater input, sediment resuspension processes, human activities, thermal conditions and fine scale circulation patterns. This research study presents a data analysis system that integrates processing chains to regionally calibrate retrieval algorithms for the estimation of seawater bio-geophysical parameters from various optical multispectral satellite data, and to analyze satellite time series in order to extract meaningful information and maps. A test case for central Adriatic coastal zone has been realized in order to demonstrate the operational capability for monitoring water quality, and depending on this, the nutrient availability and the sanitary status of the farmed species in aquaculture sites. In situ data, acquired within a monitoring sampling plan that ARTA Abruzzo carried out along the central Adriatic coast, have been used to calibrate retrieval algorithms, exploited to produce time series maps of Chl-a and turbidity. Results show performances of calibrated algorithms and the data system suitability to contribute to the production of monitoring maps and indicators, informing domain specific decision making and supporting services for integrated coastal zone management.},

Abstract = {For testing the integration of the remote sensing related technologies into the water quality monitoring programs of Lake Garda (the largest Italian lake), the spatial and spectral resolutions of Hyperion and the capability of physics-based approaches were considered highly suitable. Hyperion data were acquired on 22nd July 2003 and water quality was assessed (i) defining a bio-optical model, (ii) converting the Hyperion atsensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectances, and (iii) adopting a bio-optical model inversion technique. The bio-optical model was parameterised using specific inherent optical properties of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. A MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction code, complemented with an air/water interface correction was used to convert Hyperion at-sensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectance values. These reflectance values were comparable to in situ reflectance spectra measured during the Hyperion overpass, except at longer wavelengths (beyond 700 nm), where reflectance values were contaminated by severe atmospheric adjacency effects. Chlorophyll-a and tripton concentrations were retrieved by inverting two Hyperion bands selected using a sensitivity analysis applied to the bio-optical model. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the assessment of coloured dissolved organic matter was not achievable in this study due to the limited coloured dissolved organic matter concentration range of the lake, resulting in reflectance differences below the environmental measurement noise of Hyperion. The chlorophyll-a and tripton image-products were compared to in situ data collected during the Hyperion overpass, both by traditional sampling techniques (8 points) and by continuous flow-through systems (32 km). For chlorophyll-a the correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-inferred concentrations was 0.77 (data range from 1.30 to 2.16 mg m(-3)). The Hyperion-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations also match most of the flow-through transect data. For tripton, the validation was constrained by variable re-suspension phenomena. The correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-derived concentrations increased from 0.48 to 0.75 (data range from 0.95 to 2.13 g m(-3)) if the sampling data from the re-suspension zone was avoided. The comparison of Hyperionderived tripton concentrations and flow-through transect data exhibited a similar mismatch. The results of this research suggest further studies to address compatibilities of validation methods for water body features with a high rate of change, and to reduce the contamination by atmospheric adjacency effects on Hyperion data at longer wavelengths in Alpine environment. The transferability of the presented method to other sensors and the ability to assess water quality independent from in situ water quality data, suggest that management relevant applications for Lake Garda (and other subalpine lakes) could be supported by remote sensing.

Title = {Tempo-spatial dynamics of water quality and its response to river flow in estuary of Taihu Lake based on GOCI imagery},

Abstract = {Knowledge of tempo-spatial dynamics of water quality and its response to river flow is important for the management of lake water quality because river discharge associated with rainstorms can be an important source of pollutants to the estuary. Total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and total suspended matter (TSM) are important indexes of water quality and important factors influencing eutrophication and algal blooms. In this study, remote sensing was used to monitor these indexes to investigate the effects of river discharge on the estuary of Taihu Lake by the largest inflow river which is Chendong River using a total of 136 Geostationary Ocean Color Images (GOCI). In situ datasets collected during the four cruise experiments on Taihu Lake between 2011 and 2015 were used to develop the TP, Chl-a, and TSM inversion models based on simple empirical algorithms: 154 points for TP (mg/L), 114 for Chl-a (mu g/L), and 181 for TSM (mg/L). The spatial and temporal changes of the concentration of the three parameters in the Chendong River estuary were analyzed by combining the GOCI data, the flow of the Chendong River, and meteorological data throughout the year in 2014. The several key findings are as follows: (1) In summer and autumn, TP, Chl-a, and TSM contents were significantly higher than in winter and spring. TP and Chl-a have a few similar distribution characteristics. And organic suspended matter in summer was the main reason for the increase of the TSM concentration. (2) The severe surface erosion in the rivers cannot be ignored; the high erodibility is an important factor in the increase of TP and TSM concentrations in the estuary. The concentration of the water quality parameter showed exponential decay with distance from the shore. The concentration decreased slowly after 12 km and then remained essentially constant. (3) TP content in the Chendong River estuary decreased under steady flow inputs and dramatically increased when the flow became large. The increase in Chl-a content was linked to higher levels of TP and good weather conditions after the rain event. Higher flow rates mainly play a dilution role for the Chl-a concentration. Erosion of the surface soil via rainfall is a major source of TSM to the estuary. This paper firstly analyzes tempo-spatial dynamics of water quality and its response to river flow in estuary of Taihu Lake, helps to further understand the impact of river input on lake water quality, and is important for lake eutrophication.},

Abstract = {Water has historically been considered a renewable resource, however in the last century a sustained degradation of its quality has been observed, both in continental and oceanic systems due to the anthropic impact. Added to this problem, a new global threat global appears, climate change, causing severe droughts or extraordinary floods in different regions of the planet. In this framework, the management of water resources and satellite monitoring represent a central point in public policies, since they allow us to anticipate and adapt to these disturbances. In this work, satellite information is use to perform an analysis of the annual evolution of the water quality of the San Roque reservoir, Cordoba, and its relationship with the occurrence of fires, rainfall and urban growth for the period 2001-2016. Water quality is evaluated from a time series of chlorophyll-a generated with MODIS-TERRA data and previously validated for the water body of study. The constructed and burned area is calculated from the classification of LANDSAT-TM / ETM + / OLI images for the basin. Accumulated precipitation is obtained from the products of NASA's TRMM mission. The temperature in the water reservoir is also analyzed, obtained from MODIS-TERRA data. Finally, correlation analysis between the mentioned variables is studied.},

Title = {A spatiotemporal monitoring model of TSM and TDS in arid region lakes utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {216},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The assessment of lake water quality is crucial for protecting and managing natural resources. Total suspended matter (TSM) and total dissolved solids (TDS) are significant parameters in evaluating lake water quality, and their concentration levels provide useful information about the health of the ecosystem. However, measuring TSM and TDS concentrations in remote arid areas can be challenging, necessitating the development of a simple, efficient, and cost-effective monitoring system. In this study, the aim was to retrieve TDS and TSM concentrations in the arid region using an empirical and physics-based method simultaneously. Measured data and remote sensing images for Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs (CNRs), Iran, were used to establish the TSM and TDS concentration model. Twenty-seven Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data acquired from 2018 to 2021 were employed to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of TDS and TSM concentrations. The results indicate that Sentinel-2 MSI data is a productive tool for retrieving TSM concentration using the Case-2 Regional/Coastal Color (C2RCC) processor, with a high level of performance in the dry ecosystem of CNRs (R2 = 0.92). Furthermore, the Bayesian regularization artificial neural network (BRANN) algorithm was used to evaluate TDS concentration, and the results demonstrated that the BRANN algorithm outperforms other models, with a high level of performance (R2 = 0.89). It is noteworthy that evaluating TDS concentration is generally more challenging than TSM. The study provides a valuable model for monitoring TSM and TDS concentrations in remote arid areas using Sentinel-2 MSI data. The proposed approach can facilitate effective spatiotemporal monitoring of TSM and TDS concentrations and aid in the evaluation of lake water quality, specifically in regions where in-situ measurements are not feasible. The findings have significant implications for the management and conservation of natural resources in arid and remote regions.},

Title = {A Satellite-Based Assessment of the Distribution and Biomass of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in the Optically Shallow Basin of Lake Biwa},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Assessing the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), particularly in shallow lakes, is essential for effective lake management activities. In the present study we applied satellite remote sensing (a Landsat-8 image) in order to evaluate the SAV coverage area and its biomass for the peak growth period, which is mainly in September or October (2013 to 2016), in the eutrophic and shallow south basin of Lake Biwa. We developed and validated a satellite-based water transparency retrieval algorithm based on the linear regression approach (R-2 = 0.77) to determine the water clarity (2013-2016), which was later used for SAV classification and biomass estimation. For SAV classification, we used Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and a binary decision tree, giving an overall classification accuracy of 86.5\% and SAV classification accuracy of 76.5\% (SAV kappa coefficient 0.74), based on in situ measurements. For biomass estimation, a new Spectral Decomposition Algorithm was developed. The satellite-derived biomass (R-2 = 0.79) for the SAV classified area gives an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26 kg dry weight (DW) m(-2). The mapped SAV coverage area was 20\% and 40\% in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Estimated SAV biomass for the mapped area shows an increase in recent years, with values of 3390 t (tons, dry weight) in 2013 as compared to 4550 t in 2016. The maximum biomass density (4.89 kg DW m(-2)) was obtained for a year with high water transparency (September 2014). With the change in water clarity, a slow change in SAV growth was noted from 2013 to 2016. The study shows that water clarity is important for the SAV detection and biomass estimation using satellite remote sensing in shallow eutrophic lakes. The present study also demonstrates the successful application of the developed satellite-based approach for SAV biomass estimation in the shallow eutrophic lake, which can be tested in other lakes.},

Abstract = {Over the globe, efforts are being made to collect data and develop an adequate water resource information system for optimising its use. India is the largest consumer of water, with an estimated usage of around 300 cubic kilometers per year. Punjab, a north-western state of India, is an example of severe crises aquifer depletion due to unconstrained consumption of groundwater, leading to degradation of its quantity as well as quality. Thus it is of great importance to compile up-to-date information about the water requirement for its appropriate and sustainable use. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) are the technologies that can provide efficient and effective information system to tackle the water quality \& water supply planning parameters. Thus, under the present study, a web-enabled water resource information system has been developed in the GIS environment for the SAS (Sahibzada Ajit Singh) Nagar and Patiala districts of Punjab by using the open source software MS4W and pmapper. This system provides digital information of natural, such as drainage, and man-made features like roads, canals, and tube wells with their location and so on, and also provide information related to water level, water quality of wells, and well depth for the study area. Such an information system can be very helpful for the administrators and can serve as a decision support system for planners and policy makers so that the areas where problems related to water quality can be identified and focused upon. The system can provide an effective and meaningful direction for the planning and development of both districts.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing has been used extensively to provide quantitative information on the distribution of phytoplankton in inland waters through the surrogate mapping of chlorophyll a, but as chlorophyll a is common to almost all species of phytoplankton it cannot provide any information on the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities. However, the varied optical properties of phytoplankton taxa may present a means to their discrimination via remote sensing data. This paper presents the results of an experimental study in which the spectral dissimilarities of brown, green, blue-green and red algae were examined with a view to establishing a basis upon which broad changes in phytoplankton communities might be monitored through remote sensing. Pseudo phytoplankton communities were simulated in a series of mesocosm experiments from which spectral reflectance measurements were acquired. The results demonstrated that the phytoplankton colour groups examined were indeed spectrally dissimilar. The spectral distinction between colour groups was noted to be greatest at high concentrations of chlorophyll a and between pseudo-communities dominated by a single species; spectral differences were lower in mixed pseudo-communities with co-dominant species. Moreover, it proved possible to quantify the concentration of two potential biomarker pigments, fucoxanthin and C-phycocyanin, through the derivation of simple spectral indices. The coincidental presence of varying concentrations of SPM (SPIM and SPOM) caused significant attenuation of the spectral response of the pseudo-communities and affected the accuracy of biomarker pigment estimation. It is considered that the realisation of a remote sensing technique for the discrimination of phytoplankton taxa in inland waters would be an extremely useful tool for limnological research and water resource management and thus the future application of this research to inland waters is also discussed.

Abstract = {Tropical wetlands support high biodiversity and ecological services, but in most areas they suffer from a paucity of baseline data to support management. We demonstrate how modern technology can be used to develop ecological baseline data including, landuse/landcover, water depth, water quality, lake-level fluctuation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). For the first time we quantified and mapped these metrics for the Paya Indah Wetlands, Malaysia using the new high-spatial-resolution World View 2 imagery. Landuse/landcover classifications were validated by field visits and visual interpretation of the imagery. NDVI was extracted based on red and near infra-red 2 bands. Topo to Raster method was used for interpolation of water depths. Annual mean of a water-quality index and annual water-level fluctuation of lakes were interpolated across lakes using the inverse-distance weighting method. Qualitative and quantitative accuracy assessment of classification (75 \% overall accuracy, user's accuracies ranged from 60 \% to 90 \% and producer's accuracy ranged from 60 \% to 97 \%) was promising and clearly illustrated that World View 2 imagery can yield fast and reasonably precise identification of ecosystem characteristics for ecological baselines.},

Abstract = {Sediment yields from terrestrial catchments impact the water quality and ecosystem condition of receiving water bodies but the extent of impact can be unclear due to coincident processes, such as tidal or wind driven resuspension of benthic sediments. Understanding the magnitude and dynamics of catchment impacts on coastal water quality is vital to help inform catchment management priorities, and to assess potential responses including potential time lags. We used 14 years of turbidity monitoring in rivers draining to Western Port to estimate suspended sediment load time-series. We investigated the magnitude and timescales of linkage between river loads and a remote sensing record of coastal water quality. Results were evaluated in the context of knowledge about long-term sediment sources to, and storage volumes within, the bay. The findings will help to guide priorities for protecting bay ecosystems and for managing erosion in the catchments and within the bay. The efficiency of sediment delivery to the bay, historical changes in seagrass extent within the bay, and conceptual modelling of seagrass responses to sediment inputs are considered in companion papers.},

Title = {Fire Impacts on Water Resources: A Remote Sensing Methodological Proposal for the Brazilian Cerrado},
Journal = {FIRE-SWITZERLAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Fire events are increasing in frequency, duration, and severity worldwide. The combination of ash and uncovered land might increase the transportation of pollutants into the streams, potentially affecting the water supply systems. The intensifying fires in Brazil's Cerrado biome, responsible for 70\% of the country's water supply, give rise to profound ecological, climatic, and socio-economic concerns that require urgent and effective mitigation strategies. However, little attention has been paid to the consequences of fire events on water resources in the region. In this study, the Fire Impact on Water Resources Index (FIWRI) is proposed and applied in six different water supply watersheds to analyse fire behaviour from 2003 to 2020 and its potential impact on inland water bodies. This is the first remote-sensing-based index for fire impact on water resources developed for the Brazilian territory, to support water management on a watershed scale and uses variables such as terrain slope, river proximity, and vegetation to classify fire events as having a low to high potential to contaminate water bodies. We observed that all six water supply watersheds suffered frequent fire events, with different FIWRI proportions, which ranged from High to Low FIWRI. The proposed index could be used in real-time fire monitoring alert systems in order to support water supply management.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on lagoons, estuaries, and lakes and considering the highly dynamic behavior of these systems, methods for the continuous and spatially distributed retrieval of water quality are becoming vital for their correct monitoring and management. Water temperature is certainly one of the most important drivers that influence the overall state of coastal systems. Traditionally, lake, estuarine, and lagoon temperatures are observed through point measurements carried out during field campaigns or through a network of sensors. However, sporadic measuring campaigns or probe networks rarely attain a density sufficient for process understanding, model development/validation, or integrated assessment. Here, we develop and apply an integrated approach for water temperature monitoring in a shallow lagoon which incorporates satellite and in-situ data into a mathematical model. Specifically, we use remote sensing information to constrain large-scale patterns of water temperature and high-frequency in situ observations to provide proper time constraints. A coupled hydrodynamic circulation-heat transport model is then used to propagate the state of the system forward in time between subsequent remote sensing observations. Exploiting the satellite data high spatial resolution and the in situ measurements high temporal resolution, the model may act a physical interpolator filling the gap intrinsically characterizing the two monitoring techniques.},

Title = {Retrieving Inland Reservoir Water Quality Parameters Using Landsat 8-9 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI Sensors with Empirical Multivariate Regression},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Improving water quality is one of the top priorities in the global agenda endorsed by the United Nations. To ensure the achievement of this goal, governments have developed plans to continuously monitor the status of inland waters. Remote sensing provides a low-cost, high-frequency, and practical complement to monitoring systems that can cover a large area. However, it is crucial to evaluate the suitability of sensors for retrieving water quality parameters (WQPs), owing to differences in spatial and spectral sampling from different satellites. Taking Shanmei Reservoir in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province as a case study, this study collected and sorted the water quality data measured at the site in 2020 to 2022 and Landsat 8-9 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images, simulated the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, algae density, and turbidity using empirical multivariate regression, and explored the relationship between different WQPs using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the fitting effect of Landsat OLI data was better than that of the Sentinel-2 MSI data. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values of Chl-a, algal density, and turbidity simulated by Landsat OLI data were 0.70, 0.81, and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, the parameters of its validation equation were also smaller than those of Sentinel MSI data. The spatial distribution of three key WQPs retrieved from Landsat OLI data shows their values were generally low, with the mean values of the Chl-a concentration, algal density, and turbidity being 4.25 mu g/L, 4.11 x 10(6) cells/L, and 1.86 NTU, respectively. However, from the end of February 2022, the values of the Chl-a concentration and algae density in the reservoir gradually increase, and the risk of water eutrophication also increases. Therefore, it is still necessary to pay continuous attention and formulate corresponding water quality management measures. The correlation analysis shows that the three key WQPs in this study have a high correlation with pH, water temperature (WT), and dissolved oxygen (DO). The results of PCA showed that pH, DO, Chl-a concentration, WT, TN, and CODMn were dominant in PC1, explaining 35.57\% of the total variation, and conductivity, algal density, and WT were dominant in PC2, explaining 13.34\% of the total variation. Therefore, the water quality of the Shanmei Reservoir can be better evaluated by measuring pH, conductivity, and WT at the monitoring station, or by establishing the regression fitting equations between DO, CODMn, and TN. The regression algorithm used in this study can identify the most important water quality features in the Shanmei Reservoir, which can be used to monitor the nutritional status of the reservoir and provide a reference for other similar inland water bodies.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) are individually and collaboratively strengthening worldwide ability for agencies to manage the disasters lifecycle. The Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) of GEO has, through an agile development process, deployed and tested advanced information systems for Earth Observations based on interoperability arrangements. In particular, AIP has focused on several disaster management scenarios resulting in an architecture that has improved the ready viability and usability of data for disasters. CEOS is constructing a reference architecture, intended to streamline access to satellite data and services for disaster management and risk assessment. The CEOS approach aims to support disaster management activities with satellite information in a holistic fashion, taking account of their overlaps and interdependencies. Jointly GEO and CEOS are now working to align the approaches for disaster management to describe enterprise components and improve understanding of contributed systems and their roles. The coordination has lead to refinements of the Disaster Management Scenario via further implementation in AIP-5. By collaborating via the CEOS working groups and the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) communities of practice, these efforts are intended to engage the international community focused on disaster management and risk assessment to fully utilize remote sensing resources for societal benefit.},

Abstract = {The Romanian North Western coastal and shelf zones of the Black Sea and Danube delta are a mosaic of complex, interacting ecosystems, rich natural resources and socio-economic activity. Dramatic changes in the Black Seais ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic causes ( increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality, climatic change effects. A multitemporal data set consisting of LANDSAT MS S, TM and SAR ERS-1 images was used for comparing and mapping landcover change via change detection. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change detection of coastal area. The main aim of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive analysis based on existing historical and more recent in situ and remote sensing data to establish the link between phytoplankton bloom development, increasing erosion and diminishing of beaches and related coastal zone harmful phenomena.},

Abstract = {Diffuse pollution abatement has been a challenge for decision-makers because of the intermittent nature and difficulty of identifying impacts of non-point sources. Depending on the degree of complexity of the system processes and constraints related to time, budget and human resources, variety of tools are used in diffuse pollution management. Decision-makers prefer to use rough estimates that require limited time and budget, in the preliminary assessment of diffuse pollution. The unit pollution load method which is based on the pollution generation rate per unit area and time for a given land use can aid decision-makers in the preliminary assessment of diffuse pollution. In this study, a deterministic distributed watershed model, SWAT is used together with nonlinear optimization models to estimate unit nutrient pollution loads during wet periods for different land use classes for the semi-arid Lake Mogan watershed that is dominated by agricultural activities. Extensive data sets including in-stream water quality and flowrate measurements, meteorological data, land use/land cover (LULC) map developed using remote sensing algorithms, information about agricultural activities, and soil data are used to calibrate and verify the hydraulic and water quality components of SWAT model. Results show that the unit total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads (0.46 kg TN/ha/yr and 0.07 kg TP/ha/yr) generated from the watershed during wet periods are very close to the minimum values of the loads specified in the literature and highly depend on the variations in rainfall. Estimated unit nutrient loads both at watershed scale and for different land use classes can be used to assess diffuse pollution control measures for similar regions with semi-arid conditions and heavy agricultural activity.

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The water quality index (WQI) has been used to identify threats to water quality and to support better water resource management. This study combines a machine learning algorithm, WQI, and remote sensing spectral indices (difference index, DI; ratio index, RI; and normalized difference index, NDI) through fractional derivatives methods and in turn establishes a model for estimating and assessing the WQI. The results show that the calculated WQI values range between 56.61 and 2,886.51. We also explore the relationship between reflectance data and the WQI. The number of bands with correlation coefficients passing a significance test at 0.01 first increases and then decreases with a peak appearing after 1.6 orders. WQI and DI as well as RI and NDI correlation coefficients between optimal band combinations of the peak also appear after 1.6 orders with R-2 values of 0.92, 0.58 and 0.92. Finally, 22 WQI estimation models were established by POS-SVR to compare the predictive effects of these models. The models based on a spectral index of 1.6 were found to perform much better than the others, with an R-2 of 0.92, an RMSE of 58.4, and an RPD of 2.81 and a slope of curve fitting of 0.97.},

Abstract = {Fishing and shellfish aquaculture are important sources of income for coastal communities in Thailand and other parts of tropical Asia, but environmental impacts associated with these small-scale activities can effect water quality, nearshore habitats, and fish populations. The management of coastal fisheries and aquaculture has, therefore, become a major concern for government fisheries officials who are searching for cost effective measures to improve the regulation of these sectors. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the RADARSAT-1 satellite were acquired to determine if stationary fishing and aquaculture gears within a coastal study site in the Upper Gulf of Thailand could be identified, and if automatic signature separation of gear types was possible. The use of SAR imagery for a coastal monitoring application was also evaluated and the potential of this technology to improve resource management outcomes considered.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the problem of rising salinity levels in the Shatt al-Arab river in southern Iraq has been repeated, which has directly affected the living and health situation and the agricultural activity of these areas. Six sampling stations were selected along Shatt al-Arab to estimate the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the river; these stations included the following: Qurna, Labani, City Centre, Kateban, Corniche, and Sihan. In addition, three Landsat-8 satellite images which were taken at the same time as collected samples also used for detecting the salinity in the river. After processing of atmospheric correction and inserted remote sensing indices, the reflectance of water extracted from satellite images was used to express the spectral characteristics of different TDS concentrations. Correlation and regression were used to obtain accurate models for detecting the salinity depending on the spectral reflectance of Landsat 8 operational land image OLI. The results presented Pearson correlation (r) value of 0.70, 0.97, and 0.71, and correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.56, 0.94, and 0.85 between field data with spectral data of salinity index 2 (SI-2) derived from the green and blue bands of Landsat obtained in 2015, 2017, and 2018 respectively. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS technologies coupled with spectral modeling are useful tools for providing a solution of future water resources planning and management, and also offer great undertaking as a means to improve knowledge of water quality and support water decision making.},

Abstract = {We present an approach that uses satellite products to derive models for predicting lake chlorophyll from environmental variables, and for investigating impacts of changing environmental flows. Lake Turkana, Kenya, is the world's largest desert lake, and environmental flows from the Omo River have been modified since 2015 by the Gibe III dam in Ethiopia. Using satellite remote sensing, we have evaluated the influence of these altered hydrological patterns on large-scale lake phytoplankton concentrations for the first time. Prior to dam completion, strong seasonal cycles and large spatial gradients in chlorophyll have been observed, related to natural fluctuations in the Omo River's seasonal discharge. During this period, mean lake chlorophyll showed a strong relationship with both river inflows and lake levels. Empirical models were derived which considered multiple hydro-climatic drivers, but the best model for predicting chlorophyll-a was a simple model based on Omo River discharge. Application of this model to data for 2015-2016 estimated that during the filling of Gibe III annual mean Lake Turkana chlorophyll declined by 30\%. Future water management scenarios based on Gibe III operations predict reduced seasonal chlorophyll-a variability, while irrigation scenarios showed marked declines in chlorophyll-a depending on the level of abstraction. These changes demonstrate how infrastructure developments such as dams can significantly alter lake primary production. Our remote sensing approach is easy to adapt to other lakes to understand how their phytoplankton dynamics may be affected by water management scenarios.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Attempts have been made to incorporate remote sensing techniques and in situ observations for enhanced water quality assessments. Estimations of nonoptical indicators sensitive to water environment changes, however, have not been fully studied, mainly due to complex nonlinear relationships between the observed values and surface reflectance. In this study, we applied a novel deep learning approach driven by a range of spectral properties to retrieve 6-year changes in water quality variables, i.e., Chl-a, BOD, TN, CODMn, NH3-N, and TP, on a monthly basis between 2013 and 2018 at Dongping Lake, an impounded lake located in the Yellow River in China. Band arithmetic was used to compute 26 predictors from Landsat 8 OLI imagery for model inputs. The results showed generally strong agreement between in situ and ConvLSTM-derived lake variables, generating R-2 of 0.92, 0.88, 0.84, 0.80, 0.83, and 0.77 for TN, NH3-N, CODMn, Chl-a, TP, and BOD, which suggest good performance of the developed model. We then used statistical analysis to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The framework established in this study has applications in effective water quality monitoring and serves as an alarming tool for water-environment management in the complex inland lake waters.},

Title = {Assessing the Trend of the Trophic State of Lake Ladoga Based on Multi-Year (1997-2019) CMEMS GlobColour-Merged CHL-OC5 Satellite Observations},

Abstract = {The trophic state of Lake Ladoga was studied during the period 1997-2019, using the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS) GlobColour-merged chlorophyll-a OC5 algorithm (GlobColour CHL-OC5) satellite observations. Lake Ladoga, in general, is mesotrophic but certain parts of the lake have been eutrophic since the 1960s due to the discharge of wastewater from industrial, urban, and agricultural sources. Since then, many ecological assessments of the Lake's state have been made. These studies have indicated that various changes are taking place in the lake and continuous monitoring of the lake is essential to update the current knowledge of its state. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term trend in chl-a in Lake Ladoga. The results showed a gradual reduction in chl-a concentration, indicating a moderate improvement. Chl-a concentrations (minimum-maximum values) varied spatially. The shallow southern shores did not show any improvement while the situation in the north is much better. The shore areas around the functioning paper mill at Pitkaranta and city of Sortavala still show high chl-a values. These findings provide a general reference on the current trophic state of Lake Ladoga that could contribute to improve policy and management strategies. It is assumed that the present warming trend of surface water may result in phytoplankton growth increase, thus partly offsetting a decrease in nutrient load. Precipitation is thought to be increasing, but the influence on water quality is less clear. Future studies could assess the current chemical composition to determine the state of water quality of Lake Ladoga.},

Title = {A mixed-methods approach to determine how conservation management programs and techniques have affected herbicide use and distribution in the environment over time},

Abstract = {No-till agriculture has the ability to reduce fuel consumption, increase soil moisture, reduce soil erosion and increase organic matter. However, it remains unclear whether it increases herbicide use overall in the long term for communities that use no-till as their primary source of conservation agriculture. The preponderance of literature suggests that no-till has increased herbicide use, but it is difficult to quantify howmuch herbicide has increased in a given location and to directly correlate changes in herbicide use to changes in soil andwater quality. This paper provides severalmethods to determine howherbicide use has changed over timein an agricultural community in Oregon that switched over to no-till in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These methods include: spatial analysis of remote sensing satellite imagery of vegetation health along streams; use of a drone fitted with an agricultural camera to detect vegetation health; and soil, sediment, and water sampling for the most commonly used herbicides in the study area. By using these methods, this study shows where streamvegetation health continues to be an issue in the agricultural community, and where concentrations of a commonly used herbicide in the community may be impacting human and ecological health. This study has important implications for impacts to soil and water quality over time in agricultural communities, as many researchers have noted the need to determine the long term effects of conversion to no-till and other forms of conservation agriculture. By providing these methods, communities heavily engaged in multiple forms of conservation agriculture may be able to track herbicide use changes in real time and on shorter decadal time spans in places where conservation agriculture is practiced.

Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities threaten surface water quality across the globe, especially in contexts where monitoring is non-existent or weak. Our understanding of the effect, order and magnitude of natural and human-induced environmental factors on surface water quality is limited. This study assessed the effect, predictive order and magnitude of natural and human-induced environmental variables on surface water quality in the Birim North District of Ghana. Approximately 540 samples were collected from 15 rivers and streams in 2018 and analysed using 31 indicators. Landsat satellite images (2018 and 2019) of the study area were analysed for land use land cover data. The data were fitted to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. Season (50\%) most accounted for variability in the surface water quality whereas elevation and forest cover accounted for 28\% and 21\%, respectively. Surface water quality in the Akoase and Nyafoman/Noyem clusters were 30\% and 10\% respectively better in quality than the Adofokrom/Amenam cluster. The increasing order of magnitude of variables in predicting surface water quality was Buffer, Cultivated area, Built-up, Forest, Rivers and streams cluster, Elevation, and Season. Consequently, management interventions for surface water ecosystems should account for spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the factors that influence surface water quality.},

Abstract = {Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in lakes is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass and widely employed in lake management. Here, we used Chl-a data from 586 lakes >= 1 km(2) in eastern China from 2013 to 2018 derived from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat-8 satellite to examine influences of climatic and anthropogenic factors on Chl-a variations among these lakes, partitioned into groups of different sizes. The results indicate that Chl-a values in small lakes (1-50 km(2)) were higher than those in large lakes (>50 km(2)), and the mean Chl-a in summer and autumn was higher than in spring and winter. Air temperature was positively correlated with the seasonal mean Chl-a in all sizes of lakes. Small lakes had a larger cropland proportion in their watersheds than large lakes, suggesting that the higher cropland proportion of the land cover contributed to the high Chl-a of these lakes. This research highlights the merit of high spatial resolution remote sensing for monitoring lakes in a regional context and indicates that the management of lakes could benefit from controlling agricultural activities in their watersheds.},

Abstract = {The water has an important role in human society, especially in Brazil. Its uses are multiple, including supply, energy production, recreation and others. The National Policy for Water Resources (Law No 9.433/97) states in its articles the importance of water use in accordance to their multiple uses, prioritizing the supply for humans and animals. In this approach, it is important to consider the physical and chemical quality of water to meet these demands, scope of the legal framework applied to the Brazilian water bodies according to their main uses, in order to guarantee the water quality compatible with the most demanding uses and to reduce the costs of pollution control through ongoing preventive actions. Among the various parameters that seek to analyze the physical and chemical quality of water it is intended to understand the spatial distribution of turbidity in the lake's surface, since the variation of the components that alter this parameter can be detected by means of passive remote sensing. The application of the Linear spectral mixture model allowed, satisfactorily, the identification of turbidity spatial distribution patterns in the lake.},

Abstract = {This study employed image enhancement for LANDSAT TM and ALOS imagery to monitor the changing status of coastal resources from 2001 to 2011, object-based classification of high-resolution THEOS imagery to extract fish cage culture sites and interpolation methods to determine marine environmental quality in 2011 in the northern part of Phu Quoc Island. There were five classes in the study site: natural forest, Melaleuca forest, agriculture, peat and built-up areas. Agricultural land and Melaleuca forest changing into built-up areas constituted approximately 51.13\% of the total area changing. The benthic seagrass habitat increased dramatically from 2001 to the end of 2010. Besides, marine culture has been concerned to cage culture which is one of the sources directly affecting aquatic life and water quality in coastal environment. Cage culture locations were detected using high-resolution imagery as THEOS data for image fusion and Object-based Image Analysis methods. Water quality criteria including nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined by interpolation method, and the spatial distribution of these parameters showed a concentration in the study area in the range from 0.17 to 0.49 mg/L, 0.012 to 0.073 mg/L and 0.26 to 1.046 g/L, respectively.},

Abstract = {Accurate information on the rate of land-use pattern changes and urban expansion is essential for the sustainable development and management of natural resources. The rapid urban growth is a major challenge for local government and urban planners in small cities of India due to an insufficient database and inadequate analysis of chaotic urban expansion. The present paper has evaluated the land use/land cover change (LULCC) dynamics of the Barrackpore Subdivision area, India using remote sensing data and utilized the urban growth. Multi-temporal Landsat images with the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) method were applied to generate the land use land cover maps. The spatiotemporal changes were performed by the ``from-to{''} change matrix identifier to study land transformation. LULCC matrix demonstrated that vegetation cover, agricultural/cropland, wetland, and water bodies have decreased area under 23\%, 7\%, 6\%, 1.7\%, while the area under built-up and fallow lands have increased by 32.2\% and 6.3\% during 1972-2016. The results also revealed marked variation in the growth of built-up areas. The positive correlation between population and built-up land growth indicated that the impact of population pressure has contributed to faster growth of built-up land in the study area. The study calls for policies for proper land use management and sustainable urban development.},

Abstract = {Groundwater is a most important resource in arid and semi-arid regions and is required for drinking, irrigation and industrialization. Assessing the potential zone of groundwater recharge is extremely crucial for the protection of water quality and the management of groundwater systems. To identify the groundwater potential zone in the study area, thematic layers of lithology, slope, karst degrees, land cover, lineament and drainage density were generated using topographic maps, thematic maps, field data and satellite image, and were prepared, classified, weighted and integrated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment by the means of fuzzy logic. The fuzzy membership values have been assigned to different thematic layers according to their classification on respect for their contribution and their occurrence in groundwater. Based on the generated groundwater potential map, it was found that about 8\% of the investigation area was categorized as very high potential for groundwater recharge, 31\% as high, 28\% as moderate, 17\% as low and 16\% as very low potential for groundwater recharge. Finally, the results were verified using well-yield data. The highest recharge potential area is located towards the downstream regions related to more fractured and karstified limestone.},

Title = {Developing and Field Testing Path Planning for Robotic Aquaculture Water Quality Monitoring},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Marine food chains are highly stressed by aggressive fishing practices and environmental damage. Aquaculture has increasingly become a source of seafood which spares the deleterious impact on wild fisheries. However, continually monitoring water quality to successfully grow and harvest fish is labor intensive. The Hybrid Aerial Underwater Robotic System (HAUCS) is an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for aquaculture farms to relieve the farm operators of one of the most labor-intensive and time-consuming farm operations: water quality monitoring. To this end, HAUCS employs a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones integrated with underwater measurement devices to collect the in situ water quality data from aquaculture ponds. A critical aspect in HAUCS is to develop an effective path planning algorithm to be able to sample all the ponds on the farm with minimal resources (i.e., the number of UAVs and the power consumption of each UAV). Three methods of path planning for the UAVs are tested, a Graph Attention Model (GAM), the Google Linear Optimization Package (GLOP) and our proposed solution, the HAUCS Path Planning Algorithm (HPP). The designs of these path planning algorithms are discussed, and a simulator is developed to evaluate these methods' performance. The algorithms are also experimentally validated at Southern Illinois University's Aquaculture Research Center to demonstrate the feasibility of HAUCS. Based on the simulations and experimental studies, HPP is particularly suited for large farms, while GLOP or GAM is more suited to small or medium-sized farms.},

Abstract = {The Maltese Islands have to comply with onerous EU legislation in order to protect the integrity of their water resources in a comprehensive manner. To date, operational monitoring of water quality parameters within the Maltese coastal waters is almost non-existent. This present study was carried out to compute and map values for the CSI023(+) and modified TRIX indices, using satellite and model data for the entire Maltese Fisheries Management Zone (FMZ); and to identify trends in such index values and relate these to anthropogenic activities, geolocation, bathymetry and seasonal factors. Temporal analyses of ocean colour and index values revealed the following seasonal trend, in decreasing order of value: winter, autumn, spring, and summer. Ocean colour and TRIX index values indicate that, overall, chlorophyll-a values for the 2002-2011 period and 2013-2014 period are consistent with those of oligotrophic, poorly productive waters, with a high water quality. CSI023(+) values for the 2002-2011 period indicated that the Maltese marine area shows a statistically insignificant trend of variation in chlorophyll-a values, possibly due to the low spatial resolution of the ocean colour dataset used. Statistical analyses shows that bathymetry and west/east geolocation have an influence on the trophic status of the Maltese FMZ. Water quality indices computation from satellite and model data enables the fulfilment of the mandatory, contemporary water quality monitoring requirements Malta has and enables the formulation of water quality management recommendations. This research can be integrated in an operational online system as a decision-making tool.},

Abstract = {Cropping systems grown over sandy coarse soils are susceptible to nutrient leaching, due to local thunderstorms and irrigation. Additionally, erosion can contribute to removal of nutrients, soil organic matter, and fine particles. Balancing nutrients for these systems while protecting water and soil quality requires best management practices (BMPs). Crop rotations with deeper rooted small grains and winter cover crops reduced potential losses of fine particles, soil organic matter, nitrogen, and other nutrients due to wind erosion and protected soil and water quality. The cropping system N status can be monitored by assessing chlorophyll, sap NO3--N concentrations and N indexes of the canopy. The Nitrogen Leaching Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP) model simulated residual soil NO3--N and soil water and showed that there is potential to use precision farming to improve NUE. Simulations of the system showed that BMPs increased NUE and that NO3--N can potentially be removed from the shallow underground water table protecting water quality. These results show that with the application of models, and tools to monitor the N status of the aboveground canopy, such as chlorophyl readings, sap NO3--N concentrations, N indices, and other new technologies such as precision farming and remote sensing, nutrient use efficiency in the new millennium will be significantly increased, environmental quality will be conserved, and product quality will be improved at the farm level for the benefit of producers, processors and consumers.},

Abstract = {Agricultural landscape is designated as important landscape components for partly controlling water quality, biodiversity, as well as for their aesthetic role in landscapes. Therefore, the change of agricultural landscape is at the top of the agenda for many policy makers and landscape planners. As a basis for conservation management, sufficient information about landscape structure should be providing. Jiangdu County is the main grain producing area in Jiangsu Province, where were taken as a case study area. In this study, the former landscape structure and the changes in landscape patterns during a period of about 10 years in study area were reconstructed and elucidated. Landscape pattern information in study area were extracted and analyzed by using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System technology. Farmland, ponds cultured, forestland and settlement were extracted separately from the remote sensing images. The frequency index, landscape diversity index and landscape fragmentation index were calculated for analysis. The agriculture landscape pattern index was calculated and change characteristics were analyzed by using Fragstats software. Results show that within the study area, the agricultural landscape patterns changed significantly from 2006 to 2016, especially in farmland, ponds cultured and settlement. Landscape diversity index and fragmentation index of this study area increased.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Land administration constitutes the socio-technical systems that govern land tenure, use, value and development within a jurisdiction. The land parcel is the fundamental unit of analysis. Each parcel has identifiable boundaries, associated rights, and linked parties. Spatial information is fundamental. It represents the boundaries between land parcels and is embedded in cadastral sketches, plans, maps and databases. The boundaries are expressed in these records using mathematical or graphical descriptions. They are also expressed physically with monuments or natural features. Ideally, the recorded and physical expressions should align, however, in practice, this may not occur. This means some boundaries may be physically invisible, lacking accurate documentation, or potentially both. Emerging remote sensing tools and techniques offers great potential. Historically, the measurements used to produce recorded boundary representations were generated from ground-based surveying techniques. The approach was, and remains, entirely appropriate in many circumstances, although it can be timely, costly, and may only capture very limited contextual boundary information. Meanwhile, advances in remote sensing and photogrammetry offer improved measurement speeds, reduced costs, higher image resolutions, and enhanced sampling granularity. Applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), laser scanning, both airborne and terrestrial (LiDAR), radar interferometry, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques, all provide examples. Coupled with emergent societal challenges relating to poverty reduction, rapid urbanisation, vertical development, and complex infrastructure management, the contemporary motivation to use these new techniques is high. Fundamentally, they enable more rapid, cost-effective, and tailored approaches to 2D and 3D land data creation, analysis, and maintenance. This Special Issue hosts papers focusing on this intersection of emergent remote sensing tools and techniques, applied to domain of land administration.},

Title = {Multivariate Analysis for Assessing Irrigation Water Quality: A Case Study of the Bahr Mouise Canal, Eastern Nile Delta},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Water scarcity and suitable irrigation water management in arid regions represent tangible challenges for sustainable agriculture. The current study aimed to apply multivariate analysis and to develop a simplified water quality assessment using principal component analysis (PCA) and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) technique to assess the water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal in El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. The proposed methods depended on the monitored water chemical composition (e.g., pH, water electrical conductivity (ECiw), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-) during 2019. Based on the supervised classification of satellite images (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the distinguished land use/land cover types around the Bahr Mouise canal were agriculture, urban, and water bodies, while the dominating land use was agriculture. The water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal was classified into two classes based on the application of the irrigation water quality index (IWQI), while the water quality was classified into three classes using the PCA and AHC methods. Temporal variations in water quality were investigated, where the water qualities in winter, autumn, and spring (January, February, March, April, November, and December) were classified as class I (no restrictions) based on IWQI application, and the water salinity, sodicity, and/or alkalinity did not represent limiting factors for irrigation water quality. On the other hand, in the summer season (May, June, July, August, and October), the irrigation water was classified as class II (low restrictions); therefore, irrigation processes during summer may lead to an increase in the alkalinity hazard. The PCA classifications were compared with the IWQI results; the PCA classifications had similar assessment results during the year, except in September, while the water quality was assigned to class II using the PCA method and class I by applying the IWQI. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) around the Bahr Mouise canal over eight months and climatic data assisted in explaining the fluctuations in water quality during 2019 as a result of changing the crop season and agriculture management. Assessments of water quality help to conserve soil, reduce degradation risk, and support decision makers in order to obtain sustainable agriculture, especially under water irrigation scarcity and the limited agricultural land in such an arid region.},

Abstract = {Aim of the study The primary objective was to assess spatio-temporal changes of the vegetation occurring in 12 reservoirs located in the Odra River basin. The analysis was made for reservoirs of different constructions, i.e. single stage, two-stage and lateral. The second purpose was to analyze possibility using remote sensing data to monitor the dynamics of the vegetation processes. Material and methods Monitoring and mapping of spatio-temporal changes of the vegetation occurring in the reservoirs was analyzed on the basis on Sentinel-2 data. The analysis was based on the NDVI and the WAVI indices. To specify spatial changes of vegetation, the reservoirs were split into zones equals to 250 m. The statistical analysis was aimed at comparing the NDVI and the WAVI values between designated zones. In turn, Cluster analysis (CA) was used to group reservoirs into clusters on the basis of similarities between the NDVI and the WAVI values. Results and conclusions Cluster analysis (CA) showed that each reservoir is separate water body where decisive impact on degradation process could have different factor. There was observed that two-stage construction focuses degradation processes in pre-reservoir and protect water resources in the main part. Additionally, relatively new solution - lateral reservoirs seems to be alternative preventing degradation processes. Taking into account possibility of using satellite imagery, there was observed that resolutions of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery allow to monitor vegetation processes in terms of time and space. The major limitation of using remote sensing data is high cloud density, which significantly reduces the number of observations during most of the year.},

Abstract = {Low-power, lightweight, off-the-shelf imaging spectrometers, deployed on above-water fixed platforms or on low-altitude aerial drones, have significant potential for enabling fine-scale assessment of radiometrically derived water quality properties (WQPs) in oceans, lakes, and reservoirs. In such applications, it is essential that the measured water-leaving spectral radiances be corrected for surface-reflected light, i.e., glint. However, noise and spectral characteristics of these imagers, and environmental sources of fine-scale radiometric variability such as capillary waves, complicate the glint correction problem. Despite having a low signal-to-noise ratio, a representative lightweight imaging spectrometer provided accurate radiometric estimates of chlorophyll concentration-an informative WQP-from glint-corrected hyperspectral radiances in a fixed-platform application in a coastal ocean region. Optimal glint correction was provided by a spectral optimization algorithm, which outperformed both a hardware solution utilizing a polarizer and a subtractive algorithm incorporating the reflectance measured in the near infrared. In the same coastal region, this spectral optimization approach also provided the best glint correction for radiometric estimates of backscatter at 650 nm, a WQP indicative of suspended particle load.

Title = {Remote sensing for monitoring the impacts of agroforestry practices and precipitation changes in particle size export trends},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Recent land use changes, the absence of soil protection between crop periods, and extreme precipitation events have been highlighted as major influential factors in the fluctuations of sediment export in the last decades at the catchment scale worldwide. In this regard, soil erosion and fine-particle export are two of the major concerns of soil nutrient loss and water-quality decrease (e.g., increasing turbidity and vector of chemicals). However, while rainfall effects have been well-monitored, recent land use changes and management need additional approaches to evaluate their effect. In Mediterranean mountainous environments, in addition to forest management, agricultural practices during different cropland stages likely increase sediment and particle-bound chemicals in the drainage system. Moreover, most catchments lack instrumentalization. Thus, there is a gap in the knowledge on the processes influencing the sediment exported in ungauged catchments. To evaluate the processes involved, remote sensing and seasonal sampling of suspended sediments were examined for 5 years in a representative agroforestry system in three sub-catchments (SBCs) with different proportions of land uses. Temporal trends of NDVI, EVI, MSAVI, SAVI, and NDWI indices were analyzed for monitoring the vegetation status. With this information, we attempt to evaluate the soil response in terms of particle size export to land use change, vegetation status, and precipitation distribution in fine-grained sediment-reaching streams. Our findings not only highlight the significant effect of heavy precipitation events and vegetation cover on the grain-size fraction of the exported sediment but also reveal the existence of more complex factors influencing the export dynamics. A silt-increasing trend due to the increase of individual heavy precipitations from 2017 onward despite the total precipitation amount not increasing was detected. It is shown that indices such as NDVI and NDMI help detect small changes in vegetation cover, while EVI, SAVI, and MSAVI are more robust for detecting general patterns in large vegetated areas and preventing the appearance of artefacts in the data. Results from this study suggest that land use changes combined with short-scale changing trends of rainfall likely explain most of the possible effects observed in terms of sediment export changes.},

Abstract = {Sustainable urban planning and management demand innovative concepts and techniques to obtain up-to-date and area-wide information on the characteristics and development of the urban system. The increasing availability of Earth Observation (EO) technologies has provided new opportunities for a wide range of urban applications, such as mapping and monitoring of the urban environment, socio-economic estimations, characterization of urban climate, analysis of regional and global impacts and urban security and emergency preparedness. However, a gap exists between the research-focused results offered by the urban EO community and the application of these data and products by urban planners and decision makers. Hence, the main objective of the GEOURBAN (ExploitinG Earth Observation in sUstainable uRBan plAnning \& maNagement) project is to bridge this gap by demonstrating the ability of current and future EO systems to depict parameters of urban structure and urban environmental quality at detailed level. This paper introduces the conceptual approach towards the integration of EO-based geo-information into urban and spatial planning and presents and discusses first results of the indicators developed and evaluated by using remote sensing data.},

Abstract = {Beijing, China's cultural political, and economic center, is facing critical water pollution-related challenges warranting global attention. This study used remote sensing and geographic information systems to analyze the impact of urbanization on wastewater discharge in Beijing. Two influencing factors-urban index and environment index-were created from remote sensing image classifications to better reflect the impacts from urbanization and green-cover changes on wastewater discharge. The impacts of urban land uses on the volume of wastewater discharge were examined in localized areas (i.e., the so-called unit watersheds delineated from topography and stream segments). Geostatistical results showed that urbanization was primarily responsible for spatial variations of wastewater discharge. While vegetation helped ameliorate the pollution, increased urban areas on the outskirts of the city resulted in accelerated wastewater discharge. Analytical findings of this study could provide spatially explicit information for policy-makers to initiate and adjust protocols and strategies for protecting water resources and controlling wastewater emission, thus improving quality of living environments in Beijing.},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems can be degraded by poor water quality. Tracing the causes of poor water quality back to land-use change is necessary to target catchment management for coastal zone management. However, existing models for tracing the sources of pollution require extensive data-sets which are not available for many of the world's coral reef regions that may have severe water quality issues. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses freely available satellite data to infer the connection between land-uses in catchments and water clarity in coastal oceans. We apply the model to estimate the influence of land-use change on water clarity in Fiji. We tested the model's predictions against underwater surveys, finding that predictions of poor water quality are consistent with observations of high siltation and low coverage of sediment-sensitive coral genera. The model thus provides a means to link land-use change to declines in coastal water quality.},

Title = {Exploiting high frequency monitoring and satellite imagery for assessing chlorophyll-a dynamics in a shallow eutrophic lake},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are challenged by cultural eutrophication across the globe, and it is a priority for water managers to implement water quality monitoring at different spatio-temporal scales to control and mitigate the eutrophication process. Phytoplankton abundance is a key indicator of the trophic and water quality status of lakes. Phytoplankton dynamics are characterized by high spatio-temporal variation, driven by physical, chemical and biological factors, that challenge the capacity of routine monitoring with conventional sampling techniques (i.e., boat-based sampling) to characterise these complex relationships. In this study, high frequency in situ measurements and multispectral satellite data were used in a synergistic way to explore temporal (diurnal and seasonal) dynamics and spatial distribution of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, a proxy of phytoplankton abundance, together with physico-chemical water parameters in a shallow fluvial-lake system (Mantua Lakes). A good agreement was found between Chl-a retrieved by remote sensing data and Chl-a fluorescence data recorded by multi-parameters probes (R-2 = 0.94). The Chl-a maps allowed a seasonal classification of the Mantua lakes system as eutrophic or hypertrophic. Along the Mantua lakes system an increasing gradient in Chl-a concentration was recorded following the transition from a fluvial to lacustrine system. There was significant seasonal heterogeneity among the subbasins, probably due to different hydrodynamics, influenced also by macrophyte stands. High-frequency data revealed the importance of rainfall events in the timing and growth dynamics of phytoplankton, particularly for spring and late summer blooms. Combining temporal and spatial data at high resolution improves the understanding of complex fluvial-lake systems. This technique can allow managers to target blooms in near-real time as they move through a system and guide them to localized hot spots enabling timely management action in ecosystems of high conservation and recreational value.},

Abstract = {In the Mediterranean area, rural abandonment and the rapid urbanisation after the 1950' s led to complex environmental problems, such as the exploitation of natural resources, the environmental pollution, whilst the unstrained urban growth caused excessive pressure on the existing infrastructure, which affects buildings, public transportation, water quality and public health. Various studies demonstrate that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of buildings' energy consumption, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling and the effective management of the urban heat island effect. In this framework, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. In order to do so, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations.

Title = {Water Quality Drivers in 11 Gulf of Mexico Estuaries},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal water-quality is both a primary driver and also a consequence of coastal ecosystem health. Turbidity, a measure of dissolved and particulate water-quality matter, is a proxy for water quality, and varies on daily to interannual periods. Turbidity is influenced by a variety of factors, including algal particles, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended sediments. Identifying which factors drive trends and extreme events in turbidity in an estuary helps environmental managers and decision makers plan for and mitigate against water-quality issues. Efforts to do so on large spatial scales have been hampered due to limitations of turbidity data, including coarse and irregular temporal resolution and poor spatial coverage. We addressed these issues by deriving a proxy for turbidity using ocean color satellite products for 11 Gulf of Mexico estuaries from 2000 to 2014 on weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual time-steps. Drivers were identified using Akaike's Information Criterion and multiple regressions to model turbidity against precipitation, wind speed, U and V wind vectors, river discharge, water level, and El Nino Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation climate indices. Turbidity variability was best explained by wind speed across estuaries for both time-series and extreme turbidity events, although more dynamic patterns were found between estuaries over various time steps.},

Abstract = {Water resources are getting more and more important with each passing day in case of survival of humanity. For this reason, assessing water resources' quality and also monitoring them have attracted lots of attention in the recent years. Remote sensing has been growing widely in the last decade and its resources are very usable when it comes to water resources management. In this study, by using remote sensing technology, satellite images that have 350 to 1050 nanometres wavelength band sensors ( e. g. CHRIS Proba) are used to determine the quality of the Kizilirmak River's water. Kizilirmak River is born and also pours out to sea in country limits of Turkey. It is the longest river of the country by the length of 1355 kilometres. Through the river's resources, ground based spectral measurements are made to identify the quality differences of the water at the test spots that have been determined before. In this context at Imranli, where the river contacts civilization for the first time, which is located in Sivas city of Turkey, samples are gathered in order to do ground based spectroradiometer measurements. These samples are gathered simultaneously with the image acquiring time of CHRIS Proba satellite. Spectral signatures that are obtained from ground measurements are used as reference data in order to classify CHRIS Proba satellite's hyperspectral images over the study area. Satellite images are classified based on Chemical Oxygen Demand ( COD), Turbidity and Electrical Conductivity ( EC) attributes. As a result, interpretations obtained from classified CHRIS Proba satellite hyperspectral images of the study area are presented.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis of obtaining real-time water quality information was verified by monitoring a wastewater treatment facility consisting of a series of stabilization ponds, differing in quality and an adjacent reservoir. The changes in reflectance of the wastewater were the result of quality variations as expressed primarily by the suspended solids content, along the course of treatment. The variations in the wastewater quality along the treatment course, as well as in the reservoir at the end of the system are comparable with those in natural high quality water bodies, The importance of the proposed method is that it can promote better decision making with regards to heavily contaminated water bodies.

Abstract = {The degradation of watersheds creates immense pressure on water quality, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Total suspended solids (TSS) provide essential information to water environmental quality assessments. However, the calibration of direct retrieval models requires complicated preparations and further increases uncertainties. Here, we hypothesized that a common remote sensing index (NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index) could be used to estimate TSS concentrations in water due to the effects of canopy cover. To address this hypothesis, we collected 65 water samples from the Ebinur Lake Watershed, northwest China, to investigate the potential relationships between TSS concentrations and Sentinel-2-based NDVI at various scales (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 m). Subsequently, we established a classical measurement error (CME) model for the estimation of TSS concentrations. The results showed that TSS concentration is negatively related to the NDVI value at all buffer distances. The 300 m scale mean NDVI value showed the most effective explanation of the variations in TSS concentrations (R-2 = 0.83, P-value < 0.001), which indicated that the TSS concentration can be assessed by NDVI. The CME model showed that NDVI values played an important role in the assessment of TSS concentrations in surface water. Furthermore, the results of both leave-one-out cross-validation and the accuracy measure suggested that this specific method is satisfactory. Compared with previous statistical and field monitoring results, the proposed method is promising for cost-effective monitoring of TSS concentrations in water, especially in data-poor watersheds. This specific method may provide the basis for the conservation and management of nonpoint source pollution in arid regions.},

Abstract = {Assessing water resources' quality and also monitoring them have attracted lots of attention in the recent years. Remote sensing has been growing widely in the last decade and its resources are very usable when it comes to water resources management. In this study, by using remote sensing technology, satellite images that have 350 to 1050 nanometres wavelength band sensors are used to determine the quality of the Kizilirmak River's water. Through the river's resources, ground based spectral measurements are made to identify the quality differences of the water at the test spots that have been determined before. In this context at Imranli, where the river contacts civilization for the first time, which is located in Sivas city of Turkey, samples are gathered in order to do ground based spectroradiometer measurements. These samples are gathered simultaneously with the image acquiring time of CHRIS Proba satellite. Spectral signatures that are obtained from ground measurements are used as reference data in order to classify CHRIS Proba satellite's hyperspectral images over the study area. Satellite images are classified based on Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Turbidity and Electrical Conductivity (EC) attributes. As a result, interpretations obtained from classified CHRIS Proba satellite hyperspectral images of the study area are presented. Spectras are readied for Matched Filtering and Spectral Angle Mapper methods for determining the best classification method.},

Title = {Using the Surface Reflectance MODIS Terra Product to Estimate Turbidity in Tampa Bay, Florida},

Abstract = {Turbidity is a commonly-used index of the factors that determine light penetration in the water column. Consistent estimation of turbidity is crucial to design environmental and restoration management plans, to predict fate of possible pollutants, and to estimate sedimentary fluxes into the ocean. Traditional methods monitoring fixed geographical locations at fixed intervals may not be representative of the mean water turbidity in estuaries between intervals, and can be expensive and time consuming. Although remote sensing offers a good solution to this limitation, it is still not widely used due in part to required complex processing of imagery. There are satellite-derived products, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra surface reflectance daily product (MOD09GQ) Band 1 (620-670 nm) which are now routinely available at 250 m spatial resolution and corrected for atmospheric effect. This study shows this product to be useful to estimate turbidity in Tampa Bay, Florida, after rainfall events (R-2 = 0.76, n = 34). Within Tampa Bay, Hillsborough Bay (HB) and Old Tampa Bay (OTB) presented higher turbidity compared to Middle Tampa Bay (MTB) and Lower Tampa Bay (LTB).},

Abstract = {It is of great significance to establish a space-earth based integrated monitoring system to enhance the ability for water environmental risk prevention. Modern remote sensing technology has been used in surveying and providing urban water environment information combined with GIS spatial analysis and information management capabilities of water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. In this paper, three monitoring methods are argued. With the use of satellite image, aerial photography and other means providing all-weather, omni-directional, multi-bands, multi-temporal remote sensing image information, the water temperature, total suspended solids, particulate matter, chlorophyll, transparency (turbidity), thermal pollution and other information could be obtained; secondly, with integrated methods of laboratory testing, water quality monitoring sites, the cross-section of the routine monitoring of benzene, phenol, COD, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus concentrations could be assessed; thirdly, with the use of online monitoring of toxic chemical substances, the arsenic, mercury concentration could be monitored. And the construction framework of the space-earth based integrated monitoring system for water environment was discussed. A whole scheme integrated online monitoring device, communication system, and software support system was proposed. Meanwhile, the key techniques of this system were addressed.

Title = {AlgaeMAp: Algae Bloom Monitoring Application for Inland Waters in Latin America},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Due to increasing algae bloom occurrence and water degradation on a global scale, there is a demand for water quality monitoring systems based on remote sensing imagery. This paper describes the scientific, theoretical, and methodological background for creating a cloud-computing interface on Google Earth Engine (GEE) which allows end-users to access algae bloom related products with high spatial (30 m) and temporal (similar to 5 day) resolution. The proposed methodology uses Sentinel-2 images corrected for atmospheric and sun-glint effects to generate an image collection of the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll-a Index (NDCI) for the entire time-series. NDCI is used to estimate both Chl-a concentration, based on a non-linear fitting model, and Trophic State Index (TSI), based on a tree-decision model classification into five classes. Once the Chl-a and TSI algorithms had been calibrated and validated they were implemented in GEE as an Earth Engine App, entitled Algae Bloom Monitoring Application (AlgaeMAp). AlgaeMAp is the first online platform built within the GEE platform that offers high spatial resolution of water quality parameters. The App benefits from the huge processing capability of GEE that allows any user with internet access to easily extract detailed spatial (30 m) and long temporal Chl-a and TSI information (from August 2015 and with images every 5 days) throughout the most important reservoirs in the State of Sao Paulo/Brazil. The application will be adapted to extend to other relevant areas in Latin America.},

Abstract = {The content of total nitrogen in the waters is an important index to measure lake water quality, and the technique of remote sensing plays a large role in quantitatively monitoring the dynamic change and timely grasping the status of lake pollution. Taking Chaohu as an example, quantitative inversion models of total nitrogen were established by multivariable regression Kriging under analyzing of an correlation between total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a or suspended solids by HIS hyperspectral remote sensing data of HJ-1A satellite. The result shows that the correlation of 0. 76 was discovered between total nitrogen and the multiple combination with band 72, band 79 and band 97, while the correlation could be increased to 0. 83 by applying combined model of multiple linear regression and ordinary Kriging. The optimization of the residuals of the conventional regression model can improve the accuracy of the inversion effectively. These results also provide useful exploration for further establishing a common model of quantitative inversion of lake total nitrogen concentration.},

Abstract = {This study uses remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies to examine the combine effects of urban expansion and climatic variability on the physical environment in and around the city of Niamey. The results revealed a notable increase in the built up areas in the city between 1973 and 2001. While the city's population was increasing prime agricultural lands were also declining at increasing rate. This was due to human disturbances oil the fragile Sahelian ecosystem and climatic variability associated with this area. The consequence was increased erosion, loss of biodiversty and declining water quality. Policy intervention in the form of zoning, moratorium and other growth management strategies was suggested as a way of preventing the city from exceeding its carrying capacity.},

Therefore, it is critical to monitor and investigate the development process of eutrophication. The concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in water bodies is an essential indicator of eutrophication in them. Previous studies in predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations suffered from low spatial resolution and discrepancies between predicted and observed values. In this paper, we used various remote sensing and ground observation data and proposed a novel machine learning-based framework, a random forest inversion model, to provide the spatial distribution of chl-a in 2 m spatial resolution. The results showed our model outperformed other base models, and the goodness of fit improved by over 36.6\% while MSE and MAE decreased by over 15.17\% and over 21.26\% respectively. Moreover, we compared the feasibility of GF-1 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data in chl-a concentration prediction. We found that better prediction results can be obtained by using GF-1 data, with the goodness of fit reaching 93.1\% and MSE only 3.589. The proposed method and findings of this study can be used in future water management studies and as an aid for decision-makers in this field.},

Title = {A Machine Learning Algorithm for Himawari-8 Total Suspended Solids Retrievals in the Great Barrier Reef},

Abstract = {Remote sensing of ocean colour has been fundamental to the synoptic-scale monitoring of marine water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). However, ocean colour sensors onboard low orbit satellites, such as the Sentinel-3 constellation, have insufficient revisit capability to fully resolve diurnal variability in highly dynamic coastal environments. To overcome this limitation, this work presents a physics-based coastal ocean colour algorithm for the Advanced Himawari Imager onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite. Despite being designed for meteorological applications, Himawari-8 offers the opportunity to estimate ocean colour features every 10 min, in four broad visible and near-infrared spectral bands, and at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. Coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer simulations of the Himawari-8 bands were carried out for a realistic range of in-water and atmospheric optical properties of the GBR and for a wide range of solar and observation geometries. The simulated data were used to develop an inverse model based on artificial neural network techniques to estimate total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations directly from the Himawari-8 top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance observations. The algorithm was validated with concurrent in situ data across the coastal GBR and its detection limits were assessed. TSS retrievals presented relative errors up to 75\% and absolute errors of 2 mg L-1 within the validation range of 0.14 to 24 mg L-1, with a detection limit of 0.25 mg L-1. We discuss potential applications of Himawari-8 diurnal TSS products for improved monitoring and management of water quality in the GBR.},

Title = {Remote sensing of tropical riverine water quality using sentinel-2 MSI and field observations},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Monitoring the water quality as well as assessing its ecological status, both in coastal and inland environments, are essential tasks and pose serious environmental challenges. Although both field measurements and observations from permanent measuring stations may be available, the advent of modern remote sensors, such as MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument), on board the Sentinel-2 satellite, has made it possible to obtain inland biogeochemical products at high spatial (10 m) and temporal (5-days) resolutions. However, validating Sentinel-2 derived water quality estimations in tropical riverine and costal water is an ongoing effort.This study presents one of the first attempts to locally adapt and validate the C2RCC atmospheric processor for the inversion of IOPs to water quality parameters of productive tropical riverine waters in South East Asia using a time series of 65 Sentinel-2 MSI images from 2018 to 2021. We developed locally adapted relationships between C2X-Nets-derived inherent optical properties (IOPs) and surface reflectances with field observations of chl-a concentration, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), turbidity, transparency, and in situ reflectance spectra. Results have been validated against 3-years long time series of observations collected at six monitoring stations of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) of Thailand covering approximately 130 km-long stretch of the Chao Phraya river.Locally adapted C2X-Net processor showed good performances in predicting the chl-a concentrations, turbidity and Secchi disk depth. However, relatively low performance was noted for C2X-Nets processor in predicting CDOM absorption. During the period 2018-2021, the temporal trends of chl-a concentration and turbidity showed a clear seasonal pattern with peak turbidity values in the wet seasons. Spatial pattern of retrieved water quality products showed a noticeable change in correspondence with the built-up area of Bangkok. Even if elevated chl-a concentrations have been generally observed all year around, highest peaks have been observed in the dry and at beginning of the wet seasons.To the best knowledge of the authors, our findings firstly demonstrated the integration potential of C2RCC and satellite-retrieved water quality estimations into existing national water quality monitoring network in the context of water resources management and decision-making in the tropical Southeast Asian countries.},

Abstract = {The Ramsar Convention of IUCN held in 1971 in Iran raised global awareness of the conservation and management of wetlands. Wetlands, the transitional zones that occupy an intermediate position between dryland and open water, regulate the ? ow of water and nutrients, thereby facilitating optimum functioning of the physical and biological cycles of nature. Harike wetland in the Indian State of Punjab has been declared a wetland of international importance. Thus it is felt necessary to reclaim and develop Harike wetland for its optimum potential use, but a reliable and accurate wetland database is not available. This study aimed at the generation of a database in terms of landuse/landcover, extent of waterspread and its seasonal variation, aquatic vegetation status and turbidity levels of lake water, using multidate satellite data. The threats of the Harike wetland have been identified and adequate measures for its conservation and management suggested.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Earth observation data can provide valuable assessments for monitoring the spatial extent of (un)sustainable urban growth of the world's cities to better inform planning policy in reducing associated economic, social and environmental costs. Western Australia has witnessed rapid economic expansion since the turn of the century founded upon extensive natural resource extraction. Thus, Perth, the state capital of Western Australia, has encountered significant population and urban growth in response to the booming state economy. However, the recent economic slowdown resulted in the largest decrease in natural resource values that Western Australia has ever experienced. Here, we present multi-temporal urban expansion statistics from 1990 to 2015 for Perth, derived from Landsat imagery. Current urban estimates used for future development plans and progress monitoring of infill and density targets are based upon aggregated census data and metrics unrepresentative of actual land cover change, underestimating overall urban area. Earth observation provides a temporally consistent methodology, identifying areal urban area at higher spatial and temporal resolution than current estimates. Our results indicate that the spatial extent of the Perth Metropolitan Region has increased 45\% between 1990 and 2015, over 320 km(2). We highlight the applicability of earth observation data in accurately quantifying urban area for sustainable targeted planning practices.},

Abstract = {Measuring total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is important in managing heavy polluted urban waters in China. This study uses high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery with four multispectral bands, which roughly correspond to Landsat/TM bands 1-4, to determine TN and TP in small urban rivers and lakes in China. By using Lake Cihu and the lower reaches of Wen-Rui Tang (WRT) River as examples, this paper develops both multiple linear regressions (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models to estimate TN and TP concentrations from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery and in situ water samples collected concurrently with overpassing satellite. The measured and estimated values of both MLR and ANN models are in good agreement (R-2 > 0.85 and RMSE < 2.50). The empirical equations selected by MLR are more straightforward, whereas the estimated accuracy using ANN model is better (R-2 > 0.86 and RMSE < 0.89). Results validate the potential of using high resolution IKONOS multispectral imagery to study the chemical states of small-sized urban water bodies. The spatial distribution maps of TN and TP concentrations generated by the ANN model can inform the decision makers of variations in water quality in Lake Cihu and lower reaches of WRT River. The approaches and equations developed in this study could be applied to other urban water bodies for water quality monitoring.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) of 2014 and the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term Sustainability (CVSALTS) initiative were conceived to reverse years of inaction on the over-pumping of groundwater and salination of rivers that both threaten agricultural sustainability in the State of California. These largely stakeholder-led, innovative policy actions were supported by modern tools of remote sensing and Geographic Information System technology that allowed stakeholders to make adjustments to existing resource management and jurisdictional boundaries to form policy-mandated Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) and Salinity Management Areas (SMAs) to address future management responsibilities. Additional resources mobilized by the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) and other water resource and water quality management agencies have been effective in encouraging the use of spreadsheet accounting and numerical simulation models to develop robust and coherent quantitative understanding of the current state and likely problems that will be encountered to achieve resource sustainability. This activity has revealed flaws and inconsistencies in the conceptual models underpinning this activity. Two case studies are described that illustrate the disparity in the challenges faced by GSAs in subregions charged with developing consensus-based Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSPs). These case studies also illustrate the unique aspect of SGMA: that alongside mandates and guidelines being imposed statewide, local leadership and advocacy can play an important role in achieving long-term SGMA and CVSALTS goals.},

Vigor, organization, and resilience (VOR) and pressure-stress-response (PSR) are two commonly adopted conceptual models for indicator selection and organization. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is primarily used to determine model weights and indicator combinations. Although there have been many successful efforts in assessing regional ecosystems, they remain affected by a lack of spatially explicit data, weak integration of natural and human dimensions, and uncertain data quality and analyses. In the future, regional ecosystem condition assessments may be advanced by incorporating recent improvements in spatial big data and machine learning to create more operative indicators based on Earth observations and social metrics. The collaboration between ecologists, remote sensing scientists, data analysts, and scientists in other relevant disciplines is critical for the success of future assessments.},

Title = {Identifying the Influence of Land Cover and Human Population on Chlorophyll a Concentrations Using a Pseudo-Watershed Analytical Framework},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Increasing agricultural development and urbanization exacerbates the degradation of water quality in vulnerable freshwater systems around the world. Advances in remote sensing and greater availability of open-access data provides a valuable resource for monitoring water quality but harmonizing between databases remains a challenge. Here, we: (i) developed a pseudo-watershed analytical framework to associate freshwater lakes with adjacent land cover and human population data and (ii) applied the framework to quantify the relative influence of land cover and human population on primary production for 9313 lakes from 72 countries. We found that land cover and human population explained 30.2\% of the variation in chlorophyll a concentrations worldwide. Chlorophyll a concentrations were highest in regions with higher agricultural activities and human populations. While anthropogenic land cover categories equated to only 4 of the 18 categories, they accounted for 41.5\% of the relative explained variation. Applying our pseudo-watershed analytical framework allowed us to quantify the importance of land cover and human population on chlorophyll concentration for over 9000 lakes. However, this framework has broader applicability for any study or monitoring program that requires quantification of lake watersheds.},

Abstract = {In June 2011, Oil Spill disasters occurred at platforms of Penglai 19-3 oil field in the Bohai Sea off the China's northeast coast which hugely degraded the water quality and damaged the balance of marine environment and ecosystem in Bohai Sea, as even slight changes in water quality could be catastrophic for marine lives. Simulation, Visualization and GIS analysis of Oil Spill disasters is crucial to rapidly assessment of the vulnerability of coastal areas and to make a full understanding of possible impact of disasters on infrastructure and environment. Globe model become a hotspot in the area of GIS research presently. It is a useful platform for integration and sharing of spatial information with its strong abilities of spatial data management and visualization. In this paper, Multi-resolution remote sensing imagery and DEM of terrain is implemented with LOD based on Globe Model. A numerical simulation result of PL19-3 oil spill based on General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) is visualized using particle trace and analysed on the globe model. It proves that the method of virtual reality and GIS analysis based on globe model for oil spill is vivid and intuitionistic; it may be applied in other ocean research.},

Title = {Environment monitoring of mining area with comprehensive mining ecological index (CMEI): a case study in Xilinhot of Inner Mongolia, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 27},
Abstract = {The monitoring and evaluation of environmental and ecological status in mining area is critical for effective mineral management guidance, and remote sensing is a cost-effective solution for covering a wide spatial area with high temporal frequency. However, the diverse landscape in mining areas presents a challenge for finding a suitable monitoring method. To address this challenge, this study proposes a remote sensing-based comprehensive mining ecological index (CMEI), which integrates vegetation greenness, soil wetness, urban heat, air quality and water quality indicators obtained from Landsat images and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The integration is achieved through a principal component analysis (PCA) to encapsulate various aspects of the environment in opencast mining areas. The proposed CMEI was then applied to assess the performance of an ecological restoration project carried out in the Xilinhot coalfield in Inner Mongolia, China, over the past two decades. Our findings show that the overall ecological environment in the dumping sites and backfilling sites of Xilinhot coalfield has improved from a score of 0.15 in 2005 to 0.33 in 2020, according to the CMEI. Nevertheless, our study also highlights that some newly established dumping sites require further strengthening of management and maintenance measures. The CMEI presents a novel and effective approach for monitoring and evaluating the ecological environment in mining areas, and it can potentially be applied to assess the ecological environment of opencast mining areas globally.},

Abstract = {Agro-Ecological Infrastructures (AEIs) include many semi-natural habitats (hedgerows, grass strips, grasslands, thickets.) and play a key role in biodiversity preservation, water quality and erosion control. Indirect biodiversity indicators based on AEISs are used in many national and European public policies to analyze ecological processes. The identification of these landscape features is difficult and expensive and limits their use. Remote sensing has a great potential to solve this problem. In this study, we propose an operational tool for the identification and characterization of AEISs. The method is based on segmentation, contextual classification and fusion of temporal classifications. Experiments were carried out on various temporal and spatial resolution satellite data (20-m, 10-m, 5-m, 2.5-m, 50-cm), on three French regions southwest landscape (hilly, plain, wooded, cultivated), north (open-field) and Brittany (farmland closed by hedges). The results give a good idea of the potential of remote sensing image processing methods to map fine agro-ecological objects. At 20-m spatial resolution, only larger hedgerows and riparian forests are apparent. Classification results show that 10-m resolution is well suited for agricultural and AEIs applications, most hedges, forest edges, thickets can be detected. Results highlight the multi-temporal data importance. The future Sentinel satellites with a very high temporal resolution and a 10-m spatial resolution should be an answer to AEIs detection. 2.50-m resolution is more precise with more details. But treatments are more complicated. At 50-cm resolution, accuracy level of details is even higher; this amplifies the difficulties previously reported. The results obtained allow calculation of statistics and metrics describing landscape structures.},

Title = {Development of a Water Quality Management Model for Dry Rivers in Arid Regions: Application on Wadi Rumah, Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In dry rivers, urban wastewater discharge forms a pond in the dry period, and surface runoff shapes a longer pond in the wet period. A water quality management model developed for dry rivers is applied on Wadi Rumah in Saudi Arabia. The sub-basin was delineated from 30-m x 30-m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Hydrologic loss, runoff rates, and time of concentration were determined using the soil conservation service curve number, soil conservation service unit hydrograph methods, and Kirpich formula. Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System estimated the wet weather flows for 10 low-to-medium rainfall events. A steady-state hydrodynamic model including river flows, effluent discharge, and evaporation and infiltration losses estimated the hydraulic retention time for the explicit case of ponding conditions of dry rivers. Mass balance and first-order kinetics modeled the physical (total dissolved solid and total suspended solid), chemical (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, NH3, PO4, and Cl2), and microbiological (total coliform and fecal coliform) parameters. The hydrodynamic model and biokinetic rate coefficients were calibrated with satellite images, reported literature, and field measurements. A water quality index compared the aggregated water quality against the standards for 4 intended uses. The study yields ``very good{''} water quality for restricted and unrestricted irrigation for the dry period, ``fair{''} for livestock drinking, and ``marginal{''} for fishery and recreation for the dry period, while water quality remained ``marginal{''} for all the uses in the wet period. Water quality management implies regular water quality monitoring, continuous improvement of treatment facilities, and flood plain management initiatives for the long-term sustainability of dry rivers in arid regions.},

Volume = {551},
Pages = {63-79},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Sargassum C. Agardh is one of the most diverse genera of marine macroalgae, and commonly inhabits shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters. This study aimed at investigating the effect of seasonality and the associated water-quality changes on the distribution, canopy cover, mean thallus length and biomass of Sargassum beds around Point Peron, Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, southwest Australia. Samples of Sargassum and seawater were collected every 3 mo from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2014, from 4 different reef zones. A combination of in situ observations and WorldView-2 satellite remote-sensing images were used to map the spatial distribution of Sargassum beds and other associated benthic habitats. The results demonstrated strong seasonal variation in the physicochemical water parameters, canopy cover, mean thallus length, and biomass of Sargassum, which were significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by nutrient concentrations (PO43-, NO3-, NH4+) and rainfall. However, no significant variation in any studied parameter was observed among the 4 reef zones. The highest Sargassum biomass peaks occurred between late spring and early summer (from September to January). The results provide essential information to guide effective conservation and management, as well as sustainable utilisation of this renewable coastal marine resource.},

Abstract = {To understand the relationship between spatial water quality patterns and changes in land-use/cover types in the Jinghe Oasis, 47 water sampling sites measured in May and October 2015 were divided into six cluster layers using the self-organizing map method, which is based on non-hierarchical k-means classification. The water quality indices included the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chromaticity (SD), and turbidity (NUT). Data was also collected on the changes in the farmland, forest-grassland, water body, salinized land, and other land types during the wet and dry seasons. Then, we combined these data with the classification results of the GF-1 remote sensing satellite data obtained in May and October 2015 and analyzed the influences of land-use/cover type on water quality for different layers and seasons. The results indicate that Clusters 1 to 3 included monitoring samples from the wet season (May 2015), whereas Clusters 4 to 6 included monitoring samples from the dry season (October 2015). In general, the COD, SS, NUT, TN, and NH3-N values were high around the Ganjia Lake Haloxylon natural conservation area in the southern Ebinur Lake region, east of Ebinur Lake, and around the Kuitun River during the wet season. The SD values around these areas were high. Moreover, high BOD and TP values were mainly concentrated around the Ganjia Lake Haloxylon natural conservation area, as well as the Kuitun River, during the dry season. In the discussion on the relationship between the different water quality parameters and land-use/cover type changes, we determined that farmland, forest-grassland, and salinized land significantly influenced the water quality parameters in the Jinghe Oasis. In addition, the influences of various land-use/cover types on the water quality parameters in the research zone during the different seasons exhibited the following descending order of magnitude: farmland forest-grassland salinized land water body others. Moreover, their influences were lower during the wet season than the dry season. In conclusion, developing research on the relationship between the spatial framework of the water quality in the Jinghe Oasis and land-use/cover type changes is significant for the time sequence distribution of water quality in arid regions from both theoretical and practical perspectives.},

Title = {Seagrass distribution, areal cover, and changes (1990-2021) in coastal waters off West-Central Florida, USA},

Abstract = {Seagrass meadows of West-Central Florida (USA), between 27 degrees 3 ` N - 28 degrees 12 ` N; 82 degrees 24 ` W - 82 degrees 50 ` W, are closely monitored by federal, state, and local groups for benthic composition, density, and areal cover (extent). Biennial aerial mapping, annual in situ surveys, and monthly water quality measurements inform management and conservation actions. Here we leverage a complete archive of multiple satellite imagery products (i.e., Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 imaging sensor data) to reconstruct seagrass areal cover estimates (1990-2021) in four regions of West-Central Florida: St. Joseph Sound, Clearwater Harbor, Tampa Bay, and Sarasota Bay. Satellite imagery hosted in Google Earth Engine (GEE) was screened for low cloud cover (<40\%), and clear atmosphere and water conditions using a semi-automated process followed by visual inspection. Im-agery meeting these conditions for seagrass mapping was available for 16 years: 1990, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2004-2006, 2010, and 2015-2021. Space-based time series of seagrass areal cover for each region showed positive correlation with estimates from aerial mapping (r > 0.61). Over the period 1990-2021, satellite-derived estimates show seagrass areal cover increased by 24.3 km(2) (34.4\%) in Tampa Bay, 18.0 km(2) (74.1\%) in St. Joseph Sound, 6.3 km(2) (182.6\%) in Clearwater, and 1.3 km(2) (5.3\%) in Sarasota. Overall, the combined seagrass areal cover for the entire region increased by 49.9 km(2) (40.6\%), or similar to 1.4\% yr(-1), from 1990 through 2021. In-creases in seagrass areal cover before 2020 coincide with improvements in water quality throughout the region (i.e., a general decrease in chlorophyll-a, phosphorous, nitrogen concentration, and turbidity). The publicly available satellite datasets in GEE provide resource managers with complementary and unique tools for syn-optic and repeated seagrass areal cover assessments. This is an important approach to monitor the seagrass cover Essential Ocean Variable (EOV) of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).},

Abstract = {Frequent adjustment of operating strategies in water treatment plant and water distribution network as a simultaneous response to growing water scarcity has been a grand challenge. This challenge is emanated from transitioning the sporadic water quality samplings to self-awareness, self-adaptive, and fast response system. To bridge this gap, a cyber-physical system (CPS) is developed in this study to respond to the needs of smart and sustainable drinking water infrastructure management. This new CPS is able to gather the massive volumes of information from ground and aquatic reference data via advanced remote sensing and sensor network technologies to timely detect water pollution, exchange information through cyber interfaces, provide early-warning awareness with the aid of different models, and support actionable intelligence. Integrated 5-level CPS architecture is proposed in this study as an instruction of developing CPS for smart and sustainable drinking water infrastructure management.},

Abstract = {In order to help data providers make informed decisions regarding the availability and accessibility of Earth observations for societal benefit, a cross-sectoral meta-analysis of observation priorities was conducted from the perspective of users. The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observations' (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Users' needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs. The 10 highest ranked observations are: (1) Precipitation, (2) Soil Moisture, (3) Surface Air Temperature, (4) Land Cover, (5) Surface Wind Speed (6) Vegetation Cover, (7) Surface Humidity, (8) Urbanization, (9) Vegetation Type, and (10) Surface Wind Direction and Sea Surface Temperature (tie). This study represents one viable method to assess the priority of Earth observations from the perspective of users. The list of critical Earth observation priorities from this study is a foundation for engagement between data providers and users in regard to observation priorities.},

Abstract = {Groundwater is a strategic resource due to its usually high quality and perennial availability. However, groundwater management all over the world often lacks sustainability as evidenced by falling water tables, drying wetlands, increasing sea-water intrusion and general deterioration of water quality. As groundwater cannot be renewed artificially on a large scale, sustainable management of this resource is vital. A number of scientific tools are available to assist in his task. Three items are discussed here. They include methods for the determination of groundwater recharge, groundwater modeling including the estimation of its uncertainty, and the interfacing to the socio-economic field. Generally the quality of water management work can be largely enhanced with new tools available, including remote sensing, digital terrain models, differential GPS, environmental tracers, automatic data collection, modeling and the coupling of models from different disciplines.},

Title = {Chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids retrieval and mapping using Sentinel-2A and machine learning for inland waters},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {113},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) are both key indicators of the biophysical status of inland waters, and their continued monitoring is essential. Existing conventional methods (e.g., in situ monitoring) have shown that they are impractical due to their time and space limitations. The recently operated Sentinel-2A satellite offers the potential to have higher temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution images with no cost for monitoring water quality parameters of inland waters. The main aim of this study was to develop a semi-empirical model for predicting water quality parameters by combining Sentinel-2A data and machine learning methods using samples collected from several water reservoirs within the southern part of the Czech Republic, Central Europe. A combination of 10 spectral bands of the Sentinel-2A and 19 spectral indices, as independent variables, were used to train prediction models (i.e., Cubist) and then produce spatial distribution maps for both Chl-a and TSS. The results showed that the prediction accuracy based on Sentinel-2A was adequate for both Chl-a (R-2 = 0.85, RMSEp = 48.572) and TSS (R-2 = 0.80, RMSEp = 19.55). The spatial distribution maps derived from Sentinel-2A performed well where Chl-a and TSS were relatively high. The temporal changes in both Chl-a and TSS could be seen in the distribution maps. The temporal changes are showing that The values of TSS dramatically changed in fishponds compared to sand lakes over time which might be due to indifferent management practices. Overall, it can be concluded that Sentinel-2A, when coupled with machine learning algorithms, could be employed as a reliable, inexpensive, and accurate instrument for monitoring the biophysical status of small inland waters like fishponds and sandpit lakes.},

Abstract = {Assessments of potential environmental impacts of non-point source (NPS) pollutants at local and regional scales are necessary as a basis for effective management strategies to protect precious resources such as land and water. Intensive watershed scale study is therefore necessary to develop management strategies for abating the agricultural NPS pollution. The major goal of the present study was to identify the critical areas of an agricultural watershed and recommend the best management practices using a physical process based watershed scale model, soil water assessment tool (SWAT). A 973-ha agricultural watershed located in Midnapore district of West Bengal state in eastern India was monitored to quantify the hydrologic parameters such as runoff, sediment yield and the quality of surface water. The model was calibrated and validated using observed hydrologic and water quality data of the watershed monitored during the rainy seasons of 2002 and 2003, respectively. Besides these data, micro-meteorological data, topographical map, soil map, land resources data and remote sensing data (satellite imagery) of the watershed were used as input to the model. The study revealed that SWAT model simulates daily runoff, sediment yield and nutrient concentration in runoff satisfactorily throughout the entire rainy season, as evident from standard statistical tests. The calibrated model was then successfully used for identifying the critical sub-watersheds and for development of best management practices. Several simulations were performed to determine the best out of the 48 different combinations of treatments for the management of the critical sub-watersheds. The study revealed that no other crop could replace the rice (Oryza sativa) crop during the rainy season and the existing conventional tillage practice needs to be replaced by conservation tillage in order to minimize the sediment yield and nutrient losses. Fertilizer application rate of 80:60 kg ha(-1) of N:P is also recommended to minimize the surface water pollution in the watershed due to NO3-N and P. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Remote sensing-based assessment of ecosystem health by optimizing vigor-organization-resilience model: A case study in Fuzhou City, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {72},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although remote sensing technology has been used to evaluate regional ecosystem health for a long time, it is still necessary to find a suitable index system to better evaluate ecosystem health. This study aims to improve the ecosystem health measurement ability of remote sensing technology. This research was carried out in Fuzhou under the traditional Vigor-Organization-Resilience (VOR) framework by optimizing and improving the construction method of sub-indexes. Sub-indexes were constructed using spectral index analysis, landscape theoretical ecology model and spatial measurement. Three remote sensing datasets were used (1996, 2008 and 2021) to carry out remote sensing diagnosis of regional ecosystem health in the Fuzhou administrative region. The main research findings and conclusions were as follows. A new comprehensive vigor index (CVI) was developed by the principal component analysis (PCA) based on the four indicators: fractional vegetation cover (FVC), global vegetation moisture index (GVMI), vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), normalized differential buildup and bare soil index (NDBSI). A new organizational index was constructed based on the landscape index. Four types of indexes, namely landscape heterogeneity (LH), landscape connectivity (LC), the shape characteristics of forest patches (CS) and the connectivity of forest patches (CC) were used as the main factors for calculating the organizational index. A resilience index calculation framework was proposed based on the habitat quality model. The temporal and spatial characteristics of ecosystem health were evaluated and analyzed. The regional ecosystem health value of the whole region reduced gradually, with average values of 0.3521 (1996), 0.3445 (2008) and 0.3345 (2021) respectively. The average reduction rate was 0.0007 per year (1996-2021). The proposed remote sensing diagnosis method provides a complete framework for solving the problems of measuring the dynamic evolution process and characteristics of regional ecosystem health.},

Pages = {1321-1336},
Abstract = {In this study, a robust interval linear programming (RILP) method is developed for dealing with uncertainties expressed as intervals with deterministic boundaries. An enhanced two-step method (ETSM) is also advanced to solve the RILP model. The developed RILP improves upon the conventional interval linear programming (ILP) method since it can generate solution intervals within a larger feasible zone. The decision space based on ETSM contains all feasible solutions, such that no useful information is neglected. Moreover, the RILP can guarantee the stability of the optimization model due to no violation for the best-case constraints. The results also suggest that the RILP is effective for practical environmental and engineering problems that involve uncertainties.},

Abstract = {Land-use change is very important for determining and assessing the influence of human activity on aquatic environment of rivers and lakes. The present work with Bosten River basin as the subject, analyzes features of dynamic land-use change of the basin from 1993 to 2013, in order to study the influence ofland-use pattern change on the basin water quality, according to the land-use / land-cover(LUCC) chart from 2000 to 2013 made by ArcGIS and FN VI. It shows cultivated land, wetland and forestland constitute most of Bosten River basin, taking up over 41.79/0 of the total; from 1993-2000, LUCC of the basin is relatively small, with an increase of cultivated land, residential-industry land, water wetlands by 15.09\%-18.33\%,most of which are transformed from forestland, grassland and unused land; from 2000-2013, LUCC of the basin is relatively significant, with a continuing and bigger increase of cultivated land and Residential-industry area, most of which are transformed from water wetlands and unused land. Based on analysis of land use pattern and water quality index, it can be told that water pollution is positively correlated to cultivated land and residential-industry area and negatively con-elated to water and grassland. Also, the influence of land-use pattern change on water quality has been discussed, whose finding can serve as the scientific evidence for land-use optimization and water pollution control.},

Title = {Measurement of Total Nitrogen Concentration in Surface Water Using Hyperspectral Band Observation Method},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Nitrogen overload is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of surface water quality. Hence, monitoring nitrogen loadings is vital in maintaining good surface water quality. Increasingly, the use of spectral reflectance to monitor nitrogen concentration in water has shown potentials, but it poses some problems. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new methods of quantitative monitoring of nitrogen concentration in surface water. In this paper, hyperspectral data from surface water in the Ebinur Lake watershed are used to select sensitive bands using spectral transformation, the spectral index, and a coupling of these two methods. The particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM) model, constructed on the basis of sensitive bands, is used quantitatively to estimate the total nitrogen concentration in surface water and subsequently to verify its accuracy. The results show that the bands near 680, 850, and 940 nm can be used as sensitive bands for estimation of the total nitrogen concentration of surface water in arid regions. Compared with the best estimation models constructed by sensitive bands selected using the spectral transformation or the spectral index alone, the best model based on the coupling of these two measures is more accurate (R-2= 0.604, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.61 mg/L, Residual Prediction Deviation (RPD) = 2.002). This coupling method leads to a robust, accurate, and strong predictability model, and can contribute to improved quantitative estimation of water quality indexes of rivers in arid regions.},

Title = {Multiple Images Improve Lake CDOM Estimation: Building Better Landsat 8 Empirical Algorithms across Southern Canada},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important water property for lake management. Remote sensing using empirical algorithms has been used to estimate CDOM, with previous studies relying on coordinated field campaigns that coincided with satellite overpass. However, this requirement reduces the maximum possible sample size for model calibration. New satellites and advances in cloud computing platforms offer opportunities to revisit assumptions about methods used for empirical algorithm calibration. Here, we explore the opportunities and limits of using median values of Landsat 8 satellite images across southern Canada to estimate CDOM. We compare models created using an expansive view of satellite image availability with those emphasizing a tight timing between the date of field sampling and the date of satellite overpass. Models trained on median band values from across multiple summer seasons performed better (adjusted R-2 = 0.70, N = 233) than models for which imagery was constrained to a 30-day time window (adjusted R-2 = 0.45). Model fit improved rapidly when incorporating more images, producing a model at a national scale that performed comparably to others found in more limited spatial extents. This research indicated that dense satellite imagery holds new promise for understanding relationships between in situ CDOM and satellite reflectance data across large areas.},

Abstract = {The use of optical properties as key parameters has been widely used in water quality monitoring, which accelerates the advances of remote sensing in the field of environmental monitoring. Current analytical methods for determining heavy metals in water include flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), atomic adsorption spectrophotometry (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, which typically require use of chemicals for sample processing and pretreatment as well as high capital input for analysis. Therefore, this study aims at investigating the potential of using non-destructive approaches for rapid water monitoring of heavy metal from green chemistry perspective. The proposed non-destructive sensing techniques include X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and visible-near infrared spectroradiometer (VNIR). The former is an elemental analyser specifically for elements with relatively high atomic number, and the latter measures the reflectance or transmittance from samples. Heavy metals of lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were selected as the target water constitutes in the study. The results from the analysis were then be used for determining a correlation model through chemometric approaches. Our results demonstrated that both of the target metals could be analysed via the proposed analytical methods. Reasonable agreements between the measurements from XRF and ICP were observed, whereas moderate correlations were perceived for simple linear regression model using spectral information from VNIR. Results from this study are expected to provide useful information on rapid identification of metal-polluting sources.},

Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {The suitable spectral mode in remote sensing is often desirable to facilitate the inversion of ecological environment and landscape. This paper put forward an optimizing model based on variable precision rough sets (VPRS) for the land cover discrimination in wetland inventory. In the case study of Lake Baiyangdian which has important ecological functions to the northern China, this model is established successfully according to the domain-experts knowledge. The procedure is as follows. First step is data collection, including remote-sensing data (e.g., Landsat-5 TM bands), the digitized relief maps, and statistical yearbooks. Second, the remote sensing imagery (RSI) and relief maps are co-registered into the same resolution. Third, a condition set, including various attributes is derived from spectral bands, band math or ratio indices based on previous studies, at the same time, the decision set is derived from true land types after investigation and validation. Then, the remote sensing decision table (RSDT) is constructed by linking condition set with decision set according to the sequential pixels in RSI. Fourth, we create one forward greedy searching algorithm based on VPRS to handle this RSDT. After adjusting parameters such as 0 and knowledge granularity diameter (KGD), we obtain the stable optimized results. Comparative experiments and evaluation show that the discrimination or retrieval accuracy of VPRS model is satisfying (overall accuracy: 87.32\% and KHAT: 0.84) and better than original data. Moreover, data dimension has been decreased dramatically (from 12 to 3) and key attributes found by the model may be useful for specific retrieval in wetland inventories. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Total evaporation estimation for accurate water accounting purposes: an appraisal of various available estimation methods},
Journal = {GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1333-1351},
Abstract = {The estimation of total evaporation is fundamental for water accounting, considering its influence on water availability. Moreover, the current increase in water consumption (e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa and the world over), land cover/use changes, deteriorating water quality and the climate change projections in most regions of the world underscore the need to understand water loss. So far, different approaches have been developed and implemented in estimating the variations of total evaporation, with varying accuracies. The aim of this work was therefore, to provide a review of these different approaches for estimating total evaporation, as well as a detailed discussion of their strengths and weaknesses. Findings from this review have shown that total evaporation estimates derived, using ground-based meteorological and micro-meteorological methods are inadequate for representing its large-scale spatial variations. On the other hand, remote sensing technology, which acquires data at different resolutions (i.e. radiometric, spectral, spatial and temporal), provides timely, up-to-date and relatively accurate spatial estimates of total evaporation over large geographic coverage, for sustainable and effective water accounting, which is key for well-informed and improved management of water resources at both catchment and regional scales. In this regard, more details on the remote sensing-based methods of estimating total evaporation are provided, especially considering the robust technological advancements and its potential in characterizing earth features over time and space. This work has also managed to identify research gaps and challenges in the accurate estimation of total evaporation, using remote sensing, especially with the emergence of more advanced sensors and the characteristics of the landscape.},

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {251},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Wetlands conservation and resilience capacities are key issues in many places over the globe. Understanding these issues will benefit from a precise knowledge of seagrass species occupancy and coverage over time and over space. Such information can be obtained from remote sensing images and their classification thanks to a vegetation index, to be used in a complementary manner to field work inventories. Sentinel-2 data, which are available with a frequent revisit time (<5 days) and a high spatial resolution (10m pixel size) can be used to map grassbeds at the surface or slightly below the surface of permanent lagoons, hence enabling the characterization of its seasonal dynamics, which was not possible with previous remote-sensing tools. We have proved the feasibility of such a method in the natural reserve of the Bagnas (Herault, France) where Stuckenia pectinata coverage can be tracked over a full year thanks to Sentinel-2 images and field work. Inter-annual dynamics (seasonal growth and senescence) can be mapped over time with 10m resolution and will be extended to pluriannual studies thanks to the long-term objective of the Sentinel-2 mission. This opens the way to a concerted management of natural reserves based on data analysis and field knowledge, a better understanding of seagrass coverage with fluctuating environmental conditions, and predictive mechanistic and/or stochastic models of future qualitative trends.},

Title = {Measurement of Total Dissolved Solids and Total Suspended Solids in Water Systems: A Review of the Issues, Conventional, and Remote Sensing Techniques},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study provides a comprehensive review of the efforts utilized in the measurement of water quality parameters (WQPs) with a focus on total dissolved solids (TDS) and total suspended solids (TSS). The current method used in the measurement of TDS and TSS includes conventional field and gravimetric approaches. These methods are limited due to the associated cost and labor, and limited spatial coverages. Remote Sensing (RS) applications have, however, been used over the past few decades as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Although they also present underlying atmospheric interferences in images, radiometric and spectral resolution issues. Studies of these WQPs with RS, therefore, require the knowledge and utilization of the best mechanisms. The use of RS for retrieval of TDS, TSS, and their forms has been explored in many studies using images from airborne sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite sensors such as those onboard the Landsat, Sentinel-2, Aqua, and Terra platforms. The images and their spectral properties serve as inputs for deep learning analysis and statistical, and machine learning models. Methods used to retrieve these WQP measurements are dependent on the optical properties of the inland water bodies. While TSS is an optically active parameter, TDS is optically inactive with a low signal-noise ratio. The detection of TDS in the visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands is due to some process that (usually) co-occurs with changes in the TDS that is affecting a WQP that is optically active. This study revealed significant improvements in incorporating RS and conventional approaches in estimating WQPs. The findings reveal that improved spatiotemporal resolution has the potential to effectively detect changes in the WQPs. For effective monitoring of TDS and TSS using RS, we recommend employing atmospheric correction mechanisms to reduce image atmospheric interference, exploration of the fusion of optical and microwave bands, high-resolution hyperspectral images, utilization of ML and deep learning models, calibration and validation using observed data measured from conventional methods. Further studies could focus on the development of new technology and sensors using UAVs and satellite images to produce real-time in situ monitoring of TDS and TSS. The findings presented in this review aid in consolidating understanding and advancement of TDS and TSS measurements in a single repository thereby offering stakeholders, researchers, decision-makers, and regulatory bodies a go-to information resource to enhance their monitoring efforts and mitigation of water quality impairments.},

Title = {Analysis of Suspended Particulate Matter and Its Drivers in Sahelian Ponds and Lakes by Remote Sensing (Landsat and MODIS): Gourma Region, Mali},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {The Sahelian region is characterized by significant variations in precipitation, impacting water quantity and quality. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27\% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.},

Abstract = {Here, we introduce an interactive communication and management system, Scope Water, which is constructed to establish a transfer of results from research work directed towards the solving of a specific problem. To proceed step by step towards this goal, the system uses a structured approach. Starting with the global exploration of knowledge, expertise, and ideas from experts, passing an objective assessment of this information and leading finally to a cooperative making up of a concept for problem solving by specialists. Scope Water has been developed on the basis of recent advances in cybernetic management experienced in team meetings and was successfully launched as a tool to gain quick access to recent results from research work on water by Strategic Science Consult Ltd. (SSC). SSC now plans to broaden the application of Scope Water by adding a platform which allows scientists on remote sensing to offer their results, knowledge and ideas as a service to help to solve specific problems on studying/monitoring aquatic systems. Single scientists, working groups and research institutions are invited to participate in such a service network on remote sensing and are asked to declare their interest by sending an e-mail to the authors address given above.},

Abstract = {Current spectrometer design and the increasingly affordable price of field hyperspectral sensors are making feasible their use for water quality monitoring. In this study, we parameterized a semi-analytical algorithm to derive constituent concentrations from field spectroradiometer measurements in ten freshwater reservoirs over two years. In contrast to algorithms parameterized for single airborne or satellite sensor deployments, we optimized the algorithm for robust performance across all reservoirs and for multi-temporal application. Our algorithm produced chlorophyll-a concentration estimates with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 7.7 mg.m(-3) over a range of 4-135 mg.m(-3). The model also produced estimates of total suspended solids (TSS) concentration with an RMSE of 4.0 g.m(-3) over a range of 0-25 g.m(-3). Choosing a non-linear objective function during inversion reduced variance of residuals in chlorophyll-a and TSS estimates by 20 and 18 percentage points, respectively. Application of our algorithm to two years of data and over ten study sites allowed us to specify sources of suboptimal parameterization and measure the non-stationarity of algorithm performance, analyses difficult for short or single deployments. Suboptimal parameterization, especially of backscatter properties between reservoirs, was the greatest source of error in our algorithm, accounting for 17\%-20\% of all error. In only one reservoir was time-dependent error apparent. In this reservoir, decreases in TSS over time resulted in less TSS estimate error due to imperfect model parameterization. For future applications, especially with ground-based sensors, model performance can easily be improved by using non-linear inversion procedures and replicating spectral measurements.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) technologies provide a diagnostic tool that can serve as an early warning system, allowing the agricultural community to intervene early on to counter potential problems before they spread widely and negatively impact crop productivity. With the recent advancements in sensor technologies, data management and data analytics, currently, several RS options are available to the agricultural community. However, the agricultural sector is yet to implement RS technologies fully due to knowledge gaps on their sufficiency, appropriateness and techno-economic feasibilities. This study reviewed the literature between 2000 to 2019 that focused on the application of RS technologies in production agriculture, ranging from field preparation, planting, and in-season applications to harvesting, with the objective of contributing to the scientific understanding on the potential for RS technologies to support decision-making within different production stages. We found an increasing trend in the use of RS technologies in agricultural production over the past 20 years, with a sharp increase in applications of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) after 2015. The largest number of scientific papers related to UASs originated from Europe (34\%), followed by the United States (20\%) and China (11\%). Most of the prior RS studies have focused on soil moisture and in-season crop health monitoring, and less in areas such as soil compaction, subsurface drainage, and crop grain quality monitoring. In summary, the literature highlighted that RS technologies can be used to support site-specific management decisions at various stages of crop production, helping to optimize crop production while addressing environmental quality, profitability, and sustainability.},

Abstract = {In arid and semi-arid regions, water-quality problems are crucial to local social demand and human well-being. However, the conventional remote sensing-based direct detection of water quality parameters, especially using spectral reflectance of water, must satisfy certain preconditions (e.g., flat water surface and ideal radiation geometry). In this study, we hypothesized that drone-borne hyperspectral imagery of emergent plants could be better applied to retrieval total nitrogen (TN) concentration in water regardless of preconditions possibly due to the spectral responses of emergent plants on nitrogen removal and water purification. To test this hypothesis, a total of 200 groups of bootstrap samples were used to examine the relationship between the extracted TN concentrations from the drone-borne hyperspectral imagery of emergent plants and the experimentally measured TN concentrations in Ebinur Lake Oasis using four machine learning (ML) models (Partial Least Squares (PLS), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Gaussian Process (GP)). Through the introduction of the fractional order derivative (FOD), we build a decision-level fusion (DLF) model to minimize the regression results' biases of individual ML models. For individual ML model, GP performed the best. Still, the amount of uncertainty in individual ML models renders their performance to be subpar. The introduction of the DLF model greatly minimizes the regression results' biases. The DLF model allows to reduce potential uncertainties without sacrificing accuracy. In conclusion, the spectral response caused by nitrogen removal and water purification on emergent plants could be used to retrieve TN concentration in water with a DLF model framework. Our study offers a new perspective and a basic scientific support for water quality monitoring in arid regions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The modem remote sensing and GIS tools used in the coastal resource management will become one of the best alternatives to concentrate on the coastal vulnerability issues. In the present work will be presented the recent development of an increased understanding over the coastal process on synoptic scale afferent Romanian shore, and will give the possibility of an advised selection of different solutions for protection and conservation of the area. The work presents the certain approaches and results on GIS/spatial analysis based on RS data, towards an erosion control within Romanian littoral, presently under intense consolidation at the sea-land interface. The fusion of multiple, complementary image data sources (of different spatial/temporal, spectral/radiometric resolutions) and associated GIS databases, approached in a complex way, it were developed based on a geographic informational systems, and continuous upgraded within a national partnership projects. A similar system of mixed RS\&GIS techniques, built within a scheme of multi-institutional collaboration, it was completed as a dynamic tool for coastal environmental education, as well a tool to asses, for a period of several decades, the sustainability and ICZM activities on Romanian coastal area. Certain results of its implementation within several projects of reconstruction were emphasized in the synthesis.},

Abstract = {Coastal wetland soils play a vital role in providing habitats for wildlife and vegetation, and in affecting water quality and primary production in coastal wetland ecosystem. The spatial prediction of soil properties provides important data support to help sustainable wetland management. This research explored the relationships between soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil available potassium (AK) and multiple environmental variables such as remote sensing spectral indices, geographic attributes and land use types of coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Soil moisture and geographic attributes were the major factors controlling the spatial distribution of soil TN. Soil salinity, vegetation and geographic attributes were the key factors affecting the spatial distribution of soil AK. The research established spatial prediction models of soil TN and AK by random forest method, and showed heterogeneous spatial patterns of TN and AK in the study area. Soil TN model showed relatively higher prediction performance compared with soil AK model. The research framework utilized in this study can be promoted to predict and map other soil properties, and has significant implication for the site-specific soil management of coastal wetlands in the YRD.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Multiple Machine Learning Methods in Remote Sensing Quantitative Retrieval of Suspended Matter Concentrations: A Case Study of Nansi Lake in North China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},

Abstract = {Total suspended matter (TSM) is a core parameter in the quantitative retrieval of ocean color remote sensing and an important indicator for evaluating the quality of the aquatic environment. This study selects part of Nansi Lake in North China as the study area. Researchers used Hyperion remote sensing data and field-measured TSM concentration as data sources. Firstly, the characteristic variables with high correlation were selected based on spectral analysis. Then, seven methods such as linear regression, BP neural network (BP), KNN, random forest (RF), and random forest based on genetic algorithm optimization (GA\_RF) are used to construct the inversion model of TSM concentration. The retrieval accuracy of each model shows that the machine learning models are much more accurate than the linear model. Among them, the GA\_RF model retrieves the suspended solids concentration with the best performance and the highest prediction accuracy, with a determination coefficient R-2 of 0.98, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.715 mg/L, and an average relative error (ARE) of 6.83\%. Additionally, the spatial distribution of TSM concentration was inversed by Hyperion remote sensing image. The results showed that the concentration of TSM was lower in the northwest and higher in the southeast, and the concentration distribution was uneven, showing the characteristics of a typical shallow macrophytic lake. This study provides an effective method for monitoring TSM concentration and other water quality parameters in the shallow macrophytic lake and further proves the advantages of machine learning in ocean color inversion. All in all, this research provides some useful methods and suggestions for quantitative inversion of TSM concentration in shallow macrophytic lakes.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of information technology and location techniques not only leads to an increasing growth of massive geospatial big data but also raises the attention of using these data to complement with remote sensing images. Many efforts have been made to utilize geospatial big data to identify human activity patterns and carry out urban and environmental researches, integrating with remote sensing images. Nonetheless, there are still many issues, including the representativeness and locality of geospatial big data, as well as the fusion methods, remain to be further explored. In this article, we first reviewed the innovation and proceedings of data mining and analyzing techniques, as well as remote sensing applications driven by geospatial big data. Besides, two popular concepts, namely, ``Social Sensing{''} and ``Urban Computing,{''} were briefly introduced. Then, we highlighted the role of geospatial big data in mining human activity dynamics and socioeconomic characteristics, and the feasibility of combining with remote sensing data for various studies. Lastly, we presented some empirical case studies on the confluence of remote sensing and geospatial big data in land use extraction, environmental and disaster monitoring, as well as socioeconomic dynamics sensing. The provided examples and discussion demonstrated the high efficiency and complementarity of the integration of remote sensing and geospatial big data, which benefits decision making from multiple perspectives and scales.},

Abstract = {When Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in the source water is in contact with disinfectants in a drinking water treatment process, it oftentimes causes the formation of disinfection byproducts such as Trihalomethanes which have harmful effects on human health. As a result of the potential health risk of Trihalomethanes for drinking water, proper monitoring and forecasting of high TOC episodes in the source water body can be helpful for the operators who are in charge of the decisions when they have to start the removal procedures for TOC in surface water treatment plants. This issue is of great importance in Lake Mead in the United States which provides drinking water for 25 million people, while it is considered as an important recreational area and wildlife habitat as well. In this study, artificial neural network, extreme learning machine, and genetic programming are examined using the long-term observations of TOC concentration throughout the lake. Among these models, the model with the best performance was applied in the development of a forecasting model to predict TOC values on a daily basis. The forecasting process is aided by an iterative scheme via updating the daily satellite imagery in concert with retrieving the long-term memory of the past states with nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARXNET) on a rolling basis onwards. The best input scenario of NARXNET was selected with respect to several statistical indices. Numerical outputs of the forecasting process confirm the fidelity of the iterative scheme in predicting water quality status one day ahead of the time.},

Abstract = {Assessments of hurricane-induced environmental impacts are important to coastal management and risk analysis of ecosystems. In this study, a previously-developed remote sensing model for non-hurricane conditions by Wang et al. {[}Wang, H. Q. Hladik, C. M., Milla, K., Huang, W. R., Edmiston, L, Harwell, M. A., \& Schalles, J. F. (in press). Detecting and mapping water quality indicators in Apalachicola Bay, Florida using MODIS Terra 250-m imagery. International Journal of Remote Sensing] has been substantially enhanced to investigate the impact of Hurricane Frances on total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, USA. The remote sensing model uses 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to map TSS concentrations in the Bay. Eleven additional satellite imageries of MODIS were used in the model improvement and calibration. TSS concentration computation in the present model has been substantially improved by using a two-step process: firstly producing atmospheric correction intercept by an approach of in-water reflectance regression, and then building the regression model (R-2 = 0.8534, n = 25) between 250-m MODIS reflectance and observed TSS concentrations, which includes an extreme high TSS concentration data of 208 mg/L for severe storm or hurricane condition. Also, we carried out the validation of model (RMSE = 5.5 mg/L, n = 21). MODIS-derived TSS maps show substantial increases of TSS concentrations in the Bay during the passage of Hurricane Frances (the average TSS and maximum concentration about 54.3 mg/L and 165 mg/L in the Bay respectively) compared to under no-storm or -hurricane condition ( the average TSS and maximum concentration were approximately 24-27 mg/L and 58-64 mg/L. In comparison to those before and 5-days after the passage of the hurricane, the average TSS concentration in the Bay was twice higher while the maximum TSS concentration increased almost three times during the hurricane. This indicates that strong winds during the hurricane have caused strong sediment re-suspension. The spatial variations of TSS concentrations were analyzed by applying the hydrodynamic characteristics of wind-induced flow and tidal currents as described by Huang {[}Huang, W., Jones, K., \& Wu, T. (2002). Modeling surface wind effects on subtidal salinity in Apalachicola Bay. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 55(1), 33-46; Huang, W., Sun, H. Nnaji, S., \& Jones, K (2002). Tidal hydrodynamics in a multiple inlet estuary: Apalachicola Bay. International Journal of Coastal Research, 18 (4), 674-684], which show westward currents in the Bay under westward wind condition. Therefore, the southwestward wind (about 50 degrees from the north) during the hurricane induced southwestward currents and transport that resulted in the high TSS concentrations near West Pass in the Bay and the Gulf. Within the Bay, TSS concentrations were generally higher in the southern portion of the Bay, which was due mainly to transport by the combination of southwestward wind and southward residual flow from the Apalachicola River.

Abstract = {We integrated hyperspectral and field-measured chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data from the Kristalbad constructed wetland in the Netherlands. We developed a best-fit band ratio empirical algorithm to generate a distribution map of Chl-a concentration (C-chla) from SPOT 6 imagery. The C-chla retrieved from remote sensing was compared with a water quality model established for a wetland pond system. The retrieved satellite results were combined with a water quality model to simulate and predict the changes in phytoplankton levels. The regression model provides good retrievals for Chl-a. The imagery-derived C-chla performed well in calibrating the simulation results. For each pond, the modeled C-chla showed a range of values similar to the Chl-a data derived from SPOT 6 imagery (10-25 mg m(-3)). The imagery-derived and prediction model results could be used as the guiding analytical tools to provide information covering an entire study area and to inform policies.},

Abstract = {Water is the resource and determinant factor that determines the performance of the agricultural sector, although the role is very strategic, the water management is still far from expected so that the water that should be a farmer's turn turned into a cause of disaster for farmers. Small farm reservoir is built to accommodate excess rainwater during the rainy season. The water collected is then used as a source of supplementary irrigation for the cultivation of high-value economic commodities in the dry season. This research aims to survey, inventory, and study the potential of small farm reservoir development, and to plan potential site locations to be developed into small farm reservoir based on the results of analysis of physical and socio-economic data and drought potential using advanced remote sensing technology in Jombang Regency. Research planning of small farm reservoir location in Jombang Regency is designed in four stages of activity that is data gathering, mapping, and compilation of database, analysis, planning of location, and recommendation of the small farm reservoir location. The results of this research state that the appropriate area built small farm reservoir based on the parameters used are Ngoro, Mojoagung, Kesamben, and Kabuh village.},

Abstract = {Urban estuaries are dynamic environments that hold high ecological and economic value. Yet, their optical complexity hinders accurate satellite retrievals of important biogeochemical variables, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) biomass. Approaches based on a limited number of satellite spectral bands often fail to capture seasonal transitions and sharp spatial gradients in estuarine Chl-a concentrations, inhibiting integration of satellite data into water quality monitoring and conservation programs. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the wide range of spectral information captured by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) to retrieve estuarine Chl-a. To validate our approach, we used measurements in Long Island Sound (LIS), a highly urbanized estuary increasingly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors and climate change. Hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and Chl-a data representing the spatiotemporal diversity of LIS were used to assess the ideal atmospheric correction approach for OLCI and develop a multi-spectral multiple linear regression (MS-MLR) Chl-a algorithm. POLYMER derived Rrs proved to be the preferred atmospheric correction approach. Evaluation of MS-MLR performance in retrieving Chl-a with in situ Rrs showed good agreement with field measurements. Application to OLCI-retrieved Rrs showed significant improvement (20\%-30\%) in common error metrics relative to other algorithms assessed. The MS-MLR approach successfully captured seasonal cycles and spatial gradients in Chl-a concentration. Application of this method to urban estuaries and coasts enables accurate, high resolution Chl-a observations at the ecosystem scale and across a range of conditions, as needed for conservation and ecosystem management efforts.},

Abstract = {This work is being developed in the context of the multidisciplinary Project Tinto-Odiel River Ocean Study (TOROS), funded by the Environment \& Climate Programme of the EU, dealing with the analysis of environmental variables. This information is being obtained by the biogeochemical study of the Tinto-Odiel river-estuary system. Within the overall project, the University of Granada is carrying out the tasks related to data management, including the design and creation of a Geographic Information System (GIS), and the application of remote sensing techniques for the regional analysis of relevant water quality parameters. Data management involves the creation of a relational data base to manage all the collected information and to establish the base on which the GIS will be constructed. One aspect of interest is related to the application of geostatistical methodology to analyze the spatial distribution of the experimental data. Kriging techniques have been applied to the estimation of undersampled location in order to cover the whole study area. This preliminary step has been taken to include field data in the GIS as grid thematic layers. Taking into account the fact that partners need to access the information, we have developed a data exchange remote node by designing different web pages and common gateway interfaces (CGI) which allow the database to be queried by filling out a form. The regional scale makes the implementation of remote sensing techniques useful for the study. Specifically, a set of Landsat TM images has been processed to characterize the homogeneity, turbidity and suspended sediments of the river-estuary system. The results obtained in image processing have been included in the GIS as thematic layers.},

Abstract = {The reliable quantification of daily evapotranspiration (ET) over vast croplands is a quest in many scholarly works aimed at the precise practice of water resources management. Remote sensing-based empirical and nonempirical models were developed to overcome large-scale quantification issues, which are usually experienced when using conventional approaches for the estimation of ET. The surface energy balance system (SEBS) model was used to quantify the daily ET in the arid/semiarid over Wadi Ad-Dwaser, Saudi. SEBS input variables are parametrically sensitive and climatic dependent, and the model input/output dependencies are of high comprehensibility; therefore, the optimization analysis of SEBS input/ output parameters is the target of the current research. SEBS inputs reciprocal inconsistencies were determined using the artificial neural network analysis, while the output dependencies on the daily ET estimation were mapped. Results demonstrated that the temperature and relative humidity are the most sensitive parameters to be considered in the routine crop monitoring procedure. SEBS output thematic maps showed the robust proportional correlation between the daily ET and the conducted temperature map. Moreover, the estimated daily ET was inversely correlated with the estimated cold sensible heat fluxes. The findings suggest systematic monitoring and forecasting procedures for efficient water-saving management plans in Saudi Arabia.},

Title = {Spectral Feature Selection Optimization for Water Quality Estimation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity and nonlinearity exhibited by bio-optical relationships in turbid inland waters complicate the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration from multispectral satellite images. Most studies achieved satisfactory Chl-a estimation and focused solely on the spectral regions from near-infrared (NIR) to red spectral bands. However, the optical complexity of turbid waters may vary with locations and seasons, which renders the selection of spectral bands challenging. Accordingly, this study proposes an optimization process utilizing available spectral models to achieve optimal Chl-a retrieval. The method begins with the generation of a set of feature candidates, followed by candidate selection and optimization. Each candidate links to a Chl-a estimation model, including two-band, three-band, and normalized different chlorophyll index models. Moreover, a set of selected candidates using available spectral bands implies an optimal composition of estimation models, which results in an optimal Chl-a estimation. Remote sensing images and in situ Chl-a measurements in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to evaluate the proposed method. Results indicate that the model outperforms related Chl-a estimation models. The root-mean-squared errors of the Chl-a concentration obtained by the resulting model (OptiM-3) improve from 11.95 mgm-3to 6.37 mgm-3, and the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the predicted and in situ Chl-aimprove from 0.56 to 0.89.},

Abstract = {For the southern branch of the Rhine-Meuse estuary, The Netherlands, a two-dimensional horizontal suspended sediment transport model was constructed in order to evaluate the complicated water quality management of the area. The data needed to calibrate the model were collected during a special field survey at high river runoff utilizing a number of techniques: (1) turbidity probes were used to obtain suspended sediment concentration profiles; (2) air-borne remote sensing video recordings were applied in order to obtain information concerning the spatial distribution of the suspended sediment concentration; (3) an acoustic probe (ISAC) was used to measure cohesive bed density profiles and (4) an in situ underwater video camera (VIS) was deployed to collect video recordings of the suspended sediment. These VIS data were finally processed to fall velocity and diameter distributions and were mainly used to improve insight into the relevant transport processes, indicating significant erosion of sand from the upstream Rhine branch. For quantitative calibration of the model, the data from the turbidity profiles were used. Sedimentation and erosion were modelled according to Krone and Partheniades. The model results showed a good overall fit to the measurements, with a mean absolute error of 18 per cent (standard fault = 1 per cent), corresponding to concentrations of about 0.020 (upstream) to 0.005 kg m(-3) (downstream). The overall correlation between observed and simulated suspended sediment concentrations was 0.85. The remote sensing video recordings were used for a qualitative calibration of the model. The distribution pattern of the suspended sediment on these photos was reproduced quite well by the model. However, a more accurate calibration technique is needed to enable the use of aerial remote sensing as a quantitative calibration method. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {There are over 300 lakes interconnected by riverbranches and man-made canals in the Danube Delta (Romania). A multidisciplinary survey of these riverine lakes situated in large Wetland complexes was made comprising hydrological modelling, remote sensing and monitoring of water quality, plankton, aquatic vegetation and fish communities. Between-lake differences in water quality and aquatic vegetation cover were inferred from satellite image. Based on channel and lake dimensions, hydrological characteristics of the lakes in the delta were determined: hydrological distance from a riverbranch, residence time and impact of reed water. Water-quality and biotic parameters (phyto- and zooplankton, submerged plants and fish) were sampled in a comparative survey in June 1997-1999 in subsets of the lakes. In a follow-up study in 2001-2002, seasonality of aquatic vegetation and fish were recorded. A clear distinction was found in three lake types: (1) inflow lakes at short distance to the river, with a high flushing rate, high load of suspended minerals but low chlorophyll concentrations, high cover of floating and submerged vegetation and dominance of eurytopic fish; (2) large, relatively deep lakes with moderately long residence time, high Potamogeton-cover that collapses during summer, and dominated by eurytopic fish; (3) smaller, isolated lakes at the longest distance from the river, with long residence time, of which the water quality is strongly influenced by water flows through large floating reedbeds ('blackwater'), with a high vegetation cover of Ceratophyllum demersum and Nitellopsis obtusa throughout the summer and a limnophilic fish community tolerant for low oxygen conditions. Aquatic vegetation showed a clear seasonality related to the interaction between plant development and light conditions. Seasonal changes in fish distribution within the system merely followed the vegetation trends in different lakes and the conditions in the river channels. Past trends in the trophic gradient are discussed in the context of hydromorphological modifications in the Delta. There is a high potential for restoring natural processes owing to the high connectivity and large scale of the system. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Combining remote sensing-simulation modeling and genetic algorithm optimization to explore water management options in irrigated agriculture},

Abstract = {We present an innovative approach to explore water management options in irrigated agriculture considering the constraints of water availability and the heterogeneity of irrigation system properties. The method is two-folds: (i) system characterization using a stochastic data assimilation procedure where the irrigation system properties and operational management practices are estimated using remote sensing (RS) data; and (ii) water management optimization where we explored water management options under various levels of water availability. We set up a soil-water-atmosphere-plant model (SWAP) in a deterministic-stochastic mode for regional modeling. The distributed data, e.g. sowing dates, irrigation practices, soil properties, depth to groundwater and water quality, required as inputs for the regional modeling were estimated by minimizing the residuals between the distributions of field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) simulated by the regional application of SWAP, and by surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) using two Landsat7 ETM+ images. The derived distributed data were used as inputs in exploring water management options. Genetic algorithm was used in data assimilation and water management optimizations. The case study was conducted in Bata minor (lateral canal), Kaithal, Haryana, India during 2000-2001 rabi (dry) season. Our results showed that under limited water condition, regional wheat yield could improve further if water and crop management practices are considered simultaneously and not independently. Adjusting sowing dates and their distribution in the irrigated area could improve the regional yield, which also complements the practice of deficit irrigation when water availability is largely a constraint. This result was also found in agreement with the scenario that water is non-limited with the exception that the farmers have more degrees of freedom in their agricultural activities.

Abstract = {Airborne videographic remote sensing is less than a decade old. Its recent growth at the USDA-ARS at Weslaco, Texas and selected universities is evidence of a plethora of research and applications in this field. Video imagery, when interpreted by visual or computer techniques, has provided insights into a variety of Earth features. Much research has been done on detecting and assessing variables relating to cropland, rangeland, tree crops, and soils. In addition, videographic research and its applications have been conducted in forestry, water quality, wetlands, land-cover inventory, and urban land use. The poorer resolution of video compared with film has limited some applications, but the numerous advantages of videography have promoted its increasing use. In the future, advances in video technology will result in improved spatial resolution suitable for expanded applications.},

Abstract = {Impervious surface area (ISA) has recently emerged as an important ecological indicator of cumulative water resource impacts to urban watersheds. An ISA study was conducted in Cache County, Utah, to examine the potential of ISA as an indicator of water resource impacts in the region. Two LANDSAT 7 images from the spring of 2000 and, the summer of 2002 were analysed to compute ISA. Water chemistry and discharge data were collected from canals during five stormwater runoff events. Variables measured included dissolved metals, nutrients, sediment, oil and grease, fecal coliforms, and field parameters (e.g., water temperature). Percent ISA and loading coefficients were calculated for each of the contributing basins for a total of eight sampling locations. Results of linear regressions correlating mean site concentrations and percentage ISA were positive and strong (p<0.03) for total phosphorus (R-2=0.86), total nitrogen (R-2=0.94), orthophosphate (R2=0.94), total suspended solids (R-2=0.67), boron (R-2=0.82), copper (R-2=0.98), lead (R-2=0.96), zinc (R-2=0.97), and turbidity (R-2=0.67). Mean site loading coefficients were similarly correlated. Additionally, potential water quality impacts were evaluated by comparing mean site concentrations and percentage ISA with Utah and European water quality standards or pollution indicators. Those that exceeded the Utah standards or pollutant indicator values were total phosphorus, total suspended solids, lead, aluminium, and fecal coliform. Concentrations above the European standards were aluminium and iron. The Cache County study indicates that ISA is an applicable parameter as an indicator for cumulative water resource impacts and, further, suggests its application as an additional resource tool for the assessment and subsequent planning for water resource protection in urban developments.},

Title = {Implementation of a Satellite Based Inland Water Algal Bloom Alerting System Using Analysis Ready Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Water managers need tools to assist in the management of ever increasing algal bloom problems over wide spatial areas to complement sparse and declining in situ monitoring networks. Optical methods employing satellite data offer rapid and widespread coverage for early detection of bloom events. The advent of the Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Open Data Cube concepts offer the means to lower the technical challenges confronting managers, allowing them to adopt satellite tools. Exploiting Landsat ARD integrated into the Digital Earth Australia data cube, we developed a prototype algal bloom alerting tool for the state of New South Wales, Australia. A visualization portal allows managers to gain insights into bloom status across the state as a whole and to further investigate spatial patterns in bloom alerts at an individual water body basis. To complement this we also proposed an algal alert system for trial based on chlorophyll and TSM levels which requires further testing. The system was able to retrieve the status of 444 water bodies across the state and outputs from the visualization system are presented. Time series of image acquisitions during an intense bloom in one lake are used to demonstrate the potential of the system. We discuss the implications for further development and operationalisation including the potential for augmentation with alternative algorithms and incorporation of other sensor ARD data to improve both temporal and spectral resolutions.},

Abstract = {Precision agriculture, a holistic approach to micro-manage agricultural landscapes based on information, knowledge, and new technologies, will accelerate the application of remote sensing techniques to agricultural management. In recent years there has been a wealth of new research developments, particularly based on ground platforms, but also on airborne and spatial platforms. The paper provides a summary of applications by platform. Presently, utilizations by producers are still rare but, in the past few years, several new programs have been offered for nutrient management, particularly nitrogen, crop status monitoring, and irrigation management. There are specific and unique technical and managerial barriers and requirements for the application of remote sensing to soil and crop management. The four principal requirements relate to: spatial resolution, timeliness, coverage frequency, and imagery management infrastructure. Through precision agriculture, specialists trained in imagery analysis, efficient infrastructure for the transfer and management of imagery, better sensor systems, all needed to successfully use remote sensing for agricultural management, will become progressively available. Potential applications of remote sensing to precision agriculture include various aspects of soil monitoring, crop condition monitoring and management, and machinery performance evaluation. This will bring a more profitable and sustainable agriculture where optimal agricultural production is made while protecting environmental quality.},

Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Water quality deterioration due to outdoor loading of livestock manure requires efficient management of outside manure piles (OMPs). This study was designed to investigate OMPs using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for efficient management of non-point source pollution in agricultural areas. A UAV was used to acquire image data, and the distribution and cover installation status of OMPs were identified through ortho-images; the volumes of OMP were calculated using digital surface model (DSM). UAV- and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)-derived DSMs were compared for identifying the accuracy of calculated volumes. The average volume accuracy was 92.45\%. From April to October, excluding July, the monthly average volumes of OMPs in the study site ranged from 64.89 m(3) to 149.69 m(3). Among the 28 OMPs investigated, 18 were located near streams or agricultural waterways. Establishing priority management areas among the OMP sites distributed in a basin is possible using spatial analysis, and it is expected that the application of UAV technology will contribute to the efficient management of OMPs and other non-point source pollutants.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Groundwater resources are largely used in rural communities of river basins due to their acceptable water quality and reliability for domestic purposes where little or no treatment is required. However, groundwater resources have been affected by changes in land use, mining activities, agricultural practices, industrial effluent, and urbanisation among anthropogenic influences while climate change impacts and volcanic eruptions have affected its involvement among the natural phenomena. The purpose of the study was to assess groundwater potential in the basin with the use of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), remote sensing, GIS techniques, and groundwater occurrence and movement influencing factors. These factors were used to produce seven thematic maps, which were then assigned weights and scale using an AHP tool, based on their degree of influence on groundwater occurrence and movement. A weighted groundwater potential map was produced with four zones denoted as 0.4\% (317 km(2)) for very good potential; 27\% (19,170 km(2)) for good potential; 61\% (43,961 km(2)) for moderate potential and 12\% (8639 km(2)) for poor potential. Validation, using existing boreholes, showed that 89\% were overlain on moderate to very good potential zones and henceforth considered to be a novel approach which is useful for groundwater resources assessment and integrated water management in the basin.},

Abstract = {The ability to monitor and control plant nutrient ions in fertigation solutions, on an ion-specific basis, is critical to the future of controlled environment agriculture crop production, be it in traditional terrestrial settings (e. g., greenhouse crop production) or as a component of bioregenerative life support systems for long duration space exploration. Several technologies are currently available that can provide the required measurement of ion-specific activities in solution. The greenhouse sector has invested in research examining the potential of a number of these technologies to meet the industry's demanding requirements, and although no ideal solution yet exists for on-line measurement, growers do utilize technologies such as high-performance liquid chromatography to provide off-line measurements. An analogous situation exists on the International Space Station where, technological solutions are sought, but currently on-orbit water quality monitoring is considerably restricted. This paper examines the specific advantages that on-line ion-selective sensors could provide to plant production systems both terrestrially and when utilized in space-based biological life support systems and how similar technologies could be applied to nominal on-orbit water quality monitoring. A historical development and technical review of the various ion-selective monitoring technologies is provided.},

Abstract = {The valley of Kashmir is blessed with abundant water resources. However, high population growth and concentration of population at favorable locations have resulted in increased demand for water. The problem is further aggravated in Lidder catchment where unplanned tourism development has resulted in deterioration of water quality. Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) approach is adopted using IRS P6 LISS III satellite data 2010, geological map published by Geological Survey of India, toposheets prepared by Survey of India, 1961 and field observation. Seven thematic layers (slope, lineament density, drainage density, soil, geology, geomorphology and land use land cover) are generated in GIS environment and weighted according to their relative relevance to groundwater occurrence. Knowledge-based weights and ranks are normalized, and a weighted linear combination technique is adopted to determine the groundwater potential (GWP). The catchment is divided into five zones of very high, high, medium, low and very low GWP. The results show that 50.22\% of the total catchment area, which is uninhabited, has very low GWP. However, the densely populated southern part of the catchment has moderate to very high GWP. The study demonstrates that MCE using remote sensing and GIS technology could be efficiently employed as a very useful tool for the assessment and management of groundwater resources especially in regions where data is poor.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {Global warming together with environmental pollution threatens marine habitats and causes an increasing number of environmental disasters. Periodic monitoring of coastal water quality is of critical importance for the effective management of water resources and the sustainability of marine ecosystems. The use of remote sensing technologies provides significant benefits for detecting, monitoring, and analyzing rapidly occurring and displaced natural phenomena, including mucilage events. In this study, five water indices estimated from cloud-free and partly cloudy Sentinel-2 images acquired from May to July 2021 were employed to effectively map mucilage aggregates on the sea surface in the Izmit Bay using the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Results showed that mucilage aggregates started with the coverage of about 6 km(2) sea surface on 14 May, reached the highest level on 24 May and diminished at the end of July. Among the applied indices, the Adjusted Floating Algae Index (AFAI) was superior for producing the mucilage maps even for the partly cloudy image, followed by Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) and Mucilage Index (MI). To be more specific, indices using green channel were found to be inferior for extracting mucilage information from the satellite images.},

Abstract = {IRS-1A and 1B data have been found to be useful in providing information on the extent and condition of coastal habitats, coastal processes and water quality of coastal waters, These inputs formed major elements for preparing coastal zone management plans, IRS-1C data having improved spatial resolution (5.6 m PAN data), extended spectral range (inclusion of middle infra-red band in LISS-III) and increased repetitivity (5 days for WiFS data) have opened up new vistas of applications in the coastal zone, Preliminary analysis of IRS-1C data indicates that coral reef zonation, identification of tree and shrub mangroves, seaweed/sea grass beds, improved delineation of coastal features such as fringe mangroves, mudflats, beach, dune vegetation, saline areas, etc, as well as better understanding of suspended sediment patterns are now possible. These additional information will certainly form vital remote-sensing-based input for preparing coastal zone management plans.},

Abstract = {A wide range of satellite sensors that provide potentially useful imagery for digital documentation, mapping and monitoring of archaeological sites and cultural landscapes. Although some satellites have stopped acquiring new data, their archived satellite imagery can still be accessed, downloaded and exploited for monitoring of changes and therefore useful for research domain of archaeology and cultural landscapes. The aim of this paper is 1) to make an overview of past and current satellite earth observation optical sensors useful for land monitoring, with focus on cultural landscapes and 2) to illustrate a policy framework that goes beyond recommendations, suggesting the need of valuable information possibly provided by the in satellite imagery. Paper will put focus on Copernicus programme as the most recent mission that provides imagery on the global scale and free of charge. Paper, furthermore, highlights the need for a more structured consideration of the contribution that space technologies services and products can offer to the non-space sectors. The actions for implementation of strategies regarding the currently renewed attention towards cultural heritage protection and management, could soon benefit from the technological achievements of satellite technologies in terms of dedicated operational services and applications, tailored to the needs of end-users such as archaeologists, landscape professionals, public administration, researchers and students.},

Title = {Nutrient estimation by HJ-1 satellite imagery of Xiangxi Bay, Three Gorges Reservoir, China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Since its impoundment in 2003, the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has brought far-reaching economic and other benefits to China. However, the resulting negative ecological and environmental impacts such as eutrophication and algal bloom have been problematic. This paper describes a study on nutrient estimation concerning eutrophication and algal bloom based on Huan Jing-1 (HJ-1) satellite imagery of the Xiangxi Bay (XXB), a tributary of the TGR in China. Models of nutrient concentration were established by correlation analysis between field measurement of nutrient concentration and the values obtained from the simultaneous satellite images of the study area. The results showed that total nitrogen (TN) had the best correlation with B1/(B3 + B4), with a maximal Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.885. Both nitrate (NO3--N) and dissolved silicon (D-Si) had the best correlation with B1/(B2 + B4), with the maximal Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.818 and 0.756, respectively. All band combinations had little correlation with NH4+-N, TP, and PO43--P. The single variable quadratic models were established for predicting the concentration of TN and D-Si, while, a single variable cubic model was for the concentration of NH4+-N. Robustness analysis and validation were undertaken for the feasibility of the models, which showed that the predicted models were acceptable. Through the models, the levels of TN and NO3--N were predicted on Jan 12, May 2, July 30 and Oct 8, 2010. The results showed that the water in the XXB was eutrophic mostly. The nitrogen level was higher on Jan 12 than that of May 2, July 30 and Oct 8. Compared with the upstream, the downstream of the XXB had higher nitrogen level on Jan 12 and May 2, whereas, on July 30, it was higher for the upstream. The nitrogen level was lowest on Oct 8, with the uniform distribution in the upstream and downstream of the XXB. The predicted results coincided with the field observation. The results will help to estimate the eutrophication and algal bloom through large-scale remote sensing monitoring and water quality management in the TGR.},

Abstract = {Forel-Ule Index (FUI) is an index which classifies the colors of inland and seawater exist in nature into 21 grades ranging from indigo blue to cola brown. FUI has been analyzed in connection with the eutrophication, water quality, and light characteristics of water systems in many studies, and the possibility as a new water quality index which simultaneously contains optical information of water quality parameters has been suggested. In this study, Ocean Colour-Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) based 4 km FUI was spatially downscaled to the resolution of 500 m using the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and Random Forest (RF) machine learning. Then, the RF-derived FUI was examined in terms of its correlation with various water quality parameters measured in coastal areas and its spatial distribution and seasonal characteristics. The results showed that the RF-derived FUI resulted in higher accuracy (Coefficient of Determination (R-2) =0.81, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) =0.7784) than GOCI-derived FUI estimated by Pitarch's OC-CCI FUI algorithm (R-2=0.72, RMSE=0.9708). RF-derived FUI showed a high correlation with five water quality parameters including Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Chlorophyll-a, Total Suspended Solids, Transparency with the correlation coefficients of 0.87, 0.88, 0.97, 0.65, and-0.98, respectively. The temporal pattern of the RF-derived FUI well reflected the physical relationship with various water quality parameters with a strong seasonality. The research findings suggested the potential of the high resolution FUI in coastal water quality management in the Korean Peninsula.},

Abstract = {City is the important area of earth's surface material, energy, and information exchanging; also it is the centre of national, regional political, economic, scientific and cultural aspects. A mere 10\% of the global population were urban dwellers in 1900, but that percentage exceeds 50\% now (Grimm et al. 2008). With the rapid economic development, city is suffering from a series of serious problems such as air pollution, solid waste pollution, vegetation reduction, deterioration of water quality and living environment. Threats to our environment represent a clear danger in the context of climate change, which is part of the ``Global Change{''}, and it is obvious that action is needed right now to protect our quality of life, particularly for those most vulnerable to health threats from environmental and technological disasters. Therefore, our top priority should be to avoid human and material losses. The security area is not only defined by disaster management, but by a wide variety of events that could affect the environment and the population's health. Following the rapid development of urban areas, a present tendency is represented by the study of those factors that place some areas in categories with high risk for natural and anthropic hazard.},

Abstract = {Wetlands play a significant role in maintaining environmental stability. These have a complex of values like food storage, water quality maintenance, livelihood and support species diversity, etc. Wetlands inventory is the pre-requisite process for conservation and management practices. The study makes an attempt to delineate wetlands and prepare inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation in Lower Barpani sub-watersheds (Assam), India. The study utilized Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data during pre-and post-monsoon seasons, 2014. Wetlands during pre-and post-monsoon were delineated using supervised classification and threshold method. Wetland inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation was prepared during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. Single-band turbidity retrieval algorithm and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to assess the level of turbidity and aquatic vegetation in GIS environment. The study revealed that the variation in the extent of water logged wetlands in sub-watersheds was due to water spread variation during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. All the sub-watersheds were characterized by medium turbidity which was attributed to sediments and silts brought with runoff in wetlands. Aquatic vegetation showed variation in its distribution across subwatersheds. High vegetation indicated high turbidity and presence of nutrients. The study shows usefulness of remote sensing data in mapping and characterization of wetlands for preparing inventory and monitoring seasonal variation.

Abstract = {The present study identifies and quantifies appropriate sites for aquaculture development in the mid/high Himalayan region of Uttarakhand using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS). The GIS has an increasingly important role in management and utilisation of natural resources, particularly in fisheries resource assessment and management. Aquaculture has become one of the fastest growing food industries in the world. For aquaculture development in the region, the importance of each parameter of soil quality, water quality and infrastructure facilities were accessed using analytical hierarchical process. Various thematic layers were prepared for categorising suitable aquaculture sites based on three sub-models viz., soil quality, water quality and infrastructure facilities. The site suitability map for aquaculture development was prepared for Betalghat Block. of Nainital District, Uttarakhand. The total area suitable for aquaculture development was computed as most suitable (8426 ha forming 27\%); moderately suitable (5623 ha forming 18\%) and not suitable (198 ha forming 1\%) with constraints of forest cover and infrastructure facilities of around 16617 ha (54\%) of the total land area.},

Abstract = {Considering the importance of rainfed agriculture in adaptation to nature and long-term sustainability in human food supply and livelihood of farmers, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of rainfed agriculture in the Zarrinehroud basin as this basin is one of the most important sub-basins of Lake Urmia. For this study, the remote sensing data of surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration were combined with the SWAT model using the Data Assimilation method, Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Calibration of runoff flow rate in SWAT model showed the correlation coefficient ranging between 0.69 and 0.84 in the calibration period (2000-2009) and between 0.64 and 0.86 for the validation period (2010-2014). The assimilation of the remote sensing data with the calibrated SWAT model showed that the model simulations for both the variables of surface soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration improved by at least 25\% in both 2010 and 2014. It has been determined that 10.5 and 25.4\% of the region's lands have a Very Appropriate and Appropriate potential for rainfed wheat agriculture, respectively. Areas with Moderate and Inappropriate potential occupy 64.1\% of the lands in the region.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how GEOSS and CEOS are individually and collaboratively strengthening the world's ability to manage the disasters lifecycle. The Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) of GEOSS has, through an agile development process, deployed and tested advanced information systems for Earth Observations based on interoperability arrangements. In particular AIP has focused on several Disaster Management Scenarios resulting in an architecture that has improved the ready viability and usability of data for disasters. CEOS is constructing a reference architecture, intended to streamline access to satellite data and services for disaster management. The CEOS approach aims to support disaster management activities with satellite information in a holistic fashion, taking account of their overlaps and interdependencies. Jointly GEOSS and CEOS are now working to align the approaches for Disaster Management to describe enterprise components and improve understanding of contributed systems and their roles. The coordination will lead to refinements of the Disaster Management Scenario via further implementation in AIP-5. By collaborating via the CEOS working groups and GEOSS communities of practice, these efforts are intended to engage the international community focused on disaster management to fully utilize remote sensing resources for societal benefit.},

Abstract = {The Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, was introduced into the modern Yellow River Delta in 1989 to protect banks and beaches within the intertidal zone. By 2018, its distribution area had expanded to 4005.89 ha, which was 2557 times its initial colonization area. The distribution of S. alterniflora in the modern Yellow River Delta at given times and its ecological and biological effects have been studied previously; however, its invasion rate and characteristics, which affect its comprehensive management, are not known. Using multi-resolution and multi platform remote sensing time series data from 1989 to 2018, combined with years of field data, the invasion of S. alterniflora within the modern Yellow River Delta was studied. These data show that S. alterniflora began to expand rapidly in 2011, after a 22-y incubation period within the modern Yellow River Delta. Its expansion mainly occurred via seed reproduction. In addition, S. alterniflora preferentially invaded intertidal deltaic areas, using local seagrass beds as colonization sites. There was a significant correlation between the increase in area of S. alterniflora and the decrease in pollutant concentration of the Yellow River. Clearly, the improvement in water quality of the Yellow River accelerated the invasion of S. alterniflora within the delta.},

Consequently, it is necessary to assess and reflect upon the challenges ahead for water infrastructure and the general public in metropolitan regions. One approach to the problem is to use index-based assessment, forecasting and planning. The drought indices previously developed were not developed for domestic water supplies, and thus are insufficient for the purpose of such an assessment. This paper aims to propose and develop a ``Metropolitan Water Availability Index (MWAI){''} to assess the status of both the quantity and quality of available potable water sources diverted from the hydrologic cycle in a metropolitan region. In this approach, the accessible water may be expressed as volume per month or week (i.e., m(3)/month or m(3)/week) relative to a prescribed historical record, and such a trend analysis may result in final MWAI values ranging from 1 to +1 for regional water management decision making. The MWAI computation uses data and information from both historical point measurements and spatial remote-sensing based monitoring. Variables such as precipitation, river discharge, and water quality changes at drinking water plant intakes at specific locations are past ``point{''} measurements in MWAI calculations. On the other hand, remote sensing provides information on both spatial and temporal distributions of key variables. Examples of remote-sensing images and sensor network technologies are in-situ sensor networks, ground-based radar, air-borne aircraft, and even space-borne satellites. A case study in Tampa Bay, Florida is described to demonstrate the short-term assessment of the MWAI concept at a practical level. It is anticipated that such a forecasting methodology may be extended for middle-term and long-term water supply assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Existing guidelines for salinity and sodicity, as well as related management recommendations, were developed for generalized use, without consideration of the specific soil, chemical, physical, climatic and plant conditions at each location. Recent advances in instrumentation, increased understanding of the physical and chemical processes, and development of sophisticated computer simulation programs now allow us to develop more site specific management recommendations. New instrumentation technology exists for rapid remote sensing of salinity and representation of the spatial distribution. This information can be utilized to diagnose the cause of the salinity problem and devise a water efficient reclamation strategy. Simulation models can be used as tools to evaluate the extent to which the soil chemical or physical properties need to be modified, taking into consideration the available drainage, evapotranspiration requirements, water quality and quantity, crop salt tolerance and acceptable relative yield. Applications to management problems include evaluation of when to use supplemental saline water for irrigation during late crop stage if fresh water is not available and as well as evaluation of plant response to ion balances and osmotic pressure. Other examples include sodic soil management options where, rather than specify a fixed exchangeable sodium percentage, the user can allow for tradeoff of water quantity, amendment type and mode of application, green manuring etc., taking into consideration the different time requirements for different soil types and different reclamation practices.},

Title = {Estimation of Suspended Sediment Concentration from Remote Sensing and In Situ Measurement over Lake Tana, Ethiopia},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Discharge from basins joining a lake is the main factor determining the lake volume and sediment inflow to the lake. Suspended sediment is an important parameter for describing the water quality of aquatic ecosystems. Lake Tana is an important and the largest lake in Ethiopia for the local ecological system. However, environmental change and anthropogenic activities in the area threaten its water quality. The conventional methods of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) observation are unable to determine and compare spatial and temporal SSC patterns for the lake over a period of years. Remote sensing methods have made it possible to map SSC. The objective of this study is to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of suspended sediment of Lake Tana using in situ measurement and remote sensing applications and specifically to develop a relationship between in situ and remote sensing observation to retrieve suspended sediment concentration and map the spatal distribution of SSC. This study used MODIS-Terra and in situ data to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of SSC in the rainy season. Four sampling campaigns (20 samples per campaign) were carried out on Lake Tana, and the first three sampled campaigns on May 11-13, 2018, June 08-10, 2018, and July 15-17, 2018, were used for calibration of regression models. MODIS-Terra reflectance in NIR was found best related to in situ water quality data and varies linearly with SSC (r(2) = 0.81) and turbidity (r(2) = 0.85). Secchi disc depth (SDD) found the best fit for a power relation with NIR band reflectance (r(2) = 0.74). The MODIS-Terra reflectance in red was found to be poorly related to in situ measurements. The relation in NIR reflectance was validated using the LOOCV (leave-one-out-cross-validation) technique and the fourth sampled data set collected on August 12-14, 2018. Developed models are validated with RMSE of 42.96 mg/l, 14.6 NTU, and 0.17 m, ARE of 23.3\%, 27.6\%, and 12.4\%, and RRMSE of 25.1\%, 44.5\%, and 29.6\% for SSC, turbidity, and SDD, respectively, using LOOCV. The equation was also validated using August 2018 collected data sets with RMSE of 87.6 mg/l, 11.7 NTU, 0.08 m, ARE of 20.8\%, 25.9\%, and 28.8\%, and RRMSE of 17.8\%, 20.5\%, and 27.9\% for SSC, turbidity, and SDD, respectively. Applying the developed regression model, a 10-year time series of SSC from 2008-2017 for May-August was estimated and the trend was tested using the Mann-Kendall trend test. It was found that an increasing trend was observed from the period 2008 to 2017. The result shows that satellite data like the MODIS-Terra imagery could be used to monitor and obtain past records of SSC with the developed equation. The increasing SSC can be reduced by implementing selected management practices in the surrounding watersheds of the lake to reduce nutrient and sediment inflow.},

Abstract = {The Romanian North Western coastal zone of the Black Sea and Danube delta is a mosaic of complex interacting ecosystems rich natural resources and socio-economic activity, for which the comprehensive knowledge of the physical and biogeochemical processes in the near-shore area represents an important aspect of integrated zone management. Dramatic changes in the Black Sea's ecosystem and resources were registered due to natural and anthropogenic causes (increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). Remote sensing provides a means for locating, identifying and mapping certain coastal features and assessing of spatio-temporal changes and their environmental impact. A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields water quality, climatic change effects. A multispectral and multitemporal data set (LANDSAT MSS, TM, ETM; SAR ERS-1; MODIS, ASTER) images over some selected areas in the vicinity of the Danube mouths and North-Western coastal zone of Black Sea. The main aim of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive analysis based on existing historical and more recent in situ and remote sensing data to establish the link between phytoplankton bloom development increasing erosion and diminishing of beaches and related coastal zone harmful phenomena between 1975 and 2003 and also the sediment discharge and depositing regime in the delta near the Danube mouths and Black Sea.},

Abstract = {In order to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural changes in an ecosystem, the environmental parameters and the driving forces need to be monitored in different temporal and spatial scales. The limitation of conventional monitoring methods particularly with regard to temporal and spatial resolution is often a serious hindrance to a better understanding of marine ecosystems and the underlying biogeochemical processes. The use of unattended automatic observing systems onboard of ships of opportunity offers a cost-effective and reliable possibility to obtain regular observations of near-surface parameters with a high spatial coverage and temporal resolution. In the Southern North Sea the application of the so called Ferry Box systems has been proved since 2002. Ferry Boxes have been installed on different ferries and cargo ships as well. The system allows high frequent monitoring of oceanographic parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity) as well as biological relevant parameters such as chlorophyll, nutrients, oxygen and pH along a transect. In combination with remote sensed data the spatial limitation to a certain transect can be overcome. On the other hand the data from the Ferry Box can be used as ground truth data for the remote sensing data. Special events like strong short-term algae blooms, which will be detected only occasionally by standard monitoring methods, can be studied in detail and related to variations in influencing factors such as temperature, wind and nutrient load. Continuously measured high accurate oxygen data can be used to estimate productivity along the transect. However, due to its limitations (surface measurements, certain ship tracks only) only a combination of research ship cruises, buoy measurements at strategic locations, remote sensing and numerical modeling will give the deep insights needed for an understanding of the ecosystem as a prerequisite for future management options.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to predict drought changes in Dariun, Fars Province, and their impact on water and soil quality. To prepare drought, water, and soil quality zoning maps, Landsat satellite images and the kriging method were used. The fuzzy maps and weights for each parameter were then determined using fuzzy and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods. Additionally, cellular automata (CA)-Markov chains were used in order to predict the impact of drought changes on water and soil quality. Using the fuzzy-AHP method, water quality and soil fertility in 2020 were lower compared to previous years, mainly because of land use changes that increased pollution. Based on results of the Markov and CA-Markov chains, approximately 31\% of the region will have very poor levels of soil fertility and water quality in 2050. Further, based on remote sensing indicators, it is determined that about 25\% of the region will be at high risk of drought in 2050. Thus, if adequate management of the region is not done, the possibility of living in these areas may diminish in the coming years due to drought and deteriorated water and soil quality.},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems, including those with natural areas (e.g., reserves, refuges, parks) receive virtually all of the water flowing off the continental United States. As the human population increases, so do waste loads and use of the terrestrial surface. Changes in land use result in changes in land cover, which affect water quality and, subsequently, coastal and estuarine habitats, and their living resources. Lack of understanding of the cumulative effects of land cover and changes in land cover on these habitats and their resources has limited the appropriate management of landscape activities. Additionally, in the United States, as elsewhere, human population in the coastal region is increasing at an ever-quickening pace. Our ability to monitor resultant land cover and habitat change has not kept pace with the change, and management, thus, has been more reactive than proactive. Remote sensing is a key element of monitoring land cover changes over broad areas of the coastal zone in a synoptic, relatively inexpensive, and dependable way. Such information, when assimilated into a geographical information system and integrated with transport and process-oriented models, would allow us to relate land cover and changes in land cover(i.e., development in the coastal zone) to effects on living marine resources; it also would permit proactive responses to continuing degradation and loss of coastal and estuarine habitats and their living marine resources.},

Abstract = {A physically based algorithm is used for automatic processing of MERIS level 1B full resolution data. The algorithm is originally used with input variables for optimization with different sensors (i.e. channel recalibration and weighting), aquatic regions ( i.e. specific inherent optical properties) or atmospheric conditions ( i.e. aerosol models). For operational use, however, a lake-specific parameterization is required, representing an approximation of the spatio-temporal variation in atmospheric and hydro-optic conditions, and accounting for sensor properties. The algorithm performs atmospheric correction with a LUT for at-sensor radiance, and a downhill simplex inversion of chl-a, sm and y from subsurface irradiance reflectance. These outputs are enhanced by a selective filter, which makes use of the retrieval residuals. Regular chl-a sampling measurements by the Lake's protection authority coinciding with MERIS acquisitions were used for parameterization, training and validation.},

Title = {Evaluation of medium to low resolution satellite imagery for regional lake water quality assessments},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {47},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {This study evaluates currently available imagery from Landsat, MERIS, MODIS, and AWiFS sensors for their usefulness in regional-scale measurements of lake water clarity and chlorophyll for comprehensive lake management and scientific studies (e.g., modeling). Images from these systems were collected nearly concurrently and processed using methods similar to those developed previously for regional assessments of lake water clarity using Landsat imagery. We tested both atmospherically corrected and uncorrected imagery products; the uncorrected products performed as well as or better than the atmospherically corrected products in empirical relationships to estimate water clarity and chlorophyll. MODIS and MERIS systems, which have large swath widths and high temporal coverage are well suited for regional assessments of large lakes, but their low spatial resolution limits the number of lakes that can be assessed. Landsat imagery allows all lakes >= 4 ha (more than 12,000 in Minnesota) to be assessed, but its low spectral resolution limits assessments to water clarity. The MERIS system, with spectral and spatial resolution suitable for large (> 150 ha) lakes, was the only system with a spectral band set that measured key absorption and scattering characteristics of phytoplankton that could be used reliably for regional chlorophyll assessments. Although none of the currently available systems is ideal, the study yielded a better definition of the spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of the ideal system for regional-scale water quality remote sensing that may be realized in upcoming satellite systems.},

Pages = {125-137},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Invasions of water bodies by floating vegetation, including water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), are a huge global problem for fisheries, hydropower generation, and transportation. We analyzed floating plant coverage on 20 reservoirs across the world's tropics and subtropics, using > 30 year time-series of LANDSAT remote-sensing imagery. Despite decades of costly weed control, floating invasion severity is increasing. Floating plant coverage correlates with expanding urban land cover in catchments, implicating urban nutrient sources as plausible drivers. Floating vegetation invasions have undeniable societal costs, but also provide benefits. Water hyacinths efficiently absorb nutrients from eutrophic waters, mitigating nutrient pollution problems. When washed up on shores, plants may become compost, increasing soil fertility. The biomass is increasingly used as a renewable biofuel. We propose a more nuanced perspective on these invasions moving away from futile eradication attempts towards an ecosystem management strategy that minimizes negative impacts while integrating potential social and environmental benefits.},

Title = {Deforestation as a Cause of Increased Surface Runoff in the Catchment: Remote Sensing and SWAT Approach-A Case Study of Southern Serbia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In the past two decades, the South part of Serbia has been affected by exploitive and illegal logging. As this trend is not decreasing to this day, there is a need to determine the area where this logging occurred precisely. The consequences of these actions are tremendous, causing the forest owners' financial loss (regardless of whether it is private or state property) and a negative impact on the environment. Significant environmental and forest management problems deriving from these actions are erosion increase and more frequent torrential floods occurrence in the catchment. Since it is difficult to update the national forest inventories in remote areas, remote sensing techniques using different satellite imagery types can provide up-to-date data. The initial analysis that employed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (created using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery) indicates massive deforestation in the research area between 1999 and 2021. Headwaters of the Stavska river catchment is selected as the research area to determine the amount of erosion in two periods-before and after deforestation occurred. Change in land cover (LC) is presented with two LC maps created applying supervised classification to Landsat 7 imagery from 1999 as a pre-deforestation LC state and Landsat 8 imagery acquired in 2021 as the current LC state. The erosion in the catchment for both periods is determined using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis results show the erosion change incurred as a deforestation effect in the river catchment. With the data obtained by remote sensing and SWAT analysis, it is possible to track changes in the area and acquire essential data, making the right and fast decisions to protect the natural resources economy and make sustainable development possible in this impoverished region.},

Synoptic snapshots: monitoring lake water quality over 4 decades in an urbanizing region. Lake Reserv Manage. XX: XX-XXX. Synoptic water quality surveys-measuring major ions, nutrients, pH, organic matter, and trace elements-have been conducted in similar to 50 lakes in the Halifax Regional Municipality (Nova Scotia, Canada) once per decade since 1980. In this study, lake water quality over 40 yr was examined and urban development was evaluated as a possible driver of observed changes. More than half of the lakes experienced strong (>50\%) increases in conductivity, iron, sodium, chloride, calcium, and total phosphorus (TP), and strong decreases in acidity (i.e., {[}H+]). Between 20\% and 50\% of the lakes experienced strong increases in nitrate, alkalinity, zinc, color, aluminum, dissolved organic carbon, and magnesium, and strong decreases in manganese and sulfate. In 2021, national guidelines for the protection of aquatic life were exceeded by chloride, aluminum, manganese, and arsenic in certain lakes. Land cover classification from circa 1980 and 2020 revealed that although change in urban development within the lake watersheds ranged from a decrease of 11 percentage points to an increase of 48 percentage points, the majority (90\%) of watersheds experienced an increase. Urban development was associated with increased chloride, conductivity, sodium, calcium, and TP concentrations. Other parameters appear to be more influenced by hydrology, watershed characteristics, climate, and decreased acid deposition. Results highlight emerging water quality concerns, such as elevated aluminum concentrations, and increased concentrations of chloride, nutrients, and arsenic, which should be the focus of strategic monitoring and mitigation efforts.},

Abstract = {Monitoring and managing lake water quality are some of the most reminiscent of aquatic environmental challenges. Prediction of water quality parameters plays a major role in the enrichment of water resource management. This study creates and compares deep learning models such as ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system), LSTM (long short-term memory), and NAR neural networks in water quality prediction and proposes the most effective prediction model. Obtaining adequate water quality data with high precision to train and test deep learning models is sometimes challenging due to cost or technological constraints. A solution to this problem was established by developing the best band regression empirical water quality (BREWQ) model, which was used to extract seasonal water quality dataset (n = 490) from multi-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel 2A) for 2016-2021. The accuracy assessment parameters, such as coefficient of determination (R-2), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), is confined to illustrate the performance accuracy of the incorporated models. The results from this study inferred that the ANFIS model approach of Gbellmf linear, Gaussmff with the fuzzy set combination of {[}3 3 3 3] has the potential to predict magnesium-87.03\% (MSE:8.2436, RMSE:9.92, MAPE:4.50), potassium-94.34\% (MSE:6.24, RMSE: 8.06, MAPE: 31.55), sodium-96.19\% (MSE:5.82, RMSE:7.36, MAPE:4.82). Secchi Disc Depth (SDD)-99.87\% (MSE:3.72, RMSE:6.14, MAPE:16.03), temperature-96.2\% (MSE:2.19, RMSE:3.67, MAPE:45.33), total hardness-90.31\% (MSE:8.09, RMSE:10.13, MAPE: 8.91) and turbidity-60.52\% (MSE:6.24, RMSE: 8.08, and MAPE:1688.43) with the least error, whereas LSTM showed the lowest error in predicting parameters such as Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)- 96.76\% (MSE:8.78, RMSE:10.4502 \& MAPE:16.83), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS)-84.31\% (MSE:3.58, RMSE: 6.68, MAPE:35.69). On the other hand, it is revealed from this study that NARNET had less accuracy than LSTM and ANFIS in predicting water quality due to their simple network structure. In the ultramodern era, such deep-learning prediction models aid in continuously monitoring water bodies to prevent pollution.},

Abstract = {With the growing global demand for marine products, offshore aquaculture, which enables large-scale aquaculture compared to conventional coastal aquaculture, is drawing attention. In offshore aquaculture, the occurrence of red tide due to residual food can be suppressed by the circulation of ocean currents, and the environmental load can be reduced. On the other hand, since the farmed cage is located in a remote area, there are problems such as the cost of transporting food, the storage of a large amount of food, and the management of facilities in the event of a typhoon. In addition, it is especially important to manage the environmental information in the cage in order to understand the health condition of farmed fish in remote areas. If a device that measures water quality, which is one of the environmental information, is left in the sea for a long period of time, dirt such as algae will adhere and the measurement performance will deteriorate. This time, we developed an air pressure control system that allows the water quality sensor in the sea to enter the water only when measuring, and implemented it in the observation device. This observation device enables long-term observation of various water quality data.},

In this study, we developed and validated an empirical model for estimating the SDD based on Landsat ETM+ and OLI data using the combination of band ratio of the near-infrared (NIR) band to the blue band and the NIR band. Time series data of remotely estimated SDD in Lake Liangzi were retrieved from 2007 to 2016 using the proposed models based on forty Landsat images. The results of the Mann-Kendall test (p = 0.002) and linear regression (R-2 = 0.352, p < 0.001) indicated that the SDD in Lake Liangzi demonstrated a significant decreasing trend during the study period. The annual mean SDD in Lake Liangzi was significantly negatively correlated with the population (R 2 = 0.530, p = 0.017) and gross domestic product (R-2 = 0.619, p = 0.007) of the Lake Liangzi basin. In addition, water level increase and the flood have an important effect on SDD decrease. Our study revealed that anthropogenic activities may be driving factors for the long-term declining trend in the SDD. Additionally, floods and heavy precipitation may decrease the SDD over the short term in Lake Liangzi. A declining trend in the SDD in Lake Liangzi may continue under future intense anthropogenic activities and climate change such as the extreme heavy precipitation event increase.},

Abstract = {Several interrelated factors affect water quality in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES) including land use change in the upland and coastal watersheds, legislatively mandated basin-wide nutrient management plans, intense storms, and global and local changes in sea level. Despite its importance as an essential fish habitat, the APES has not been monitored as intensively or extensively for habitat impacts associated with decreased water quality as other estuaries have been, such as with the North Carolina tributary estuaries or Chesapeake Bay. To support the sustainable use of these estuaries, we are developing an automated water quality monitoring system aboard ferries that traverse the APES. This program, FerryMon, provides a unique, long-term, and cost-effective monitoring system to evaluate status and trends in APES water quality Intensive temporal and spatial data obtained from all ferry routes provide an environmental baseline and are used to assess the patterns and variability in surface water hydrography, dissolved constituents, and particulate matter. The data are useful to calibrate estimates of ocean color and sea surface temperature from aircraft and satellite sensors. We are creating a searchable geographic database that is intended for scientists, managers, and the general public. Using ferries as sampling platforms to monitor estuarine water quality is a tractable approach and FerryMon represents a model for use in other large bodies of water traversed by ferries.},

Abstract = {Sustainable development and management of groundwater resources require application of scientific principles and modern techniques. An integrated approach is implemented using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation to identify promising areas for groundwater exploration in Raya Valley, northern Ethiopia. The thematic layers considered are lithology, lineament density, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, rainfall and land use/cover. The corresponding normalized rates for the classes in a layer and weights for thematic layers are computed using Saaty's analytical hierarchy process. Based on the computed rates and weights, aggregating the thematic maps is done using a weighted linear combination method to obtain a groundwater potential (GP) map. The GP map is verified by overlay analysis with observed borehole yield data. Map-removal and single-parameter sensitivity analyses are used to examine the effects of removing any of the thematic layers on the GP map and to compute effective weights, respectively. About 770 km(2) (28 \% of the study area) is designated as `very good' GP. `Good', `moderate' and `poor' GP areas cover 630 km(2) (23 \%), 600 km(2) (22 \%) and 690 km(2) (25 \%), respectively; the area with `very poor' GP covers 55 km(2) (2 \%). Verification of the GP map against observed borehole yield data shows 74 \% agreement, which is fairly satisfactory. The sensitivity analyses reveal the GP map is most sensitive to lithology with a mean variation index of 6.5 \%, and lithology is the most effective thematic layer in GP mapping with mean effective weight of 52 \%.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the effects of pine (Pinus taeda L.) thinning and clear-cutting on the water yield and quality of three micro-watersheds from southern Brazil using paired- (reference site) and within-site (pre- and post-management periods) comparisons between 2013 and 2016. We inspected for differences in topographic and remote sensing data between the reference site 1 (native forest) and the managed sites 2 (thinning) and 3 (clear-cutting). Double-mass analysis and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to evaluate rainfall across sites. Using physicochemical data, we calculated the Water Quality Index (WQI) and measured the water yield, detecting anomalous events with wavelet transform. Finally, we verified differences across- and within-sites in median values of yield and WQI using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. The results from paired- and within-site comparisons showed that the management practices did not control the water yield and quality of the three studied micro-watersheds. Statistically significant differences in water yield and WQI were observed between the reference site 1 and pine-planted sites only in the pre-management period. Our findings showed slight differences across sites in morphometric parameters of the watersheds. The ANCOVA confirmed the importance of rainfall in controlling the variability of water yield over the thinning and clear-cutting sites.},

Abstract = {Several urban centres of different sizes have developed over time, and continue to grow, within the basin of Lake Victoria. Uncontrolled urban development, especially along the lake shore, puts environmental pressure on Lake Victoria and its local ecosystem. This study sought to monitor the extent and impacts of urban development (as measured by population growth and built-up land use/land cover) in the Lake Victoria basin, Kenya, between 1978 and 2018. Remote sensing and GIS-based land use/land cover classification was conducted to extract change in built-up areas from Landsat 3, 4, 5 and 8 satellite imagery obtained for the month of January at intervals of ten years. Change in population distribution and density was analysed based on decadal census data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics between 1979 and 2019. A statistical regression model was then estimated to relate population growth to built-up area expansion. Results indicate that the basin's built-up area has expanded by 97\% between 1978 and 2018 while the population increased by 140\% between 1979 and 2019. Urban development was attributed to the rapidly increasing population in the area as seen in a positive statistical correlation (R-2=0.5744) between increase in built-up area and population growth. The resulting environmental pressure on the local ecosystem has been documented mainly in terms of degradation of lake water quality, eutrophication and aquatic biodiversity loss. The study recommends the enactment and implementation of appropriate eco-sensitive local legislation and policies for sustainable urban and rural land use planning in the area. This should aim to control and regulate urban expansion especially in the immediate shoreline areas of the lake and associated riparian zones.},

Abstract = {The disruption of watersheds due to indiscriminate land use and urban development increases the vulnerability of adjacent surface water to contaminants of anthropogenic origin. This study assessed the relationship between disrupted watershed, drinking water quality and health risks of two urban rivers: Ureje and Awedele, Ado-Ekiti (Nigeria). Monthly samples of surface water (n = 60, per river) collected across seasons for 6 months (January-June, 2017) were analyzed for twenty-nine drinking water parameters including metals, nutrients (phosphates and nitrates) and pathogens using standard methods. The difference in the mean concentration of parameters between rivers was determined using t test, while the association between change in seasons and water quality parameters of both rivers was highlighted using principal component analysis (PCA).The risk was assessed based on on-site inspection studies and water sample analysis using WHO semiquantitative risk matrix approach. Inferences on surface water vulnerability were made from percentage built-up areas, riparian cover and stream order within each watershed. Mean concentrations of Pb, Cd, Fe, Mn, nitrates and coliform presence in samples from Awedele river (0.02 +/- 0.00; 0.005 +/- 0.001; 5.44 +/- 1.33; 0.81 +/- 0.03; 58.03 +/- 0.10 mg/L; 1.2x 10(6) MPN/100 ml, respectively) and Cd, Fe, Mn, nitrates and coliform in samples from Ureje river (0.004 +/- 0.0001; 4.96 +/- 0.12; 0.54 +/- 0.01; 62.08 +/- 0.02 mg/L; 1.6x 10(3) MPN/100 ml, respectively) were above the permissible limits of WHO drinking guidelines. Risk assessment revealed urban runoff and unsanitary practices within the watershed as possible hazardous events which may compromise water quality of both rivers, while the PCA associated greater likelihood of surface water deterioration with areas of a higher percentage built-up area and lesser riparian density and width. We infer that disrupted watersheds and greater riparian depletion due to urbanization increased chances of metals and pathogens incidence that negatively impacts water. A twofold strategy of policy protection of watersheds and public health education on sourcing polluted surface water is recommended.},

Abstract = {The article describes the concept of a decentralized architecture of a traffic management system for mobile vehicles and is a continuation of the results presented in the previous article ``Blockchain-based protocol of autonomous business activity for multi-agent systems consisting of UAVs{''}. Robonomic protocol is the basis for the system architecture - a combination of the decentralized Ethereum computer, the IPFS distributed file system, Robot Operating System and market mechanisms. In particular, its focused on the principle of communication between nodes of the traffic management system and the stages of the unmanned mission. As a proof of concept, two experiments on the integration of the proposed architecture are presented: air quality measurements using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and water quality measurements using unmanned surface vessels (USV). Our work demonstrates that distributed ledger and smart contracts technologies are applicable to the traffic management system and increases the transparency and immutability of the data.},

Abstract = {The aim of MyWater project (http://mywater-fp7.eu/) is to provide reliable information on water quantity, quality and usage for appropriate water management. This was achieved by joining three scientific research areas: earth observation (EO), catchment modelling and meteorology. Data from these different sources were integrated through an interface platform, which provides tailored services to the water manager, including support for irrigation activities in Nestos river plain (Greece) and early flood warning in Rijnland (The Netherlands). The platform includes tools for visualization and presentation of short-term prediction of the meteorological and hydrological conditions in maps and charts. It also allows the users to make analysis of time series of data, definition of warning alarms, and other tools useful for the water managers. MyWater's users played a key role, by defining the requirements during the development phase, and providing evaluation feedback towards the project's end. The aim of this work is to present the feedback from the users, after they had been trained on using MyWater's platform and information services. Participants were asked to reflect on the platforms' ease of use, speed performance. Secondly whether the data is easily to be retrieved and the catalogue is clear enough, and to what extend the platform could be customized. Results show that 75\% of the questions concerning the Platform were answered with Good or Excellent, while 25\% was marked as Average. Few participants raised their concern on the speed / performance they experienced with the platform, and indeed the internet band-width required for optimal use of the platform was not met all the time during the evaluation phase. With respect to the services offered, some participants indicated they would appreciate MyWater also to focus on water quality (e.g. salinity problems in irrigation water) and pollution. In its current version the MyWater platform focuses mainly on Water Resources Management. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Potential of Virtual Earth Observation Constellations in Archaeological Research},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Earth observation sensors continually provide datasets with different spectral and spatial characteristics, while a series of pre- and postprocessing techniques are needed for calibration purposes. Nowadays, a variety of satellite images have become accessible to researchers, while big data cloud platforms allow them to deal with an extensive number of datasets. However, there is still difficulty related to these sensors meeting specific needs and challenges such as those of cultural heritage and supporting archaeological research world-wide. The harmonization and synergistic use of different sensors can be used in order to maximize the impact of earth observation sensors and enhance their benefit to the scientific community. In this direction, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has proposed the concept of virtual constellations, which is defined as ``a coordinated set of space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners that focuses on observing a particular parameter or set of parameters of the Earth system{''}. This paper provides an overview of existing and future earth observation sensors, the various levels of interoperability as proposed by Wulder et al., and presents some preliminary results from the Thessalian plain in Greece using integrated optical and radar Sentinel images. The potential for archaeolandscape studies using virtual constellations is discussed here.},

Abstract = {Turkey is a county that experiences rapid socioeconomic development, which, in turn, leads to high urbanization rates due to migration of people from rural to urban areas, many large-scale development projects (e.g. highways, dams, housing and infrastructure), and environmental problems that adversely affect agriculture, such as soil erosion and deforestation. Furthermore, Turkey lies in a region prone to natural disasters, especially earthquakes, landslides, flooding and forest fires. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires continuous monitoring to enable rapid response as well as the development of effective socioeconomic policies. In this regard, space-based earth observation (EO) systems play a critical role in the rapid acquisiton and extraction of crucial information. The first launch of the first Turkish-designed satellite, RASAT, in 2011 led to the wide-spread exploitation of space-based resources by Turkish institutions through the dissemination of EO data on an open and free basis via the GEZGIN internet portal (http://www.gezgin.gov.tr). The push for data sharing was further instigated by the nationally funded project GEOPORTAL ({''}Satellite Image Processing and Geoportal Development Project{''}) and European Union FP7 project EOPOWER ({''}Earth Observation for Economic Empowerment{''}), which strove to create conditions for sustainable economic development through the increased use of Earth observation products and services for environmental applications. In this work, the technical challenges involving processing and preparing raw satellite data for dissemination as well as software design of the GEZGIN Portal will be presented.},

Abstract = {Spatio-temporal patterns of four neighbouring river-scapes in the central Western Ghats, India through land-use analyses using temporal remote sensing data (1973, 2018), reveal a decline in evergreen forests (41\%) and fragmentation of intact or contiguous forests (60\%). Hydro-ecological footprint illustrates that catchment integrity plays a decisive role in sustaining water for societal and ecological needs. This is evident from the occurrence of perennial streams in the catchment dominated by native flora with forest cover greater than 60\%, highlighting the riverscape dynamics with hydrological, ecological, social and environmental dimension linkages and water sustainability. This helps in evolving strategies to adopt integrated watershed management to sustain anthropogenic and environmental water demand.},

Abstract = {Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a prominent technology to assess the environmental changes in the open cast Limestone mining region. However, traditional EIA methods and Limestone deposit identification involves time consuming, cost effective and manpower requirements. We cope-up these problem and incorporated with different satellite image processing techniques and field studies to estimate the impact on environment. Landsat imageries have been used to calculate NDVI, NDWI, LULC, LST for the buffer zone within a 10 km radius of the mines from the period between 1997-2017. The noise pollution of the mining region is identified using a random sample method. To access water quality analysis in the area, the Water Quality Index (WQI) is generated using 12 water quality parameters. EIA is analyzed using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and future EIA is also predicted using empirical Bayesian Kriging approach.},

Abstract = {Accurate and rapid evaluation of the regional eco-environment is critical to policy formulation. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model of the Guangxi Beibu Gulf Economic Zone (GBGEZ) during 2001-2020 was established and evaluated using four indices: dryness, wetness, greenness, and heat. This paper proposes an information granulation method for remote sensing based on the RSEI index value that uses granular computing. We found that: (1) From 2001 to 2020, the eco-environmental quality (EEQ) of GBGEZ tended to improve, and the spatial difference tended to expand. The regional spatial distribution of the eco-environment is primarily in the second-level and third-level areas, and the EEQ in the east and west is better than that in the middle. The contribution of greenness, wetness, and dryness to the improvement of EEQ in the study region increased year by year. (2) From 2001 to 2020, the order of the contribution of the EEQ index in the GBGEZ was dryness, wetness, greenness, and heat. (3) The social and economic activities in the study region had a certain inhibitory effect on the improvement of the EEQ.},

Title = {Integrating field observations and process-based modeling to predict watershed water quality under environmental perturbations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {602},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Watersheds play a critical role in supplying water resources needed for human use and ecosystem health. Understanding and predicting how, when, and where changes in the quantity and quality of water resources occur under different environmental stresses including extreme events is crucial for sustainable management of water resources under a changing environment. However, few studies have attempted to quantify or identify the factors and process interactions controlling the impact of extreme events across watershed systems. Only few large-scale studies include coordinated monitoring and modeling efforts, which limits our ability to assess the large-scale impact of extreme events on water supply and quality. Methods are lacking to propagate uncertainty in process understanding through an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model framework and evaluate its importance, thus failing to take full advantage of the information potentially available through transformative advances in characterization technologies from high-resolution mass spectrometry to airborne and satellite-based remote sensing. There are consequent risks to our nation's water security and to human and ecosystem health that may become exacerbated with the increasing frequency of extreme events that is projected for the coming decades. This paper reviews the current status of watershed science for both water quantity and quality and identifies critical gaps in our current knowledge and modeling capability in addressing the emergent needs in predicting watershed hydrologic and biogeochemical responses (i.e., water quantity and quality) under natural and anthropogenic perturbations. We highlight the need to (1) understand how environmental perturbations including extreme events like floods and droughts and anthropogenic changes such as deforestation and urbanization propagate through watershed systems and assess their short- and long-term impacts on watershed biogeochemistry, water quality and their recovery pathways; (2) develop and improve a watershed water quality model that reflects the state of scientific understanding gained from observations; and (3) construct a data-model fusion system for watershed characterization, process identification, and mechanistic model parameterization. A large base of modeling, monitoring and data capabilities have been built by various federal government agencies given the relevance of water to their critical missions.

Abstract = {Sustainable growth, environmental preservation, and improvement of life quality are strategic fields of worldwide interest and cornerstones of international policies. Humanity health and prosperity are closely related to our present choices on sustainable development. The main sources of pollution concern industry, including mining, chemical companies, and refineries, wastewater treatment; and consumers themselves. In order to guide and evaluate the effects of environmental policies, diffuse monitoring campaigns and detailed (big) data analyses are needed. In this respect, the development and availability of innovative sensor platforms for field analysis and remote sensing are of crucial relevance. In this review, we provide an overview of the area, analyzing the major needs, available technologies, novel approaches, and perspectives. Among environmental pollutants that threaten the biosphere, we focus on inorganic and organic contaminants, which affect air and water quality. We describe the technologies for their assessment in the environment and then draw some conclusions and mention future perspectives opened by the integration of sensing technologies with robotics and the Internet of Things. Without the ambition to be exhaustive in such a rapidly growing field, this review is intended as a support for researchers and stakeholders looking for current, state-of-the-art, and key enabling technologies for environmental monitoring.},

Abstract = {It is estimated that more than 20,000 natural lakes are found across China. Most of these lakes are undergoing eutrophication or other severe environmental nuisances owing to natural and/or anthropogenic processes. In order to prevent or to minimize such damaging impacts, and to ascertain a proper quality management of the lake water and the associated fish resources, it is required to have access to up-to-date, accurate, and relevant data and information on the aquatic ecosystem in a timely manner. The ``Dragon 3{''} project, supported by the European Space Agency, is focusing on Xin'an river watershed and investigates the impact of water quality and land cover/use change on the spatio-temporal distribution of the fishing grounds in Qiandao Lake. In this paper, the land use changes derived from satellite images is presented. Initially, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 LDCM have been analyzed for the last 20 years in the vicinity of the Xin'an river watershed. Following the radiometric calibration of the images, several pixel-base classification algorithms have been evaluated including Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well Neural Network (NN). As it was found using the multi-temporal satellite imagery, the SVM algorithm was able to give high kappa accuracy estimated at around 0.90. In addition EO-Hyperion images over the western part of the Xin'an River were evaluated using hyperspectral vegetation indices as well using linear spectral un-mixing techniques. In addition, ENVISAT radar images have been evaluated in terms of land use change. The final outcomes indicate a significant urban expansion in the surrounding area of the Xin'an River which impacts the water quality investigation. Finally, a Landsat image was processed in order to estimate the Trophic State Index (TSI) values over the water bodies and the highest values were observed over the Xin'an river watershed and more specifically for the urban sites.},

Title = {Thirty-Four-Year Record (1987-2021) of the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Algal Blooms in Lake Dianchi from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Insights},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Lake Dianchi is one of the most eutrophic lakes in China. The decline in water quality and the occurrence of massive algal blooms pose a significant threat to the health and environmental safety of the water ecosystem, making Lake Dianchi a key concern for algal bloom management in China. Obtaining the spatiotemporal dynamics of algal blooms for the longest time possible is crucial to algal bloom management and future prediction. However, it is difficult to acquire a long-term record of algal blooms from a single sensor in order to cover a more extended period of eutrophication in the lake due to the limitation of the spatial and temporal resolution of the sensors. In this study, Landsat and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were combined with the Floating Algae Index (FAI) to reconstruct a unified time series of bloom areas to analyze the algal bloom dynamics in Lake Dianchi in recent decades. Regarding the interannual variation, the bloom area showed an increasing trend from 1987 to 2021, with larger bloom areas in 1991-1992, 2000-2003, 2012-2013, and 2020-2021. In terms of seasonal characteristics, the bloom area was significantly more prominent in the rainy season compared with the dry season during the year. The spatial distribution of the bloom frequency showed a pattern of higher frequencies in the north and lower frequencies in the south. From 2000 to 2021, the initial bloom time and bloom duration showed a trend of delaying and then advancing and decreasing and then increasing, respectively. We analyzed the importance of long-term records of algal blooms and found that the percentage of rainy season images is an essential factor in reconstructing time series based on different sensors. In addition, the relationship between environmental factors and algal blooms was analyzed. The results show that wind speed and air temperature were the main meteorological factors controlling the interannual variation in algal blooms in Lake Dianchi. Water quality factors such as nutrients have less of an influence on the variation in algal blooms because the algal growth demand has been met. Environmental management measures taken by local governments have led to improvements in the lake's trophic state, and continued strengthening of environmental pollution control is expected to curb the algal blooms in Lake Dianchi. This study provides a long-term record of algal blooms in Lake Dianchi, which provides essential reference information for a comprehensive understanding of the development process of algal blooms in Lake Dianchi and its sustainable development.},

Title = {Multi-band spectral matching inversion algorithm to derive water column properties in optically shallow waters: An optimization of parameterization},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) and other water quality parameters from satellite remote sensing data covering optically shallow environments has historically been problematic due to difficulties in separating the benthic signal from that of the water column. While recent advances have improved such retrievals, most methods have high uncertainties for very shallow (< 5 m) or very bright (e.g., carbonate sand) targets. Here, we present a two-stage process to improve IOP derivations from satellite-derived reflectance data, termed the Shallow Water Optimization with Resolved Depth (SWORD). Within this process, a raster bathymetry is first derived through multiple pixel-wise implementations of a spectral matching algorithm on mapped reflectance data. This bathymetry is then used as a fixed input in subsequent implementations of the algorithm, leading to improved IOP retrievals. The SWORD approach was developed and tested using a dataset of simulated reflectance spectra as well as MERIS reflectance data covering two optically shallow water environments. Bathymetries derived using this process showed strong agreement with those determined from soundings and coastal relief models. Although SWORD-derived raster albedo maps showed general concordance to benthic habitat surveys, we found limited benefit of fixing this parameter in spectral matching routines. IOP derivations from SWORD show expected spatiotemporal patterns in the Florida Keys region, consistent with local hydrodynamic processes, seasonal fluctuations, and known anomalous events. This approach is portable to multi spectral reflectance data from similar satellite instruments, allowing regular and ongoing assessment and monitoring of optical water quality for ecologically and economically important marine systems.},

Title = {Comparison of Outdoor Compost Pile Detection Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Images and Various Machine Learning Techniques},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Since outdoor compost piles (OCPs) contain large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, they act as a major pollutant that deteriorates water quality, such as eutrophication and green algae, when the OCPs enter the river during rainfall. In South Korea, OCPs are frequently used, but there is a limitation that a lot of manpower and budget are consumed to investigate the current situation, so it is necessary to efficiently investigate the OCPs. This study compared the accuracy of various machine learning techniques for the efficient detection and management of outdoor compost piles (OCPs), a non-point pollution source in agricultural areas in South Korea, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. RGB, multispectral, and thermal infrared UAV images were taken in August and October 2019. Additionally, vegetation indices (NDVI, NDRE, ENDVI, and GNDVI) and surface temperature were also considered. Four machine learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and k-NN, were implemented, and the machine learning technique with the highest accuracy was identified by adjusting several variables. The accuracy of all machine learning techniques was very high, reaching values of up to 0.96. Particularly, the accuracy of the RF method with the number of estimators set to 10 was highest, reaching 0.989 in August and 0.987 in October. The proposed method allows for the prediction of OCP location and area over large regions, thereby foregoing the need for OCP field measurements. Therefore, our findings provide highly useful data for the improvement of OCP management strategies and water quality.},

Abstract = {An enterprise architecture for the Earth Science activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was developed to assist in assessing the capacity of scientific instruments in meeting the needs of society. It can also help them develop the right investment strategies and help scientists and engineers in their planning for system development, especially for complex space-based environmental sensors. This architecture model can be easily extended to the Global Earth Observation System-of-Systems (GEOSS). In fact, it was constructed with GEOSS in mind to ensure that NASA's observation systems can be readily mapped into the GEOSS structure. The architecture contains about 3000 elements that are involved in earth science research: observation sources, sensors, environmental parameters, data products, mission products, observations, science models, predictions, and decision-support tools. The science models use observations from the space-based instruments to generate predictions about various aspects of the environment. These predictions are used by decision-makers around the world to help minimize property damage and loss of human life due to adverse conditions such as severe weather storms. The architecture is developed using both traditional and nontraditional systems engineering (SE) tools and techniques. This paper will describe additional methods needed for the SE toolbox.},

Abstract = {For more than a century, agricultural mechanization encouraged larger fields with more uniform management and increasing impacts on the environment. The trajectory of agricultural technology is now at an inflection point where information technology, including remote sensing, simulation modeling, decision support systems, precision agricultural technologies, and automation, enables site-specific management at small spatial scales with the potential to simultaneously enhance food and bioenergy production, farm profitability, and environmental quality. To achieve these economic and environmental benefits of transforming agricultural landscape design and cropping system management, agricultural producers need increased access to both enabling technologies and engineering expertise. Government policies and programs are also needed to incentivize changes in cropping systems that promote soil health and improve water quality, for example, payments to cover much or all of the cost of transitioning land use to perennials and nutrient trading programs in which agricultural producers contract with industrial and municipal wastewater generators to reduce nutrient loading at a reduced cost. Information technology is providing the tools to target, quantify, and document this re-coupling of economic, environmental, and social sustainability in food-energy-water systems.},

Title = {Study on Meteorological Disaster Monitoring of Field Fruit Industry by Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Meteorological disasters have brought a great negative impact on people's lives. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the detection technology of meteorological disasters has been continuously improved. At present, satellite remote sensing detection technology has made gratifying achievements, and it has a good application in meteorological disaster prediction. In this paper, the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the process of meteorological disaster monitoring is discussed in depth. In traditional work, the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring is the key and difficult point of meteorological disaster prevention. Using satellite telemetry to monitor meteorological disasters can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring, provide reasonable solutions and decision-making basis for meteorological disaster prevention, and achieve the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. This paper introduces the basic principle, technical system, and important role of satellite remote sensing technology, expounds on the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the monitoring of agricultural meteorological disasters such as water, drought, freezing, and hail, and provides a scientific reference for farmers, agricultural sustainability, and agricultural decision-making. The continuous development of our country's modern social economy has put forward higher requirements for agricultural production. Traditional monitoring technology can no longer meet the needs of agricultural meteorological disaster monitoring. The scientific application of remote sensing monitoring technology has important value, which can effectively improve the detection level and make it have higher accuracy and real-time performance, thereby promoting modern agricultural production in China. Based on the analysis of the application value of remote sensing monitoring technology, this paper comprehensively discusses the specific conditions of different disasters monitored by remote sensing monitoring technology in agricultural production.},

Abstract = {Salinity intrusion is a complex issue in coastal and estuarine areas. Currently, remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor water quality changes, ranging from inland river networks to deep oceans. The Vietnamese Mekong Delta is an important rice-growing area, and intrusion of saline water into irrigated freshwater-based agriculture areas is one of the most crucial constraints for agriculture development. This study aimed at building a numerical model to realize the salinity intrusion through the relationship between reflectance from the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager images and salinity levels measured in situ. A total of 103 observed samples were divided into 50\% training and 50\% test. Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest (RF) approaches were applied in the study. The result showed that the RF approach was the best model to estimate salinity along the coastal river network in the study area. However, the large samples size needed was a significant challenge to circumscribe predicting ability of the RF model. The reflectance has a good correlation with salinity when locations (latitude-longitude) of salinity measured stations were added as a parameter of the Step-wise model with R-square 77.48\% in training and 74.16\% in test while Root Mean Square Error was smaller than 3.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are hotspots of marine biodiversity, and their global decline is a threat to our natural heritage. Conservation management of these precious ecosystems relies on accurate and up-to-date information about ecosystem health and the distribution of species and habitats, but such information can be costly to gather and interpret in the field. Remote sensing has proven capable of collecting information on geomorphologic zones and substrate types for coral reef environments, and is cost-effective when information is needed for large areas. Remote sensing-based mapping of coral habitat variables known to influence biodiversity has only recently been undertaken and new sensors and improved data processing show great potential in this area. This paper reviews coral reef biodiversity, the influence of habitat variables on its local spatial distribution, and the potential for remote sensing to produce maps of these habitat variables, thus indirectly mapping coral reef biodiversity and fulfilling information needs of coral reef managers.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Harmful cyanobacteria blooms (HCBs) are one of the main water quality threats affecting reservoirs. Guidelines suggest integrating laboratory, real-time in situ, and remote sensing data in the monitoring of HCBs. However, this approach is still little adopted in institutional measuring programs. We demonstrated that this integration improves frequency and spatial resolution of the data collection. Data were from an intense HCB (Planktothrix rubescens), which occurred in a south Italy multiple-uses reservoir (Lake Occhito) between 2008 and 2009 and regarded both the lake and the irrigation network. Laboratory and in situ fluorometric data were related to satellite imagery, using simple linear regression models, to produce surface lake-wide maps reporting the distribution of both P. rubescens and microcystins. In the first node of the distribution network, microcystin concentrations (4-10 mu g L-1) reached values potentially able to damage the culture and to accumulate during cultivation. Nevertheless, our study shows a decrease in the microcystin content with the distance from the lake (0.05 mu g L-1 km(-1)), with a reduction of about 80\% of the microcystin concentrations at the furthest tanks. Recent improvements in the spatial resolution (i.e., tens of meters) of satellite imagery allow us to monitor the main tanks of large and complex irrigation systems.},

Title = {Analysis of the Evolution of Sea Water Quality in the Spanish Coast from Satellite Images before and during a Confinement Period},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {Satellite imaging, a form of remote sensing, can be used to analyse water quality, which must be monitored for proper and sustainable environmental management. This paper studies the effect of a sea traffic reduction in the Alboran Sea (Spain), analysing the changes in water quality before (from February 3rd, 2020) and during (until June 22nd, 2020) a confinement period. This was an unprecedented event in modern times and brought an interesting opportunity to study dynamics when the human impact is reduced. The study of these dynamics and the concentration levels with little human effect is important for environmental conservation purposes. We applied already existing indices using ArcGIS and ACOLITE to determine the following environmental parameters: colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Prequarantine concentration levels can reach up to 4 a(CDOM)440 (CDOM), 18 g/m(3) (SPM), and 100 mu g/L (Chl-a). Most prequarantine days presented an increment in either concentration level or distribution from the day before. The effects a sudden human impact has on an ecosystem which experimented reduced human influence for months were shown. On the day before the said impact (June 12th), three of the parameters were barely detected with concentration levels of mostly 2 a(CDOM)440 (CDOM), 6 g/m(3) (SPM), and 25 mu g/L (Chl-a), and sparse distribution. Afterwards (June 22nd), their levels went up to 4 a(CDOM)440 (CDOM), 14 g/m(3) (SPM), and 1000 mu g/L (Chl-a) and were distributed near the ports. The results presented in this study show that the main drivers of change when human impact was reduced were climatologic events (such as storms). Nevertheless, the importance of the human facto can be seen through the CDOM, SPM, and Chl-a plume near port areas observed the day after port activity was reactivated, June 22nd.},

Title = {Impact of land use and urbanization on river water quality and ecology in a dam dominated basin},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {584},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Improving water quality and ecological status is an important foundation for sustainability development. Increasing human activity and the corresponding land use change lead to the deterioration of river water quality (WQ) and water ecology (WE), but the pathway is complex, especially in dam dominated basins with the altered streamflow by the joint regulation of multiple dams and sluices that leads to changes in WQ seasonally. However, the research on this issue is inadequate and it is urgently needed since a large number of dams and sluices have been built worldwide for socioeconomic benefits, putting the basin's WQ and WE under pressure. Based on water ecological experiment, a framework was proposed to assess the impact of land use (LU) and urbanization on WQ and WE in different scenarios derived from human activities (low, and intense) and seasonality (winter, and summer) in a dam dominated basin. The framework was applied to the Shaying River Basin located in the Central China as a case study. The remote sensing of Landsat 8 OLI\_TIRS images and Geographic Information System (GIS) were combined by using the support vector machine classification method to extract the land use patterns and to map the spatial distribution diagrams of WQ and WE indicators based on in-situ experimental data. A canonical correlation analysis method and Pearson correlation testing were adopted to evaluate the impact of LU and urbanization on WQ and WE in the basin. Results showed that LU and urbanization had a great impact on WE compared to WQ due to the slow reaction of ecosystem in the basin. Because the former was resulted by long-term regulation of dams and sluices, and the latter was related to the short-term changes of river environment. Moreover, the former was attributed to the latter largely. LU and urbanization impact on WQ had a significant seasonality with higher impact in winter than in summer, and the seasonality of the impact was weakened as the disturbance of LU and urbanization increased. The seasonal variation of WE indicators was almost not significant in our study due to their adaptability to surrounding environment. Our results provide insights to water resources management and ecological restoration in the Shaying River Basin and other similar basins with intensive dams and sluices.},

Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Groundwater quality, scarcity and over-exploitation of available resources have produced several critical problems in Jhajjar district, Haryana, India. Health problems associated with drinking of polluted groundwater and its escalating demands make management of groundwater more complicated and require more innovative scientific analyses for good strategies of water management. In this study, a comprehensive water management plan has been developed for seven sub-watersheds of Jhajjar district using the remote sensing and geographical information system techniques. This research work addresses a central concern: how an integrated watershed management system can be applied, which can solve both water quality and scarcity problem in semi-arid climatic conditions. About 30 parameters including linear, areal and relief aspects of watersheds were determined for these watersheds. The focus was given on the characteristics of drainage basins such as permeability, soil quality, slope, run-off time and time of concentration for watershed during a rainfall event. Analysis results show that most of the basins are of an elongated shape with low drainage density and texture, which makes recharge plan difficult. Based on the outcome of the morphometric analysis of sub-watersheds, various suitable recharge sites have been proposed along with recharge structures for various stream orders. This study will address the immediate need to incorporate groundwater quality and will also help in replenishing the groundwater resources if implemented.},

Abstract = {Contaminants from various anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, mining, and recreation negatively affect wetland water quality and vegetation health and composition. Phytoremediation is an effective, sustainable and eco-friendly pollution abatement method using green plants. Arundo donax L. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. are two morphologically similar reeds commonly used for phytoremediation in wetlands of South Africa. Arundo donax is however, a declared category `1b' weed under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA, Act No. 10 of 2004), requiring its immediate removal. Thus, determining the phytoremediation efficiency of the two reeds could help making the right choice between them for potential use in wetlands. Furthermore, the effeciency of wetlands depends on a robust monitoring system for phytoremediating plants to determine the appropriate time for biomass harvest before they die and release contaminants taken up in plant tissues back into the source through decomposition. Remote sensing can be used for mapping and monitoring of such aquatic macrophytes at species level effectively. Satellites imageries with high spatial and spectral resolutions not only are capable of detecting heavy metal-induced plant stresses, but also can effectively discriminate between morphologically similar species like A. donax and P. Australis and facilitate wetland managment.},

Title = {Quantitative estimation of wastewater quality parameters by hyperspectral band screening using GC, VIP and SPA},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Water pollution has been hindering the world's sustainable development. The accurate inversion of water quality parameters in sewage with visible-near infrared spectroscopy can improve the effectiveness and rational utilization and management of water resources. However, the accuracy of spectral models of water quality parameters is usually prone to noise information and high dimensionality of spectral data. This study aimed to enhance the model accuracy through optimizing the spectral models based on the sensitive spectral intervals of different water quality parameters. To this end, six kinds of sewage water taken from a biological sewage treatment plant went through laboratory physical and chemical tests. In total, 87 samples of sewage water were obtained by adding different amount of pure water to them. The raw reflectance (R-raw) of the samples were collected with analytical spectral devices. The Rraw-SNV were obtained from the R raw processed with the standard normal variable. Then, the sensitive spectral intervals of each of the six water quality parameters, namely, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), NH3-N, the total dissolved substances (TDS), total hardness (TH) and total alkalinity (TA), were selected using three different methods: gray correlation (GC), variable importance in projection (VIP) and set pair analysis (SPA). Finally, the performance of both extreme learning machine (ELM) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) was investigated based on the sensitive spectral intervals. The results demonstrated that the model accuracy based on the sensitive spectral ranges screened through different methods appeared different. The GC method had better performance in reducing the redundancy and the VIP method was better in information preservation. The SPA method could make the optimal trade-offs between information preservation and redundancy reduction and it could retain maximal spectral band intervals with good response to the inversion parameters. The accuracy of the models based on varied sensitive spectral ranges selected by the three analysis methods was different: the GC was the highest, the SPA came next and the VIP was the lowest. On the whole, PLSR and ELM both achieved satisfying model accuracy, but the prediction accuracy of the latter was higher than the former. Great differences existed among the optimal inversion accuracy of different water quality parameters: COD, BOD and TN were very high; TA relatively high; and TDS and TH relatively low. These findings can provide a new way to optimize the spectral model of wastewater biochemical parameters and thus improve its prediction precision.},

Title = {Nitrogen Inversion Model in a Wetland Environment Based on the Canopy Reflectance of Emergent Plants},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {Reuse of reclaimed water in constructed wetlands is a promising way to conserve water resources and improve water quality, and it is playing a very important role in wetland restoration and reconstruction. This study utilized reflectance spectra of wetland vegetation to estimate nitrogen content in water in the Beijing Bai River constructed wetland, a typically constructed wetland that uses reclaimed water. Canopy reflectance spectra of two dominant plants in the wetland, including reed and cattail, were acquired using a spectrometer (350-2500 nm). Simultaneously, water samples were collected to measure water quality. To establish the appreciate relationship between total nitrogen content (TN) and reflectance spectra, both simple and multiple regression models, including simple ration spectral index (SR), normalized difference spectral index (ND), stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) model, and partial least squares regression (PLSR), were adopted in this study. The results showed that (1) compared with simple regression models (SR and ND), multiple regressions models (SMLR and PLSR) could provide a more accurate estimation of TN concentration in the wetland environment. Among these models, the PLSR model had the highest accuracy and was proven to be the most useful tool to reveal the relationship between the spectral reflectance of wetland plants and the total nitrogen consistency of wetland at the canopy scale. (2) The inversion effect of TN concentration in water is slightly better than that of wetland vegetation, and the reflection spectrum of the reed can predict TN concentration more accurately than that of cattail. The finding not only provides solid evidence for the potential application of remote sensing to detect water eutrophication but also enhances our understanding of the monitoring and management of water quality in urban wetlands using recycled water.},

Abstract = {To better assess the impacts of conservation buffers and grasslands on water quality at large spatial scales, development and integration of novel approaches are crucial to ensure that these land management practices are functioning properly and meeting their original goals. Recent developments in remote sensing technology have greatly enriched the availability of geospatial data that can be used in hydrological modeling to assess the potential hydrological response of conservation practices over larger areas. A methodology was developed using the object-based image analysis approach with Landsat-5 TM imagery of the year 2005 and thematic layers of streams to quantify conservation buffers and grasslands (OBIA-2005). The OBIA-2005 land cover data was used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model to assess the impacts of vegetative conservation practices on total phosphorus (TP) loads. The model was calibrated and validated for discharge and TP loads in the Cedar Creek Watershed (CCW) in northeast Indiana. In general model efficiency for streamflow values was within acceptable statistical ranges. While calibration of TP loads was satisfactory for the total contributing area of two nested catchments within the upper CCW. Vegetative buffers of 30.5 m and 61 m combined with conservation grasslands generated from the OBIA-2005 resulted in a large reduction of TP loads as compared to no practices. The results also showed that including conservation grassland alone reduced TP loads by less than 2\%. However, the combination of these practices with the width of edge-of-field buffer strips module of the SWAT model achieved the largest TP loads reduction. These findings demonstrate that improved representation of vegetative conservation practices in geospatial land cover data sets are more effective in assessing the impacts of conservation buffers and grasslands on water quality through hydrologic modeling.

Abstract = {Imaging spectrometry of non-oceanic aquatic ecosystems has been in development since the late 1980s when the first airborne hyperspectral sensors were deployed over lakes. Most water quality management applications were, however, developed using multispectral mid-spatial resolution satellites or coarse spatial resolution ocean colour satellites till now. This situation is about to change with a suite of upcoming imaging spectrometers being deployed from experimental satellites or from the International Space Station. We review the science of developing applications for inland and coastal aquatic ecosystems that often are a mixture of optically shallow and optically deep waters, with gradients of clear to turbid and oligotrophic to hypertrophic productive waters and with varying bottom visibility with and without macrophytes, macro-algae, benthic micro-algae or corals. As the spaceborne, airborne and in situ optical sensors become increasingly available and appropriate for aquatic ecosystem detection, monitoring and assessment, the science-based applications will need to be further developed to an operational level. The Earth Observation-derived information products will range from more accurate estimates of turbidity and transparency measures, chlorophyll, suspended matter and coloured dissolved organic matter concentration, to more sophisticated products such as particle size distributions, phytoplankton functional types or distinguishing sources of suspended and coloured dissolved matter, estimating water depth and mapping types of heterogeneous substrates. We provide an overview of past science, current state of the art and future directions so that early career scientists as well as aquatic ecosystem managers and associated industry groups may be prepared for the imminent deluge of imaging spectrometry data.},

Abstract = {Efficient land and water management require the accurate selection of suitable crops that are compatible with soil and crop water requirements (CWR) in a given area. In this study, twenty soil profiles are collected to represent the soils of the study area. Physical and chemical properties of soil, in addition to irrigation water quality, provided data are utilized by the Agriculture Land Evaluation System for Arid and semi-arid regions (ALES-Arid) to determine crop suitability. University of Idaho Ref-ET software is used to calculate CWR from weather data while the Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land Model (SEBAL) is utilized to estimate CWR from remote sensing data. The obtained results show that seasonal weather-based CWR of the most suitable field crops (S1 and S2 classes) ranges from 804 to 1625 mm for wheat and berssem, respectively, and ranges from 778 to 993 mm in the vegetable crops potato and watermelon, respectively, under surface irrigation. Mean daily satellite-based CWR are predicted based on SEBAL ranges between 4.79 and 3.62 mm in Toshka and Abu Simbel areas respectively. This study provides a new approach for coupling ALES-Arid, Ref-ET and SEBAL models to facilitate the selection of suitable crops and offers an excellent source for predicting CWR in arid environments. The findings of this research will help in managing the future marginal land reclamation projects in arid and semi-arid areas of the world.},

Abstract = {The Choptank River is an estuary, tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, and an eco-system in decline due partly to excessive nutrient and sediment loads from agriculture. The Conservation Effects Assessment Project for the Choptank River watershed was established to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation practices oil water quality, within this watershed. Several measurement frame works are being used to assess conservation practices. Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and herbicides (atrazine and metolachlor) are monitored within 1.5 small. agricultural subwatersheds and periodically in the lower portions of the river estuary Initial results indicate that land use within these subwatersheds is a major determinant Of nutrient concentration in streams. In addition, the (18)O isotope signature of nitrate was used to provide a landscape assessment of denitrification processes in the presence of the variable land use. Herbicide concentrations were not correlated to land use, suggesting that herbicide delivery to the streams is influenced by other factors and/or processes. Remote sensing technologies have been used to scale point measurements of best management practice effectiveness from field to subwatershed and watershed scales. Optical satellite (SPOT-5) data and ground-level measurements have been shown to be effective for monitoring nutrient uptake by winter cover crops in fields with a wide range of management practices. Synthetic Aperture Radar (RADARSAT-1) data have been shown to detect and to characterize accurately the hydrology (hydroperiod) of forested wetlands at landscape and watershed scales. These multiple approaches are providing actual data for assessment of conservation practices and to help producers. natural resource managers, and policy makers maintain agricultural production while protecting this unique estuary},

Abstract = {Total phosphorus (TP) is an important factor of eutrophication. The accurate monitoring of TP concentration is conducive to the management of water environments. To improve the accuracy of TP remote sensing inversion, this paper improved and studied the following three aspects. First, a new optical classification method was constructed to classify water into two different types. Compared with other classification methods, the proposed method can be more effective for improving the accuracy of TP inversion. Second, data regression analysis and fitting (DRF), back propagation neural network (BP) and random forest (RF) were used to build TP inversion models based on the different water type. The validation results indicated that the DRF performed best, with the highest precision for all water types, and was suitable for TP inversion. Finally, the performance of the classification and inversion algorithms on Sentinel-3 data was evaluated and one image was acquired for mapping the TP concentration in Taihu Lake. All in all, this study improves the accuracy of TP inversion by combining the new classification algorithm with DRF. This is significant for the development of class-based water quality parameter inversion algorithms for water color remote sensing, and this approach can be applied in the effective management and control of the eutrophication of lake environments.},

Abstract = {An ecological environment is a complex system fundamental to the sustainable development of societies and economies. Landsat series satellites are widely used for monitoring the changes in Earth's surface morphology. With long timeseries data, Landsat can provide new methods and technical support for eco-environmental monitoring. This study developed remote-sensing monitoring methods based on Landsat data to observe the changes in the ecological environment in the Zhoushan region, China. The regional environmental changes in vegetation, water, and other key ecological factors were analyzed using multitemporal remote-sensing data. This study shows the effectiveness of this method for the extraction of key eco-environmental factors such as vegetation and water body area and the evaluation of regional eco-environmental quality. This study also reveals ecological patterns in the Zhoushan region and provides data support for regional eco-environmental assessment and management.},

Abstract = {South Sea Islands of China are far away from the mainland, the reefs takes more than 95\% of south sea, and most reefs scatter over interested dispute sensitive area. Thus, the methods of obtaining the reefs bathymetry accurately are urgent to be developed. Common used method, including sonar, airborne laser and remote sensing estimation, are limited by the long distance, large area and sensitive location. Remote sensing data provides an effective way for bathymetry estimation without touching over large area, by the relationship between spectrum information and bathymetry. Aimed at the water quality of the south sea of China, our paper develops a bathymetry estimation method without measured water depth. Firstly the semi-analytical optimization model of the theoretical interpretation models has been studied based on the genetic algorithm to optimize the model. Meanwhile, OpenMP parallel computing algorithm has been introduced to greatly increase the speed of the semi-analytical optimization model. One island of south sea in China is selected as our study area, the measured water depth are used to evaluate the accuracy of bathymetry estimation from Worldview-2 multispectral images. The results show that: the semi-analytical optimization model based on genetic algorithm has good results in our study area; the accuracy of estimated bathymetry in the 0-20 meters shallow water area is accepted. Semi-analytical optimization model based on genetic algorithm solves the problem of the bathymetry estimation without water depth measurement. Generally, our paper provides a new bathymetry estimation method for the sensitive reefs far away from mainland.},

Abstract = {Lake Champlain has bays undergoing chronic cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms that pose a public health threat. Monitoring and assessment tools need to be developed to support risk decision making and to gain a thorough understanding of bloom scales and intensities. In this research application, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Rapid Eye, and Proba Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) images were obtained while a corresponding field campaign collected in situ measurements of water quality. Models including empirical band ratio regressions were applied to map chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin concentrations; all sensors performed well with R-2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 and 0.42 to 1.51, respectively. The outcomes showed spatial patterns across the lake with problematic bays having phycocyanin concentrations >25 mu g/L. An alert status metric tuned to the current monitoring protocol was generated using modeled water quality to illustrate how the remote sensing tools can inform a public health monitoring system. Among the sensors utilized in this study, Landsat 8 OLI holds the most promise for providing exposure information across a wide area given the resolutions, systematic observation strategy and free cost.},

Abstract = {Turbidity is a key indicator of water quality. It has biotic effects due to low penetration of light into the water such as photosynthesis reduction. The seasonal and interannual variability of turbidity in the Eastern Tropical Pacific coast of Mexico were analyzed using ocean color data. The region has an extended continental shelf, with several river discharges and marked seasonal patterns of wind. Remote sensing data (1998 to 2017) of reflectance, wind, rainfall, and river discharges were analyzed through Hovmoller diagrams and Empirical Orthogonal Functions. The results indicated that wind stress explained 76\% of the turbidity variance, while 8\% was explained by river discharges and rainfall. In winter, turbidity is intensified by resuspension mechanisms in front of the southern river mouths. In spring, turbidity increases due tophytoplankton particulate concentrations enhanced by coastal upwelling. During summer and autumn, wind stress is weaker and river discharges increase, thus turbidity increases in front of northern river mouths. El Nino-Southern Oscillation generates turbidity anomalies by alteration of rainfall and wind stress. Despite the proximity of the river mouths, the coastal water turbidity is explained by different processes, which need to be assessed in coastal management. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

Abstract = {Systematic planning for groundwater exploration using modern techniques is essential for the proper utilization, protection and management of this vital resource. Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, a geographic information system (GIS), a watershed modeling system (WMS) and weighted spatial probability modeling (WSPM) were integrated to identify the groundwater potential areas in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. Eight pertinent thematic layers were built in a GIS and assigned appropriate rankings. Layers considered were: rainfall, net groundwater recharge, lithology or infiltration, lineament density, slope, drainage density, depth to groundwater, and water quality. All these themes were assigned weights according to their relative importance to groundwater potentiality and their corresponding normalized weights were obtained based on their effectiveness factors. The groundwater potentiality map was finally produced by WSPM. This map comprises five gradational groundwater potentiality classes ranging from very high to very low. The validity of this unbiased GIS-based model was tested by correlating its results with the published hydrogeological map of Egypt and the actual borehole yields, where a concordant justification was reached. The map declared that the Sinai Peninsula is generally of moderate groundwater potentiality, where this class encompasses an area of 33,120 km(2) which represents 52\% of its total area.},

Title = {Morphometric analysis and change detection in Yamuna riverbed in Delhi},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 28},
Abstract = {Morphometry is the process that deals with mathematical analysis and calculations of the various land surface dimensions. In this study, morphometry analysis and changes in riverbeds due to anthropogenic activities have been studied using geospatial techniques for a stretch of the Yamuna river in Delhi. The parametric values related to morphometry, such as low permeability and high surface run-off were determined through Remote Sensing, which is helpful to understand the characteristics of the area. The study reveals that morphometric parameters and land surface properties are closely interrelated and are dependent on each other. Analysis has lightened up that over the year river span has been reduced from 5.15 to 4.23 sq. km and there is a trend of reduction and alteration of the channel in upcoming days. The morphometric conditions also indicate a concern of flood during monsoon. This study also focuses on the adverse effects of anthropogenic activities on the Yamuna riverbed morphology. There is a need for restriction on haphazard human activities, effective planning and management for sustainable development of the Yamuna riverbed in Delhi. The study suggests further research on aquatic ecology, water quality, and life expectancy of the river due to immense anthropogenic pressure.},

Abstract = {Zizania latifolia is a common emergent macrophyte in lakes along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. To investigate the factors driving the expansion or decline of Z. latifolia populations, the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of Z. latifolia in six Yangtze floodplain lakes were analyzed from 2007 to 2016 using remote sensing and geographic information system tools. In combination with hydrological data and other environmental factors, the main influencing factors were determined. The results showed that distribution of Z. latifolia among the six lakes exhibited obvious differences. Plant cover was the highest in Wuchang and Huangda lakes, which had relatively stable water levels. Spearman correlation analyses showed that the lake morphological variables, climatic variables, and water quality variables had no significant effects on the distribution of Z. latifolia. Regarding variables related to hydrology, excluding the rate of water level change and timing of extreme water level annually, the other four groups of hydrological variables (a total of 20 indicators) all had significant effects on the distribution of Z. latifolia. At last, the reasons for difference in cover in different lake types were analyzed and appropriate strategies for the ecological management of Z. latifolia populations in different lake types were recommended.},

Abstract = {Growing demand for water, as a consequence of population growth, farmland irrigation, and industrial expansion, results in groundwater resources exploitation. This, in combination with droughts induced by climate change, has caused a sharp drop in groundwater levels throughout arid and semiarid countries. In Iran, all these factors are resulting in alarming water scarcity. Appropriate management and control of existing water resources can overcome water shortages, with healthy and sustainable management of groundwater as one of the most efficient tools. Artificial recharge of aquifers can be used to replenish water supplies and restore the water resources in Iran and other semiarid and arid countries, but selection of the right location for runoff collection is essential to achieve success. Precipitation, slope, geology, lineament density, drainage density, aquifer water quality, groundwater level, vegetation, and land use were selected in this study as key factors in locating suitable sites for artificial recharge. The weight of each, in terms of importance and impact on aquifer recharge, was determined using remote sensing techniques to prepare layers and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Boolean logic to identify the optimal weight for each factor. Geographic information system (GIS) was used for modeling, applying the weight of each criterion, and producing a final map. The results showed better performance of AHP than Boolean logic. For artificial recharge, 9.9\% of the total study area (Mahdishahr in northern Iran) was found to be in a very good position and 22.6\% in a good position. On filtering the privacy layer of fountains and aqueducts, the very good and good area declined to 8.4\% and 14.7\% of the total area, respectively, and mainly comprised alluvial valleys and coarse alluvial sediments with low slope and drainage density.},

Title = {Remote Sensing-Based Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Water Colour Variations in Baiyangdian Lake after the Establishment of the Xiong'an New Area},

Abstract = {The Forel-Ule Index (FUI) is an important parameter that can be calculated from optical remote sensing data to assess water quality based on water colour. Using Sentinel-2 images from April to November within the 2016-2020 period coupled with the Google Earth Engine Platform, we calculated FUI to analyse the spatial distribution, seasonal variations, and inter-annual variations of water colour in Baiyangdian Lake in the Xiong'an New Area established on 1 April 2017. The lake was divided into seven sub-regions, A-G; subsequently, high and low FUI values were observed in the south and north, respectively. Additionally, the mean FUI values of G and F zones in the south were 11.9 and 12.7, respectively, whereas those for the A, B, C, D, and E zones in the north were 10.5, 9.8, 10.4, 11.1, 11.2, respectively. The seasonal variations in the Baiyangdian Lake and seven sub-regions were consistent, with turbid water in spring and autumn, and clear water in summer. Inter-annual variations analyses for 2016-2020 indicated that the zone of A became progressively turbid, whereas the B, C, D, E, F, and G zones exhibited slow and gradually decreasing trends. Our findings suggest that the overall water quality of Baiyangdian Lake may be better, which may be related to the governance policies of the region.},

Abstract = {The Center for Hydrology, Soil Climatology, and Remote Sensing (HSCaRS) at Alabama A\&M University has conducted a research project, funded by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), for monitoring ground water quality with regards to agrochemicals in four counties in north Alabama. In this project, the latest GPS and desktop GIS, as well as Windows technology have been employed for locating, mapping the sample sites, and presenting the results interactively using desktops. A Motorola GPS system provided by GeoResearch Inc. (Billings, Montana), ArcView 2.1 and MapObjects from ESRI: (Redlands, California), and Visual Basic 4.0 from Microsoft (Redmond, Washington) were used. The GPS system includes two precision 8 channel GPS receivers with carrier phase measurement capability. With two GPS receivers, post-differential correction was performed over all GPS field data to ensure accuracy. The initial GPS files were exported into text files and translated into ArcView shape files. Within the ArcView environment, a gee-database, which contained shape files for all GPS points and base maps for the four counties, was built. Thematic mapping was performed by using attributes of water quality and hard-copy maps were generated. Furthermore, an easy to use GIS program was developed with VB 4.0 and MapObjects. With this program, one could display and search sample sites and their water quality interactively. The integration of GPS, GIS, and Windows technology in this project was successful. Enormous man power was saved by establishing automatic procedures for data capture, data conversion, and map manipulation.},

Abstract = {Most remote sensing algorithms for phytoplankton in inland waters aim at the retrieval of the pigment chlorophyll a (Chl a), as this pigment is a useful proxy for phytoplankton biomass. More recently, algorithms have been developed to quantify the pigment phycocyanin (PC), which is characteristic of cyanobacteria, a phytoplankton group of relative importance to inland water management due to their negative impact on water quality in response to eutrophication. We evaluated the accuracy of three published algorithms for the remote sensing of PC in inland waters, using an extensive database of field radiometric and pigment data obtained in the Netherlands and Spain in the period 2001-2005. The three algorithms (a baseline, single band ratio, and a nested band ratio approach) all target the PC absorption effect observed in reflectance spectra in the 620 nm region. We evaluated the sensitivity of the algorithms to errors in reflectance measurements and investigated their performance in cyanobacteria-dominated water bodies as well as in the presence of other phytoplankton pigments. All algorithms performed best in moderate to high PC concentrations (50-200 mg m(-3)) and showed the most linear response to increasing PC in cyanobacteria-dominated waters. The highest errors showed at PC<50 mg m(-3). In eutrophic waters, the presence of other pigments explained a tendency to overestimate the PC concentration. In oligotrophic waters, negative PC predictions were observed. At very high concentrations (PC>200 mg m(-3)), PC underestimations by the baseline and single band ratio algorithms were attributed to a non-linear relationship between PC and absorption in the 620 nm region. The nested band ratio gave the overall best fit between predicted and measured PC. For the Spanish dataset, a stable ratio of PC over cyanobacterial Chl a was observed, suggesting that PC is indeed a good proxy for cyanobacterial biomass. The single reflectance ratio was the only algorithm insensitive to changes in the amplitude of reflectance spectra, which were observed as a result of different measurement methodologies.

Abstract = {Environment transformation is inevitable in the coastal lands of eastern China. It is a land characterized by rapid urbanization, which requires an objective method to evaluate environmental quality (EQ). In this study, a remote sensing-based theoretical research framework was used to create a synthetic remote sensing environmental index (RSEI). Then, spatio-temporal characteristics and transformation of EQ were evaluated by applying the RSEI to the coastal lands of Hangzhou Bay. Results demonstrated that: (1) the background value of the RSEI remained stable, but the standard deviation of the RSEI increased from 0.227 to 0.268 from 2000 to 2015; (2) the overall structure of EQ became polarized such that the two extreme grades (excellent and poor) increased by 13.000\%; and (3) the lands where prominent EQ changes occurred were in Yinzhou (improvement) and Pinghu (degradation) in Hangzhou Bay.},

Abstract = {China has experienced a rapid urbanisation, especially since the 1980s; however, the environmental impacts of this process are not fully investigated. Hanyang (Hubei Province, south China) was selected as a typical case to investigate runoff and non-point source (NPS) pollution impacts of urbanisation. A water quality simulation model (L-THIA) was applied to determine the long-term implications of different degrees of regional urbanisation impacts on NPS pollutants. Land-use patterns in 1987, 1998 and 2003 were analysed to evaluate the temporal variation of urbanisation, and the precipitation dataset from 1975 to 2003 was used to estimate the mean annual runoff and NPS pollutants. The contributions of different land-use categories to average annual runoff and NPS pollutant production were assessed by the means of a regression model. Results show that urban/impervious lands increased by 30.4\% between 1987 and 2003, with the most increase occurring in 1998-2003. Industrial and forestlands have the most and least impact, respectively, on mean annual runoff and NPS pollutants. A combination of L-THIA and the regression model was found to be useful as a decision support tool for regional and urban planning from the perspectives of water quality control.},

Abstract = {Research on the consistency of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration retrieved from multisource satellite sensors can serve as long-time monitoring of water quality. To explore the influence of the atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm and the retrieval model on the consistency of the SPM concentration values, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) images acquired on the same day are used to compare the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) SPM retrieval values in two high-turbidity lakes. An SPM retrieval model for Shengjin Lake is established based on field measurements and applied to OLI and MSI images: two SPM concentration products are highly consistent (R-2 = 0.93, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 20.67 mg/L, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 6.59\%), and the desired results are also obtained in Chaohu Lake. Among the four AC algorithms (Management Unit of the North Seas Mathematical Models (MUMM), Atmospheric Correction for OLI'lite'(ACOLITE), Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S), Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code \& Sen2cor (LaSRC \& Sen2cor)), the two Rrs products, as well as the final SPM concentration products retrieved from OLI and MSI images, have the best consistency when using the MUMM algorithm in SeaWIFS Data Analyst System (SeaDAS) software. The consistency of SPM concentration values retrieved from OLI and MSI images using the same model or same form of models is significantly better than that retrieved by applying the optimal models with different forms.},

Abstract = {The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is composed of diverse component systems contributed by members and participating organizations of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). To enable these diverse components to interoperate, the GEOSS Architecture embodies principles given in the GEOSS 10-Year Implementation Plan and Reference Document. A basic principle is adoption of international standards and common interoperability arrangements, as seen in the contributed facility known as GEOSS Clearinghouse. GEOSS Clearinghouse acts as a cross-cutting discovery tool, encompassing all registered GEOSS components and external catalogs as well. Together, the GEOSS Architecture and GEOSS Clearinghouse enable GEO members and participating organizations to cooperate in realizing GEOSS. The resulting system of systems is simplifying access to resources for any and all users, including decision makers across the GEO Societal Benefit Areas. This paper explains key GEOSS Architecture principles and how GEOSS Clearinghouse applies international standards and interoperability arrangements.},

Title = {Soil Moisture Inversion Based on Data Augmentation Method Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important land environment characteristic that connects agriculture, ecology, and hydrology. Surface soil moisture (SSM) prediction can be used to plan irrigation, monitor water quality, manage water resources, and estimate agricultural production. Multi-source remote sensing is a crucial tool for assessing SSM in agricultural areas. The field-measured SSM sample data are required in model building and accuracy assessment of SSM inversion using remote sensing data. When the SSM samples are insufficient, the SSM inversion accuracy is severely affected. An SSM inversion method suitable for a small sample size was proposed. The alpha approximation method was employed to expand the measured SSM samples to offer more training data for SSM inversion models. Then, feature parameters were extracted from Sentinel-1 microwave and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, and optimized using three methods, which were Pearson correlation analysis, random forest (RF), and principal component analysis. Then, three common machine learning models suitable for small sample training, which were RF, support vector regression, and genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, were built to retrieve SSM. Comparison experiments were carried out between various feature optimization methods and machine learning models. The experimental results showed that after sample augmentation, SSM inversion accuracy was enhanced, and the combination of utilizing RF for feature screening and RF for SSM inversion had a higher accuracy, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7256, a root mean square error of 0.0539 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error of 0.0422 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed method was finally used to invert the regional SSM of the study area. The inversion results indicated that the proposed method had good performance in regional applications with a small sample size.},

Abstract = {The irregular monsoonal rainfall and overexploitation of groundwater have resulted in the sharp decline of water resources in different parts across India. Various factors like geology, terrain morphology, hydrology, and hydrometeorology influence the recharge potentiality of a region. Application of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) tools might be effective in the delineation of groundwater recharge potential zones and help towards the sustainability of groundwater resources. In this study, it was attempted to identify the groundwater recharge potential zones in the Courtallam region located at Tamil Nadu state of South India by integrating multiple thematic layers involving lithology, geomorphology, land use/land cover, slope, lineament density, drainage density, and the spatial distribution of groundwater level and rainfall through weighted overlay analysis in Arc GIS. The recharge potential was compared with the electrical conductivity of groundwater for evaluating the water quality. It was characterized the groundwater recharge potential of the study area as very poor (8.7\%), poor (32.5\%), moderate (37\%), good (16.3\%), and very good (5.5\%). one-third of this area has moderate groundwater recharge potentiality and the southeastern part of the study area with good quality of water is feasible for new bore-well construction.},

Abstract = {The monitoring of environmental parameters is indispensable for controlling mosquito populations. The abundance of mosquitoes mainly depends on climate conditions, weather and water (i.e., physicochemical parameters). Traditional techniques for immature mosquito surveillance are based on remote sensing and weather stations as primary data sources for environmental variables, as well as water samples which are collected in the field by environmental health agents to characterize water quality impacts. Such tools may lead to misidentifications, especially when comprehensive surveillance is required. Innovative methods for timely and continuous monitoring are crucial for improving the mosquito surveillance system, thus, increasing the efficiency of mosquitoes' abundance models and providing real-time prediction of high-risk areas for mosquito infestation and breeding. Here, we illustrate the design, implementation, and deployment of a novel IoT-based environment monitoring system using a combination of weather and water sensors with a real-time connection to the cloud for data transmission in Madeira Island, Portugal. The study provides an approach to monitoring some environmental parameters, such as weather and water, that are related to mosquito infestation at a fine spatiotemporal scale. Our study demonstrates how a combination of sensor networks and clouds can be used to create a smart and fully autonomous system to support mosquito surveillance and enhance the decision-making of local environmental agents.},

Abstract = {Quantifying the effect of non-point source pollution from different land use types (e.g., agricultural lands, pastures, orchards, and urban areas) on stream water quality is critical in determining the extent and type of land use. The relationship between surface water quality as the primary source of drinking water and land use patterns in suburban areas with an accelerated pace of industrial development and progressive growth of population has drawn much attention recently. This study aims to determine the type and portion of the land use changes over three-time intervals from 2000 to 2015 in the Jajrood River Catchment (Tehran metropolis, north of Iran). We used satellite images of Landsat TM and ETM for 2005, 2010, and 2015 to analyze land use changes as a spatiotemporal model. According to the image processing and analysis, we classified the land uses of the study area into irrigated farming, orchards, pastures, and residential areas. In addition, we used temporal data from sampling stations to identify the relationship between land use and water quality based on a multivariate regression model. The analysis shows a significant correlation between the type and extent of land use and water quality parameters, including pH, Na+, Ca+, Mg+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, and TDS. Pastures and residential areas had the highest impact on water quality parameters among all land use types. Besides, we have used the regression analysis results to determine the maximum permissible areas of each land use type. Consequently, effective management strategies such as land use optimization in catchment scale for this catchment and similar areas will help to consciously protect and manage the quality of drinking water resources.},

Abstract = {Trophic structure deterioration in continental water bodies (lakes and damps) has been a growing problem during the last years. Numerous factors, either natural or man-made contribute in value increments of various water quality indexes ranging toward eutrophication. Our study had objective to use remote sensing as complementary tool to study the spatial distribution and dynamics of Lake Vichuquen water quality parameters in two seasons of 2016 through the use of two satellite images of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor, with in situ and laboratory data. The Chl-a and Z(SD) parameters were estimated from multiple linear regression models. The results indicate that the trophic state of Lake Vichuquen corresponds to a eutrophic level in summer and mesotrophic in autumn. The laboratory analyzes establish for the summer and autumn season that the Chl-a data oscillate between 14.1 and 5.5 mu g/l and for the Z(SD) between 3.7 and 2.5 m respectively. The increase in the levels of eutrophication of Lake Vichuquen is influenced in the first place by the seasonality and secondly by the different land uses that accelerate this type of processes; such as the plantations of radiata pine and eucalyptus, the agricultural activities and the urban areas surrounding the lake. The mean square error for each variable and each season varied in Chl-a in summer and another year 0.74 and 0.01 mu g/l and Z(SD) 0.16 m respectively.},

Abstract = {Mangroves store significant carbon content that, when managed properly, will contribute to combating the climate crisis. Despite having the largest mangrove forest, Indonesia's mangrove annual damage rate turns out to be the highest globally, one of the most significant factors is extensive plastic waste exposure, exacerbated by mangroves' deforestation for conversion into agricultural land. Many efforts initiated by the government and other stakeholders have been targeting mangrove rehabilitation and plastic waste abatement. Labor-intensive and time-consuming ground checking have been the main source of information to determine priority areas for mangrove rehabilitation so far. This study aims to introduce a more effective and efficient identification of priority areas for rehabilitation. The study utilizes vulnerability index by optimizing remote sensing satellite data modeling. The study covers all mangroves in Indonesia, and for the purpose of this study, four mangrove vulnerability classes are formed to help categorize the severity of the damage. The classes are formed through integration, scoring, and classifying plant health, water turbidity, land temperature, plant carbon sequestration capability, and plastic waste distribution in Indonesian coastal area data. The modeling demonstrates its ability to distinguish the classes through machine learning. This study identifies that 65.74\% of Indonesia's coastal mangroves are highly exposed to plastic waste. Bali and Surabaya are two of the most severely damaged areas. This study, along with further analysis of socio-cultural, economic, and development priorities, will enable decision-makers to prioritize and mobilize necessary resources to rehabilitate the mangroves guided by a suitable mangrove management regime for each class.},

Title = {Forecasting models for surface water quality using predictive analytics},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 7},
Abstract = {Modeling surface water quality has become crucial in providing better strategies for managing surface water resources, and adequate findings need accurate and geographically dispersed data. Hydrogeological modeling of these data sets is possible using empirically-based models. The other statistical models are also an alternative approach. In this study, a process with maximum probability is considered with the help of machine learning tools (MLT) to have optimized and valid output. The proposed method combines remote sensing and geographic information systems (RS and GIS) and MLT, which are appropriate for the predicament of neither small, large scale, nor long-term simulations. MLT methods such as VAR and ARIMA are developed in the Python programming with Jupyter notebook and tested according to the data in the spatial prediction for surface water quality parameters such as Tr, pH, Ec, TDS, AL, Ca++, NO3-, So, Cl, F-, Fe, and Mg2+ in the Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India-lower delta part. The delta with susceptible zones was identified using RS and GIS as those areas are prone to direct exposure to surface water contaminants from aquaculture, agricultural runoff, small- and medium-scale businesses, and household trash. Achieving effective surface water management for this ecosystem is critical for regional water management. The geographical information about the concentrations acquired via the RS and GIS was compared to the statistical modeling findings and verified using real-time measurements. MLT modeling seems more realistic than the experimental setting; data from the previous 20 years (2000-2020) were used for modeling, and the predicted values presented in the paper are predicted for the year 2021. The computed R-2 value of ranges between 0.75 and 0.96\% is recorded with ARIMA, and VAR posted range between 0.56 and 0.75\% with the trained and tested data. The findings show the potential for MLT of geographically dispersed hydrogeological data to be used for pollution-free surface water management. From the surface water management perspective, combining RS and GIS and MLT offers an alternate data analysis approach for obtaining quick results utilizing a less laborious process that produces acceptable results.},

Abstract = {Ecological environment quality assessment (EEQ) is an important parameter for sustainable development and sometimes it's more valuable during industrialization and urbanization progress of the region. This study compares remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and ecological index (EI) and assesses EEQ with the most popular pressure-state-response (PSR) method based on a set of remote sensing and statistical indexes through a weight system in Samara region Russia. EI and RSEI framed from 15 to and 4 indicators respectively and in the PSR framework natural-human pressure and health state assessed based on 12 and 3 indicators respectively and in the last response index developed from pressure and state indicators. Results indicate that RSEI and EI showed very strong comparability in the ecological sense but EI reflect more effectively EEQ changes than RSEI. Finally this study explores all important effective indicators developed from remote sensing for eco-environment quality assessment, which provide a strong decision making base for sustainable development as well as provide a new and latest technological support for long term comprehensive mapping, monitoring and assessment of environment.},

Title = {Monitoring the ecological state of a hypertrophic lake (Albufera of Valencia, Spain) using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images},

Abstract = {Albufera of Valencia, a hypertrophic lake, has been studied extensively since the 1980s, but the efforts to revert the system to a clear water state have not yielded the expected results because pressure on this system is growing (increase in nutrient-rich water inputs, decrease in precipitation and increase in evaporation). The current state of the lake requires constant monitoring, and one of the main biological parameters used in ecology and water management to monitor and control the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems is chlorophyll a concentration {[}Chl-a]. In this sense, remote sensing is an optimal tool for continuous monitoring of the quality state of the water body through {[}Chl-a] and to obtain a better understanding of its spatial dynamics. This work aims to demonstrate the validity of an algorithm for {[}Chl-a] retrieval from Sentinel-2 (A and B), the new Earth observation satellites of the European Space Agency, with the sensor MSI, multispectral (13 bands) from 404 nm to 2200 nm, a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal frequency of 5 days - values unthinkable until now as regards to open access images. The study was carried out with images from 2016 and 2017, but only 40 images out of the 81 taken by the satellite could be used - such rate was mainly due to unfavourable weather conditions. Once images were downloaded, the SNAP 5 software was used for the processing. Using the Sen2cor tool, they were corrected atmospherically and, with the algorithm developed by Soria et al. 2017, lake {[}Chl-a] was estimated. Estimated data were validated against field samples: a total of 18 sampling campaigns were carried out and 92 samples were taken to measure the {[}Chl-a] . In addition, to better interpret results, data on conductivity and Secchi disk depths measurements were taken in the field and hydrological, precipitation and wind data were also collected. Results of the validation were deemed very good since an R = 0.8 was obtained when applying a linear correlation between field data and estimates, which shows the robustness of the algorithm used. From the interpretation of the thematic maps, it was possible to infer that the temporal evolution in {[}Chl-a] variations follows an annual bimodal pattern, where the decrease in {[}Chl-a] is determined either by a significant increase in water renewal of the lake or by the depletion of the available nutrients in the water due to a previous excessive growth of phytoplankton.},

Abstract = {In recent times, it has become apparent that environmental information systems are useful only if they work with a high resolution in space. Detailed area information is required in order to identify environmental dangers, changes in the ecosystems and for planning of environmental protection or rehabilitation measures. This is also true for hydrological and water management systems dealing with water quantity and water quality. Also, hydrological modeling data sets are needed which are distributed in area, both as input to hydrological models and for determination of parameters of hydrological models. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on hydroecological data sets exposing a high resolution in space. In ecological and hydrological modeling, we need such data sets for many parameters so that the acquisition, storage and retrieval of such data forms a major problem particularly since such multiple data sets are required also in a multi-temporal form The handling of these data sets is reasonably done with the aid of Geographical Geographical information Systems (GIS). Three types of area data with a high resolution in space will be discussed here: a) remote sensing data, b) Digital Elevation Models and c) digitized maps. Examples will be given in the paper for long-term changes in an environmental system for various parameters, e.g. urbanization, forest diseases, and reduction of agricultural areas. Historic changes of such parameters will be demonstrated as well as a method for forecasting changes in these environmental parameters for future conditions. The use of the overlay concept allows merging data from different sources (remote sensing digital maps, Digital Elevation Models) with a high resolution in space. By merging of these different data sets, new information is generated having a new quality for monitoring or modeling environmental systems. Examples of such new products will be shown.},

Title = {Assessment of the SWAT model to simulate a watershed with limited available data in the Pampas region, Argentina},

Abstract = {Argentina has been among the world leaders in the production and export of agricultural products since the 1990s. The Carcarana River Lower Basin (CRLB), a cropland of the Pampas region supplied by extensive rainfall, is located in an area with few streamgauging and other hydrologic/water-quality stations. Therefore, limited hydrologic data are available resulting in limited water-resources assessment. This work explores the application of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to the CRLB in the Santa Fe province of the Pampas region. The analysis of field and remote-sensing data characterizing hydrology, water quality, soil types, land use/land cover, management practices, and crop yield, guarantee a comprehensive SWAT modeling approach. A combined manual and automated calibration and validation process incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is performed using information concerning interior watershed processes. Eleven N/P fertilizer rates are selected to simulate the impact of N fertilizer on crop yield, plant uptake, as well as runoff and leaching losses. Different indices (partial factor productivity, agronomic efficiency, apparent crop recovery efficiency of applied nutrient, internal utilization efficiency, and physiological efficiency) are considered to assess nitrogen-use efficiency. The overall quality of the fit is satisfactory considering the input data limitations. This work provides, for the first time in Argentina, a reliable tool to simulate yield response to soil quality and water availability capable to meet defined environmental targets to support decision making on planning public policies and private activities on the Pampas region.

Abstract = {Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System has been rapidly grown last decade in Taiwan. Remote sensing is a great efficient source in data acquisition and GIS provides a useful tool in data analysis and display. Both technologies have been applied in many fields such as commerce management, environmental monitoring, healthy and safety improvements. However, the rapid technology development is followed by several debated legal issues, especially after the success launch of ROCSAT-II on 21st May, 2004 which, a land observation satellite system, is owned and operated by Taiwan Government. Since most of time the government is the major financial sponsor of remote sensing data, the public pay tax and should have a right of open access to these data banks. There are different points of view about the public access to government-owned geographic databases. Increase of remote sensing data sharing and dissemination benefits the public by an easy access to relevant information. On the contrary, the high-efficient data propagation causes a crisis of the tendency to invasion of personal privacy. Therefore, the tension between data transparency and privacy invasion is raised recently. Thus, the public access policy of remote sensing data in Taiwan should be revised immediately based on the consideration of the entire social effect. This paper addresses and discusses several legal issues about the public access to remote sensing data, including copyright, open record law, and privacy law. The legal development in the United States is also reviewed to provide an experience for Taiwan's regulation.},

Title = {An inventory and typology of permanent floodplain lakes in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley: a first step to conservation planning},
Journal = {AQUATIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The alluvial valley of the Mississippi River is an extensive area harboring hundreds of lakes created by fluvial dynamics. These floodplain lakes are scattered throughout the valley and carved over thousands of years by shifting river courses and other hydro-fluvial processes associated with contemporary and prehistoric rivers. These lakes have significant ecological importance as they support a large component of North American biodiversity. We used remote sensing to catalog lakes, to characterize morphology, and to construct a typology via cluster analysis. We identified over 1300 permanent lakes totaling over 100,000 ha. The lakes were classified into 12 types according to lake size, shape, depth, connectivity, inundation frequency, and surrounding landcover. We anticipate that biotic characteristics differ among the 12 types, but large-scale systematic analyses of biotic assemblages of floodplain lakes in the region are mostly absent. Our typology can provide the framework essential for organizing research to define water dynamics, water quality, and ecological conditions such as forests, mussel, fish, and avian communities to construct conservation plans. The typology encourages a large-scale view of the properties of floodplain lakes in the alluvial valley. It is a functional tool that can be used to begin identifying conservation and research needs, adapt monitoring and management programs, customize environmental programs, and use conservation resources more effectively to achieve large-scale management objectives.},

Abstract = {Sustainable development associated with the agricultural field of Arequipa, a region in economic growth, is vulnerable to contamination of water resources, putting production systems and food security at risk. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automated system to control, management, and monitor this vital resource. The proposed work proposed a system to measure water quality monitoring in reservoirs and lakes with high accurate related to global positioning. It includes an embedded computer, multiparameter sonde, and an additional dual GNSS/INS in hardware architecture. The software architecture is fully open-source with compatibility, modularity, and interoperability features between Python and MySQL, allowing data management for real-time data in visual interface on a platform that stores unlimited data logging, monitors and analyzes. The proposed system is validated in an experimental test that measures the water quality of a huge agricultural reservoir, where certified instrumentation is mandatory, as compared to other methods used locally for this action.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},

Abstract = {The knowledge on urban ecosystem dynamics is being increasingly felt due to unprecedented symptoms arising out of urbanization. This study is aimed to assess land use-land cover changes (LULCCs) around a wetland ecosystem using high spatial resolution CORONA and Google Basemap satellite imageries. The imageries were processed by digitizing land cover features at 1:3000 scale in ArcGIS 10.1. The imageries were classified into nine classes, and an estimation of accuracy was performed utilizing the Kappa coefficient and error matrices. The overall accuracy obtained was 94\% for the 2017 dataset. The key findings indicated a loss of 23\% in the wetland area from 1980 to 2017. While in the vicinity, a significant increase in green spaces (706.2\%) and roads (89.4\%) was observed. Morphometric analysis revealed that the wetland has lost a surface area of 10.2 ha from 1980 to 2017. The maximum length (L-max) of the wetland was reduced by 722 m while the maximum width (W-max) decreased by 78 m. Bathymetric analysis revealed that the wetland is shallow with a depth ranging from 10 to 174 cm. The Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI) of wetland ranging from 74 to 87 indicates hyper-eutrophic waters. Overall, the loss of wetland area, together with the reduction in morphometric features, low depth, and higher trophic status speak of anthropogenic pressures that are compromising the ecological integrity of this wetland. Therefore, landscape planning and governance are of pivotal importance for the conservation and management of wetland ecosystems in this region.},

Title = {Remote sensing of coastal interactions in the Mediterranean region},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {217-233},
Abstract = {The coastal regions of the Mediterranean are the site of countless economic and recreational activities, but are threatened by dramatic dangers of misuse and pollution. Adequate tools are needed to study the environmental pressure imposed on these regions by the conflicting needs of protecting their ecological balance and exploiting their natural resources. Coastal ecosystems are very sensitive to the environmental impact of land use in watersheds, along the coast and further inland, of fluvial discharges, and of marine processes. Weathering, erosion, or waste disposal on land, as well as other activities at sea, such as shipping, dumping or oil extraction, are but a few of the factors which would require that the coastal areas be suitably monitored. Modern techniques of environmental assessment call for the rise of integrated observation systems. The collection of data with traditional coastal installations remains an important component of such research. However, the large space scales and short time scales of many near-coastal and/or marine processes require the use of (orbital) remote sensors. In particular, optical sensors, operating in the visible/infrared spectral region, have shown their usefulness for providing novel information on physical, gee-chemical and biological processes of the coastal area. Optical remote sensing of the coastal zone finds applications in studies of land use, surface cover, hydrology and coastal ecology at large; of water quality and sediment transport, coastal runoff and circulation, or dynamical processes (looking, e.g., at the evolution of pigment and/or temperature patterns, and their distribution as related to plankton dynamics, currents or river plumes); as well as in those of energy transfer, carbon cycling and climatology in general. Selected applications of optical observation techniques in the Mediterranean region, conducted in the framework of international demonstration programmes (i.e. the Ocean Colour European Archive Network, OCEAN, Project), provide examples of the remote sensing potential in the field of integrated coastal/marine environmental management.

Abstract = {Fowler's Sneaker Depth (FSD), analogous to the well known Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)), is a visually discerned citizen scientist metric used to assess water clarity in the Patuxent River estuary. In this study, a simple remote sensing algorithm was developed to derive FSD from space-borne spectroradiometric imagery. An empirical model was formed that estimates FSD from red-end remote sensing reflectances at 645 nm, R-rs(645). The model is based on a hyperbolic function relating water clarity to Rrs(645) that was established using radiative transfer modeling and fine tuned using in-water FSD measurements and coincident Rrs(645) data observed by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua spacecraft (MODISA). The resultant FSD algorithm was applied to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager data to derive a short time-series for the Patuxent River estuary from January 2015 to June 2016. Satellite-derived FSD had an inverse, statistically significant relationship (p<0.005) with total suspended sediment concentration (TSS). Further, a distinct negative relationship between FSD and chlorophyll concentration was discerned during periods of high biomass (> 4 mu g L-1). The complex nature of water quality in the mid-toupper Chesapeake Bay was captured using a MODISA-based FSD time series (2002-2016). This study demonstrates how a citizen scientist-conceived observation can be coupled with remote sensing. With further refinement and validation, the FSD may be a useful tool for delivering scientifically relevant results and for informing and engaging local stakeholders and policy makers.

Abstract = {Inland and coastal waterbodies are critical components of the global biosphere. Timely monitoring is necessary to enhance our understanding of their functions, the drivers impacting on these functions and to deliver more effective management. The ability to observe waterbodies from space has led to Earth observation (EO) becoming established as an important source of information on water quality and ecosystem condition. However, progress toward a globally valid EO approach is still largely hampered by inconsistences over temporally and spatially variable in-water optical conditions. In this study, a comprehensive dataset from more than 250 aquatic systems, representing a wide range of conditions, was analyzed in order to develop a typology of optical water types (OWTs) for inland and coastal waters. We introduce a novel approach for clustering in situ hyperspectral water reflectance measurements (n = 4045) from multiple sources based on a functional data analysis. The resulting classification algorithm identified 13 spectrally distinct clusters of measurements in inland waters, and a further nine clusters from the marine environment. The distinction and characterization of OWTs was supported by the availability of a wide range of coincident data on biogeochemical and inherent optical properties from inland waters. Phylogenetic trees based on the shapes of cluster means were constructed to identify similarities among the derived clusters with respect to spectral diversity. This typification provides a valuable framework for a globally applicable EO scheme and the design of future EO missions.},

Abstract = {In the recent past, Pakistan's economy has suffered due to a shortage of electric power. To shorten the production and demand gap, coal reserves in the Thar region of Pakistan are being utilized. During the process of mining, a huge quantity of saline water is being pumped from the mining site to a natural depression called Gorano Dam. This study examines the impact of saline water on land cover in the area. Two scenarios including pre-disposal conditions (February 2017) and existing conditions (February 2020) were compared. Sentinel-II images with a spatial resolution of 10 m were classified using the maximum likelihood supervised classification method. This study also determines the spatial and temporal variation of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the Gorano Dam. Water quality samples were collected to measure TDS. Landsat 8 OLI images were used to develop a linear regression equation between Band 5 reflectance and TDS measurements. Using the regression model, spatiotemporal maps of TDS were developed. The results revealed that the area covered by water in February 2020 was 1,233,100 m(2). After the creation of the dam, the area covered by barren land has decreased from 4,592,100 to 4,134,900 m(2) (9.96\% decrease), and the area covered by vegetation has decreased from 3,682,400 to 1,906,500 m(2) (48.23\% decrease). The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the multiple regression equation was 0.846. The study will help to understand the impacts of Gorano Dam on the land cover of the area and temporal change in TDS of the dam.},

Abstract = {P>1. This study evaluates the efficacy of remote sensing technology to monitor species composition, areal extent and density of aquatic plants (macrophytes and filamentous algae) in impoundments where their presence may violate water-quality standards. 2. Multispectral satellite (IKONOS) images and more than 500 in situ hyperspectral samples were acquired to map aquatic plant distributions. By analyzing field measurements, we created a library of hyperspectral signatures for a variety of aquatic plant species, associations and densities. We also used three vegetation indices. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), near-infrared (NIR)-Green Angle Index (NGAI) and normalized water absorption depth (D-H)(,) at wavelengths 554, 680, 820 and 977 nm to differentiate among aquatic plant species composition, areal density and thickness in cases where hyperspectral analysis yielded potentially ambiguous interpretations. 3. We compared the NDVI derived from IKONOS imagery with the in situ, hyperspectral-derived NDVI. The IKONOS-based images were also compared to data obtained through routine visual observations. Our results confirmed that aquatic species composition alters spectral signatures and affects the accuracy of remote sensing of aquatic plant density. The results also demonstrated that the NGAI has apparent advantages in estimating density over the NDVI and the D-H. 4. In the feature space of the three indices, 3D scatter plot analysis revealed that hyperspectral data can differentiate several aquatic plant associations. High-resolution multispectral imagery provided useful information to distinguish among biophysical aquatic plant characteristics. Classification analysis indicated that using satellite imagery to assess Lemna coverage yielded an overall agreement of 79\% with visual observations and > 90\% agreement for the densest aquatic plant coverages. 5. Interpretation of biophysical parameters derived from high-resolution satellite or airborne imagery should prove to be a valuable approach for assessing the effectiveness of management practices for controlling aquatic plant growth in inland waters, as well as for routine monitoring of aquatic plants in lakes and suitable lentic environments.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease (HFMD) has brought a serious threat to people's health. There is no research considering both the natural and social environment to study the outbreak and propagation of HFMD quantitatively by now. In this study, we acquired environmental impact factors of HFMD using remote sensing and GIS. Then we analyzed the relationship between density of HFMD cases and environmental impact factors for year 2009 in Shenzhen. It was found that density of HFMD cases was significantly associated with population density, hospital density, road density, annual average of aerosol optical depth, and annual average of normalized difference vegetation index. A linear regression model was constructed with the R-2 value of 0.677 using environmental impact factors, and both hospital density and annual average of aerosol optical depth were included in the model.},

Title = {Razzaza Lake, a natural water body: its hydraulic characteristics and water quality},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Razzaza Lake is a depression that has been used for water storage created by the water management system in Iraq. This research examines the hydraulics characteristics and water quality of Razzaza Lake for the period 2006-2020. The hydraulic characteristics of Razzaza Lake are concerned with the quantity of Razzaza Lake storage and water level fluctuations, whilst the quality of water is concerned with the total dissolved salts (TDS), hardness of water, chlorides (Cl-) and sulfates (SO4-2). Results provide invaluable information on the water level. The monthly discharge inflow to the lake through the study period is found to be 15 m(3)/sec, which is less than the minimum designed inflow discharge of 100 m(3)/sec of the lake. This phenomenon reduced the water level from the annual average of 23.05 to 20.81 m.a.s.l. during the studied period and caused a decrease in the average annual capacity storage of the lake from 2.418 x 10(9) to 1.042 x 10(9) m(3) and shrinkage in the top surface area from 742.55 x 10(6) to 483.66 x 10(6) m(2). Results of water quality showed that the annual TDS is 11435 ppm; hardness of water is 4617.08 ppm; Cl- is 3713.58 ppm and SO4-2 is 2,951.25 ppm with extremely high rates according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study yields logical results which attributed to low rates of inflow discharges to Razzaza Lake, high rates of evaporation of 6.5 cm/month and due to low rates of rainfall for the studied period.},

Abstract = {Smart monitoring, planning and decision making for projects in the coastal and nearshore regions requires spatial and temporal understanding on the environmental parameters. Very often time and budget constraints preclude a comprehensive physical and environmental survey data collection exercise. Bathymetry, for example, is typically valid for one timestamp (during the period of data collection), one-dimensional (e.g. single beam surveys), and has sparse resolution in the shallow nearshore regions. In recent years, significant advances in satellite sensor technology and analysis have been developed to produce relevant information for coastal and nearshore monitoring applications at a fraction of both the time and cost of traditional methods. Aquatic Earth Observation techniques have been evolving since the 1970s. The recent advances on satellite sensor hardware and analytics have allowed the once crude methodology to be efficiently applied into practice - in particular very high-resolution satellite data availability and the sound understanding on the physical modelling of the light path from the surface/seafloor to the sensor. Applying over 20 years of continuous research and development, EOMAP has advanced a unique physics-based procedure which allows mapping of shallow water bathymetry, water quality parameters, seafloor characteristics and topography in dense spatial grids. Uncertainties in Earth Observation products are subject to a number of environmental factors that need to be accounted for. At the core of the technology are state-of-the-art algorithms for extracting quantitative environmental information from the aquatic remote sensing signal. Mechanisms for quantifying uncertainties and flagging relative reliabilities are embedded in the algorithms, which include: (1) allowance for coupled atmospheric and in-water parameter retrievals, which includes a correction of the (terrestrial) adjacency effect, critical for the accurate remote sensing of any coastal or inland water body, (2) a physically accurate implementation of the bi-directional effect inside the water column, at the water surface and in the atmosphere, (3) accounting for the full range of reflecting, absorbing and scattering properties of the water body and the interfaces. Those procedures are included in EOMAP's Watcor-X physics-based Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) software. This paper provides an overview of SDB, demonstrates successful project applications, and describe tools that support coastal and nearshore monitoring projects through the use of the software in the Pacific, Caribbean Sea and Arabian waters. We showcase the capability to monitor spatial seabed changes in highly dynamic environments, and demonstrate the latest technology that jointly incorporates the passive multispectral satellite imagery with complementary active Satellite- Lidar bathymetric data technology using NASA's ICESAT-2 Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) sensor.},

Abstract = {In the United States, many state and federally funded conservation programs are required to quantify the water quality benefits resulting from their efforts. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of conservation practices subsidized by the Oklahoma Conservation Commission on phosphorus and sediment loads to Lake Wister. Conservation practices designed to increase vegetative cover in grazed pastures were evaluated using Landsat imagery and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Several vegetative indices were derived from Landsat imagery captured before and after the implementation of conservation practices. Collectively, these indicators provided an estimate of the change in vegetative soil cover attributable to conservation practices in treated fields. Field characteristics, management, and changes in vegetative cover were used in the SWAT model to simulate sediment and phosphorus losses before and after practice implementation. Overall, these conservation practices yielded a 1.9\% improvement in vegetative cover and a predicted sediment load reduction of 3.5\%. Changes in phosphorus load ranged from a 1.0\% improvement to a 3.5\% increase, depending upon initial vegetative conditions. The use of fertilizers containing phosphorus as a conservation practice in low-productivity pastures was predicted by SWAT to increase net phosphorus losses despite any improvement in vegetative cover. This combination of vegetative cover analysis and hydrologic simulation was a useful tool for evaluating the effects of conservation practices at the basin scale and may provide guidance for the selection of conservation measures subsidized in future conservation programs.},

Title = {Remote Estimation of Water Clarity and Suspended Particulate Matter in Qinghai Lake from 2001 to 2020 Using MODIS Images},

Abstract = {Climate change and human activities have been heavily affecting oceanic and inland waters, and it is critical to have a comprehensive understanding of the aquatic optical properties of lakes. Since many key watercolor parameters of Qinghai Lake are not yet available, this paper aims to study the spatial and temporal variations of the water clarity (i.e., Secchi-disk depth, Z(SD)) and suspended particulate matter concentration (CSPM) in Qinghai Lake from 2001 to 2020 using MODIS images. First, the four atmospheric correction models, including the NIR-SWIR, MUMM, POLYMER, and C2RCC were tested. The NIR-SWIR with decent accuracy in all bands was chosen for the experiment. Then, four existing models for Z(SD) and six models for C-SPM were evaluated. Two semi-analytical models proposed by Lee (2015) and Jiang (2021) were selected for Z(SD) (R-2 = 0.74) and C-SPM (R-2 = 0.73), respectively. Finally, the distribution and variation of the Z(SD) and C-SPM were derived over the past 20 years. Overall, the water of Qinghai Lake is quite clear: the monthly mean Z(SD) is 5.34 +/- 1.33 m, and C-SPM is 2.05 +/- 1.22 mg/L. Further analytical results reveal that the Z(SD) and C-SPM are highly correlated, and the relationship can be formulated with Z(SD)=8.072e(-0.212)C(SPM) (R-2 = 0.65). Moreover, turbid water mainly exists along the edge of Qinghai Lake, especially on the northwestern and northeastern shores. The variation in the lakeshore exhibits some irregularity, while the main area of the lake experiences mild water quality deterioration. Statistically, 81.67\% of the total area is dominated by constantly increased C-SPM, and the area with decreased C-SPM occupies 4.56\%. There has been distinct seasonal water quality deterioration in the non-frozen period (from May to October). The water quality broadly deteriorated from 2001 to 2008. The year 2008 witnessed a sudden distinct improvement, and after that, the water quality experienced an extremely inconspicuous degradation. This study can fill the gap regarding the long-time monitoring of water clarity and total suspended matter in Qinghai Lake and is expected to provide a scientific reference for the protection and management of the lake.},

Abstract = {The study area covers 1871 km(2) is located in the upstream of Oum Er-Rbia river basin, between latitudes 33 degrees and 34 degrees North, and longitudes 4 degrees 30' and 5 degrees 20' East. Watersheds prioritization based on morphometric parameters through the analysis of linear, areal and relief aspects is necessary in order to develop a sustainable watersheds management plan. The High Oum Er-Rbia basin has been subdivided into 17 sub-watersheds using remote sensing data (Aster-DEM) and Geographic Information System. For prioritization of sub-watersheds. The Multi-Criteria Analysis through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), were applied to determine the relative weights of various parameters. Linear parameters; such as bifurcation ratio (Rb), drainage density (Dd), stream frequency (Fs), drainage texture (Dt), and shape parameters such as form factor (Rf), shape basin (Bs), elongation ratio (Re), compactness constant (Cc), and circularity ratio (Rc). The present study is an attempt to use TOPSIS approach based morphometric indices for prioritization of watersheds for water and soil resources conservation and management. The results show that sub-watersheds 2 and 6 have been ranked 1 and 2 assigned to highest closeness (C-i(+)) to ideal solution with 0.6838 and 0.6788 respectively. These sub-watersheds must be given the highest priority for soil and water conservation measures, to insure future sustainable agriculture, water quality and to prevent silting of Ahmed El-Hansali Dam.},

Abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in water-quality management is to understand the many complex interactions between landscape structure and nutrient transport. This study analysed the relationship between the inter-annual vegetation phenologies and seasonal change of water quality in the Choptank Basin, a typical agricultural tributary of the Chesapeake Bay (along the east coast of USA), using blended images from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Cross-Correlogram Spectral Matching (CCSM) was applied to explain the correlation between seasonal nitrate discharge and phenologies of different crop types as well as forest. Nitrate discharges from forest-dominated watersheds are reduced as the forest greens up with an increasing percentage above the predefined enhanced vegetation index (EVI) threshold values. The crop-dominant watersheds have higher correlations than the forest-dominant watersheds between seasonal nitrate discharge and vegetation phenologies. The correlations between seasonal water quality and vegetation phenology in forest-dominant watershed have less variance than those of crop-dominant watersheds. The highest correlations were found between EVI and water quality at one or two months `later', e.g. between the `earlier' green-up and the `later' nutrient discharge. This work could be applied to guide farmland planning to effectively control the non-point source pollution.},

Abstract = {This study integrates an Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution Model (AGNPS), the Geographic Resource Analysis Support System (GRASS) (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1987), and GRASS WATERWORKS (a hydrologic modeling tool box being developed at the Michigan State University Center for Remote Sensing) to evaluate the impact of agricultural runoff on water quality in the Cass River, a subwatershed of Saginaw Bay. AGNPS is used to estimate the amounts, origin, and distribution of sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the watershed. GRASS and GRASS WATERWORKS are used to generate parameters needed for AGNPS from digital maps, which include soil association, land use, watershed boundaries, water features, and digital elevation. Outputs of the model include spatially distributed estimates of volume and peak runoff, overland and channel erosion, sediment yields, and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. Management scenarios are explored in the AGNPS model to minimize sedimentation and nutrient loading. Scenarios evaluated include variations in crop cover, tillage methods, and other agricultural management practices. In addition, areas vulnerable to erosion are identified for best management practices.},

Title = {Monitoring water transparency of a hypertrophic lake (the Albufera of Valencia) using multitemporal Sentinel-2 satellite images},

Abstract = {The Albufera of Valencia has been a hypertrophic lake since the 1970s. Extensive efforts to revert the system to a clear water state, such as wastewater treatment and green filters construction, have not yielded the desired results; Albufera is still qualified as ``bad{''} according to the Spanish Water Framework Directive implementation. Currently, the lake requires constant monitoring, and water transparency, measured by Secchi disc depth (SDD), is a key parameter for evaluating water quality. Remote sensing offers substantial advantages over traditional monitoring methods such as SDD because it allows the quality of the surface waters to be continuously monitored. This work aimed to calibrate and validate an algorithm for SDD retrieval from Sentinel-2 (S2) (A and B) satellites with multispectral instrument (MSI) sensors (13 bands) from 404 nm to 2200 nm, spatial resolutions of 10, 20 and 60 m and a temporal frequency of 5 days (revisit at the equator)-values previously unattainable from open access images. The study was carried out with images from 2016 and 2017; only 40 of the 81 images of the Albufera captured by the S2 satellites could be used, mainly due to the presence of clouds. Once the images were downloaded, they were processed using SNAP 5 software. Images were then atmospherically corrected using the Sen2Cor tool, and the lake's SDD was estimated using the developed algorithm. The estimated SDD data were validated against field samples; a total of 20 sampling campaigns were carried out to measure the SDD, and 114 samples were taken. Chlorophyll a concentrations from each sample point were also measured to allow for better data interpretation; hydrological, precipitation and wind data were also collected. The algorithm model's calibration showed its robustness with an R-2 of 0.673 using 79 samples. Validation of the algorithm's accuracy using 35 samples produced a low root mean squared error of 0.06 m, indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and observed data. Interpretation of thematic maps showed that SDD temporal variations follow an annual bimodal pattern where the increase of SDD is determined by a significant increase in water renewal. The retrieval algorithm to estimate the SDD from S2 satellite images is accurate and appropriate to use within a protocol whose main purpose is to monitor the ecological status of the Albufera of Valencia.},

Abstract = {Seagrass habitats are characteristic features of shallow waters worldwide and provide a variety of ecosystem functions. Remote sensing techniques can help collect spatial and temporal information about seagrass resources. In this study, we evaluate a protocol that utilizes image optimization algorithms followed by atmospheric and sunglint corrections to the three satellite sensors {[}Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP)] and a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique to map and assess seagrass abundance in Pinellas County, FL, USA. After image preprocessed with image optimization algorithms and atmospheric and sunglint correction approaches, the three sensors' data were used to classify the submerged aquatic vegetation cover (\%SAV cover) into 5 classes with a maximum likelihood classifier. Based on three biological metrics {[}\%SAV, leaf area index (LA!), and Biomass] measured from the field, nine multiple regression models were developed for estimating the three biometrics with spectral variables derived from the three sensors' data. Then, five membership maps were created with the three biometrics along with two environmental factors (water depth and distance-to-shoreline). Finally, seagrass abundance maps were produced by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique and five membership maps. The experimental results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best results of the 5-class classification of \%SAV cover (overall accuracy = 87\% and Kappa = 0.83 vs. 82\% and 0.77 by ALI and 79\% and 0.73 by TM) and better multiple regression models for estimating the three biometrics (R-2 = 0.66, 0.62 and 0.61 for \%SAV, LAI and Biomass vs. 0.62, 0.61 and 0.55 by ALI and 0.58, 0.56 and 0.52 by TM) for creating seagrass abundance maps along with two environmental factors. Combined our results demonstrate that the image optimization algorithms and the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique were effective in mapping detailed seagrass habitats and assessing seagrass abundance with the 30-m resolution data collected by the three sensors.

Title = {Design and Performance Analysis of a Constellation of Nanosatellites to Monitor Water Quality in the Southern Catchment of the Baltic Sea},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The quality of inland waters has a significant influence on human life and the functioning of the environment. The disasters that result from water pollution may cause major financial losses and lead to irreversible changes in the ecosystem, such as the dying out of endemic species of plants and animals. Quick detection of pollution sources may minimise those negative effects and reduce the costs of their elimination. The study presents a constellation design that provides imagery in the optic range and that might supplement the point water quality measurements that are conducted in situ. The area of interest was the southern catchment of the Baltic Sea and the main rivers in the region. The requirements for the designed mission were defined in reference to the remote sensing needs concerning the monitoring of water quality, the characteristics of the analysed area, and weather conditions. Based on these requirements, the Simera Sense MultiScape100 CIS sensor and the M6P nanosatellite manufactured by NanoAvionics were selected. The authors proposed a process for selecting the optimum orbit, taking into account the area of interest, the possibilities of the satellite platform, and of the sensor's optics. As a result of the analyses, four concepts of creating a constellation were presented. Each constellation consisted of four nanosatellites. The designs were then subjected to performance analysis, considering the lighting limitations. Among the proposed systems, the constellation designed by the authors was distinguished; it used four orbital planes and achieved the coverage and availability of imagery in the time that was best suited to monitoring the waters. Thanks to a small number of platforms, the costs of the mission are relatively low, and it might significantly improve awareness of the current state of surface waters in the southern catchment of the Baltic Sea.},

Title = {Regional Remote Sensing of Lake Water Transparency Based on Google Earth Engine: Performance of Empirical Algorithm and Machine Learning},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Secchi depth (SD) is a valuable and feasible water quality indicator of lake eutrophication. The establishment of an automated system with efficient image processing and an algorithm suitable for the inversion of transparency in lake-rich regions could provide sufficient temporal and spatial information for lake management. These are especially critical for lake-rich regions where in situ monitoring data are scarce. This study demonstrated the implementation of an atmospheric correction algorithm (ACOLITE algorithm) in conjunction with the Google Earth Engine platform to generate remote-sensing reflectance products of specific points efficiently. The study also evaluated the performance of an algorithm for inverting lake SDs in Yunnan Plateau lakes, which is one of the five lake districts in China, since there is a lack of in situ data for most of the lakes in the region. The in situ data from four lakes with large SD ranges and imagery from Landsat Operational Land Imager were used to train and evaluate the performance of two algorithms: an empirical algorithm (stepwise regression) and machine learning (support vector machines and multi-layer perception). The results revealed that the retrieval accuracy of models with bands and band ratio combinations could be substantially improved compared with models with a single band or band combinations. A negative correlation was also observed between the temporal match between observations and the model accuracy. This study found that the MLP model with sufficient training data was more suitable for transparency estimation of lakes belonging to the dataset; the SVM model was more suitable for transparency prediction outside the training set, regardless of the adequacy of the training data. This study provides a reference for monitoring lakes within the Yunnan region using remote sensing.},

Abstract = {Declining water quality in the Chesapeake Bay estuary is in part the result of disruptions in the hydrological system caused by urban and suburban development throughout its 167000 km(2) watershed. A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful for a wide range of applications relevant to the future health of the Bay and its tributaries. We describe and test a regional predictive modeling system that could be used to meet these needs. An existing cellular automaton model, SLEUTH, was applied to a 23 700 km(2) area centered on the Washington - Baltimore metropolitan region, which has experienced rapid land-use change in recent years. The model was calibrated using a historic time series of developed areas derived from remote sensing imagery, and future growth was projected out to 2030 assuming three different policy scenarios: (1) current trends, (2) managed growth, and (3) ecologically sustainable growth. The current trends scenario allowed areas on the urban fringe that are currently rural or forested to be developed, which would have implications for water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The managed growth and ecologically sustainable scenarios produced growth patterns that were more constrained and which consumed less natural resource land. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues, but spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are among the factors that must be further considered for practical application.},

Abstract = {This work aims to identify the potential groundwater recharge zones in the Mitidja plain (north Algeria) using the multi-criteria approach. The analysis was based on the use of a geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing to establish eight thematic maps, weighted, categorized and inserted, that allowed us to establish the potential zones' map for groundwater recharge. Three potential groundwater recharge classes were defined corresponding, respectively, to low (26\%), moderate (47\%) and high (27\%). The best groundwater potential zones are situated in the piedmont of the Blidean Atlas (the south of the study area), precisely, upstream near to wadis (wadi El Harrach, wadi Djemaa, wadi Mazafran) and the western aquifer limit, where the hydrogeological units are formed by the alluvium formation which is characterized by high hydraulic conductivity, high water flow, low slope, low drainage, low quantity transported sediments and good water quality. The obtained results, in this work, describe the groundwater recharge potential areas and supply information for a suitable mapping and the management of aquifer resources in the study area.},

Abstract = {Classification-based methods for estimating water quality parameter (WQP) using remote sensing have shown great application potential in inland waters. Water classification algorithms have seen progress in water remote sensing. In this paper, we conducted the Secchi Depth value (Z (SD)) estimation based on a global water typology for the Wuhan area. Firstly, we classified the water into seven types using the Sentinel-2 data. The procedure was based on spectral angle mapping (SAM) of the 13 inland water optical types (IWOTs). Afterwards, seven IWOTs were summarized into four categories for Wuhan area. We then developed empirical models for each water category by stepwise multiple linear regression, generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and sparse spectrum Gaussian process regression (SSGPR), and applied the better approaches (GRNN and SSGPR) to three full satellite images (27 October 2018, 10 May 2019, and 29 July 2019). Finally, the retrieved results were validated using in situ-satellite match-ups and compared with the results based on unclassified imagery. With root-mean-square error (RMSE) of three satellite-derived results reduced from 0.32 m (without classification) to 0.16 m (with classification), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reduced from 52\% to 18\%, from 0.51 m (MAPE = 57\%) to 0.19 m (MAPE = 21\%), and from 0.18 m (MAPE = 35\%) to 0.09 m (MAPE = 17\%), Z (SD) estimations over optically complex waters were improved based on this water classification. Due to its low cost and ease of operation, the SAM - derived classification applied in this paper provides a possibility for dynamic and high-precision monitoring for water management.},

Title = {Design of Terrace Drainage Networks Using UAV-Based High-Resolution Topographic Data},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Hillslope viticulture has a long history in Mediterranean Europe, and still holds important cultural and economic value. Steep hillsides have widely been levelled by terraces, in order to control surface water flow and facilitate cultivation. However, under unsustainable management and growing rainfall aggressiveness, terraced vineyards have become one of the most erosion-prone agricultural landscapes. The Valcamonica valley in Lombardy (Italy) presents a typical example of an ancient wine production region where rural land abandonment has previously caused widespread degradation of the traditional terracing systems. Recently, a local revival of wine production led to restoration plans of the terraces and their drainage functioning, to safeguard productivity and hydrogeologic safety. In this study, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) survey was carried out to reconstruct an accurate and precise 3D terrain model of a Valcamonica vineyard through photogrammetry. The resulting high-resolution topographic data allowed insights of surface flow-induced soil erosion patterns based on the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII). Three diverse drainage networks were designed and digitally implemented, allowing scenario analysis of the costs and benefits in terms of potential erosion mitigation. The presented methodology could likely improve the time-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of similar restoration plans in degraded landscapes.},

Abstract = {The Eocene aquifer system in Egypt is an important source of water to meet the increasing necessities of the agricultural, drinking, and domestic purposes. This study aimed to assess the impact of the hydro-structural features identified as lineaments on the groundwater occurrence, assess the water quality status for various purposes, and provide useful information for future management. To achieve this, Landsat images have been used in conjunction with the chemical data (major, trace ions, and physicochemical parameters) and statistical analysis. The hydrochemical facies showed that the water samples belong to (1) Ca-HCO3; (2) mixed facies CaMgHCO3 and mixed CaNaHCO3, and (3) Na-Cl hydrochemical facies. The water chemistry is controlled by the carbonate weathering, ion exchange, and evaporite dissolution. The groundwater analysis has indicated that the water is suitable for drinking purposes when compared with the drinking water standards. Furthermore, salinity, electric conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and sodium percentage (\%Na) assessment show that majority of the groundwater samples are appropriate for irrigation. The satellite imagery of the area has been analyzed to determine the orientation, density, and intersection. The orientation of the lineaments is well-confirmed with regional structural setting; in addition, density maps show that the density is high throughout the study area. The results reflect a correlation between the lineaments and the hydrologic phenomena. The statistical analysis with the one-way ANOVA confirmed the importance of lineaments as explanatory variable for the observed variation in water quality. This in turn supported that the fracture is structurally controlled and mostly influences both the occurrence and quality},

Abstract = {Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a very challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always the key features for classifying mixed pixels. This paper proposes an approach for pixel classification using a hybrid approach of rough set theory and particle swarm optimization methods. Rough set theory deals with incompleteness and vagueness among data, which property may be utilized for detecting arbitrarily shaped and sized clusters in satellite images. To enable fast automatic clustering of multispectral remote sensing imagery, in this article, we propose a rough set-based heuristical decision rule generation algorithm. For rough-set-theoretic decision rule generation, each cluster is classified using heuristically searched optimal reducts to overcome overlapping cluster problem. This proposed unsupervised algorithm is able to identify clusters utilizing particle swarm optimization based on rough set generated membership values. This approach addresses the overlapping regions in remote sensing images by uncertainties using rough set generated membership values. Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, inspired from the social behavior of bird flock. Therefore, to predict pixel classification of remote sensing imagery, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based membership correction approach over rough set-based initial decision rule generation. We demonstrate our algorithm for segmenting a LANDSAT image of the catchment area of Ajoy River. The newly developed algorithm is compared with fuzzy C-means and K-means algorithms. The new algorithm generated clustered regions are verified with the available ground truth knowledge. The validity analysis is performed to demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms with K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms.},

Title = {Multispectral derivation of bathymetry in Singapore's shallow, turbid waters},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2070-2088},
Abstract = {In very shallow waters, active sensing determinations of bathymetry are often expensive and unwieldy. Sea depth estimation using passive remote-sensing methods is an attractive alternative, especially using cheap multispectral imagery with high spatial resolution. Three models for the determination of bathymetry from multispectral imagery were utilized with new eight-band images from DigitalGlobe's Worldview-2 satellite platform. All three were trained with electronic navigational chart data and evaluated for accuracy in Singapore's turbid shallow coastal waters. These waters are characterized by high turbidity, suspended sediment, and vehicle traffic. Of the three models, a linear band algorithm performed best, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.48 m. A look-up table classification provided a precision of 0.64 m, but was limited by a training set that did not fully represent variance in water column and benthic properties. Possibly owing to the domination of particle backscatter over pigment absorption in these turbid waters, a linear ratio algorithm did not perform as well as the linear band algorithm, achieving an RMSE of only 0.56 m. Analysis found that the usual relationship between ratios of low-absorption to high-absorption bands and depth does not hold as well for these waters, likely due to backscatter dominating leaving-water signals, masking relative absorption effects. High turbidity, with a Secchi disk depth of 1.9 m, limited analysis to shallow reefs and coastline and likely impacted the sensitivity of the bathymetric algorithms. A larger validation data set containing water quality and benthic data is required for further investigation to determine specific sources of error.},

Abstract = {The Baltic Sea is subject to various European environmental regulations which aim at securing its long-term protection. This will be achieved by the accompanying monitoring programmes associated with, for example, the HELCOM convention, the EC Water Framework Directive, the Natura 2000 Directives and the upcoming European Maritime Policy, to name the most important regulatory policies. These monitoring programmes demand large scale, frequent and accurate measurements of physical, biological and chemical parameters. GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) is a major activity of the European Union and Commission which aims at providing operational services by making the best use of spaceborne earth observation data, in-situ observations and models. MarCoast is the GMES Service Element Project addressing the marine environment and is funded by the European Space Agency. MarCoast is providing Marine and Coastal Services for international, regional and national end users. The project is driven solely by these end users, which include mainly public bodies in charge of the marine environment, such as, for example, the European Environmental Agency (EEA), the European Maritime Security Agency (EMSA) or the German Federal and Maritime Hydrographic Agency (BSH). The MarCoast service portfolio includes oil spill detection and polluter identification as well as water quality products and services. The latter comprises monitoring the water quality with respect to European regulations as above, monitoring and alerting of algal blooms and the monitoring of large scale water quality indicators. The production chain of MarCoast begins with ENVISAT MERIS and Aqua MODIS data for the ocean colour products and AATSR data for sea surface temperature. The satellite data are downloaded from the space agencies and routinely processed to provide basic data sets of key parameters on a common grid. A merged MODIS and MERIS data product is produced at 1km. MERIS Full Resolution data (300m) complement the basic data. The service providers combine the basic data with in-situ data, integrate them into forecasting models or perform data analysis and statistical evaluation. Validation plays a key role for the acceptance of the satellite derived products by the end users. The accuracy of the products and the reliability of the service are regularly evaluated by the Validation Bureau, which is an independent entity within the project.},

Title = {The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions ``on the ground{''} more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) from applying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.},

Title = {Assessing land use and land cover change in Los Molinos reservoir watershed and the effect on the reservoir water quality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding and modelling land use and land cover (LULC) change have become one of the major subjects of interest for environmental management due to the negative effects that human activities generate on the normal functioning and dynamics of freshwater resources. Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are essential tools for assessing the drivers that cause LULC change and its relationship with lake and reservoir water quality. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of LULC change in the watershed of Los Molinos reservoir (Argentina), and to investigate its relationship with the reservoir's water quality. Four Landsat imagery was used to analyse the LULC change in the studied watershed and in different buffer zones from 1990 to 2020. Further, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a MODIS time-series dataset (2001-2020) was used to explain the effects of LULC change on the status of the reservoir. Results showed that the most significant LULC change started two decades ago and it has intensified during the last ten years. This change is related to the intensification of agriculture activities, and to the increasing conversion into urban areas, mainly on the shores of Los Molinos reservoir. During the period 2010-2020, urbanization located in the 1 km buffer zone defined from the shore of the reservoir increased at an annual rate of 18.02\%. The degradation trend of LULC in Los Molinos watershed significantly contributed to the degradation of water quality of the reservoir. This was corroborated by analysing the MODIS NDVI time-series, which showed that since 2014 the NDVI trend-line presented an increasing behaviour and extreme values of NDVI, related to algal blooms, were more frequently observed.},

Abstract = {Land-use activities affect water quality by altering sediment, chemical loads, and watershed hydrology. Some land uses may contribute to the maintenance of water quality due to a biogeochemical transformation process. These land-use/land-cover types can serve as nutrient detention zones or as nutrient transformation zones as dissolved or suspended nutrients or sediments move downstream. Despite research on the effects of individual land-use/land-cover types, very little has been done to analyze the joint contributions of multiple land-use activities. This paper examines a methodology to assess the relationships between land-use complex and nitrate and sediment concentrations {[}nonpoint source (NPS) pollutants] in streams. In this process, selected basins of the Fish River, Alabama, USA, were delineated, land-use/land-cover types were classified, and contributing zones were identified using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) analysis tools. Water samples collected from these basins were analyzed for selected chemical and physical properties. Based on the contributions of the NPS pollutants, a link-age model was developed. This linkage model relates land use/land cover with the pollution levels in the stream. Linkage models were constructed and evaluated at three different scales: (1) the basin scale; (2) the contributing-zone scale; and (3) the stream-buffer/riparian-zone scale. The contributing-zones linkage model suggests that forests act as st transformation zone, and as the proportion of forest inside a contributing zone increases (or agricultural land decreases), nitrate levels downstream will decrease. Residential/urban/built-up areas were identified as the strongest contributors of nitrate in the contributing-zones model and active agriculture was identified as the second largest contributor. The regression results for the streambank land-use/land-cover model (stream-buffer/riparian-zone scale) suggest that water quality is highest when passive land uses, such as forests and grasslands, are located adjacent to streams. Nonpassive land uses (agricultural lands or urban/built-up areas) located adjacent to streams have negative impacts on water quality. The model can help in examining the relative sensitivity of water-quality variables to alterations in land use made at varying distances from the stream channel. The model also shows the importance of streamside management zones, which are key to maintenance of stream water quality. The linkage model can be considered a first step in the integration of GIS and ecological models. The model can then be used by local and regional land managers in the formulation of plans for watershed-level management.},

Title = {An approach to understanding persistent yield variation-A case study in North China Plain},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {77},

Pages = {10-19},

Abstract = {Large gaps between maize yields on average farmers' fields and the highest yields achieved by either experiment or farmers are typical throughout the developing world, including in the North China Plain (NCP). Understanding the underlying causes to this yield gap is important for prioritizing strategies for shrinking this gap and improving food security. Quzhou county in Hebei province is typical of the winter-wheat summer-maize system in NCP where the average plot size is only 0.25 ha. To analyze this cropping system amidst the challenge of substantial heterogeneity, we identified fields that were either persistently higher or lower yielding according to remote sensing yield estimates, and then conducted detailed field surveys. We found irrigation facility to be a major constraint to yield both in terms of irrigation water quality and farmers' access to wells. In total, improving the access to unsalty water would be associated with a 0.32 t/ha (4.2\%) increase in multi-year average yield. In addition, farmers' method of choosing cultivar, which likely relates to their overall knowledge level, significantly explained yield variation. In particular, those choosing cultivars according to technician advice, personal experiences and high yielding neighbors' advice had on average higher yield than farmers that either followed seed sellers' advice or collectively purchased seeds.

Abstract = {Soil loss is a major concern for land managers due to its influence oil biomass production, surface water quality and landscape beauty. In Somalia, the risk of soil loss is accelerated by the removal of vegetation, bad land use practices and negative impacts of urbanization. The political upheavals and consequent insecurity in the country are major limitations for detailed database and research in soil loss. This study tested opportunities in pedometrics, remote sensing, limited field data collection and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) to model the risk of soil loss in northwestern Somalia. The approach successfully predicted the risk of soil loss with accuracy of 79 per cent. It also showed that RUSLE is only relatively accurate and stable in identifying areas with low risk of soil loss and therefore is useful in modelling early warning signs of erosion. About 24 per cent of northwestern Somalia was depicted to have no significant human-induced soil loss while 68 per cent of the region is in threat of soil loss if no action is taken against the removal of vegetation, land use practices and policies oil land tenure systems. About 8 per cent of the area is at high risk of soil loss due to negative effects Of urbanization and lack of proper management of steep slopes. It is anticipated that this approach can be integrated in the assessment of soil erosion in areas with poor database. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Water turbidity is a key index used to evaluate coastal water quality conditions. To determine the turbidity in large areas, remote sensing technologies have the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to experimental methods that require extensive time for field data collection and laboratory analysis. This research focuses on the development of an accurate model to estimate and monitor low water turbidity using Sentinel-2 images and field measurements in the Sidi Moussa lagoon of the Moroccan Atlantic coast. Also, the effect of various factors was mentioned and compared qualitatively to the water turbidity variations, including spatiotemporal variation, wind, depth, geomorphology, and vegetation. Among all the regressions analyzed, the Red band was the most successful remote sensing information for water turbidity with a good validation accuracy of R2 = 0.87. ANOVA analysis showed that measured turbidity values vary differently from upstream to downstream of the lagoon. The analysis of the seasonal effect on the water turbidity using one-year multitemporal Sentinel-2 images showed that in the dry season, the mean turbidity is lower than in the rainy season. The water turbidity map derived using the developed algorithm can be used to support wetland management, the conservation of natural resources, and the selection of aquaculture areas. These results highlight the potential contribution of Sentinel-2 to map and monitor the low water turbidity.},

Abstract = {As a multinational organization with rapid economic development, the eco-environment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be an important factor in determining the success or failure of the future development of the region. This study uses information granulation based on granular computing and spatial distribution characteristics of the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) to granulate indicator. According to the different influences of different countries in ASEAN, a new scale-up evaluation method of RSEI is proposed, which considers the influence of countries and establishes the weight by scale transformation knowledge granularity entropy. The RSEI research results of ASEAN from 2000 to 2021 show that 1) from 2000 to 2021, the eco-environmental quality of ASEAN was good. The areas with better RSEI accounted for 40.3566\%, while the poor areas accounted for 32.6194\%. The areas with extremely poor and excellent remote sensing ecology accounted for less. 2) From 2000 to 2021, the remote sensing eco-environment of ASEAN showed a certain volatility, the quality of the remote sensing eco-environment was declining, and the spatial differentiation was increasing. 3) The spatial distribution of the remote sensing eco-environmental quality of the Malay Peninsula is better than that of the Indochina Peninsula. 4) The order of impact of ASEAN remote sensing eco-environmental indicators is heat, dryness, greenness and humidity.},

Abstract = {In southern African countries, soil erosion and related problems like water quality issues or decreasing soil productivity are increasingly affecting the inhabitants of rural and urban areas. Problems related to soil erosion therefore have received increased attention in the recent past. Gully erosion processes especially play an important role for sediment production in many southern African catchments. Nevertheless, gully erosion phenomena have been widely neglected in erosion modelling. This study concerns the identification of spatially distributed erosion forms and processes in the Mbuluzi River catchment (Kingdom of Swaziland), with particular attention to gully erosion phenomena. The modelling of gully erosion was done successfully with models accounting for the two stages of development of a gully. The input data were obtained using remote sensing techniques and GIS-analyses. The example from Southern Africa shows that the methods applied are suitable for identifying and simulating the relevant erosional processes.},

Title = {Reconstruction of Sentinel Images for Suspended Particulate Matter Monitoring in Arid Regions},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Missing data is a common issue in remote sensing. Data reconstruction through multiple satellite data sources has become one of the most powerful ways to solve this issue. Continuous monitoring of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in arid lakes is vital for water quality solutions. Therefore, this research aimed to develop and evaluate the performance of two image reconstruction strategies, spatio-temporal fusion reflectance image inversion SPM and SPM spatio-temporal fusion, based on the measured SPM concentration data with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. The results show that (1) ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatio-temporal Adaptive Reflection Fusion Model) performed better than FSDAF (Flexible Spatio-temporal Data Fusion) in the fusion image generation, particularly the red band, followed by the blue, green, and NIR (near-infrared) bands. (2) A single-band linear and non-linear regression model was constructed based on Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. Analysis of the accuracy and stability of the model led us to the conclusion that the red band model performs well, is fast to model, and has a wide range of applications (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and fused high-accuracy images). (3) By comparing the two data reconstruction strategies of spatio-temporal fused image inversion SPM and spatio-temporal fused SPM concentration map, we found that the fused SPM concentration map is more effective and more stable when applied to multiple fused images. The findings can provide an important scientific reference value for further expanding the inversion research of other water quality parameters in the future and provide a theoretical basis as well as technical support for the scientific management of Ebinur Lake's ecology and environment.},

Title = {EOLakeWatch; delivering a comprehensive suite of remote sensing algal bloom indices for enhanced monitoring of Canadian eutrophic lakes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Early detection and comprehensive monitoring of inland water algal blooms is fundamental to their effective management and mitigation of potential ecosystem and public health impacts. With the spatial and temporal limitations of in situ sampling, algal bloom monitoring capabilities have been enhanced greatly by advancements in satellite Earth Observation (EO). Three turbid, eutrophic Canadian lakes (Lake Winnipeg (LW); Lake Erie (LE); Lake of the Woods (LoW)) have been the focus of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) research and monitoring initiatives due to concerns over persistent degraded water quality from recurring algal blooms. ECCC's EOLakeWatch was developed to deliver a suite of useful, easily interpretable, and accessible EO-derived products to support algal bloom monitoring on these three lakes. Algal bloom indices, describing bloom spatial extent, intensity, duration, and severity were derived using the European Space Agency's OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) sensor for observations from 2016 to present and its predecessor MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) for 2002 to 2011. Results document widespread blooms on each lake, with maximum spatial extent of 21,641 km(2) (representing 88.1\% of the lake area) on LW, 3070 km(2) (79.5\%) on LoW and 5257 km(2) (19.7\%) on LE. Bloom intensity showed seasonal and inter-annual variability on all three lakes, with a suggestion that LoW may be responding to reduced nutrient loads with a recent decrease in bloom intensity. Annual bloom duration on LW and LoW was on average 44 and 47 days respectively, while on LE blooms were significantly shorter in duration at an average of 24 days. Variance among the derived bloom indices was shown to be significant (i.e. the most extensive bloom was not necessarily the longest or most intensive), demonstrating the need for the indices to be used collectively, or for any single comprehensive bloom indicator to capture the variability of all individual metrics. Bloom indices are processed in a fully automated operational capacity, distributed in near-real-time through a web portal and collated into end-user-friendly annual algal bloom reports for each lake. These products go a long way to address existing monitoring gaps, delivering prompt, consistent measures of lake-wide algal bloom conditions required to provide stakeholders with early warning of bloom risks, identify areas of potential concern, quantify spatio-temporal trends, further understand bloom dynamics and drivers, as well as guide and determine the effectiveness of implemented management actions.},

Title = {Combining Hydrogeochemical Characterization and a Hyperspectral Reflectance Tool for Assessing Quality and Suitability of Two Groundwater Resources for Irrigation in Egypt},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hyperspectral reflectance sensing provides a rapid and cost-effective technique for assessing the suitability of groundwater for irrigation by monitoring real-time changes in its quality at a large scale. In this study, we assessed the quality of 15 groundwater samples from El Fayoum depression in the Western Desert (WD) and 25 groundwater samples from the Central Nile Delta (CND) in Egypt using a traditional approach of the physiochemical parameters, irrigation water quality indicators (IWQIs), and hydrochemical facies. The spectral reflectance data of the water surface was used to build new simple reflectance indices (SRIs), and the performance of these indices for assessing IWQIs was compared with those by partial least square regression (PLSR) that was based on all SRIs or the full-spectrum ranges. Generally, the groundwater of the CND was fresher and more suitable for irrigation purposes than those of the WD. Based on the six IWQIs, similar to 6.7-60.0\% and 85.0-100.0\% of the groundwater samples of the WD and CND, respectively, were categorized as highly suitable for irrigation purposes. Based on hydrochemical facies, Na-Cl and Ca-HCO(3)were dominant in the WD and CND, respectively, as well as the alkali earth metals (Na++ K+), which significantly exceeded the alkaline earth metals (Ca2++ Mg2+) in the WD, with the reverse for the CND. Most developed SRIs had a moderate, weak, and moderate to strong relationship with physiochemical parameters and IWQIs in the WD, CND, and across both regions, respectively. The PLSR models based on all SRIs provided a more accurate estimation of IWQIs in calibration and validation datasets than those based on full-spectrum ranges, and both PLSR models provided better estimation than the individual SRIs. These findings support the feasibility of using ground reflectance measurements as a fast and low-cost tool for the assessment and management of groundwater for irrigation in arid and semiarid regions.},

Title = {RSEIFE: A new remote sensing ecological index for simulating the land surface eco-environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {326},

Abstract = {With the development of remote sensing technology, significant progress has been made in the evaluation of the eco-environment. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is one of the most widely used indices for the comprehensive evaluation of eco-environmental quality. This index is entirely based on remote sensing data and can monitor eco-environmental aspects quickly for a large area. However, the use of RSEI has some limitations. For example, its application is generally not uniform, the obtained results are stochastic in nature, and its calculation process cannot consider all ecological elements (especially the water element). In spite of the widespread application of the RSEI, improvements to its limitations are scarce. In this paper, we propose a new index named the remote sensing ecological index considering full elements (RSEIFE). The proposed RSEIFE is compared with commonly used evaluation models such as RSEI and RSEILA (Remote Sensing Ecological Index with Local Adaptability) in several types of study areas to assess the stability and accuracy of our model. The results show that the calculation process of RSEIFE is more stable than those of RSEI and RSEILA, and the results of RSEIFE are consistent with the real eco-environment surface and reveal more details about its features. Meanwhile, compared with RSEI and RSEILA, the results of RSEIFE effectively reveal the ecological benefits of both water bodies themselves and their surrounding environments, which lead to more accurate and compre-hensive basis for the implementation of environmental protection policies.},

Abstract = {We have measured the water quality and bio-optical parameters of 94 samples from Taihu Lake in situ and/or in the lab between June 10-18, 2007. A transparency-assisted decision tree was developed to more accurately divide the aquatic vegetation zone into a floating vegetation-dominated zone and a submerged vegetation-dominated zone, whose respective present biomass retrieval models were easily developed with an empirical approach because of the quasi-concurrence of ground field investigations with the satellite sensor flight over the lake. The significant quantitative relationships between the vegetation index NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of different images at different times were used to help develop the past biomass retrieval model on the basis of the present developed model. In Taihu Lake, the total covering area of aquatic vegetations decreased from 454.6 km(2) in 2001 to 364.1 km(2) in 2007. Correspondingly, the total biomass decreased from 489,000 tons in 2001 to 406,000 tons in 2007, suggesting that a great change in the ecological environment has been taking place in Taihu Lake over this period.},

Title = {Associations between county-level land cover classes and cyanobacteria blooms in the United States},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},
Number = {B},
Pages = {556-563},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria blooms can cause public health concerns related to drinking water quality and water recreation. The rapidly changing global climate is anticipated to bring about an increased frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. stronger storms, more extensive droughts), which are expected to promote more frequent cyanobacteria blooms that persist for longer durations in freshwater. Land use planning, landscape management, and ecological engineering may present mitigation opportunities for decreasing the occurrence and intensity of current and future cyanobacteria blooms through improved nutrient management strategies thereby reducing eutrophication of watersheds. To examine the potential impacts of various land cover classes (and their relative density) on cyanobacteria bloom coverage, county-level data were obtained or generated from the National Land Cover Database and the national nutrient inputs to the land surface database. These data were paired with county-level estimates of cyanobacteria bloom area obtained by satellite-based MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). Multivariable zero-inflated beta regression models were constructed for the U.S. and five U.S. regions for assessing the relationships between the proportion of county area experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom, county land cover types, and nutrient loading. The land cover type associated with the greatest decreases in bloom area in the national model was deciduous forest (p < 0.001). Open water extent (p = 0.001) and nitrogen loading from manure (p = 0.002) and fertilizer (p < 0.001) were positively associated with the proportion of water characterized as experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom. A significant interaction (p < 0.001) was observed between cultivated crop coverage and open water extent. Overall, increasing cultivated crop coverage was associated with increasing proportions of cyanobacteria blooms. Low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity development land uses were not associated with bloom coverage in the national model, although development land uses were positively associated in several regional models. Ultimately, there is evidence that county-level land cover and nutrient loading, notably N in the national model, can impact countylevel cyanobacteria bloom coverage. Given regional model differences, additional remote sensing-based studies that examine watershed-based effects on cyanobacteria coverage are needed to establish watershed-specific associations. Studies that transcend county boundaries may provide greater utility than this correlational study for better characterizing land uses and mitigation measures that impact or could impact cyanobacteria bloom coverage in U.S. surface waters.},

Title = {Remote sensing of vegetation conditions after post-fire mulch treatments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {260},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Wildfires are becoming more prevalent and are impacting forests, watersheds and important resources. Hydrologic and geomorphic processes following wildfires can include erosion flooding, and degraded water quality. To mitigate these secondary impacts, post-fire restoration treatments can be applied to a burned area to stabilize the land surface or promote vegetative regrowth. This research focuses on wood and straw mulch treatment implemented after the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado (United States) and estimates the spatial and temporal changes in annual and seasonal vegetation after a fire with respect to geomorphic factors. This study highlights the use of satellite-based remote sensing products to investigate the impacts of post-fire rehabilitation treatments on vegetation. Using Enhanced Vegetation Index as a proxy for vegetative growth, vegetation conditions are evaluated with respect to slope, slope aspect, and burn severity to understand the impact of the ground cover treatments on vegetation for five years before and after the fire (2007-2016). Sixty-three burned and untreated sites, forty-nine burned sites treated with wood mulch, and twenty-eight burned sites treated with straw mulch were analyzed. These sites were also compared to two control sites that were unburned and untreated, Hunter's Run and Fountain Creek. Generally, post-fire conditions did not return to pre-fire levels, where average vegetation levels were lower. By the end of the study, burned and untreated sites had larger vegetative levels than burned and treated sites. The vegetation levels of the burned sites were statistically different (alpha = 0.05) from pre-fire conditions in all areas of treatment. Burned sites treated with wood and straw recovered to 69\% and 73\% of pre-fire conditions, respectively. This work demonstrates the novel use of remote sensing to observe vegetation after post-fire treatment applications to augment the number of sites and length of time that can be analyzed. The observed change in vegetation conditions also contributes to furthering our understanding of the impacts of post-fire restoration, which is important for post-fire management.},

Title = {Task Offloading Strategy Based on Mobile Edge Computing in UAV Network},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2022},

Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {When an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) performs tasks such as power patrol inspection, water quality detection, field scientific observation, etc., due to the limitations of the computing capacity and battery power, it cannot complete the tasks efficiently. Therefore, an effective method is to deploy edge servers near the UAV. The UAV can offload some of the computationally intensive and real-time tasks to edge servers. In this paper, a mobile edge computing offloading strategy based on reinforcement learning is proposed. Firstly, the Stackelberg game model is introduced to model the UAV and edge nodes in the network, and the utility function is used to calculate the maximization of offloading revenue. Secondly, as the problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, we introduce the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to solve it. Finally, the effects of the number of UAVs and the summation of computing resources on the total revenue of the UAVs were simulated through simulation experiments. The experimental results show that compared with other algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper can more effectively improve the total benefit of UAVs.},

Abstract = {Intensive field observations as well as monitoring of discharge, water quality, and soil erosion have been conducted in forest plantations in order to identify the effects of forest cover and management practices on runoff generation, sediment transport, and downstream environmental issues. Five experimental catchments, each with rather uniform lithology, were established in both managed and unmanaged plantations of Japanese cypress and cedar, as well as broadleaf forests. Field monitoring was conducted from sub-plots (e. g. splash cups) to small hillslope plots (0.5 x 2 m) to large hillslope-scale plots to first order streams (0.1-4 ha) and finally to larger catchments (>4 ha) in a nested structure. Remote sensing techniques were employed to identify broad scale forest stand and soil surface conditions. As part of this integrated study, these field-based monitoring and remote sensing techniques provide information for modelling runoff generation and developing adaptive management schemes with respect to catchment-scale water resources.

Title = {Beyond Impervious: Urban Land-Cover Pattern Variation and Implications for Watershed Management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-30},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Impervious surfaces degrade urban water quality, but their over-coverage has not explained the persistent water quality variation observed among catchments with similar rates of imperviousness. Land-cover patterns likely explain much of this variation, although little is known about how they vary among watersheds. Our goal was to analyze a series of urban catchments within a range of impervious cover to evaluate how land-cover varies among them. We then highlight examples from the literature to explore the potential effects of land-cover pattern variability for urban watershed management. High-resolution (1 m(2)) land-cover data were used to quantify 23 land-cover pattern and stormwater infrastructure metrics within 32 catchments across the Triangle Region of North Carolina. These metrics were used to analyze variability in land-cover patterns among the study catchments. We used hierarchical clustering to organize the catchments into four groups, each with a distinct landscape pattern. Among these groups, the connectivity of combined land-cover patches accounted for 40 \%, and the size and shape of lawns and buildings accounted for 20 \%, of the overall variation in land-cover patterns among catchments. Storm water infrastructure metrics accounted for 8 \% of the remaining variation. Our analysis demonstrates that land-cover patterns do vary among urban catchments, and that trees and grass (lawns) are divergent cover types in urban systems. The complex interactions among land-covers have several direct implications for the ongoing management of urban watersheds.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the last few years, the world's urban population has significantly increased and it is expected to undergo a continuous accelerated growth. This urban revolution confronts us with real challenges to promote urban sus-tainable development and has significant effects on socioeconomic development and the urban environment. This research suggests an approach to assess urban sustainability (US) based on the integration of census in-formation, GIS, and remote-sensing data, which can support urban planners and decision-makers in broad environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. Five environmental indices retrieved from Landsat-8 imagery were coupled with eight general census socioeconomic indicators using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA produced three components, and each one was considered a unique urban sustainability aspect covering social, economic, and/or environmental dimensions. Furthermore, the obtained result was exploited to develop a synthetic US index at the commune level with the main aim to assess urban sustainability and its spatial dis-tribution. The outcome depicts that the US is adequate in 50\% of Casablanca city, which contains nearly the third of the urban population. This research remains so promising and can be considered by urban planners as a reference to take necessary actions to improve sustainability, resilience, and well-being in the most vulnerable communes.},

Abstract = {As the global ecosystem has been severely disturbed by an increasing number of human activities at different scales, remote sensing technology, as an effective quantitative measure of environmental quality, has been widely used. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is one of the most popular and comprehensive ecological quality assessment indices based on the remote sensing data. However, the RSEI model exhibits that the ecological environment under natural conditions is not limited by the spatial scales. In addition, the model has major shortcomings in index selection and eigenvector, which greatly limit the application of RSEI. In this paper, the RSEI model is improved and a remote sensing ecological index optimized by the regional scale (RO-RSEI) is proposed. The result of the study, conducted in Shuangyang District, Changchun City, Jilin Province, shows that the RO-RSEI model has regional ecological significance after the introduction of the scale theory of landscape ecology; the index is preferred to solve problems like the RSEI model applied mechanization and baseless index selection. Meanwhile, due to the optimization of the eigenvector contribution of the optimal index, it solves the problems like non-unique model calculation result caused by principal component analysis or even antipodal calculation result. Compared with the RSEI model, the monitoring result of RO-RSEI model can better reflect the regional ecological changes. The improved model offers the possibility of monitoring ecological environment quality with remote sensing big data and provides a scientific basis for future scholars' batch computing.},

Abstract = {Riparian ecosystems have critical impacts on controlling the non-point source pollution and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a process oriented soil denitrification model was extended with algorithms from a simple nitrogen (N) cycle model and coupled to land surface remote sensing data to enhance its performance in spatial and temporal prediction of gaseous N emissions from soils in the riparian buffer zone surrounding the Guanting reservoir (China). The N emission model is based on chemical and physical relationships that govern the heat budget, soil moisture variations and nitrogen movement in soils. Besides soil water and heat processes, it includes nitrification. denitrification and ammonia (NH3) volatilization. SPOT-5 and Landsat-5 TM satellite data were used to derive spatial land surface information and the temporal variation in land cover parameters was also used to drive the model. A laboratory-scale anaerobic incubation experiment was used to estimate the soil denitrification model parameters for the different soil types. An in situ field-scale experiment was conducted to calibrate and validate the soil temperature, moisture and nitrogen sub-models. An indirect method was used to verify simulated N emissions, resulting in a coefficient of determination of R-2 = 0.83 between simulated and observed values. Then the model was applied to the whole riparian buffer zone catchment, using the spatial resolution (10 m) of the SPOT-5 image. Model sensitivity analysis showed that soil moisture was the most sensitive parameter for gaseous N emissions and soil denitrification was the main process affecting N losses to the atmosphere in the riparian area. From the aspect of land use management around the Guanting reservoir, the spatial structure and distribution of land cover and land use types in the riparian area should be adapted, to enhance faster ecological restoration of the wetland ecological system surrounding this strategically important water resource.

Abstract = {Globally, soil erosion is a significant problem contributing to nutrient loss, water quality degradation, and sand accumulation in water bodies. Currently, various climate factors are affecting the natural resources entire worldwide. Agricultural intensification, soil degradation, and some other human impacts all contribute to soil erosion, which is a significant issue. Management and conservation efforts in a watershed can benefit from a soil erosion study. Modeling can establish a scientific and accurate method to calculate sediment output and soil erosion below a variety of circumstances. The measured soil loss tolerance was compared to the risk of soil erosion (T value).In this study, GIS and remote sensing techniques have been integrated with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model to estimate soil loss in the Mayurakshi river basin of eastern India. To determine soil erosion-prone areas, rainfall, land use, and land cover maps, as well as a digital elevation model (DEM), were used as input. The annual soil loss in the basin area is estimated to be 4,629,714.8 tons. Accordingly, the study basin was categorized into five soil loss severity classes: very low (40.92\%), low (49\%), moderate (6.5\%), high (2.4\%) and very high (1.18\%) risk classes. Soil erosion rates ranged from very slight to slight throughout the majority of the region. The section of the basin's lower plain has been discovered to be least affected by soil loss. The results of study area can be helpful to conservation of soil management practices and watershed development program in the basin area.},

Abstract = {The occurrence and related risks from cyanobacterial blooms have increased world-wide over the past 40 years. Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities. In the present study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment phycocyanin (PC) using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Lake Chaohu (China's fifth largest freshwater lake). The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000-2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of <60\% for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 mu g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of <65\% for PC between 10 and 500 mu g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios (<29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same. Remote sensing cyanobacterial risk mapping provides a new tool for reservoir and lake management programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Trophic state index (TSI) is a vital parameter for aquatic ecosystem assessment. Estimating TSI by remote sensing is still a challenge due to the multivariate complexity of the eutrophication process. A comprehensive in situ spectral-biogeochemical dataset for 7 lakes in Northeast China was collected in October 2020. The dataset covers trophic states from oligotrophic to eutrophic, with a wide range of total phosphorus (TP, 0.07-0.2 mg L-1), Secchi disk depth (SDD, 0.1-0.78 m), and chlorophyll a (Chla, 0.11-20.41 mu g L-1). Here, we propose an empirical method to estimate TSI from remote sensing data. First, TP, SDD, and Chla were estimated by band ratio/band combination models. Then TSI was estimated using the Carlson model with a high R-2 (0.88), a low RMSE (3.87), and a low MRE (6.83\%). Synergistic effects between TP, SDD, and Chla dominated the trophic state, changed the distribution of light in the water column, affected the spectral characteristics. Furthermore, the contribution of each parameter for eutrophication were different among the studied lakes from ternary plot. High Chla concentration was the main reason for eutrophication in HMT Lake with 45.4\% of contribution more than the other two parameters, However, in XXK Lake, high TP concentrations were the main reason for eutrophication with 66.8\% of contribution rather than Chla and SDD. Overall, the trophic state was dominated by TP, and SDD accounted for 85.6\% of contribution in all sampled lakes. Additionally, we found using one-parameter index to evaluate the lake trophic state will lead to a great deviation, even with two levels of difference. Therefore, multi-parameter TSI is strongly recommended for the lake trophic state assessment. Summarily, our findings provide a theoretical and methodological basis for future large-scale estimations of lake TSI using satellite image data, help with water quality monitoring and management.

Title = {Evaluating the spatiotemporal variations of soil salinity in Sirjan Playa, Iran using Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 OLI imagery},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {231},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The creation of large-scale deserts is a consequence of soil salinization, a major land degradation phenomenon that also disrupts ecological equilibrium. Saline lands can be evaluated, mapped, and monitored in different world regions using satellite imaging and remote sensing techniques. In order to assess the ability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of electrical conductivity (EC) and to determine the importance of salinity indices for prediction in two seasons (summer and winter) using the systematic sampling method, from surface depth (0--20 cm), 90 soil samples were taken of marginal lands of Sirjan Playa, southeast of Iran. Satellite images for two seasons were acquired close to the sampling time to obtain the soil salinity indices. Four machine-learning algorithms, namely artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in soil salinity. Results confirmed that the ANN model developed by the Sentinel-2A image had the highest performance (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 16.1, NRMSE = 27.1) to predict ECe in the winter season. Furthermore, RF presents the lowest error for prediction ECe during the summer, independent type of satellite data used. Additionally, in virtually all of the analyzed models, the Sentinel-2A data produced lower RMSE and NRMSE values than the Landsat-8 data throughout the two seasons. Results also confirmed that among the soil salinity indices, the Vegetation Soil Salinity Index (VSSI) was identified as the most effective predictor. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of satellite imaging and machine learning algorithms for monitoring and predicting soil salinity, which can contribute to the sustainable management of marginal lands in arid and semi-arid regions. The findings also highlight the importance of selecting appropriate satellite data and salinity indices for accurate and reliable predictions.},

Abstract = {Earth observing satellites represent some of the most valued components of the international Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), both part of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In the United States, such satellites are a cornerstone of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), required to carry out advanced coastal and ocean research, and to implement and sustain sensible resource management policies based on science. Satellite imagery and satellite-derived data are required for mapping vital coastal and marine resources, improving maritime domain awareness, and to better understand the complexities of land, ocean, atmosphere, ice, biological, and social interactions. These data are critical to the strategic planning of in situ observing components and are critical to improving forecasting and numerical modeling. Specifically, there are several stakeholder communities that require periodic, frequent, and sustained synoptic observations. Of particular importance are indicators of ecosystem structure (habitat and species inventories), ecosystem states (health and change) and observations about physical and biogeochemical variables to support the operational and research communities, and industry sectors including mining, fisheries, and transportation. IOOS requires a strategy to coordinate the human capacity, and fund, advance, and maintain the infrastructure that provides improved remote sensing observations and support for the nation and the globe. A partnership between the private, government, and education sectors will enhance remote sensing support and product development for critical coastal and deep-water regions based on infrared, ocean color, and microwave satellite sensors. These partnerships need to include international research, government, and industry sectors in order to facilitate open data access, understanding of calibration and algorithm strategies, and fill gaps in coverage. Such partnerships will define the types of observations required to sustain vibrant coastal economies and to improve the health of our marine and coastal ecosystems. They are required to plan, fund, launch and operate the types of satellite sensors needed in the very near future to maintain continuity of observations.},

Title = {The Use of Sentinel-3 Imagery to Monitor Cyanobacterial Blooms},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) have been a concern for aquatic systems, especially those used for water supply and recreation. Thus, the monitoring of CHABs is essential for the establishment of water governance policies. Recently, remote sensing has been used as a tool to monitor CHABs worldwide. Remote monitoring of CHABs relies on the optical properties of pigments, especially the phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a). The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of recent launch the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on-board the Sentinel-3 satellite to identify PC and chl-a. To do this, OLCI images were collected over the Western part of Lake Erie (U.S.A.) during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. When comparing the use of traditional remote sensing algorithms to estimate PC and chl-a, none was able to accurately estimate both pigments. However, when single and band ratios were used to estimate these pigments, stronger correlations were found. These results indicate that spectral band selection should be re-evaluated for the development of new algorithms for OLCI images. Overall, Sentinel 3/OLCI has the potential to be used to identify PC and chl-a. However, algorithm development is needed.},

Title = {Effect of Mariculture on bio-optical properties and water quality of Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Marine cage aquaculture is gaining importance in India, due to its contribution as an alternate livelihood to coastal communities and also because of its export value. Water quality is the most important determinant for sustainable marine cage farming. Nutrient enrichment in coastal waters results in increased occurrence of algal blooms. A mariculture practice makes the coastal waters eutrophic due to increased input of nitrogen and phosphorous, ultimately leading to bloom. A phytoplankton bloom dominated by Trichodesmium species was detected outside mariculture cages located in Gulf of Mannar during August, 2015, which possibly interfered with fish gill function. High nutrient and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) (29.97 mg/m(3)) concentration were observed during peak bloom period. Three groups of phytoplankton were identified - diatoms (24 species with, 14 centric species and 10 pennate species), dinoflagellates (10 species) and cyanobacteria (one species). Stable salinity condition and the depletion in nutrient concentration due to higher primary production might have triggered the bloom of Trichodesmium. In-situ bio-optical measurements were also made to understand the spatial and temporal variation and effect of bloom on the optical components. Our study is a preliminary step to understanding the in-situ bio-geochemical and bio-optical characteristics of coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay, which could aid in the management of cage culture sites.

Abstract = {Proper management of valuable land resources is of paramount importance especially in regions affected by natural hazards. The sustainable development of land resources depends on the understanding of the processes and dynamics active within the landscape. In Southern African countries water shortage and water quality issues related to soil erosion are a major problem affecting the population in rural and urban areas. Consequently, during the last decade increasing attention has been focussed especially on such issues, and an increasing number of integrated hydrological and erosion studies, including the development and application of respective integrated regionalization. concepts, is reflecting this development. The present study deals with the regionalization of spatially distributed hydrological related erosion processes in the catchments of the Mkomazi river (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) and the Mbuluzi-river (Kingdom of Swaziland). It was carried out within the framework of an interdisciplinary EU-funded project developing an Integrated Water Resources Management System (IWRMS) in semiarid catchments of Southern Africa. Within this project the concept of ``Response Units (RUs){''} was applied and adapted as Erosion Response Units (ERUs) to regionalize the distribution of hydrologically induced soil erosion in space and time. ERUs are landscape model entities identifying relative homogeneous hydrological related erosion processes, thus providing a spatially distributed model structure for regionalization. The examples from Southern Africa presented in this paper discuss the methods used to delineate such Response Units integrating remote sensing and GIS techniques.},

Abstract = {A great challenge the US military land managers are often faced with is how to optimize road networks in order to maintain roads (including all roads, trails, and paths) for the purpose of military training and reducing negative impacts on environment. In this study, a methodology was developed to identify superfluous roads for being closed in terms of both sustainable military land carrying capacity and environment for Fort Riley. In this method, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and landscape analysis technologies were combined to derive various spatial data layers of factors that had significant impacts on both military training and environment. The factors included maintenance cost of roads, road access area, military training intensity, soil erosion, water quality, landscape fragmentation, and noise production. The factors were quantified and normalized. A spatial multicriteria decision was then developed to obtain the weights of the factors, combine the data layers, and derive a priority map of all the roads for being closed. This map summarized the negative and positive impacts of the factors on environment and military land carrying capacity and can provide the US military land managers with useful guidelines and tools for determining superfluous roads in terms of both sustainable military training and environment. It is expected this effort can provide a method to quickly ascertain which roads are most cost-effective for being closed without hindering the mission and at the same time with benefits for environmental protection and thus provide the land managers with a comprehensive analysis and assessment of alternatives at their disposal.

Abstract = {Earth Camp is a NASA-funded program that gives students and teachers opportunities to explore local, regional, and global earth change through a combination of hands-on investigations and the use of satellite images. Each summer, 20 middle school and 20 high school students participate in a two-week leadership program investigating contemporary issues (e.g., changes in river sheds, water quality, and land use management) through hands-on investigations, analyzing remote sensing data, and working with experts. Each year, 20 teachers participate in a year-long professional development program that includes monthly workshops, field investigations on Mt. Lemmon in Tucson, Arizona, and a week-long summer design workshop. Teachers conduct investigations of authentic questions using satellite images and create posters to present results of their study of earth change. In addition, teachers design lesson plans to expand their students' ability to investigate earth change with 21st Century tools. Lessons can be used as classroom exercises or for after-school club programs. Independent evaluation has been an integral part of program development and delivery for all three audiences, enabling the program staff and participants to reflect on and continually improve their practice and learning over the three year period.},

Abstract = {The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission represents NASA's next investment in satellite ocean color and the study of Earth's ocean-atmosphere system, enabling new insights into oceanographic and atmospheric responses to Earth's changing climate. PACE objectives include extending systematic cloud, aerosol, ocean biological and biogeochemical data records, making essential ocean color measurements to further understand marine carbon cycles and ecosystem responses to a changing climate, as well as improving knowledge of how aerosols influence ocean ecosystems and, conversely, how ocean ecosystems and photochemical processes affect the atmosphere. PACE objectives also encompass management of fisheries, large freshwater bodies, and water quality and reducing uncertainties in climate and radiative forcing models of the Earth system. PACE observations will also provide information on radiative properties of land surfaces and characterization of the vegetation and soils that dominate their reflectance. The primary PACE instrument - the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) - is a hyperspectral imaging radiometer that spans the ultraviolet to shortwave infrared, with a ground sample distance of 1-km at nadir. This includes continuous collection of spectra from 340 nm to 890 nm in 5 nm steps. The PACE payload is complemented by two multi-angle polarimeters with spectral ranges that span the visible to near-infrared region. Scheduled for launch in late 2022-to-early 2023, the PACE observatory will enable significant advances in the study of Earth's biogeochemistry, carbon cycle, clouds, hydrosols, and aerosols in the ocean-atmosphere system. We present a brief overview of the PACE mission, followed by a discussion of the capabilities and design concept of OCI.},

Abstract = {Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is widely recognized as an important habitat and indicator of water quality in large rivers and estuaries. Despite the perceived importance, system-wide assessments of cover, susceptibility to change, and ecological functioning are rare because of the geographical scope and multidisciplinary expertise required. A collaboration between scientists, estuarine managers, and environmental educators was initiated to map the SAV and the Eurasian water chestnut (Trapa natans) in the Hudson River estuary from Hastings-on-Hudson north to Troy, New York. These groups provided diverse scientific and estuarine management expertise to enable the first broad delimitation of SAV in the Hudson and sampling of beds to describe abundance, biomass, and species composition and to address management and education needs and opportunities. The areal extent of SAV based on a combination of 1995 and 1997 photographs in the study area was 1,802 hectares (4,453 acres), similar to6\% of the river area and similar to18\% of the shallows (defined as less than 3 meters deep at low tide). Trapa natans covered 575 hectares (1,421 acres), 2\% of the river area and 6\% of the shallows. In the most heavily vegetated portion of the Hudson (approximately 150-200 kilometers of river), the coverage by plants (both SAV and T natans) approached 25\% of the river bottom area. Results of this work have been integrated into the federal and state regulatory processes, local resource users, and local science education programs. Finally, we have initiated a volunteer SAV monitoring program.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing is a powerful tool, providing a truly synoptic view of surface water quality. Spectral enhancement of satellite images has improved significantly in recent years. In this research, satellite image data were used to detect, monitor and map different pollutants at five study sites along the El-Gamil beach including; El-Debba, El-Manasra, EI-Fardous and El-Gamil inlets and the El-Gamil airport. The images were rectified and analyzed by ERDAS IMAGINE 8.7. Image processing techniques were applied using ENVI 4.2 to analyze the SPOT image data (10 in resolution) for 2006. Image enhancement, principal component analysis (PCA), band ratios and supervised/unsupervised classifications were applied. Water quality degradation, due to high discharge volumes of domestic sewage and the absence of any substantive controls on the release of toxic materials, was monitored. Surface water samples were collected during the winter of 2005 and the summer of 2006. Water contamination was found to be higher in the summer than in the winter. SPOT image data from the summer, therefore, was selected to verify the results of heavy metal analysis. Six metals, at varying concentrations, were detected along the coast: iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). The highest concentrations were: Fe (896 mu g/l) at El Debba; Mn (198 mu g/l) at the El-Gamil airport; Cd (2.7 mu g/1) at El Fardous; Pb (56 mu g/l) at El Debba; Zn (300 mu g/l) at the El Gamil airport; Cu (19.3 mu g/l) in El Manasra. Chemical analyses verified the surface water contamination distinguished from the satellite data. El-Gamil airport, El Gamil and El Fardous inlets were the most polluted sites due to intensive discharge of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes. Different pollutants detected along the El Manasra and El Debba sites are associated with industrial development, and discharge from natural gas companies and electric power generating stations. Satellite imagery data were verified through a field investigation. Significant water pollution was recorded on the eastern side of the coast due to contaminants carried from the Damietta promontory by longshore currents and from other eastern cities by the reverse seasonal currents. Significant water pollution is not unique to this region of the Mediterranean Sea, but is increasingly common at coastal locations throughout the globe. To protect both the marine environment and commercial interests that depend on clean water and beaches (e.g., beach resorts), effective wastewater management practices must be designed, implemented and maintained, along with reasonable development policies. Remote sensing may be an important tool for monitoring the effectiveness of any pollution mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Improved retrieval of Secchi depth for optically-complex waters using remote sensing data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {77},

Abstract = {Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (Z(SD)) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution).The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CNOM)(442) ranging 1.7-4.0 m(-1)), Chl a concentration (0.5-73 mg m(-3)) and total suspended matter (0.7-37.5 g m(-3)) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < Z(SD) < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R-2). The accuracy increased (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when Z(SD) was retrieved via an empirical relationship between Z(SD) and K-d (490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when Z(SD) was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived Z(SD) product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the world of water resource management, commercially available hydroclimatic monitoring systems are large, expensive, and disconnected. The current technology is inaccessible to smaller community groups, citizen scientists, teachers, and even university researchers needing to collect real time or high density data. The HydroSense project aims to build an open-source hardware and software framework to enable hydroclimatic monitoring in a more cost effective manner. At present, several prototype system components have been designed, fabricated, and tested. Our design demonstrates that a complete hydroclimatic monitoring system can be deployed at 1/8th the cost of modern commercially available systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to interface with existing water quality sensors, allowing stakeholders the ability to use instruments they may already own.},

Title = {Remote sensing and GIS based analysis of temporal land use/land cover and water quality changes in Harike wetland ecosystem, Punjab, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {262},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Wetlands help in maintaining ecological balance in an area, but are shrinking fast all over the world. A study was conducted on the Harike wetland in Punjab state of India to analyze temporal changes in land use/land cover (LULC), water spread area and water pollution by using RS and GIS techniques. The LULC map of Harike wetland ecosystem covering an area of 22213.91 ha was prepared through on-screen visual interpretation of multispectral Resourcesat 2 LISS-IV satellite data (2014 and 2018) having spatial resolution of 5.8 m. Area under agriculture, forest and built up increased and that under waste land, water bodies and wetland decreased during 2014-18. The rate of increase in agricultural land was quite high (18.87 ha/year) during 2006-2014, but reduced to 3.53 ha/year during 2014-2018. The built up land increased comparatively at low rates (0.87 and 0.90 ha/year). Areas under waste land, water bodies and wetland decreased at the rate of 4.32, 1.61 and 13.80 ha/year during 2006-2014 and 2.37, 0.34 and 1.71 ha/year during 2014-2018, respectively. The water spread area of Harike wetland which was 4073 ha and 4166 ha in year 2002 and 2006 reduced to 3918.98 ha and 3910.56 ha in the year 2014 and 2018, respectively. However, wetland ponded area shrinked at a rate of 30.37 ha/year during 2006-2014 and 2.11 ha/year during the period 2014-2018. The area under low and medium turbidity increased by 22.02\% and 15.2\%, respectively, but decreased by 49\% under high turbidity during 2014-18. Wetland water was observed to be rich in macro and micronutrients. The pH, BOD and COD of wetland water increased by 0.51, 9.7 mg/l and 24 mg/l, respectively, during 2002-14 and by 0.03, 2.0 mg/l and 5.92 mg/l, respectively during 2014-18. Interaction between land use, water quality, water inflow, ground water and wetland area has also been studied. Intensive cultivation and declining groundwater levels in the area are negatively affecting the wetland. This necessitates regular monitoring of wetland structural components and water quality along with an urgent plan in place for conservation, rehabilitation and management of Harike wetland ecosystem in participatory mode.},

Abstract = {One of the important steps towards optimizing land productivity and water availability for the semi-arid and arid areas is the identification of potential sites for water harvesting. Therefore, this paper uses the Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques to select the optimized sites for water harvesting in Al-Qadisiyah Governorate, Iraq. Geographic water management capabilities are applied as a spatial analysis model. Data from global data repositories are retrieved followed by rescaling them to a spatial resolution to acquire a manageable input data set. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) model is used to calculate the potential runoff as an intermediate input. Multi-Criteria Evaluation techniques are adopted to identify the relative importance and suitability levels of the input parameters set to manage the water supply. The suitability for identifying irrigation pond and dam location(s) was considered in this study. To achieve this goal, the criteria for eligibility for water harvesting areas have been completed on the basis of the conditions in the study methods. Based on the hydrological and geomorphological standards of the study area, suitable sites for harvest areas were identified and it was divided into four classes in terms of their suitability for water harvesting, namely very low, low, moderate, and high suitable for water harvesting. It can be concluded that the findings of this research can be used to assist in water resources management as an efficient planning tool to ensure sustainable development of the water in Iraq who suffers from water shortages.},

Abstract = {A watershed is a fluvial geomorphological unit in which all the precipitation and streams drain into a common outlet such as the mouth of a bay or any point along a stream channel. Stream flow and the water quality of a river are affected by both anthropogenic and natural factors existing within the catchment area, hence it is vital to study watershed and its management. This includes identification of problems and issues impacting the natural resources of the watershed and recommending management solutions that will benefit the community, the economy and the environment and would bring about a sustainable development within the watershed. The present study seeks to generate various thematic maps in GIS domain like Drainage, Geomorphology, Road, Rail, Canal, Forest, Settlement, Land Use Land Cover etc. using high resolution satellite data (IRS LISS IV and Cartosat-1). The application of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to give suitable weightage value to various factors in each layer. In this paper, Land Resource Development Plan (LRDP) map has been generated to suggest conservation of forest, Farmbund, Social forestry etc. to protect soil loss, soil erosion and also Water Resource Development Plan (WRDP) map has been generated to suggest to make some structures like Canal, check dam, reservoir for the conservation of water resources. The future implication of the study would be to control damaging runoff and degradation of land and thereby conservation of soil and water.},

Abstract = {Providing high-resolution monitoring data is essential in promoting decision-making activities for surface water quality protection such as scientific modeling and data analysis. In this study, statistical models using multiple linear regression (MLR) were developed to estimate Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in a mesotrophic reservoir, the Yeongam Reservoir in Korea, from satellite observations. Two types of satellite data that covered different spectral regions, for wavelengths in 412-865nm (for the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) and those in 405-14,385nm (for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), were used as inputs for statistical models, after bias correction. The MLR models for Chl-a and TSS were initially constructed and evaluated with 39 image data-sets obtained during 2011-2014. Subsequently, they compared with their corresponding algorithms that were developed under different environmental settings as well as the CE-QUAL-W2 model, a numerical model of reservoir water quality. Sensitivity analysis showed that specific red and near-infrared wavelengths significantly contributed to improve the accuracy of the Chl-a and TSS estimates, respectively, along with those of blue and green bands typically used. The constructed MLR models showed better performance than the simulation model as well as the classical and recent bio-optical algorithms on average. In particular, poor prediction performance for total nitrogen and total phosphorus caused by a lack of adequate input data and description of transport mechanisms appeared to lower the accuracy of the Chl-a and TSS estimates in the simulation model. Therefore, these results demonstrate that statistical models developed from satellite observations can be used to rapidly screen local water quality and to provide high-quality data for reservoir water quality management.},

Abstract = {Ocean transparency, often measured using Secchi disk, is a useful index of water quality or productivity and is used in many environmental studies. The spaceborne ocean color sensors provide synoptic and regular radiometric data and can be used for applying environmental policies if the data is converted into relevant biogeochemical properties. We adapted and developed semi-analytical and empirical algorithms to estimate the Secchi depth from satellite ocean color data in both coastal and oceanic waters. The development of the algorithms is based on the use of a comprehensive in situ bio-optical dataset The algorithms are validated using an extensive set of coincident satellite estimates and in situ measurements of the Secchi depth (so-called matchups). More than 400 matchups are compiled for the MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors. The comparison between Secchi depth retrievals from remote sensing data and in situ measurements yields determination coefficients (R-2) between 0.50 and 0.73, depending on the sensor and algorithm. The type II linear regression slopes and intercepts vary between 0.95 and 1.46, and between -0.8 and 6.2 in, respectively. While semi-analytical algorithms provide the most promising results on in situ data, the empirical one proves to be more robust on remote sensing data because it is less sensitive to error due to erroneous atmospheric corrections. Using ocean color archives, one can derive maps of ocean transparency for different areas. Our climatology of the Secchi depth based on ocean color for the transition zone between the North Sea and Baltic Sea is compared to an historical dataset (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Assessing the impact of land use and land cover dynamics on water quality of Dal Lake, NW Himalaya, India},
Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},

Abstract = {A dynamic process like land use, if anthropogenically unsustainable, adversely affects the well-being of the land system. Worldwide, water bodies are facing imminent threat due to unsustainable anthropogenic activities. Water quality and ecology are the two characteristics of water bodies, if not preserved, shall have a direct consequence on the well-being of the human systems. Hence it is essential to understand the causes and consequences of the deteriorating water body systems. The condition is particularly grim in Himalayan water body ecosystems, where unplanned and unchecked urbanization has threatened their very existence. In the present study, the dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) and its impact on the water quality of Dal Lake in Kashmir Himalaya, India has been assessed. We carried out a detailed study wherein changing LULC is analyzed against the deteriorating trophic status of the Dal Lake using time-series of satellite imagery of the lake's catchment and its water quality data. Results indicated that the water quality of Dal Lake has remarkably deteriorated due to increased nutrient and sediment loads from the catchment, attributed to significant anthropogenic activities in the catchment. Due to unprecedented LULC changes in the catchment, the forest class shows a significantly negative change since the last four decades (1980-2018), corroborating with the ongoing deterioration of physicochemical characteristics of the lake. The analysis shows an increase in all the agents of eutrophication, such as NO3-N, TP, and COD, from 1990 to 2018. The decrease in forest, agriculture, and floating gardens was observed to show a significant negative correlation with the increase in the decadal average values of the COD, NO3-N, and TP for the same corresponding period. Similarly, a positive correlation was found between the increase in built-up, aquatic vegetation, bare surfaces, and these water quality parameters, establishing a strong relationship between the deteriorating condition of the lake and changing LULC. Our findings indicate that changing LULC of the lake's catchment is one of the critical factors that has significantly contributed toward the deteriorating ecology and water quality of the Dal Lake. This study shall contribute toward the development of the robust conservation strategy in order to save this urban lake from its untimely death.},

Abstract = {This study employs remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and spatial statistical modeling to structurally characterize urban growth and spatially understand its drivers in an effort to assess the outcome of the 1974 Tulsa Metropolitan Statistical Area (TMSA) comprehensive land use plan. Results demonstrate that the TMSA witnessed significant alterations in land use/land cover (LULC) spatial extent and structure over the assessment period and further illustrate that median household income, population density, sales, and construction cost are key drivers that influenced the structural character of LULC between 1990 and 2011. The assessment shows that the spatial and temporal patterns within development districts deviated from that prescribed in the comprehensive plan while spatial development within intensity corridors mirrors the goals and objectives set in the plan. Aberrations between plan objectives and outcomes can be attributed to upward mobility in financial status, growth in markets, and political climate.},

Title = {Testing and Validating the Suitability of Geospatially Informed Proxies on Land Tenure in North Korea for Korean (Re-)Unification},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {The role of remote sensing data in detecting, estimating, and monitoring socioeconomic status (SES) such as quality of life dimensions and sustainable development prospects has received increased attention. Geospatial data has emerged as powerful source of information for enabling both socio-technical assessment and socio-legal analysis in land administration domain. In the context of Korean (re-)unification, there is a notable paucity of evidence how to identify unknowns in North Korea. The main challenge is the lack of complete and adequate information when it comes to clarifying unknown land tenure relations and land governance arrangements. Deriving informative land tenure relations from geospatial data in line with socio-economic land attributes is currently the most innovative approach. In-close and in-depth investigations of validating the suitability of a set of geospatially informed proxies combining multiple values were taken into consideration, as were the forms of knowledge co-production. Thus, the primary aim is to provide empirical evidence of whether proposed proxies are scientifically valid, policy-relevant, and socially robust. We revealed differences in the distributions of agreements relating to land ownership and land transfer rights identification among scientists, bureaucrats, and stakeholders. Moreover, we were able to measure intrinsic, contextual, representational, and accessibility attributes of information quality regarding the associations between earth observation (EO) data and land tenure relations in North Korea from a number of different viewpoints. This paper offers valuable insights into new techniques for validating suitability of EO data proxies in the land administration domain off the reliance on conventional practices formed and customized to the specific artefacts and guidelines of the remote sensing community.},

Abstract = {Groundwater constitutes the key segment of freshwater assets of the world. With increasing urbanization across the globe, quality and quantity of groundwater are the issue of major concern. Water resources are highly dynamic and undergo significant changes with the changing land-use patterns. Rapid industrialization and population growth have strongly accelerated land-use changes globally and have a severe impact on groundwater resources. Accurate monitoring and management of groundwater resources is therefore required for the sustainable development of cities. Mapping groundwater resources is significant for the development and management of same. Estimation of Potential Groundwater zones, Assessment of Ground Water Quality, and Ground Water Vulnerability assessment are the key concerns for Groundwater management. Geospatial technologies have proven to be very useful in the development of optimal approaches for groundwater development, assessment, and management. Studies of various researchers have revealed that interrelated factors of lithology, lineaments or geologic structures and terrain features help in identifying themost promising sites for groundwater exploration. Remote Sensing studies facilitate delineating various geological, topographic, and structural features and further integration in the GIS environment to demarcate potential groundwater zones. Similarly, groundwater models created with sufficient groundwater quality data converted into GIS database give an accurate assessment of the spatial distribution of groundwater quality and changes with time and change in land-use. Information about vulnerability to contamination of groundwater can aid in selecting suitable sites for certain activities and thus minimizing adverse effects on groundwater. GIS-based vulnerability maps based on the subjective rating of hydrogeological factors are commonly used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability and can be effectively used for decision-making and proper groundwater planning. Therefore, an integrated approach including data-driven out from Remote Sensing, ground truth data, and hydrogeological GIS database and groundwater modeling using statistical techniques offers immense potential for groundwater mapping and management.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) have a wide range of applications in groundwater assessment, exploration, and resource management. Several other types of research targeting the water quality assessment in the study area have been done. However, the present work is the first attempt to delineate the groundwater potential zone using a different approach. This paper finds the way to identify the groundwater potential zone for Gundihalla watershed located in the hard rock region of Bellary district in Karnataka state. Various thematic layers such as geomorphology, lithology, land use and land cover (LULC), soil, drainage density, lineament density, rainfall, and slope were prepared for the study area. The various sub-criteria of each thematic layer were ranked based on their influence in the groundwater recharge, and each thematic layer was given a weightage, derived from the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The overall groundwater potential map for the study areas is obtained by performing a weighted overlay analysis of all the thematic layers. The resultant groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) map is further categorized into five different groundwater potential: very good (76\%) good (23.70\%), moderate (23.30\%), poor (18\%), and very poor (16.40\%). The obtained results were validated using groundwater fluctuation data for pre- and post-monsoon periods. The validation holds well for the methodology adopted. Thus, the results were utilized for carrying out water management through artificial recharge and further exploration approaches.},

Abstract = {This study is the first to document an algal bloom caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which was detected using remote sensing techniques and confirmed in the field along the coast of Elba National Park. Noctiluca scintillans is a phytoplankton species that accumulate toxic ammonia that endangers various organisms, including fish, birds, mammals, and human. Therefore, monitoring red tide is essential for water pollution control and management. This study aims to evaluate the potential of the recent launch of the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3 satellite to identify chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a proxy for an algal bloom event and study its impacts on the ecosystem. To fulfill the aim, OLCI images were collected over the study area from the 25th of May to the 13th of June 2017. Satellite images were converted from level 1 to level 2 through radiometric and atmospheric correction, and Chl-a maps were produced from the level 3 data during product development using standard Ocean Color 4 for MERIS (OC4Me) model. The time-series analyses of the Sentinel-3 satellite images indicated that the algal blooms (Red tide) event occurred four days at the studied sites (7th to 10th of June). The current findings reveal a strong relationship between the deterioration in water quality criteria and Noctiluca scintillans cell counts (x104) /L (0.05 > P \& LE; 0.01). This study strongly urges routine monitoring of the physicochem-ical characteristics of coastal waters and using remote sensing techniques for early rid tide detection to control the phenomenon.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing \& Space Science.

Title = {Comparative approach of decision tree and CWQI analysis for classification of groundwater with a special reference to fluoride ion in drought-prone Boudh district of Odisha, India},

Abstract = {Major population in the Boudh district of Odisha, India basically depends upon groundwater for various household needs. The presence of underlying hard-rock terrain increases the scarcity, and fluoride content in the groundwater. Hydrochemical studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality of groundwater using GIS. A field reconnaissance survey has been done for assessing water table conditions. The presence of fluoride in groundwater varies from 0.239 to 4.20 mg/L before the monsoon and 0.184-3.75 mg/L after the monsoon period. Fluoride (F-) ion content is found to be more in samples of the pre-monsoon period than post-monsoon due to the dilution in the rainy season. The statistical analysis has directed that fluoride ion has a positive correlation with bicarbonate (HCO3), TA, Sodium (Na) and pH. The suitability of this groundwater is further examined and analysed with World Health Organization (WHO) standard. Various groundwater samples were cross-examined with high-end analytical techniques. A computational decision tree approach of data mining with an accuracy of 92.68\% has been used to confirm the classification result of groundwater of different categories calculated through statistical analysis. The experiment through decision tree (J48) classification algorithm and Canadian water quality index (CWQI) concluded that 2 areas contain good quality of groundwater, 19 areas contain the fair quality of groundwater, 70 areas are considered marginal for drinking and only 11 areas contain poor water quality.},

Title = {An integrated study on change detection and environment evaluation of surface water},
Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Surface water pollution is one of the serious environment pollution problems, posing threat to human and other creatures. Extraction, change detection and environment evaluation of surface water are prerequisite for water resource management. Undoubtedly, remote sensing data play an important role in these researches because of its large geographic coverage and high temporal frequency. In this study, the Tianjin Binhai New Area was chosen as the study area and the surface water extraction method Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was used by combining with adaptive dynamic threshold to extract surface water and detect its change. Comparing with single-band threshold, model of multi-band spectral relationship, Iterative Self-organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm and MNDWI, MNDWI-based adaptive dynamic threshold method performed better, which considered the influence of background. Analysis on dynamic change of water showed the area of lake and river had increased and the area of seawater had decreased. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis between area change of surface water and impact factors indicated both climatic and anthropogenic factors made positive contribution to the present water environment situation. Finally, an improved model of surface water environment evaluation was established to evaluate water quality by combining genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation (BP) neural network model. And the test results proved that the optimized GA-BP neural network is better than the single BP neural network. The environment evaluation indicated that water quality of the Haihe River section in the study area was poor. Therefore, water environment protection should be strengthened in this area. Some suggestions on practical management were given accordingly.},

Abstract = {Eutrophication of lakes is an environmental issue that has attracted increasing attention all over the world. This study analyses the monitoring data of the Lake Erhai, Yunnan Province in China with Carlson's TSI, Improving Carlson's TSI (TSIM) and TLI. The results reveal that the eutrophication index for this lake is in the Mesotrophic status. The mechanism of the eutrophication in Lake Erhai is also investigated. The mechanism shows that rate of nutrient transformation is the core issue and the process of eutrophic evolution involves natural, social, and economic factors. The restrictions on sustainable development in Lake Erhai are discussed. To maintain sustainable development, green watershed construction (GWC) and its corresponding effective measures are proposed. Moreover, lessons learned from Lake Erhai watershed management are presented, to provide valuable experiences for alleviating water pollution caused by insufficient environmental management during rapid economic development. Perspective future research works are proposed, including establishment of the early warning system with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) as well as the artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

Abstract = {Collecting samples manually and sending them to the laboratory for analysis represents the traditional method of water quality testing. However, nowadays, it has been unable to fulfill the needs of water quality. An innovative project has been initiated to monitor floods and water quality in Tunisia in order to meet the current water resources management automation and remote monitoring requirements. It presents an application for the international space project initiative HumSat and GENSO network. The aim of this initiative is monitoring the environment of our planet. This system consists of three segments: spatial segment including the constellation HumSat, ground segment entailing the ground station and user segment which contains platforms and scientific users. The platform is equipped with multi-parameter sensors of water quality testing, GPS, microcontroller, communication module and other accessories. Various parameters such as level and water quality can be detected under the control of these platforms all the day. This instrument collects the hydrological information and sends it to the satellite. The download of this data is obtained by ground station included in GENSO network. Finally, users will retrieve the data via internet. The real time data will be acquired and processed for statistic, analysis, curve and well management for surface water in Tunisia. In this paper, we discuss the use of space technology in the hydrodynamic and physico-chemical data collection on the Tunisian territory. This system presents many benefits such as hydrological forecasting and operation of hydrological networks as well as the possibility to launch scientific experiments related to water to hydrologists.},

Abstract = {The status quo in forestry practice is to leave standard width buffers around water bodies in order to prevent the excess transport of sediments and nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic systems. This practice does not seem to be effective in the sub-humid boreal forest where climatic and physiographic variability produces complex hydrologic pathways not well protected by standard width buffers. We developed a remote sensing technique that forms a hydrologic basis for buffer strip design. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was used to map, both inundated and saturated areas (herein called wet areas) amenable for surface transport of nutrients and sediments on a low relief landscape in northern Alberta, Canada. Wet areas coverage of the Moose Lake drainage basin showed a semi-logarithmic relationship with daily discharge (r(2) = 0.72, p < 0.001, n = 18). This relationship was used to define a flow-duration curve for wet areas that could be used as an aspatial assessment of what proportion of a drainage basin should be protected. A probability map of wet areas formation was calculated from the database of 18 images. We demonstrated how the probability map may be used to design adaptive buffer strips for the mitigation of increased nutrient loading to boreal lakes following timber harvesting.

Abstract = {This paper is focused on the monitoring of the diffuse pollution characteristics from the agricultural land confining the River Yamuna in Delhi (capital of India). Agricultural fields surrounding the Yamuna river are direct nonpoint source of pollution impacting the river quality. The study includes watershed delineation for the River Yamuna using SWAT (2005) and land use classification for the city using GIS and remote sensing. Thereafter, the rainfall-runoff pollutant concentrations from the mixed agricultural land use were assessed for the 2006 and 2007 monsoon period (July-September). Runoff was measured using SCS method and grab samples of rainfall runoff were collected at three stations namely Old Delhi Railway Bridge (ODRB), Nizamuddin and Okhla bridge in Delhi. The samples were analysed for physico-chemical and biological parameters. Rainfall runoff and event mean concentrations (EMCs) for different water quality parameters were characterized and the effect of land use was analyzed. The average EMCs for BOD, COD, ammonia, nitrate, TKN, hardness, TDS, TSS, chlorides, sulfates, phosphate, fluorides and TC were 21.82 mg/L, 73.48 mg/L, 72.68 mu g/L, 229.87 mu g/L, 15.32 mu g/L, 11.36 mg/L, 117.44 mg/L, 77.60 mg/L, 117.64 mg/L, 135.82 mg/L, 0.08 mg/L, 0.85 mg/L and 2,827.47 MPN/100 mL, respectively. The EMCs of TSS, nitrogen and its compounds, phosphate and BOD were high.},

Abstract = {Earth observations can help reduce the loss of life and property from natural and human induced disasters through increasing our understanding of complex environmental systems. In this context, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is being built through the coordination of efforts within the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO), comprised of 80 Member States, the European Commission and 58 Participating Organizations, established in February 2005. The 10-Year Implementation Plan defines a vision statement for GEOSS, its purpose and scope, expected benefits for nine ``Societal Benefit Areas{''} (SBAs) (disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity), technical and capacity building priorities, and the GEO governance structure. The full value of GEOSS lies in its ability to integrate information across disciplines. Thus, GEOSS is concerned with: interlinking weather forecasting systems with other Earth observation systems; supporting efforts to advance sustainable energy; and devising end-to-end information services and sustained observing systems essential for addressing climate variability and change. The international collaborative framework of GEO allows: water experts to define the data and systems needed for improved water-cycle forecasting; international teams to monitor ecosystems and generate maps and other decision support tools; development of an Agricultural Monitoring System of Systems that will integrate in-situ and space data from multiple fields; and comprehensive monitoring critical to the conservation and sustainable use of the world's biological diversity. In particular, in the field of water, unique regional cooperative approaches are now on-going and under planning for making maximum use of, and contributing to, GEOSS. The current GEO Work Plan furnishes the blueprint for activities to implement GEOSS, and provides concrete examples of how decision makers can use the data and services available through GEOSS to address major global opportunities and challenges. This is why GEO strives to develop a GEOSS that would serve the needs of all SBAs through interconnecting existing and future Earth observation systems, interlinking observation systems, and promotion of open data sharing.},

Abstract = {Human activities and climate changes significantly affect our environment, altering hydrologic cycles. Several environmental, social, political, and economical factors contribute to land transformation as well as environmental changes. This study first identified the most critical factors that affect the environment in Al-Anbar city including population growth, urbanization expansion, bare land expansion, and reduction in vegetation cover. The combination of remote sensing data and fuzzy analytic hierarch process (Fuzzy AHP) enabled exploration of land transformations and environmental changes in the study area during 2001 to 2013 in terms of long and short-term changes. Results of land transformation showed that the major changes in water bodies increased radically (94 \%) from the long-term change in 2001 to 2013 because of water policies. In addition, the urban class expanded in two short-term periods (2001-2007 and 2007-2013), representing net changes of 46 and 60 \%, respectively. Finally, barren land showed 25 \% reduction in the first period because of the huge expansion of water in the lake; a small percentage of growth gain was observed in the second period. Based on the land transformation results, the environmental degradation assessment showed that the study area generally had high level of environmental degradation. The degradation was mostly in the center and the north part of the study area. This study suggested for further studies to include other factors that also responsible for environmental degradation such as water quality and desertification threatening.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the impact of changing land use/land cover (LULC) on the hydrological processes in Dal lake catchment of Kashmir Himalayas by integrating remote sensing, simulation modelling and extensive field observations. Over the years, various anthropogenic pressures in the lake catchment have significantly altered the land system, impairing, inter-alia, sustained biotic communities and water quality of the lake. The primary objective of this paper was to help a better understanding of the LULC change, its driving forces and the overall impact on the hydrological response patterns. Multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data for 1992 and 2005 was used for determining the spatio-temporal dynamics of the lake catchment. Geographic Information System (GIS) based simulation model namely Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) was used to model the hydrological processes under the LULC conditions. We discuss spatio-temporal variations in LULC and identify factors contributing to these variations and analyze the corresponding impacts of the change on the hydrological processes like runoff, erosion and sedimentation. The simulated results on the hydrological responses reveal that depletion of the vegetation cover in the study area and increase in impervious and bare surface cover due to anthropogenic interventions are the primary reasons for the increased runoff, erosion and sediment discharges in the Dal lake catchment. This study concludes that LULC change in the catchment is a major concern that has disrupted the ecological stability and functioning of the Dal lake ecosystem.},

Title = {Exploring the Influence Mechanism of Meteorological Conditions on the Concentration of Suspended Solids and Chlorophyll-a in Large Estuaries Based on MODIS Imagery},
Journal = {WATER},

Abstract = {In estuary areas, meteorological conditions have become unstable under the continuous effects of climate change, and the ecological backgrounds of such areas have strongly been influenced by anthropic activities. Consequently, the water quality of these areas is obviously affected. In this research, we identified periods of fluctuation of the general meteorological conditions in the Yangtze River Estuary using a wavelet analysis. Additionally, we performed a spatiotemporal evaluation of the water quality in the fluctuating period by using remote sensing modeling. Then, we explored how the fluctuating meteorological factors affect the distribution of total suspended solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration. (1) The results show that from 2000 to 2015, temperature did not present significant fluctuations, while wind speed (WS) and precipitation (PR) presented the same fluctuation period from January 2012 to December 2012. (2) Based on the measured water sample data associated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, we developed a water quality algorithm and depicted the TSS and Chla concentrations within the WS and PR fluctuating period. (3) We found that the TSS concentration decreased with distance from the shore, while the Chla concentration showed an initially decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend; moreover, these two water quality parameters presented different inter-annual variations. Then, we discussed the correlation between the changes in the TSS and Chla concentrations and the WS and PR variables. The contribution of this research is reflected in two aspects: 1. variations in water quality parameters over a wide range of water bodies can be evaluated based on MODIS data; 2. data from different time periods showed that the fluctuations of meteorological elements had different impacts on water bodies based on the distance from the shore. The results provide new insights for the management of estuary water environments.},

Abstract = {The importance of groundwater is growing based on an increase in need and decrease in the availability of fresh surface water sources and adequate rainfall. Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) has become one of the leading tools in the field of hydrogeological science, which helps in assessing, monitoring and conserving groundwater resources. This paper describes the results of a groundwater potentiality and quality assessment conducted in Koduvan Ar sub-watershed of Meenachil river basin, Kottayam district of Kerala state, in the Republic of India. Shallow groundwater is the main source of drinking water in urban and rural areas, but reliable spatial data on its potentiality and quality are currently insufficient for developing the water-supply systems with standard designs. The methodology used in the present study includes an integrated approach of remote sensing and GIS for the construction of groundwater potentiality map and the assessment of water quality of identified wells. Different spatial data layers such as, geomorphology, lithology, slope and land use/ land cover are generated and the interrelationship between these layers were analyzed to identify and assess the groundwater potentiality of the area. The final result depicts the favourable prospective zones in the study area with its quality parameters and can be helpful to formulate recommendations to reduce the water scarcity and quality risks for public health.},

Abstract = {Karst water is an important resource for drinking water supply. To determine the impacts of urbanization on karst water quality, we performed a case study in the rapidly urbanized Guiyang-Anshun region, Guizhou province, southwestern China. We interpret data from regional reconnaissance and long-term monitoring related to major ion chemistry, stable isotopes (Sr, C, S (for SO42-), and N and O (for NO3-)), remote sensing, and socio-economic development. We identify groundwater SO42- and NO3- sources by combined use of delta S-34 and Ca2+/Na+ molar ratio and delta N-15 and NO3-/Na+ ratio, respectively. We find that carbonate, sulfide, silicate, and gypsum weathering, anthropogenic inputs, and hydrodynamic conditions account for karst water composition and its seasonal variations. Atmospheric N and S deposition, nitrification of soil N, and sulfide oxidation control the background levels of groundwater NO3- and SO42-. The elevated concentrations of NO3- and SO42- at residential sites in rural and urban areas mainly arise from domestic sewage. Nitrification and fertilizer application are major reasons for the high levels of NO3- in regional groundwater systems. Vegetated/forested land area decreases as constructed land area increases, which results in declining biogenic CO2 production and inputs into the aquifer. Although the local government has attempted to control SO2 emissions, substantial increases in fossil fuel utilization and fertilizer consumption as well as population growth may have increased atmospheric HNO3 deposition and induced increasingly severe contamination of groundwater with NO3- and SO42-. Our results improve the understanding of urbanization impacts on water quality and are important for water resource management in karst regions.},

Title = {Environmental consequences of dam construction: a case study from Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the variation in the vegetation cover as a result of the construction of Wadi Baish Dam, Saudi Arabia by the remote sensing techniques and geographic information system. The variations in soil physical and chemical properties as well as irrigation water quality were also investigated. The results show that the soil morphological, physical, and chemical characteristics were affected by dam construction. The data reveal that area under the green cover in Wadi Baish declined from 23.7 km(2) in 2005 to 13.3 km(2) in 2013 before and after the construction of Baish Dam, respectively. Moreover, soil salinity level (ECe) and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were increased following the dam construction. In addition, soil texture, soil organic matter content, and soil macro-(P and K) and micro-(Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) nutrient availability were changed after dam construction. In the surface layer of soil, the clay content decreased from 156-211 ( before the dam construction) to 56-106 g kg(-1) (after the dam construction). However, the sand content increased from 279-344 to 869-944 g kg(-1) before and after dam construction, respectively. The soil organic matter content decreased from 6.8-11.0 to 0.5-7.2 g kg(-1). It was concluded that the dam construction raised the salinity level in soil and underground water level and thus caused negative environmental and agricultural changes. A proper management is necessary after dam construction to improve soil fertility and prevent soil and water from salinization in Wadi Baish, Saudi Arabia.},

Title = {Climate change/variability and hydrological modelling studies in Zimbabwe: a review of progress and knowledge gaps},
Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper reviews developments in climate science and hydrological modelling studies in Zimbabwe over the past 29 years in an effort to expose knowledge gaps within this research domain. We initially give a global and regional overview and then follow a systematic thematic approach in reviewing specifically online published, peer-reviewed journal articles on climate change/variability and hydrological modelling in Zimbabwe. The state and progress towards advanced integrated climate and hydrological modelling research are assessed, tracking benchmarks in the research methodologies (tools and techniques) used therein including geographic information systems and remote sensing. We present descriptive summaries of key findings, highlighting the main study themes (categories) and general conclusions arising from these studies while examining their implications for future climate and hydrological modelling research in Zimbabwe. Challenges associated with climate and hydrological modelling research in Zimbabwe are also briefly discussed and the main knowledge gaps in terms of research scope and methodologies employed in the reviewed studies also exposed. We conclude by presenting plausible potential areas of focus in updating and advancing scientific knowledge to better understand the climate-land use-hydrology nexus in Zimbabwe. While this paper is primarily relevant for researchers, the general findings are also important for policy-makers since it exposes potential areas for policy intervention or agenda setting in as far as climate and hydrology science research is concerned so as to effectively address pertinent questions in this domain in Zimbabwe.},

Title = {Ocean Color Continuity From VIIRS Measurements Over Tampa Bay},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Ocean color continuity calls for consistent observations from multiple sensors in order to establish a seamless data record to address earth science questions. Currently, both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites are being operated well beyond their designed five-year mission life, and they have shown signs of sensor degradation. It is thus urgent to evaluate whether the most recently launched Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument (2011 to present) can provide consistent observations should MODIS instruments stop functioning. In this study, the consistency between MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS measurements over the Tampa Bay estuary (similar to 1000 km(2)) is assessed for remote sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr(-1)), chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla, mg . m(-3)), and absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (a(g)(443), m(-1)). While Rrs was derived as a standard National Aeronautics and Space Administration product from the SeaDAS software package (reprocessing version R2013.0), Chla and a(g)(443) were estimated using the recently developed regional algorithms for Tampa Bay. Time-series analysis and statistics both showed that the two sensors provided consistent measurements for most products evaluated, with unbiased mean percentage differences of < 25\% and mean annual biases within -9\% (except for one of the eight cases) for large dynamic ranges in Chla (1.0-20 mg . m(-3)) and a(g)(443) (0.1-1.5 m(-1)) in all four bay segments. These estimates are comparable or better than those derived from satellite-in situ comparisons, suggesting that VIIRS will provide observations consistent with MODIS, ensuring ocean color continuity and seamless data records for Tampa Bay. Such observations are crucial in establishing a long-term satellite-based water quality decision matrix for Tampa Bay.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Inland water is fundamental for the conservation of flora and fauna and is a source of drinking water for humans; therefore, monitoring its quality and ascertaining its status is essential for making decisions in water resources management. As traditional measuring methods present limitations in monitoring with high spatial and temporal coverage, using satellite images to have greater control over lake observation can be a handy tool and have satisfactory results. The study of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has been widely used to ascertain the quality of the inland aquatic environment using remote sensing, but in general, it depends on the local conditions of the water body. In this study, the suitability of the Sentinel-2 MSI sensor for Chl-a estimation in a lake in south-central Chile is tested. An empirical approach is proposed, applying multiple linear regressions, comparing the efficiency and performance with L1C and L2A products, separating the equations constructed with spring-summer and fall-winter data, and restricting Chl-a ranges to those measured in the field to generate these regressions. The algorithms combining spectral bans proved to have a good correlation with Chl-a measured in the field, generally resulting in R-2 greater than 0.87 and RMSE and MAE with errors less than 6 mu g L-1. The spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations at the study site was obtained based on the proposed equations.},

Title = {Determination of optically inactive water quality variables using Landsat 8 data: A case study in Geshlagh reservoir affected by agricultural land use},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {247},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Water chemical variables such as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) are soluble and are optically inactive. Remote sensing (RS) technique is able to monitor the optical activity of water but it has limited capability to monitor the TN and TP concentrations. In order to determine the TN and TP concentrations of Geshlagh Reservoir (GR), RS was used. The other water quality variables that were utilized included chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk depth (SDD) and total suspended solids (TSS). These variables are optically active and have a high correlation coefficient with TN and TP concentrations. The five images of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) taken at different times were used. Artificial neural network (ANN) model and linear regression (LR) model were utilized to determine the relationship of OLI data and TP and TN concentrations in GR. Results showed that the TN and TP concentrations have a high correlation with chlorophyll-a concentration. The spectral reflectance of bands ratio (band3/band2) and the single band of bands 3 and 4 were obtained as the most suitable bands to determine the chlorophyll-a concentration in GR. Compared with LR model, the accuracy of the ANN model was higher in the testing phase of TP prediction with R = 0.81 and TN prediction with R = 0.93. It can be concluded that the Landsat 8 OLI data has a high potential to provide the data of solubility variables of the water quality for the management of reservoirs. The contribution of this paper is that the developed ANN model will improve the prediction accuracy of inactive water quality variables based on the RS data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This study attempts to assess the influence of changing land-use patterns on the groundwater quality of the hard rock aquifer system in the Maheshwaram watershed, near Hyderabad, India. The study area is a rapidly urbanizing region with land development progressing at a fast pace. To study the impact of this rapid urbanization and overall land-use transition, a groundwater quality index (GQI) was prepared within a geographical information system (GIS). The GQI integrates the different water quality parameters to give a final index value that can be used for spatio-temporal comparisons. The land-use transitions were closely monitored from 2003 to 2008 using multispectral satellite images. The land-use pattern has changed drastically with an increase in the built-up area at the expense of other land uses. The analysis reveals a rapid deterioration of groundwater quality related mainly to the increase in built-up land with unsewered sanitation and poultry farms. Seasonal variability of the groundwater quality was also assessed. Mean GQI decreased from 84.16 to 83.26 over a period of 5 years from 2003 to 2008, while seasonal variability of water quality increased. GQI and Seasonal Variability of water quality were integrated in GIS to yield a groundwater sustainability map, in terms of water quality. Zones of sustainable and unsustainable groundwater use were demarcated for better decision making related to municipal land allotment in this rapidly urbanizing region.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a vision-aided motion planning and control framework for the efficient monitoring and surveillance of water surfaces using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The ultimate goal of the proposed strategy is to equip the UAV with the necessary autonomy and decision-making capabilities to support First Responders during emergency water contamination incidents. Toward this direction, we propose an end-to-end solution, based on which the First Responder indicates visiting and landing waypoints, while the envisioned strategy is responsible for the safe and autonomous navigation of the UAV, the refinement of the way-point locations that maximize the visible water surface area from the onboard camera, as well as the on-site refinement of the appropriate landing region in harsh environments. More specifically, we develop an efficient waypoint-tracking motion-planning scheme with guaranteed collision avoidance, a local autonomous exploration algorithm for refining the way-point location with respect to the areas visible to the drone's camera, water, a vision-based algorithm for the on-site area selection for feasible landing and finally, a model predictive motion controller for the landing procedure. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated via a set of simulated and experimental scenarios using an octorotor UAV.},

Abstract = {Urban planning to solve environmental problems in Latin American cities requires information that commonly does not exist or, if it does exist, is at different scales, which makes the information incomparable. Therefore, a quantitative approach is proposed to assess an urban environmental quality index (UEQI) for Cali, Colombia, integrating remote sensing and census data. Landsat TM images were used to extract biophysical indicators: land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), leaf wetness content index (LWCI), normalized humid index (NHI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI). These seven indicators were integrated with seven socioeconomic indicators obtained from census data using multivariate statistical analysis to determine the UEQ index at the commune level. The results showed consistent correlation among the indicators, and the highest values of UEQI occurred in communes with less built-up areas and more green areas. There were statistically significant differences among the index at the commune level. Therefore, communes were categorized into five classes (very good, good, moderate, poor and very poor environmental quality) according to the index to determine the most critical interventions to be made by planning and decision-making institutions. This method could be applied to similar cities using large-scale administrative units.},

Abstract = {Coastal zone is characterized by its complicated physical processes and fragile ecological environment because of its land-sea interactive environment, and more and more population and social-economic properties have been attracted to this area because of its advantageous geographic location. Various human activities have brought many kinds of environmental problems, among of which water pollution has become a key trouble in the coastal area of the world. In this paper the discussion focused on the framework of coastal water management system and its kernel function spatio-temporal analysis based on RS/GIS technology and statistical software. The Pearl River estuary and its adjacent coastal waters of Hong Kong were taken as a case, software ArcGIS was employed as a basic platform for developing the coastal water environment system and spatial analysis, Geo-database was used to manage the temporal-spatial data, ERDAS IMAGINE and SPSS were used to analyze the temporal-spatial data. A related-data model was proposed to solve the problem of data communication between ArcMap and SPSS, which is a basis of spatio-temporal analysis. Data mainly came from remote sensed images and monitoring program of water quality in the study area. Two parameters, suspended solids and DO, were selected to discuss the spatio-temporal analysis. The spatio-temporal analysis of suspended solids was based on 152 suspended solids concentration maps revised from the remote sensed images NOAA/AVHRR in the time period of 1995 and 2000, and the result showed that the spatio-temporal dynamics of suspended solids can spatially quantify the distribution and diffusion of land-source materials and direct the movement of the coastal waters. The buffering analysis of DO in 2001 showed that an obviously offshore increment and the lowest levels mainly appeared within 1 km in the near shore waters. Those analyses can provide with scientific information to coastal water environment management and decision making.},

Abstract = {Ocean color remote sensing is an important tool to monitor water quality and biogeochemical conditions of ocean. Atmospheric correction, which obtains water-leaving radiance from the total radiance measured by satellite-borne or airborne sensors, remains a challenging task for coastal waters due to the complex optical properties of aerosols and ocean waters. In this paper, we report a research algorithm on aerosol and ocean color retrieval with emphasis on coastal waters, which uses coupled atmosphere and ocean radiative transfer model to fit polarized radiance measurements at multiple viewing angles and multiple wavelengths. Ocean optical properties are characterized by a generalized bio-optical model with direct accounting for the absorption and scattering of phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and non-algal particles (NAP). Our retrieval algorithm can accurately determine the water-leaving radiance and aerosol properties for coastal waters, and may be used to improve the atmospheric correction when apply to a hyperspectral ocean color instrument.

Abstract = {Satellite remote sensing has a particularly important role: many initiatives are now operating and others, with more advanced technological possibilities, are planned, often being the result of international co-operation. In this context it is necessary to establish an appropriate regulation of these activities, as the interests at stake are considerably divergent. Industrialised countries are in fact able to play an active role in the development of space activities, while developing countries, not holding the necessary technology, more or less passively witness such activities. The most controversial point is the interpretation of the principle of sovereignty, from which both parties move to reach opposite results. In favour of the industrialised countries one can invoke the principles of exploration and use on a non discriminatory basis, laid down by the Outer Space Treaty and also by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, without mentioning the social and economic opportunities deriving from the development of activities bringing considerable benefits to mankind. It is equally true, though, that other principles exist, asserted to the point of sustain their common law status, such as the principle of permanent sovereignty on natural resources and the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of other States, which are the foundation on which the claims of the sensed States are based. My paper, taking into special consideration the UN Gen. Ass. Resolution 41/65 of 1986 on the ``Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from the Outer Space{''}, would illustrate how the international co-operation is pushed on. The Principles on Remote Sensing of the United Nations do not mention the issues concerning the international commercialisation of the data, the notion of public benefit or intellectual property. The use of the data and the packaging of the relevant products require great investments by the industries and the latter are not willing to make these investments if a legal protection of the products and a technological followup for at least ten years is not assured. The most frequent form of protection of the remote sensing data, protecting from improper appropriation, reproduction and distribution, is the right of intellectual property. We will consider the remote sensing data protection foreseen in the United States, France, ESA and for primary data by an European Directive. A wider and inexpensive distribution of remote sensing data concerning the protection of the Earth's environment may be a concrete realisation of the international co-operation which extends to all countries the benefits deriving from a peaceful use out outer space. The market of space data concerning Earth observation is in full progress and it has not yet reached a sufficient maturity for the application of the laws of the market. At present the procedures change considerably from one country to another, and at times from one operator to another in the same country; they vary according to the nature of the data of the programs, of the categories of the users or of the use of the information. For the purpose of this study we shall consider the policy of the United States and of France and of the ESA, which have launched remote sensing satellites in outer space for the longest time, in order to stress the apparent differences. The study of the most emblematic data distribution policies shows an increasingly strong opening, albeit carried out in different manners, in favour of research in disciplines concerning the Earth. The initiatives of rules of the European Union concerning satellite data and the protection of environment prove the developing interest in this sector for a growing international co-operation.},

Abstract = {Hydrilla is an invasive aquatic plant that has rapidly spread through many inland water bodies across the globe by outcompeting native aquatic plants. The negative impacts of hydrilla invasion have become a concern for water resource management authorities, power companies, and environmental scientists. The early detection of hydrilla infestation is very important to reduce the costs associated with control and removal efforts of this invasive species. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a tool for rapid, frequent, and large-scale monitoring and predicting spatial extent of hydrilla habitat. This was achieved by integrating in situ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager satellite data for Lake J. Strom Thurmond, the largest US Army Corps of Engineers lake east of the Mississippi River, located on the border of Georgia and South Carolina border. The predictive model for presence of hydrilla incorporated radiometric and physical measurements, including remote-sensing reflectance, Secchi disk depth (SDD), light-attenuation coefficient (K-d), maximum depth of colonization (Z(c)), and percentage of light available through the water column (PLW). The model-predicted ideal habitat for hydrilla featured high SDD, Z(c), and PLW values, low values of K-d. Monthly analyses based on satellite images showed that hydrilla starts growing in April, reaches peak coverage around October, begins retreating in the following months, and disappears in February. Analysis of physical and meteorological factors (i.e., water temperature, surface runoff, net inflow, precipitation) revealed that these parameters are closely associated with hydrilla extent. Management agencies can use these results not only to plan removal efforts but also to evaluate and adapt their current mitigation efforts.},

Abstract = {Accurate habitat mapping methods are urgently required for the monitoring, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems and their associated services. This study focuses on exposed intertidal seagrass meadows, which play a major role in the functioning of nearshore ecosystems. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) data, we demonstrate that satellite remote sensing can be used to map seagrass percent cover (SPC) and leaf biomass (SB), and to characterize its seasonal dynamics. In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The po-tential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14\%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, influenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC >= 50\% and SPC >= 80\% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (<= 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal ecosystem management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are proposed.},

Title = {Long-term characteristics of water quality around the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area: Spatiotemporal variations and meteorological effects},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {216},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Monitoring the coastal water quality (CWQ) and determining the effects of meteorological factors (MF) on the long-term CWQ adjacent to urban agglomerations are key topics in coastal monitoring and management. This study used satellite-derived data to study the long-term CWQ around the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) with indicators of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) and diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (Kd(490)). The sea surface temperature (SST) and total precipitation accumulation (TPA) of the waters around the GBA were also studied from 2003 to 2019. Furthermore, statistical analysis was conducted to identify the impact of the MF on CWQ by quantifying trends and relationships of CWQ \& MF. The results showed that (1) An increasing trend of annual Chla, Kd(490), and TPA were observed, whereas a decreasing trend of SST has been recorded from 2003 to 2019. Both CWQ indicators and meteorological variables showed significant differences among seasons, and the values of Chla, Kd(490), and SST were found higher in the coastal area but lower in the open waters area. (2) SST was the crucial factor of the high values of CWQ indicators in summer: the highest values of Chla and Kd(490) in summer are likely to be attributed to the proper SST (r = 0.87; r = 0.83) and higher TPA in spring (r = 0.95; r = 0.93). The precipitation played an uncertain role in driving the CWQ (r 0.9 and r <-0.9 in spring and winter, respectively). A significant increase in TPA was associated with the decrease of SST in the coming year. (3) Due to the relatively stable change of natural environment and human activities, the trends of Chla, Kd(490), and TPA remained broadly consistent with those of the past 17 years. However, SST indicates a slight downward trend. In summary, the TPA and SST driven patterns were essential in the management of water quality indicators in the GBA area. This study can improve our comprehensive understanding of the water quality status in the coastal regions of the GBA and provide references to the coastal zone and marine management, as well as the sustainable development of the GBA.},

Abstract = {This research estimates phytoplankton pigment concentrations (chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC)) from hyperspectral Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) imagery. AISA images were acquired for a meso-eutrophic reservoir in Central Indiana, USA. Concurrent with the airborne image acquisition, in situ water samples and reflectances were collected. The water samples were subsequently analysed for pigment concentrations, and in situ measured reflectance spectra were used for calibrating the AISA images. Spectral indices, derived from the AISA reflectance spectra, were regressed against the measured pigment concentrations to derive algorithms for estimating chl-a and PC. The relationship between the pigment concentrations and the spectral indices were analysed and evaluated. The results indicate that the highest correlation occurred between chl-a and a near-infrared to red ratio (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.78) and between PC and the reflectance trough at 628 nm (R2 = 0.80). The relationship between PC and the reflectance at 628 nm provides an approach to the estimation of cyanobacteria concentration from hyperspectral imagery, which facilitates water-quality authorities or management agencies in making well-informed management decisions.},

Title = {Improving the accuracy of nonpoint-source pollution estimates in inland waters with coupled satellite-UAV data},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Quantitatively and accurately analyzing nonpoint-source (NPS) pollution is essential for efficiently preventing the input of NPS loads into inland waters. However, the accuracy of previous NPS pollution models is limited by the accuracy of ground parameter data. In addition, there are few effective methods that thoroughly verify modeling results at large scales. This paper presents a framework for accurate NPS pollution estimation by coupling satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring data, and the results are verified by both field sampling and a newly developed inlet NPS pollution ``observation{''} simulation method. Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) data obtained by satellite were used to improve the accuracy of the runoff module of the framework. Satellite and UAV data were coupled to acquire livestock data, determine inlets, and identify reservoir buffer zones and vegetation types. These new data were then used to improve the accuracy of the livestock and runoff modules in the framework. The results show that the estimation accuracy of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand with FVC were improved by 39.96\%, 69.29\%, 54.05\% and 47.22\% (in relative error), respectively. The high-resolution livestock data acquisition improved the estimation accuracy of the NPS pollution load by 7-53\%. The high-resolution inlet extraction improved the accuracy by 3-24\%. The high-resolution buffer zone identification improved the accuracy with the estimated NPS pollutant concentration into reservoir decreasing by 60-99\%. Finally, the high-resolution vege-tation type identification improved the accuracy by 10-72\%. The framework performs satisfactorily, which was verified based on the simulated NPS observations with an average relative error of 11.54-24.31\%. We found that the FVC, livestock number, and inlet number are key parameters for NPS pollution modeling; the introduction of monthly variation in the FVC makes the modeled NPS pollution load much higher in areas with mature complex forested ecosystems or densely distributed vegetation but much lower in areas with sparsely distributed vege-tation. The above methods provide a scientific reference for high-efficiency NPS pollution prevention in inland waters, laying a solid basis for decision-making regarding water quality management in data-scarce regions around the world.},

Title = {Long-Term Trends in Chesapeake Bay Remote Sensing Reflectance: Implications for Water Clarity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While ecosystem health is improving in many estuaries worldwide following nutrient reductions, inconsistent trends in water clarity often remain. The Chesapeake Bay, a eutrophic estuary with a highly populated watershed, is a crucial testbed for these concerns. Improved efforts are needed to understand why some measurements of downstream estuarine water clarity appear to be uncorrelated with watershed management actions, and multiple metrics of clarity are needed to address this issue. To complement in situ measurements, satellite remote sensing provides an additional tool with which to assess long-term change in water clarity. In this study, remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on satellite Aqua was evaluated from 2003 to 2020 at multiple wavelengths for surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Trends show an overall long-term decrease in Rrs in the upper estuary for all wavelengths, yet an increase in Rrs in the lower estuary for green wavelengths. Trends in band ratios show long-term decreasing red-to-green and red-to-blue ratios, yet long-term increasing green-to-blue ratios. Seasonally, trends in band ratios were relatively consistent throughout the year and along-estuary, whereas single band reflectance trends varied seasonally and along-estuary. In the lower Bay, Septembers showed the strongest decreasing trends in red reflectance, while early spring and summer had the most pronounced increasing trends in green reflectance. These trends suggest that the system has experienced a long-term reduction in suspended solids concentration and light attenuation without a systematic reduction in chlorophyll-a concentration.},

Title = {Agroecological Efficiency Evaluation Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data in a Typical County of the Tibetan Plateau},

Abstract = {Evaluating agricultural ecology can help us to understand regional environmental status and contribute to the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems. Furthermore, the results of eco-environmental assessment can provide data support for policy-making and agricultural production. The application of multi-source remote-sensing technology has the advantages of being fast, accurate and wide ranging. It can reveal the status of regional ecological environments, and is of great significance to monitoring their quality. In this paper, an agroecological efficiency evaluation model was constructed by combining remote sensing data and ecological index (EI). Multi-source remote-sensing data were used to obtain the evaluation index. Indicators collected from satellites, such as biological richness, vegetation cover, water network density, land stress, and pollution load, were used to quantitatively evaluate the agroecological efficiency of Rangtang County in the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that the EI of Rangtang County increased from 61.77 to 65.10 during 2000-2020, which means that the eco-environmental quality of this area was good, and it has shown an obviously improving trend over the past 20 years. Rangtang County has converted more than 30 km(2) of grassland into woodland over the past 20 years. Climate change and human activities have had combined effects on the ecological environment of this area. The change in ecological environment quality is greatly affected by human disturbance. Policymakers should continue setting up nature reserves and should implement the policy of returning farmland to forests. Unreasonable grazing and rational allocation of land resources are still critical points of concern for future ecological environment construction. EI, combined with remote sensing and statistical data, is proven to be able to reasonably represent changes in ecological environment in Rangtang County, thus providing more possibilities for ecological evaluation on the Tibetan Plateau, and even the whole world.},

Abstract = {Rivers, as one of the freshwater resources, are generally put in the state of jeopardy in terms of quantity and quality due to the development in industry, agriculture, and urbanization. Management of water quality is inextricably bound up with a reliable prediction of the Water Quality Index (WQI) for various purposes. In this way, an accurate estimation of WQI is one of the most challenging issues in the water quality studies of surface water resources. There is a board range of traditional methodologies for the WQI evaluation. Due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional models, Data-Driven Models (DDMs) have been frequently employed to assess the WQI for natural streams. In the present research, WQI values and their typical classifications were obtained by guidelines of the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Hence, four well-known DDMs such as Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR), M5 Model Tree (MT), Gene-Expression Programming (GEP), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) are employed to predict WQI in Karun River. In this way, 12 Water Quality Parameters (i.e., Dissolved Oxygen, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Electrical Conductivity, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphate, Turbidity, pH, Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium) were accumulated from nine hydrometry stations and additionally missing values of water temperature were extracted from images analysis of Landsat-7 ETM+. Furthermore, the Gamma Test (GT), Forward Selection (FS), Polynomial Chaotic Expression (PCE), and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were used to reduce the volume of DDMs-feeding-input variables. Results of DDMs demonstrated that FS-M5 MT had the best performance for the estimation of WQI classification. WQI values for Karun River were assessed in the reliability-based probabilistic framework to consider the effect of any uncertainty and randomness in the input parameters. To this end, the Monte-Carlo scenario sampling technique was conducted to evaluate the limit state function from the DDMs-based-WQI formulation. Based on the qualitative description of the WQI, it was observed that the WQI of Karun River is classified into ``Relatively Bad{''} quality. Moreover, based on the reliability analysis, there is only a 19\% chance exists for a specimen from Karun River to have a better quality index.},

Title = {Predicting the Spatial Distribution and Severity of Soil Erosion in the Global Tropics using Satellite Remote Sensing},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary This research paper presents the first consistent spatial assessments of soil erosion prevalence based on Earth observation data and systematic field surveys to train models that predict soil erosion prevalence across the global tropics. The results of the study have major implications for efforts to identify land degradation hotspots and design interventions to restore degraded lands given the importance of soil erosion as a major process of land degradation globally. The paper also presents analysis of changes in soil erosion prevalence over the 15 year period from 2002 to 2017. The results of the study can also be used to better understand ecosystem health and resilience in the global tropics, for assessments of food security, and the implications of land degradation on climate change. Abstract Soil erosion has long been recognized as a major process of land degradation globally, affecting millions of hectares of land in the tropics and resulting in losses in productivity and biodiversity, decreased resilience of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and increased vulnerability to climate change. This paper presents an assessment of the extent of soil erosion in the global tropics at a moderate spatial resolution (500 m) based on a combination of systematic field surveys using the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) methodology and Earth observation data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform. The highest erosion prevalence was observed in wooded grassland, bushland, and shrubland systems in semi-arid areas, while the lowest occurrence was observed in forests. Observed erosion decreased with increasing fractional vegetation cover, but with high rates of erosion even at 50-60\% fractional cover. These findings indicate that methods to assess soil erosion need to be able to detect erosion under relatively dense vegetation cover. Model performance was good for prediction of erosion based on MODIS, with high accuracy (89\% for detection) and high overall precision (AUC = 0.97). The spatial predictions from this study will allow for better targeting of interventions to restore degraded land and are also important for assessing the dynamics of land health indicators such as soil organic carbon. Given the importance of soil erosion for land degradation and that the methodology gives robust results that can be rapidly replicated at scale, we would argue that soil erosion should be included as a key indicator in international conventions such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.},

Title = {Comparison of Image Endmember- and Object-Based Classification of Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Narrow-Band Images for Mapping Riparian Forests and Other Land Covers},
Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {Riparian forests are critical for carbon storage, biodiversity, and river water quality. There has been an increasing use of very-high-spatial-resolution (VHR) unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)-based remote sensing for riparian forest mapping. However, for improved riparian forest/zone monitoring, restoration, and management, an enhanced understanding of the accuracy of different classification methods for mapping riparian forests and other land covers at high thematic resolution is necessary. Research that compares classification efficacies of endmember- and object-based methods applied to VHR (e.g., UAS) images is limited. Using the Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone (SMACC) endmember extraction algorithm (EEA) jointly with the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier, and a separate multiresolution segmentation/object-based classification method, we map riparian forests/land covers and compare the classification accuracies accrued via the application of these two approaches to narrow-band, VHR UAS orthoimages collected over two river reaches/riparian areas in Austria. We assess the effect of pixel size on classification accuracy, with 7 and 20 cm pixels, and evaluate performance across multiple dates. Our findings show that the object-based classification accuracies are markedly higher than those of the endmember-based approach, where the former generally have overall accuracies of >85\%. Poor endmember-based classification accuracies are likely due to the very small pixel sizes, as well as the large number of classes, and the relatively small number of bands used. Object-based classification in this context provides for effective riparian forest/zone monitoring and management.},

Title = {SWAT-3PG: Improving forest growth simulation with a process-based forest model in SWAT},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {164},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study developed a new process-based forest module for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), based on the Physiological Process in Predicting Growth (3-PG) model (SWAT-3PG). The new model allows for improved biomass assimilation, partitioning (stem, foliage, root), and losses (root turnover, foliage loss, mortality). Evaluation at field-scale showed that SWAT-3PG can replicate the different forest biomass components for evergreen forests well. Testing for deciduous and mixed forests sites using remote-sensed data showed that the model can simulate leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) reasonably well and can be used to constrain SWAT-3PG when lack of field data. Sensitivity analysis of SWAT3PG showed its potential in evaluating the impacts of management and climate on forested ecosystems. SWAT3PG can also be of importance to forest managers as it can estimate variables such as plant height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and basal area.},

Title = {Climate-driven chlorophyll-a changes in a turbid estuary: Observations from satellites and implications for management},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {11-24},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Significant advances have been made in ocean color remote sensing of turbidity and water clarity for estuarine waters, yet accurate estimations of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla in mg m(-3)) has been problematic, posing a challenge to the research community and an obstacle to managers for long-term water quality assessment. Here, a novel empirical Chla algorithm based on a Red-Green-Chorophyll-Index (RGCI) was developed and validated for MODIS and SeaWiFS observations between 1998 and 2011. The algorithm showed robust performance with two independent datasets, with relative mean uncertainties of similar to 30\% and similar to 50\% and RMS uncertainties of similar to 40\% and similar to 65\%, respectively, for Chla ranging between 1.0 and >30.0 mg m(-3). These uncertainties are comparable or even lower than those reported for the global open oceans when traditional blue-green band ratio algorithms are used. A long-term Chla time series generated from SeaWiFS and MODIS observations showed excellent agreement between sensors and with in situ measurements. Substantial variability in both space and time was observed in the four bay segments, with higher Chla in the upper bay segments and lower Chla in the lower bay segments, and higher Chla in the wet season and lower Chla in the dry season. On average, river discharge could explain similar to 60\% of the seasonal changes and similar to 90\% of the inter-annual changes, with the latter mainly driven by climate variability (e.g. El Nino and La Nina years) and anomaly events (e.g. tropical cyclones). Significant positive correlation was found between monthly mean Chla anomalies and monthly Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.43, p<0.01, N = 147), with high Chla associated with El Nino and lower Chla associated with La Nina. Further, a Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was established from satellite observations, providing complementary and more reliable information to the existing WQDM based on less synoptic and less frequent field measurements. The satellite-derived WQDM and long-term time-series data support the decision making efforts of the management agencies that regulate nutrient discharge to the bay. Similar approaches may be established for other estuaries where field data are much more limited than for Tampa Bay. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Agricultural erosion modelling: Evaluating USLE and WEPP field-scale erosion estimates using UAV time-series data},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil erosion models, typically applied at basin and watershed scales, are rarely evaluated at agricultural field scales due to the lack of spatially-distributed time series data. A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) methodology was used to quantify farm-field soil erosion from nine UAV surveys and structure-from-motion (SfM). Using a semi-distributed approach, we evaluated soil erosion estimates from the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). The annual erosion rate, measured with the UAV methodology, was 18.83 t ha(-1) yr(-1), with USLE and WEPP predictions of 26.23 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and 16.41 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Modelled annual and sub-annual erosion rates with WEPP were within the upper-limit of predictive accuracy, while the USLE tended to systematically overestimate soil erosion rates. These outcomes have implications on the efficacy of conservation efforts, which is highlighted through a discussion and comparison of different best-management practice applications.},

Title = {Temperature Profiling of Waterbodies with a UAV-Integrated Sensor Subsystem},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Evaluation of thermal stratification and systematic monitoring of water temperature are required for lake management. Water temperature profiling requires temperature measurements through a water column to assess the level of thermal stratification which impacts oxygen content, microbial growth, and distribution of fish. The objective of this research was to develop and assess the functions of a water temperature profiling system mounted on a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The buoyancy apparatus mounted on the UAV allowed vertical takeoff and landing on the water surface for in situ measurements. The sensor node that was integrated with the UAV consisted of a microcontroller unit, a temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor. The system measured water temperature and depth from seven pre-selected locations in a lake using autonomous navigation with autopilot control. Measurements at 100 ms intervals were made while the UAV was descending at 2 m/s until it landed on water surface. Water temperature maps of three consecutive depths at each location were created from the measurements. The average surface water temperature at 0.3 m was 22.5 degrees C, while the average water temperature at 4 m depth was 21.5 degrees C. The UAV-based profiling system developed successfully performed autonomous water temperature measurements within a lake.},

Abstract = {The monitoring of the water cycle at the Earth surface which tightly interacts with the climate change processes as well as a number of practical applications (agriculture, soil and water quality assessment, irrigation and water resource management, etc.) requires surface temperature measurements at local scale. Such is the goal of the Indian-French high spatio-temporal TRISHNA mission (Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment). The scientific objectives of the mission and research work conducted to consolidate the mission specifications are presented. Progress in modelling of surface fluxes is then discussed. The main specifications of the mission such as the revisit, the spatial resolution, the overpass time, the spectral bands and the orbit are analyzed and justified. The resulting baseline of the mission is given.},

Title = {Monitoring as the Key Factor for Sustainable Use and Protection of Groundwater in Karst Environments-An Overview},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As a specific type of landscape and aquifer, karst is developed in soluble carbonate and evaporitic rocks and is of great importance for humanity. It covers more than 15\% of Earth's ice-free land and its aquifers provide about 10\% of the world population's drinking water. However, in general, its importance is not adequately supported by monitoring. Due to very dynamic karst regimes, in many countries, monitoring networks and their technology must be enlarged and improved, in terms of both the quantity and quality of water. The article discusses the current state of monitoring in legislation and water practice, as well as its importance in preventing water pollution, ensuring water provision to dependent ecosystems and preparing adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate changes. Karst aquifers' heterogeneity, high vulnerability to pollution and their very dynamic regimes require a more frequent observation of discharge and water quality parameters than any other aquifer system. There is also a need for installing sophisticated monitoring equipment, which enables remote observation of changes in dynamic karst systems. Improving monitoring and creating an early warning system would have a direct and positive effect on water management and might also be able to prevent uncontrolled groundwater extraction and deterioration of water quality.},

Title = {Statistical learning algorithms for identifying contrasting tillage practices with Landsat Thematic Mapper data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {5732-5745},
Abstract = {Tillage management practices have a direct impact on water-holding capacity, evaporation, carbon sequestration and water quality. This study examines the feasibility of two statistical learning algorithms, namely the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM), for identifying two contrasting tillage management practices using remote-sensing data. LSSVM is firmly based on statistical learning theory, whereas RVM is a probabilistic model where the training takes place in a Bayesian framework. Input to the LSSVM and RVM algorithms were reflectance values at different bandwidths and indices derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Ground-truth data for this study were collected from 72 commercial production fields in two counties located in the Texas High Plains of the south-central USA. Numerous LSSVM- and RVM-based tillage models were developed and evaluated for tillage classification accuracy. The percentage correct and kappa statistic were used for the evaluation. The results showed that the best LSSVM and RVM models included the use of TM band 5 or vegetation indices that involved TM band 5, indicating sensitivity of near-infrared reflectance of crop residue cover on the surface. This is consistent with other remote-sensing models reported in the literature. Overall classification accuracies of the best LSSVM and RVM models were 87.8 and 90.2\%, respectively. The corresponding kappa statistics for those models were 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, comparison of the best LSSVM and RVM models with the published logistic regression-based tillage models developed with the same data indicated the superiority of the RVM model over LSSVM and logistic regression models in determining contrasting tillage practices with Landsat TM data.},

Abstract = {China has witnessed rapid urban growth over the past 3 decades resulting in vast ecological and environmental issues. Understanding the process of construction land (Cl) expansion and its driving factors are crucial for urban growth planning and management to mitigate the adverse impacts of such growth. Based on remote sensing data for 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2008, we monitored Cl changes in Xi'an City over the past 3 decades. The land use transform matrices were calculated. The results showed that from 1975 to 2008, remarkable changes in Cl occurred in Xi'an City. Over the past 30years, the Cl concentration spread from one centre to multiple centres. The elevation, slope, traffic condition, wetland, education industry, rebuilding of city village, and historical and cultural sites may be the most important driving forces. We therefore recommend discussing the interactions of these potential driving factors within the Cl sprawl.},

Title = {CURRENT RESEARCH IN LAND, WATER, AND AGROECOSYSTEMS: ASABE JOURNALS 2017 YEAR IN REVIEW},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1639-1651},
Abstract = {This article highlights current research into land and water resources, agroecosystems, and agricultural production systems published by the Natural Resources and Environmental Systems (NRES) community of ASABE journals (Transactions of the ASABE and Applied Engineering in Agriculture) in 2017. Context, scope, and key results of the published articles are reviewed and perhaps more importantly areas for increased research attention are recommended. This article describes experimental and modeling advances in hydrology, agroecosystems, climate change effects, soil erosion, agricultural irrigation, agricultural drainage, forest resource management, livestock systems, natural treatment systems, international water issues, and water quality topic areas. Three special collections were published (International Watershed Technology, Crop Modeling and Decision Support for Optimizing Use of Limited Water, and Advances in Drainage). Other focal areas included 14 articles relating to livestock waste management, 13 concerning irrigated agricultural systems, 8 addressing climate change effects on land, water, and agroecosystems, and 16 on various aspects of soil erosion measurement and modeling. Building on the articles reviewed from 2017 and toward a vision of future agroecosystems research, the NRES community of ASABE journals strives to expand its role in making new knowledge accessible to sustain agricultural and natural systems in a changing world. With this goal in mind, recommendations for future research needs are proposed with an emphasis on increased application of remote sensing data to agroecosystems research, improved assessment of agroecosystem resiliency and vulnerability to land and climate change, development of integrated models of agroecosystem services, meeting stubborn water management challenges in agricultural production systems, and focusing on publishing fully reproducible model results.},

Abstract = {European legislation is driving the development of methods for river ecosystem protection in light of concerns over water quality and ecology. Key to their success is the accurate and rapid characterisation of physical features (i.e., hydromorphology) along the river. Image pattern recognition techniques have been successfully used for this purpose. The reliability of the methodology depends on both the quality of the aerial imagery and the pattern recognition technique used. Recent studies have proved the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to increase the quality of the imagery by capturing high resolution photography. Similarly, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been shown to be a high precision tool for automated recognition of environmental patterns. This paper presents a UAV based framework for the identification of hydromorphological features from high resolution RGB aerial imagery using a novel classification technique based on ANNs. The framework is developed for a 1.4 km river reach along the river Dee in Wales, United Kingdom. For this purpose, a Falcon 8 octocopter was used to gather 2.5 cm resolution imagery. The results show that the accuracy of the framework is above 81\%, performing particularly well at recognising vegetation. These results leverage the use of UAVs for environmental policy implementation and demonstrate the potential of ANNs and RGB imagery for high precision river monitoring and river management.},

Title = {Muzaffarpur city land changes and impact on urban runoff and water quality of the river Burhi Gandak},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 28},
Abstract = {Nowadays, river water is continuously polluting due to rapid urban growth. Hence, measuring the water quality (WQ) year wise is the most needed task for today's culture. However, usual neural network features are limited to forecasting the WQ that was resulted in poor estimation exactness. So, a novel Dove-based varying coefficient neural network (DbVCNet) was executed to find the WQ of Burhi Gandak river and the land use changes of Muzaffarpur city and their surroundings. Hence, the specific region's satellite images and WQ data were utilized to attain these objectives. Hence, the WQ was analyzed by recognizing the changes in chemical quantity in river water. In addition, the percentage of land use changes was estimated based on cropland, urban growth and forest region. Subsequently, it was tested in the MATLAB Tool, and robustness was estimated against the recent existing model. A novel DbVCNet scores the widest range of WQ estimation rate at 98.5\%, which is the finest exactness range compared to past studies.},

Title = {Developing MODIS-based retrieval models of suspended particulate matter concentration in Dongting Lake, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {46-53},

Abstract = {To case-II waters, suspended particulate matter (SPM) is one of the dominant water constituents, SPM concentration (C-SPM) is a key parameter describing water quality, and developing remote sensing-based C-SPM retrieval models is foundation for obtaining its spatiotemporal distributions. This study aimed to develop moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based C-SPM empirical retrieval models in Dongting Lake, China. The 95 C-SPM measurements on 31 August 2012 and 14 June 2013 and their corresponding MODIS Terra images were used to calibrate models, and the model calibration results showed that the 250 m MODIS red band obtained better fitting accuracies than the near infrared band; the quadratic and exponential models of single red band explained 75\% (estimated standard errors (SE) = 6.19 mg/l) and 71\% (SE = 6.54 mg/l) of the variation of C-SPM; and the quadratic and exponential models of red minus shortwave infrared (SWIR) band at 1240 and 1640 nm explained 72-73\% (SE= 6.43-6.48 mg/l) and 68-69\% (SE = 6.83-6.96 mg/l) of the variations of C-SPM, respectively. The quadratic and exponential models of red band and red minus SWIR band were applied to the MODIS Terra image on 16 September 2013 to estimate C-SPM values. By comparing the estimated C-SPM values on 16 September 2013 and the measured ones on 17 September 2013 at 40 sampling points for model validations, the results indicated that there exited significantly strong correlations between the measured and estimated C-SPM values at a significance level of 0.05 for all models, and the exponential model of red minus SWIR band at 1240 nm achieved the best estimation result within all models. Such result provided foundation for obtaining the spatiotemporal distribution information of C-SPM from MODIS images in Dongting Lake, which will be helpful for understanding, managing and protecting this ecosystem.

Abstract = {Technological advances in remote sensing capabilities, wider participation of commercial firms and the possibilities of `processing' spatial data to create value-added information have given rise to a range of policy and legal issues in the geographic information (GI) field. How far satellite images can still be considered a `public good', conflicts between commercial and national interests is becoming a major issue, especially where security is concerned, sovereignty and the rights of sensed states, shutter control vs transparency is debated, data access, IPR and infringement of privacy becoming more relevant are all discussed. At the same time, the societal and public good of GI is well accepted with innumerable national and international examples. It is clear that societies would greatly benefit from the proper use of GI. A multilateral debate to formulate a GI policy that will take account of these while ensuring that the full benefits of remote sensing are available to society is called for. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {For thousands of years, data allowed societies to firstunderstandthe connection between water quality and public health and later torefine water and waste management strategies. In this commentary,we look at the past, present, and future of `big-impact'data in thewater sector, from ancient water systems to Paris' valorizationof wastes, London's tribulations with cholera, and modern environmentalstandards for the protection of public and environmental health. Wecontinue the journey of water data with emerging applications in understandingour water resources, including blue-green city planning, understandingwater use trends in remote areas, water resource monitoring, and wastewaterepidemiology. We conclude with a foray into the future of the watersector, where proactively managing water resources to ensure equitableand resilient water access can be informed by remote sensing, satellite-basedmonitoring, and machine learning. By understanding how water datarevolutionized our societies in the past, we aim to inspire the useof big water data to open possibilities for managing urban and environmentalwater in our future.},

Abstract = {An enterprise architecture for the Earth Science activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was developed to assist in assessing the capacity of scientific instruments in meeting the needs of society. It can also help them develop the right investment strategies and help scientists and engineers in their planning for system development, especially for complex space-based environmental sensors. This architecture model can be easily extended to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In fact, it was constructed with GEOSS in mind to ensure that NASA's observation systems can be readily mapped into the GEOSS structure. The architecture contains about 3000 elements that are involved in earth science research: observation sources, sensors, environmental parameters, data products, mission products, observations, science models, predictions, and decision-support tools. The science models use observations from the space-based instruments to generate predictions about various aspects of the environment. These predictions are used by decision-makers around the world to help minimize property damage and loss of human life due to adverse conditions such as severe weather storms. The architecture is developed using both traditional and non-traditional SE tools and techniques. This paper will describe additional methods needed for the SE tool-box.},

Title = {Demarcating saline water intrusion pathways using remote sensing, GIS and geophysical techniques in structurally controlled coastal aquifers in Southern India},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Application of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) with the help of ground truth studies like vertical electrical soundings (VES) and water quality measurements gave a comprehensive picture on saline water intrusion pathways in the structural controlled aquifers of Uppanar and Cauvery River systems located in Sirkazhi and Mannanpandal coastal areas of Southern India. The detailed geomorphic units and lineaments were mapped using IRS LISS-III (1: 50,000 Scale) and SRTM Elevation Digital data under GIS environment. The area is mainly alluvial deposits of Holocene Age and classified into three major geomorphic units (i.e., fluvial, fluviomarine, and marine geomorphic units). The identified lineaments are mostly trending North-northeast (NNE)South-southwest (SSW), Northeast (NE)-Southwest (SW), Northwest (NW)-Southeast (SE), East-West (EW) and East-Northeast (ENE)-West-Southwest (WSW) directions. Some of them are potential for fresh groundwater occurrence and movement. The lineaments trending NE-SW, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW act as pathways for saline water intrusion to the inland. The lineament L1 (NNE-SSW trending) conformed as a sinisterly shifted fault played a significant role in saline water intrusion. The area within the parallel lineaments L2 and L3 oriented ENE-WSW direction indicates low topography, beach ridges, paleo-channel sinuosity, large aerial extent of tidal flats, and backwater inundation. All the above geomorphic units gave indirect evidence of land subsidence, which was confirmed with the help of sub-surface geo-electrical signals obtained through VES and in situ groundwater quality measurements. Integrating all the above results, the saline water spread and fresh water pockets were identified.},

Abstract = {Water scarcity and contamination of clean water have been identified as major challenges of the 21st century, in particular for developing countries. According to the International Water Management Institute, about 30\% of the world's population does not have reliable access to clean water. Consequently, contaminated water contributes to the death of about 3 million people every year, mostly children. Access to potable water has been proven to boost education, equality and health, reduce hunger, as well as help the economy of the developing world. Currently used in-situ water monitoring techniques are sparse, and often difficult to execute. Space-based instruments will help to overcome these challenges by providing means for water level and water quality monitoring of medium to-large sweet (fresh) water reservoirs. Data from hyperspectral imaging instruments on past and present governmental missions, such as Envisat and Aqua, has been used for this purpose. However, the high cost of large multi-purpose space vessels, and the lack of dedicated missions limits the continuous monitoring of inland and coastal water quality. The proposed CubeSat mission SWEET (Sweet Water Earth Education Technologies) will try to fill this gap. The SWEET concept is a joint effort between the Technical University of Munich, the German Space Operations Center and the African Steering Committee of the IAF. By using a novel Fabry-Perot interferometer based hyperspectral imager, the mission will deliver critical data directly to national water resource centers in Africa with an unmatched cost per pixel ratio and high temporal resolution. Additionally, SWEET will incorporate education of students in CubeSat design and water management. Although the aim of the mission is to deliver local water quality and water level data to African countries, further coverage could be achieved with subsequent satellites. Finally, a constellation of SWEET-like CubeSats would extend the coverage to the whole planet, delivering daily data to ensure reliable access to clean water for millions of people worldwide.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore the capability of hyperspectral remote sensing to map areas affected by Red Dust (RD) pollution on soil and river water. The chosen study area contains residues from the extraction of aluminum from bauxite in a mud pond (i.e. the red mud), which contain high concentrations of contaminants such as heavy metals, so that special precaution must be taken when disposing to avoid RD pollution of land surface and river water resources. We perform laboratory analysis and in situ measurements of RD polluted samples to recognize the dominant minerals and identify the optical characteristics of the samples and their spectral features. Both an unsupervised methodology and a shape-based spectral analysis technique, using the significant RD reflectance spectral features, were applied to airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data to map the RD distribution on bare soils. Whereas, to assess a tool for the detection of RD in river waters a semi-analytical model for the radiative transfer in water bodies was used. The results of the spectral shape-based analysis and of the semi-analytical model used for this study were consistent with ground truth data and hence support the application of hyperspectral technologies for a rapid detection and mapping of industrial wastes, such as the RD. This information is suitable to support the development of effective intervention policies and monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {According to the new European water framework directive, water management plans will become mandatory for all inland water bodies. The development of management plans requires information about the environmental status of the water bodies and their surroundings. Wetland vegetation is a good indicator for water quality monitoring. Remote sensing methods are assumed to be able to provide the specialist with the information needed for the monitoring of wetland vegetation. Applying methods offered by the object oriented eCognition software, an evaluation chain for sensitive aquatic environments is under development which should be used for monitoring purposes. This paper describes two approaches for wetland classification and the evaluation of reed stands. The first one is deriving the information exclusively from Ikonos data analysis, simulating the case of a basic inventory. The second one is taking advantage of existing thematic GIS layers, a situation which often appears in monitoring purposes.},

Abstract = {Land use and land-cover (LULC) data provide essential information for environmental management and planning. This research evaluates the land-cover change dynamics and their effects for the Greater Mankato Area of Minnesota using image classification and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) modelling in high-resolution aerial photography and QuickBird imagery. Results show that from 1971 to 2003, urban impervious surfaces increased from 18.3\% to 32.6\%, while cropland and grassland decreased from 54.2\% to 39.1\%. The dramatic urbanization caused evident environmental impacts in terms of runoff and water quality, whereas the annual air pollution removal rate and carbon storage/sequestration remained consistent since urban forests were steady over the 32-year span. The results also indicate that highly accurate land-cover features can be extracted effectively from high-resolution imagery by incorporating both spectral and spatial information, applying an image-fusion technique, and utilizing the hierarchical machine-learning Feature Analyst classifier. This research fills the high-resolution LULC data gap for the Greater Mankato Area. The findings of the study also provide valuable inputs for local decision-makers and urban planners.},

Title = {Evaluation of the First Year of Operational Sentinel-2A Data for Retrieval of Suspended Solids in Medium- to High-Turbidity Waters},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this study, we apply high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery to assist in the monitoring of the southwestern Spanish coast during its first year of data. The aim is to test suitability of MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) at higher resolution (10 m) for mapping Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Several field campaigns are carried out to collect TSS at three different sites in the Guadalquivir estuary, Cadiz Bay and Conil port. A regional multi-conditional remote sensing algorithm with a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive TSS vs. water reflectance relationship is developed to estimate TSS concentration while avoiding saturation effects. An existing semi-analytical algorithm is calibrated by means of a cross-validation procedure based on both red 664 nm (r = 0.8, NRMSE of 25.06\%) and near-infrared (NIR) 865 nm (r = 0.98, NRMSE of 10.28\%) parts of the spectrum, showing the MSI sensor's great potential to estimate TSS even though it was not designed for aquatic remote sensing. The first year of data reveals improved monitoring along the coastal region at unprecedented resolution with accuracy to detect the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum (ETM). ACOLITE and POLYMER Atmospheric Correction strategies are applied over this coastal region (no in-situ data on water reflectance). The results confirm that the flexible POLYMER algorithm can address intense sun-glint effects. These findings encourage further research of water quality studies relying on both operational Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, with great implications to improve the understanding of turbid coastal and inland water environments.},

Abstract = {Water resources management is an important issue in southern African countries. With respect to water quality problems, the understanding of the dynamics of integrated soil erosion processes in river basins is of crucial importance. This study is on the delineation of response units (RUs) in the Mkomazi River catchment (KwaZulu/Natal; South Africa). It was carried out within the framework of an interdisciplinary EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated water resources management system for water resources analyses and prognostic scenario planning in semi-arid catchments of southern Africa. Within this more general framework, particular attention was focused on the identification of sediment source areas. For this purpose, the RUs concept was applied to delineate erosion RUs (ERUs). The ERUs were subsequently used to identify heterogeneously distributed areas within a river catchment characterized by specific hydrological and erosion dynamics and features. Therefore, they can be applied as modelling entities in physically based hydrological and erosion models. Spatially distributed input data from the catchment were derived by remote sensing techniques and geographical information systems analyses. Taking into account the high amount of sediments produced by gully erosion, not considered in USLE-type models, special attention was focused on gully erosion using a dynamic gully erosion model. The example from southern Africa shows that the methods applied are able to identify areas affected by gully erosion. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the entire amount of soil loss, including gully erosion. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {With continued population growth and increasing demands on water resources, precision conservation wilt have an increasing role during this new millennium. It has been reported that world population is expected to be about 9.4 billion by 2050, and that increases in crop yields will have to be achieved primarily from land that is currently under production since most of the world's arable land is already being cultivated. These increases in population growth and food and water demands will put increasing pressure for development of new more efficient technology and production practices that contribute to higher yields. Since intensive farming can potentially impact soil and water quality, parallel increases in new practices and technology contributing to improved soil and water conservation practices will be needed to help sustain and maintain the needed yield increases from agricultural systems.},

Abstract = {We have presented an improved short-wave infrared (SWIR)-based iterative algorithm for the atmospheric correction (AC) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over Lake Taihu, China. The algorithm was validated by means of matchup comparison between MODIS-retrieved and in situ remote sensing reflectances (R-rs). Four examples of the matchup comparison were first carried out for the observation stations within a +/- 5-min time window of MODIS overpass and field measurements. It is shown in the examples that the retrieved R-rs spectra compare reasonably well with the in situ measurements not only over relatively clear waters (with R-rs(859) about 0.0014 sr(-1)) but also over turbid waters (with R-rs(859) about 0.013 sr(-1)). The matchup comparison was further carried out for a total of 54 observation stations within a +/- 2-h time window, indicating that the AC algorithm has good performance for producing water spectra from MODIS data over Lake Taihu. The development of an algal bloom event has been monitored using MODIS-measured R-rs(443) and R-rs(859), showing that MODIS data, combined with the AC algorithm, can be a useful tool for monitoring the water quality of Lake Taihu. The SWIR iterative algorithm, along with the chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) retrieval model using red to near-infrared bands, has the potential of monitoring Chl-a quantitatively and providing useful information for decision makers to manage the water environment and to prepare for events as algal blooms.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) have been used to guide the selection of suitable areas for aquaculture. This systematic review synthesizes the key suitability factors and constraints reported in the literature for establishing inland pond aquaculture. We searched for primary studies on Scopus and Web of Science according to preferred reporting items for systemic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Between 1991 and 2020, 354 articles were published in 104 academic journals. The maximum annual number of publications occurred in 2020, with 22 publications, and there is an increasing trend in studies published over the past 30 years. From 12 selected studies, we identified 48 suitability factors, 11 related to soil suitability, 19 to socioeconomic and infrastructure suitability, and 18 to water quality and availability. The most frequently used suitability factors were road proximity, local market center distance, soil texture, soil slope, and water temperature. We listed 15 constraints that restrict or limit the selection of specific geographic locations for inland aquaculture. Urbanized areas, roads, and forests were the most frequently restricted areas. Geotechnologies provide powerful tools for spatial planning and management of aquaculture. Availability, quality, and access to spatial data are critical for the use of geotechnologies in the process of aquaculture site selection.},

Abstract = {Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was a great visionary, and we are celebrating his Centenary birth anniversary, this year. It was amazing to see, 50 years back, he had planned meticulously various possible remote sensing applications that materialised in the fields of weather and oceans, coastal zone management, geoscience, hydrology, forestry, land use and agriculture and contributed significantly towards national development. Not only that, he had thought about the kinds of sensors, processing and communicating technologies that would be required. He had stressed need for the domain expertise in different disciplines and collaboration with various stakeholders for developing various remote sensing-based products and services and their utilisation. The concept of the National Natural Resources Management System had born out this vision. Such approach has really paid rich dividends. Today, because of such approach, India is in forefront of operational utilisation of remote sensing data and provides weather services for farmers, potential fishery zone advisories to fishermen, accurate and reliable forecast on cyclones and droughts, groundwater targeting for drinking water, condition and status of forest and glaciers, annual forecast of production of major food grains, to name a few. The time is now appropriate to transform this world-class technology into a national system of remote sensing in collaboration with industries to provide operational services to not only users in India, but also all developing countries. Such approach will pave way in translating technology development into innovation for the benefit of all stakeholders. These benefits will help in improving particularly social and economic conditions of developing societies, and is the best way to pay tribute to him. In this article, the vision of Dr. Sarabhai vis-a-vis the status of utilisation of remote sensing in the country has been discussed.},

Abstract = {Identification of groundwater potential is important for the preparation of management plan of groundwater resource in watershed scale. Groundwater potential zone in watershed scale is identified using GIS, remote sensing satellite data, and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis technique. Different thematic layers, i.e. geological formation, lineament, soil, etc. were used for the identification of groundwater potential zones, while groundwater quality parameters, i.e. hardness, pH, etc. were used for the preparation of groundwater quality index map. The present study focused on identification of possible groundwater potential zones and groundwater quality index both in terms of quantity and quality. The Analytic Hierarchy Approach is utilized to identify the groundwater potential zones. Conclusively, 27.1\% area falls under low-medium groundwater potential zone and 9.3\% area falls under above the permissible limit of water quality. In total, 240 suitable water harvesting structures, namely storage tank (120 nos), percolation tank (70 nos), stop dam (34 nos) and check dam (16 nos) with their sites, were identified and suggested for water harvesting to enhance the groundwater conditions to meet the scarcity of water resources in agriculture and domestic use.},

Title = {Stubble burn area estimation and its impact on ambient air quality of Patiala \& Ludhiana district, Punjab, India},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Stubble burning during October and November, results in the extensive formation of smoke cloud over the Punjab region, and maybe one of the main reasons behind the increase in air pollution levels in these areas. The manual detection and estimation are tedious, lengthy and unpractical, so several researchers have been using remote sensing and GIS technique to estimate stubble burn areas and forest fires. Thus, in the present study, an attempt has been made to detect and estimate the stubble burn area. Landsat 8 OLI images are used to detect the stubble burn area for the year 2014-18 for Patiala and Ludhiana, which are major rice producing districts of Punjab. Normalize Burn Ratio (NBR) index have been used to determine the burned area in an image using a statistical threshold technique (2s approach). The results have been validated using available as well as collected Ground Control Points (GCPs) and accuracy assessment has been conducted by generating an error matrix. It has been estimated that the stubble burn area was reduced by 32\% and 40\% during the study period for Patiala and Ludhiana regions, respectively. The monthly variation for various pollutants (RSPM, NOx, and SO2) during the study period has also been studied and analyzed. The distinct increase in pollutant levels has been observed during each stubble burning period. The results also indicate that the amount of emitted RSPM and NOx was higher than the emitted SO2 during stubble burning. The wind rose diagrams have also been plotted.},

Abstract = {There is a great need in the world for assessing the different water problems in quantity and quality. in order to address different options for restoration or protection of watersheds. In the world nearly 36 \% of the agricultural land has been somehow degraded: about 90 \% of the Northern Andean cloud forest has been destroyed. and in the last three decades floods related disasters have increased 40 folds worldwide. This document tries to illustrate applications for sedimentation assessment, terrain stability, and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) evaluation. It summarizes the result of a research conducted on El Mezcalar micro - watershed, which is part of the National School of Forest Sciences. ESNACIFOR's school forest. The study consisted of a sedimentological and hydrological assessment of a micro - watershed. Additionally, the use of GIS techniques to evaluate the TMDL, sediment problems. and some of the causes. such as deforestation arc discussed. The field data collection consisted of a daily flow measurements along with water sampling to determing suspended sediment content. Paired data was collected for 140 days, from February to October of 1999. As a result, a sediment rating curve was developed: Ss = k Q(m) were Ss = Suspended Sediment Content (mg/L), Q = discharge (L/s), k = -0.88893, and m = 1.03337. The month with the highest precipitation was September with an average of 10.08 mm/day and a corresponding discharge of 15.43 L/s, while the month with the highest concentration of suspended sediment was June with 0.197 mg/L. Also, the use of automatic weather stations. automatic water quality stations, high resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model), and Airborne Remote Sensing data, in the application of GIS (Geographic Information System) based algorithms are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the works undertaken on the Rio do Peixe watershed by the Coordination of Agricultural Defense (CDA) over 12 years, where conservationist agriculture practices have been used since 2007 to promote the recovery of degraded areas, the reduction of erosion and the improvement of water quality. In addition, we evaluated the performance of innovative diagnostic strategies used to identify erosion spots in the river basin. The effective supervision of large farmland areas is a common problem that requires the development of cost-effective tools while keeping a close interaction with stakeholders. From 2007 to 2017, 176 properties (23,103 ha) were inspected and notified to fulfill the soil conservation laws, using the Conventional CDA methodology (i.e., field assessment by an agronomist). In the Marilia sector, the Innovative CDA Methodology (with remote sensing) was used, enabling the audit of 52 properties covering 27,775 ha in 2 years. Each landowner was requested to submit technical projects using conservationist practices to be implemented under CDA guidelines. Methods included vegetation cover and crop rotation (control of laminar erosion) and implementation of agricultural terraces, bypass channels, and containment basins (management of gullies erosion). The activities carried out promoted a shift from conventional agriculture, which was impacting soil fertility and water quality, towards conservation agriculture. Degraded pastures were converted into annual cropping areas using No-Tillage (zero tillage) farming techniques. Other pastures were recovered, through Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems, increasing its stocking rate. The undertaken activities were labor-intensive but beneficial for farmers and for the quality of waterbodies.},

Title = {Hybrid forward-selection method-based water-quality estimation via combining Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS images and ancillary environmental data},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {A simple approach to enable water-management agencies employing free data to create a single set of water quality predictive equations with satisfactory accuracy is proposed. Multiple regression-derived equations based on surface reflectance, band ratios, and environmental factors as predictor variables for concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Nitrogen (TN) were derived using a hybrid forward-selection method that considers both p-value and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) in the forward-selection process. Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS images were jointly utilized with environmental factors, such as wind speed and water surface temperature, to derive the single set of equations. Through splitting data into calibration and validation groups, the coefficients of determination are 0.73 for TSS calibration and 0.70 for TSS validation, respectively. The coefficients of determination for TN calibration and validation are 0.64 and 0.37, respectively. Among all chosen predictor variables, ratio of reflectance of visible red (Band 3 for Landsat TM and ETM+, or Band 4 for Landsat OLI/TIRS) to visible blue (Band 1 for Landsat TM and ETM+, or Band 2 for Landsat OLI/TIRS) has a strong influence on the predictive power for TSS retrieval. Environmental factors including wind speed, remote sensing-derived water surface temperature, and time difference (in days) between the image acquisition and water sampling were found to be important in water-quality quantity estimation. The hybrid forward-selection method consistently yielded higher validation accuracy than that of the conventional forward-selection approach.},

Abstract = {It is well-known that Earth observation (EO) data plays a critical role in scientific understanding about the global environment. There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts. Both the role of Big Data and associated technologies are discussed as they relate to the ultimate use of Landsat-derived information products to guide decision-making, and key data ecosystem characteristics that shape the likelihood of these products' use are highlighted.},

Title = {Automatization and evaluation of a remote sensing-based indicator for wetland health assessment in East Africa on national and local scales},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To avoid wetland degradation and promote sustainable wetlands use, decision-makers and managing institutions need quantified and spatially explicit information on wetland ecosystem condition for policy development and wetland management. Remote sensing holds a significant potential for wetland mapping, inventorying, and monitoring. The Wetland Use Intensity (WUI) indicator, which is not specific to a particular crop and which requires little ancillary data, is based on the Mean Absolute Spectral Dynamics (MASD), which is a cumulative measure of reflectance change across a time series of optical satellite images. It is sensitive to the compound effects of land cover changes caused by different agricultural practices, flooding or burning. The more frequent and intrusive management practices are on the land cover, the stronger the WUI signal. WUI thus serves as a surrogate indicator to measure pressure on wetland ecosystems.We developed a new and automated approach for WUI calculation that is implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment. Its automatic calculation, use of regular Sentinel-2 derived time series, and automatic cloud and cloud shadow masking renders WUI applicable for wetland management and produces high quality results with minimal user requirements, even under cloudy conditions. For the first time, we quantitatively tested the capacity of WUI to contribute to wetland health assessment in Rwanda on the national and local scale. On the national scale, we analyzed the discriminative power of WUI between different wetland management categories. On the local scale, we evaluated the possible contribution of WUI to a wetland ecosystem health scoring system. The results suggest that the adapted WUI indicator is informative, does not overlap with existing indicators, and is applicable for wetland management. The possibility to measure use intensity reliably and consistently over time with satellite data is useful to stakeholders in wetland management and wetland health monitoring, and can complement established field-based wetland health assessment frameworks.},

Title = {Modelling of Greek Lakes Water Quality Using Earth Observation in the Framework of the Water Framework Directive (WFD)},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Given the great importance of lakes in Earth's environment and human life, continuous water quality (WQ) monitoring within the frame of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the most crucial aspect for lake management. In this study, Earth Observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors have been combined with co-orbital in situ measurements from 50 lakes located in Greece with the main objective of delivering robust WQ assessment models. Correlation analysis among in situ co-orbital WQ data (Chlorophylla, Secchi depths, Total phosphorus-TP-) contributed to distinguishing their inter-relationships and improving the WQ models' accuracy. Subsequently, stepwise multiple regression analysis (MLR) of the available TP and Secchi depth datasets was implemented to explore the potential to establish optimal quantitative models regardless of lake characteristics. Then, further MLR analysis concerning whether the lakes are natural or artificial was conducted with the basic aim of generating different remote sensing derived models for different types of lakes, while their combination was further utilized to assess their trophic status. Correlation matrix results showed a high and positive relationship between TP and Chlorophyll-a (0.85), whereas high negative relationships were found between Secchi depth with TP (-0.84) and Chlorophyll-a (-0.83). MLRs among Landsat data and Secchi depths resulted in 3 optimal models concerning the assessment of Secchi depth of all lakes (Secchi(general;) R = 0.78; RMSE = 0.24 m), natural (Secchi(natural;) R = 0.95; RMSE = 0.14 m) and artificial (Secchi(artificial;) R = 0.62; RMSE = 0.1 m), with reliable accuracy. Study findings showed that TP-related MLR analyses failed to deliver a statistically acceptable model for the reservoirs; nevertheless, they delivered a robust TPgeneral (R = 0.71; RMSE = 1.41 mg/L) and TPnatural model (R = 0.93; RMSE = 1.43 mg/L). Subsequently, trophic status classification was conducted herein, calculating Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI) initially throughout all lakes and then oriented toward natural-only and artificial-only lakes. Those three types of TSI (general, natural, artificial) were calculated based on previously published satellite-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) assessment models and the hereby specially designed WQ models (Secchi depth, TP). The higher deviation of satellite-derived TSI values in relation to in situ ones was detected in reservoirs and shallower lakes (mean depth < 5 m), indicating noticeable divergences among natural and artificial lakes. All in all, the study findings provide important support toward the perpetual WQ monitoring and trophic status prediction of Greek lakes and, by extension, their sustainable management, particularly in cases when ground truth data is limited.},

Abstract = {Water quality in estuarine and coastal waters of Aotearoa New Zealand is of concern yet currently under-monitored, reflecting challenges of sampling at regular intervals across large areas. Satellite products are currently underutilised (globally) by management agencies but could be part of a holistic approach. NIWA-SCENZ (Seas, Coasts and Estuaries New Zealand) is a website providing access to MODIS-Aqua products at moderate spatial resolution (500 m) across relatively clear coastal waters (Case 1) to turbid coastal waters (Case 2). It also provides advanced analytical tools on an extracted area of interest for trend assessment (Shiny-SCENZ). For Case 1 areas product accuracy will be comparable to data from other websites using the same algorithms. For Case 2 and transition (blended) areas, although tuned to New Zealand conditions, accuracy of products requires validation. Data availability is mainly impacted by cloud cover, but also adjacency to land and bottom reflection. On average <5\% within similar to 1 km from coastlines, compared to similar to 10\%-30\% outside 2 km. Extrapolation and blending from offshore into shorelines on month averaged maps extend estimates into many bays and estuaries. Active research efforts will deliver iterative improvements in data quality, new products, and analysis methods (e.g. variability and long-term trend maps).},

Abstract = {Management of river salt loads in a complex and highly regulated river basin such as the San Joaquin River Basin of California presents significant challenges for current Information Technology. Computer-based numerical models are used as a means of simulating hydrologic processes and water quality within the basin and can be useful tools for organizing Basin data in a structured and readily accessible manner. These models can also be used to extend information derived from environmental sensors within existing monitoring networks to areas outside these systems based on similarity factors - since it would be cost prohibitive to collect data for every channel or pollutant source within the Basin. A common feature of all hydrologic and water quality models is the ability to perform mass balances. This paper describes the use of a number of state-of-the-art sensor technologies that have been deployed to obtain water and salinity mass balances for a 60,000 ha tract of seasonally managed wetlands in the San Joaquin River Basin of California. These sensor technologies are being combined with more traditional environmental monitoring techniques to support real-time salinity management (RTSM) in the River Basin. Two of these new technology applications: YSI-Econet (which supports continuous flow and salinity monitoring of surface water deliveries and seasonal wetland drainage); and electromagnetic salinity mapping (a remote sensing technology for mapping soil salinity in the surface soils) - have not previously been reported in the literature. Continuous sensor deployments that experience more widespread use include: weather station sensor arrays - used to estimate wetland pond evaporation and moist soil plant evapotranspiration; high resolution multi-spectral imagery - used to discriminate between and estimate the area of wetland moist soil plant vegetation: and groundwater level sensors - used primarily to estimate seepage losses beneath a wetland pond during flood-up. Important issues associated with quality assurance of continuous data are discussed and the application of a state-of-the-art software product AQUARIUS, which streamlines the process of data error correction and dissemination, is described as an essential element of ensuring successful RTSM implementation in the San Joaquin River Basin.

Abstract = {The Himalayan region is vulnerable to climate change, which is triggering extreme hydrological events. To understand the impact of climate emission scenarios on different hydrological flow dynamics of the Himalayan region, a thorough hydrological investigation is needed for improved water resource management. Hence, this research exemplifies the use of remote sensing, modelling techniques, and recent climate projections (CMIP5 and CMIP6) for the assessment of hydrological flow dynamics in the central Himalayan catchment. The SWAT model is calibrated/validated using gauge observation and satellite altimetry-derived river discharge and used for long-term hydrological simulations (1979-2100). CMIP6 models predicted that there would be a steady rise in high flows in all the projected scenarios. Flow duration curve for CMIP5 and CMIP6 models depicted that high flow of short duration would be frequent in future. The environmental flow components (EFCs) were calculated using the indicator of hydrologic alteration tool. The SWAT model simulations of hydrological and EFCs under CMIP6 climate projections are found to be significantly more vulnerable to climate warming than CMIP5, which could be due to socioeconomic pathway emission scenarios.},

Abstract = {Over the past years, there has been significant progress in the field of water quality monitoring that has also introduced new challenges. First and foremost, there is an ongoing development in satellite-based retrieval techniques, accompanied by technological development of the equipment deployed in situ to monitor chlorophyll and cyanobacteria. To design and adopt potential adaptation and mitigation strategies for the future, analyses of the current monitoring system that is implemented in Romania are necessary in order to look into the current status of the stakeholders perception of algal blooms and to promote integration of satellite-based monitoring of cyanobacteria into the existing water monitoring programme.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Loch Vale watershed was instrumented in 1983 with initial support from the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program to ask whether ecosystems of Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) were affected by acidic atmospheric deposition. Research and monitoring activities were expanded in 1991 by the U.S. Geological Survey Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets program to understand the processes, and their interactions, controlling water, energy, and biogeochemical fluxes. With help from many collaborators we have characterized trends and patterns in atmospheric deposition, climate, and hydrology, including glaciers and other ice features. Instead of acidic deposition, we documented high atmospheric inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr), and have studied the ecological consequences in soils, surface water, and vegetation. Using paleolimnology, we documented the onset of human-caused change to lake primary producers ca. 1950 in response to increased Nr deposition and warming. Our results provided the basis for the Colorado Nitrogen Deposition Reduction Plan, a state policy that aims to reduce Nr emissions to protect resources in RMNP by 2032. Carbon cycle research revealed mountain wetlands now release more carbon than they store, and respiration and methane flux occurs even during winter through deep snow packs. Trend analyses found export of Nr to be closely tied to atmospheric inputs, but can lag in response to drought. Current research explores consequences of the combination of warming, changes in precipitation dynamics, and atmospheric deposition of Nr and dust on stream and lake CO2 dynamics, lake biology and trophic state, and soil carbon composition. Dramatic increases in park visitors have prompted studies on the effects of recreational use on water quality. New tools such as remote sensing and high frequency instream water quality sensors are being applied to lake and stream studies. Monitoring, combined with experiments, models, and spatial comparisons is an essential foundation for science-based resource management.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Buffalo and Brays Bayous are two of the primary drainage channels in the city of Houston. Both the Buffalo and Brays Bayou Watersheds (BBW, BrBW) are impacted by frequent flooding, rapid urbanization and intense land cover changes. The goal of this research is to assess and compare the soil and water quality and land cover changes in the BBW and BrBW. The specific objectives of the study are 1) to monitor and assess the nutrient and metal concentrations in the water and soil samples along the Buffalo and Brays Bayou, 2) to map the long-term land cover changes within these urban watersheds, and 3) to assess the effect of land cover changes on the bayou discharge, water and soil quality of the watersheds. Water and soil samples from several locations along the Brays and Buffalo Bayous were collected during multiple seasons and processed for chemical analysis. Our water sample analysis revealed that the Cu, As and Pb concentrations were higher in the fall compared to the summer and exceeded the critical limit in both the bayous. The soil analysis indicated that the Zn and Pb concentrations were higher in the fall over summer season and exceeded the background concentrations in both BBW and BrBW. The remote sensing analysis revealed that there was a 145\% and 140\% increase in impervious surface and 34.8\% and 34.5\% decrease in the vegetative surface in the BBW and BrBW, respectively, due to urbanization during 1984-2019. The contamination of soil and water in BrBW is substantially higher than the BBW. The results of this study provide insights for adoption of best sustainable management practices in urban watersheds.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},

Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Monitoring of aquatic habitats for water quality and biodiversity requires regular sampling, often in off-shore locations and underwater. Such sampling is commonly performed manually from research vessels, or if autonomous, is constrained to permanent installations. Consequentially, high frequency ecological monitoring, such as for harmful algal blooms, are limited to few sites and/or temporally infrequent. Here, we demonstrate the use of MEDUSA, an Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicle which is capable of performing underwater sampling and inspection at up to 10 m depth, and is composed of a multirotor platform, a tether management unit and a tethered micro Underwater Vehicle. The system is validated in the task of vertical profiling of Chlorophyll-a levels in freshwater systems by means of a custom solid sample filtering mechanism. This mechanism can collect up to two independent samples per mission by pumping water through a pair of glass-fibre GF/F filters. Chlorophyll levels measured from the solid deposits on the filters are consistent and on par with traditional sampling methods, highlighting the potential of using UAAVs to sample aquatic locations at high frequency and high spatial resolution.},

Abstract = {The pressure and dependence on coastal aquifers are on the rise in many parts of the globe. These lead to overexploitation, aggravated levels of groundwater pollution, and seawater intrusion. Integrated analyses can create holistic insights into the quality and the vulnerability of aquifers to seawater intrusion. In this study, Mombasa North coast's coastal aquifer was characterized by integrating multiple approaches-GALDIT overlay index, seawater intrusion groundwater quality index GQI(SWI), total hardness, water quality index (WQI)-and the results were further explored and interpreted with geospatial analysis techniques. The study suggests that the predominant water type in areas under moderate or high vulnerabilities to seawater intrusion is the Na-Cl water type. However, similar Na-Cl water types can produce a range of total hardness from soft to hard. GQI(SWI) classification can be used to narrow down the observations from Stuyfzand's TH-based classification system. In the aquifer studied, the results of the GALDIT overlay index, a weighted aggregation of intrinsic parameters contributing to seawater intrusion, show that 29\%, 59\%, and 12\% of the aquifer have low, moderate, and high vulnerabilities, respectively. The GQI(SWI) analysis indicates that the groundwater is largely brackish (68\%) but saline towards the southern end of the aquifer at 32\%. Total hardness values indicate that 67\% of the aquifer's coverage falls under the ``moderately hard{''} category. The geodatabase creation introduced in the study provides a template for similar studies and a baseline for future WQI and water quality monitoring. However, temporal studies on chronological timescales are recommended for sustainable management of the aquifer.},

We identify its benefits and costs to encourage social scientlists to consider the use of remote sensing as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutions. Methods. We analyze two multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images to evaluate a habitat conservation plan (HCP) implemented Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. Results, Image analysis provides useful broad spatial scale information on HCP performance that is not discernible to the naked eye or through other methodologies. Conclusions. Satellite image analysis should be considered as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutional designs-despite the financial costs and requisite technical training. These images provide ecological and land cover change information that may not be available elsewhere. We provide lessons learned to help make analysts cognizant of some important issues Surrounding the use of satellite-based imagery for environmental institutional analysis.},

Abstract = {Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration, which reflects the biomass and primary productivity of phytoplankton in water, is an important water quality parameter to assess the eutrophication status of water. The band combinations shown in the images of Donghu Lake (Wuhan City, China) captured by Landsat satellites from 1987 to 2018 were analyzed. The (B4 - B3)/(B4 + B3) {[}(Green-Red)/(Green+Red)] band combination was employed to construct linear, power, exponential, logarithmic and cubic polynomial models based on Chl-a values in Donghu Lake in April 2016. The correlation coefficient (R-2), the relative error (RE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the cubic model were 0.859, 9.175\% and 11.194 mu g/L, respectively and those of the validation model were 0.831, 6.509\% and 19.846 mu g/L, respectively. Remote sensing images from 1987 to 2018 were applied to the model and the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations in spring and autumn of these years was obtained. At the same time, the eutrophication status of Donghu Lake was monitored and evaluated based on the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI). The results showed that theTLI( n-ary sumation ) of Donghu Lake in April 2016 was 63.49 and the historical data on Chl-a concentration showed that Donghu Lake had been eutrophic. The distribution of Chl-a concentration in Donghu Lake was affected by factors such as construction of bridges and dams, commercial activities and enclosure culture in the lake. The overall distribution of Chl-a concentration in each sub-lake was higher than that in the main lake region and Chl-a concentration was highest in summer, followed by spring, autumn and winter. Based on the data of three long-term (2005-2018) monitoring points in Donghu Lake, the matching patterns between meteorological data and Chl-a concentration were analyzed. It revealed that the Chl-a concentration was relatively high in warmer years or rainy years. The long-term measured data also verified the accuracy of the cubic model for Chl-a concentration. The R-2, RE and RMSE of the validation model were 0.641, 2.518\% and 22.606 mu g/L, respectively, which indicated that it was feasible to use Landsat images to retrieve long-term Chl-a concentrations. Based on longitudinal remote sensing data from 1987 to 2018, long-term and large-scale dynamic monitoring of Chl-a concentrations in Donghu Lake was carried out in this study, providing reference and guidance for lake water quality management in the future.},

Abstract = {Unplanned aquaculture led to the destruction of important ecosystems worldwide. A multi-criteria land suitability model (MLSM) was developed to locate the suitable regions for aquaculture using satellite images, AHP and Monte Carlo simulation, spatial analysis, resource characteristics, and regulations. Twenty-one variables within four subgroups (land use, water quality, soil characteristics, and infrastructure support) have been integrated for the site suitability. Land availability was the major limiting factor. The area available for aquaculture was 4310 ha in Ramanathapuram District, which consists of 33.3\% of most appropriate, 23.1\% of appropriate, and 43.6\% of moderately appropriate regions. The carrying capacity of rivers indicated that all rivers had sufficient nutrient assimilation capacity, except the Kottagudi River, where the aquaculture planning is to be within the carrying capacity of the river. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that integrated MLSM and carrying capacity approach could be adopted to identify suitable zones to develop aquaculture and save productive ecosystems.},

Title = {Rapid Assessment of Hillslope Erosion Risk after the 2019-2020 Wildfires and Storm Events in Sydney Drinking Water Catchment},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Australian Black Summer wildfires between September 2019 and January 2020 burnt many parts of eastern Australia including major forests within the Sydney drinking water catchment (SDWC) area, almost 16.000 km(2). There was great concern on post-fire erosion and water quality hazards to Sydney's drinking water supply, especially after the heavy rainfall events in February 2020. We developed a rapid and innovative approach to estimate post-fire hillslope erosion using weather radar, remote sensing, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The event-based rainfall erosivity was estimated from radar-derived rainfall accumulations for all storm events after the wildfires. Satellite data including Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to estimate the fractional vegetation covers and the RUSLE cover-management factor. The study reveals that the average post-fire erosion rate over SDWC in February 2020 was 4.9 Mg ha(-1) month(-1), about 30 times higher than the pre-fire erosion and 10 times higher than the average erosion rate at the same period because of the intense storm events and rainfall erosivity with a return period over 40 years. The high post-fire erosion risk areas (up to 23.8 Mg ha(-1) month(-1)) were at sub-catchments near Warragamba Dam which forms Lake Burragorang and supplies drinking water to more than four million people in Sydney. These findings assist in the timely assessment of post-fire erosion and water quality risks and help develop cost-effective fire incident management and mitigation actions for such an area with both significant ecological and drinking water assets. The methodology developed from this study is potentially applicable elsewhere for similar studies as the input datasets (satellite and radar data) and computing platforms (GEE, GIS) are available and accessible worldwide.},

Booktitle = {HANDBOOK OF BIOENERGY ECONOMICS AND POLICY},

Pages = {307-323},
Abstract = {Corn stover is a likely bioenergy feedstock, but whether farmers would find harvesting stover profitable depends on its price as well as on the prices of corn and other agricultural commodities. We analyze the potential supply of corn stover and the associated changes in crop rotations and tillage practices for a major US corn production region, the state of Iowa. Using remote-sensing crop-cover maps and digitized soils data as inputs to integrated economic, geographical, and environmental models, we simulate the land use changes in response to alternative crop and corn stover prices. The ensuing changes in soil erosion, nitrogen runoff, and phosphorus runoff are predicted with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model. We find that the amount and the location of corn stover available for sale at a viable stover market are greatly influenced by the primary product (crop) markets. High corn stover prices can significantly affect land use, which in turn may incur significant soil erosion as well as nitrogen and phosphorus runoff in the region.},

Title = {Mangrove Ecosystems in the Mekong Delta - Overcoming Uncertainties in Inventory Mapping Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data},
Booktitle = {MEKONG DELTA SYSTEM: INTERDISCIPLINARY ANALYSES OF A RIVER DELTA},
Series = {Environmental Science and Engineering-Environmental Engineering},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {315-330},
Abstract = {In the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, losses of mangroves have been especially severe over the last decades mainly due to clearing for shrimp farming leading to a land use conflict between mangrove silviculture and shrimp aquaculture. Following the law on rules for land use and natural resource utilisation for reforestation of mangrove forests (1999), shrimp farming-forestry enterprises (SFFEs) have therefore been established where shrimp are cultured together with mangroves in integrated farming systems whereby 60\% of the farm area must be protected mangrove. Monitoring tools are therefore required to map the extent of mangroves and aquaculture and to delineate the percentage of mangroves in mixed mangrove-aquaculture farms. Current methodologies in forest mapping and mangrove area estimation require a large amount of manual work. In addition, currently applied methodologies in base data acquisition and transformation into statistics or maps are varying. This is leading to different estimates of mangrove area of the same region in different statistical surveys. Similar problems arise for actual mangrove distribution maps which are generated based on different sources and methodologies. Precise and reliable mangrove maps are of increasing importance, since changes in these ecosystems often occur rapidly. There is a growing demand for detecting and assessing changes especially in the context of climate change, sea level rise and related threats to coastal ecosystems. International organizations and government agencies in several countries are, for this reason, urgently implementing programs of mapping and monitoring to measure the extent of decline of these important ecosystems. Remote sensing enables large-scale, rapid, long-term, and cost-effective mapping and monitoring of mangrove ecosystems and with that provides important information for resource inventory mapping, change detection, and monitoring aquaculture activities. It also supports various management requests, ecosystem evaluation, productivity measurement, water quality assessment, or disaster management.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JUL 25},
Abstract = {The water quality represents the water's physical, chemical and biological properties and depends on the environment, and anthropogenic influences. Recently, river water in Dehradun has subjected to immense pressure due to contamination from indecorous land use and urbanisation. In this study area, water quality assessment is carried out with the help of in situ observations and satellite surface reflectance from October 2018 to March 2019. Physicochemical and microbial qualities, namely, ambient temperature (AT), electrical conductivity (EC), water temperature (WT), potential hydrogen (pH), free carbon di oxide (CO2), biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity (S), total Hardness (TH), calcium hardness (CH), magnesium hardness (MgH), sodium ion (Na), Potassium ion (K), nitrate (NO2), phosphate (PO4), and coliform concentrations (CC) were evaluated in the laboratory, plotted spatially in GIS environment and validated with the Indian Standards (IS). Furthermore, the Pearson correlation matrix was an established between the mean surface reflectance band values of Landsat-8 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the water quality parameters are collected at each station location. The entire river water has been found an unsuitable for drinking but suitable for irrigation purposes. In future, such studies would be supportive for more effective management strategies to overcome the problems of water pollution.},

Nonpoint source pollution problems of rural watersheds in Australia, particularly those in the state of New South Wales, and the role of the state's environment protection agency are outlined. A case study that applies an auditing methodology using GIS in a study area within the Lachlan River catchment is presented. The suitability of the approach for land condition evaluation and the review of land use controls for nonpoint source pollution is discussed.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Since the initiation of economic reforms and opening up, China has witnessed an unprecedented rate of development across all sectors. However, the country has also experienced severe ecological damage, surpassing that of many other nations. The rapid economic growth has come at the expense of the environment, revealing a significant lack of coordination between urbanization and eco-environmental protection in China. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and continuous historical dataset of China's eco-environmental quality (EEQ) based on remote sensing, allowing for the analysis of spatial and temporal changes. Such data would provide objective, scientific, and reliable support for China's eco-environmental protection and pollution prevention policies, while addressing potential ecological risks resulting from urbanization. To achieve this, the entropy value method is employed to integrate multi-source remote sensing data and construct an evaluation system for China's EEQ. Historical data from 2000 to 2017 is plotted to illustrate China's EEQ over time. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) The entropy method effectively facilitates the construction of China's eco-environmental quality assessment system. (2) From 2000 to 2017, approximately 39.7\% of China's regions witnessed a decrease in EEQ, while 60.3\% exhibited improvement, indicating an overall enhancement in EEQ over the past eighteen years. (3) The Yangtze and Yellow River basins experienced improved EEQ due to China's ecological restoration projects. (4) The future EEQ in China demonstrates a subtle positive trend across diverse contexts. This study departs from conventional approaches to EEQ evaluation by leveraging the advantages of multivariate remote sensing big data, including objectivity, timeliness, and accessibility. It provides a novel perspective for future eco-environmental quality evaluation.},

Title = {Spatial Analysis of a Chesapeake Bay Sub-Watershed: How Land Use and Precipitation Patterns Impact Water Quality in the James River},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Changes in land cover throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed, accompanied by variability in climate patterns, can impact runoff and water quality. A study was conducted using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the James River watershed in Virginia, the southernmost tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, from 1986 to 2018, in order to evaluate factors that affect water quality in the river. This research focuses on statistical analysis of land use, precipitation, and water quality indicators. Land cover changes derived from satellite imagery and geographic information system (GIS) tools were compared with water quality parameters throughout that timeframe. Marked decreases in forest land cover were observed throughout the watershed, as well as increased residential development. Our findings suggest strong links between land cover modification, such as residential development, and degraded water quality indicators such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment. In addition, we note direct improvements in water quality when forest land areas are preserved throughout the watershed.},

Title = {Identifying lakes at risk of toxic cyanobacterial blooms using satellite imagery and field surveys across the United States},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {869},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms caused by cyanobacteria are a threat to global water resources and human health. Satellite remote sensing has vastly expanded spatial and temporal data on lake cyanobacteria, yet there is still acute need for tools that identify which waterbodies are at-risk for toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Algal toxins cannot be directly detected through imagery but monitoring toxins associated with cyanobacterial blooms is critical for assessing risk to the environment, animals, and people. The objective of this study is to address this need by developing an approach relating satellite imagery on cyanobacteria with field surveys to model the risk of toxic blooms among lakes. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and United States (US) National Lakes Assessments are leveraged to model the probability among lakes of exceeding lower and higher demonstration thresholds for microcystin toxin, cyanobacteria, and chlorophyll a. By leveraging the large spatial variation among lakes using two national-scale data sources, rather than focusing on temporal variability, this approach avoids many of the previous challenges in relating satellite imagery to cyanotoxins. For every satellite-derived lake-level Cyanobacteria Index (CI\_cyano) increase of 0.01 CI\_cyano/km2, the odds of exceeding six bloom thresholds increased by 23-54 \%. When the models were applied to the 2192 satellite monitored lakes in the US, the number of lakes identified with >= 75 \% probability of exceeding the thresholds included as many as 335 lakes for the lower thresholds and 70 lakes for the higher thresholds, respectively. For microcystin, the models identified 162 and 70 lakes with >= 75 \% probability of exceeding the lower (0.2 mu g/L) and higher (1.0 mu g/L) thresholds, respectively. This approach represents a critical advancement in using satellite imagery and field data to identify lakes at risk for developing toxic cyanobacteria blooms. Such models can help translate satellite data to aid water quality monitoring and management.},

Title = {Impacts of Insufficient Observations on the Monitoring of Short- and Long-Term Suspended Solids Variations in Highly Dynamic Waters, and Implications for an Optimal Observation Strategy},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Coastal water regions represent some of the most fragile ecosystems, exposed to both climate change and human activities. While remote sensing provides unprecedented amounts of data for water quality monitoring on regional to global scales, the performance of satellite observations is frequently impeded by revisiting intervals and unfavorable conditions, such as cloud coverage and sun glint. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the impacts of varied sampling strategies (time and frequency) and insufficient observations on the monitoring of short-term and long-term tendencies of water quality parameters, such as suspended solids (SS), in highly dynamic coastal waters. Taking advantage of the first high-frequency in situ SS dataset (at 30 min sampling intervals from 2007 to 2008), collected in Deep Bay, China, this paper presents a quantitative analysis of the influences of sampling strategies on the monitoring of SS, in terms of sampling frequency and time of day. Dramatic variations of SS were observed, with standard deviation coefficients of 48.9\% and 54.1\%, at two fixed stations; in addition, significant uncertainties were revealed, with the average absolute percent difference of approximately 13\%, related to sampling frequency and time, using nonlinear optimization and random simulation methods. For a sampling frequency of less than two observations per day, the relative error of SS was higher than 50\%, and stabilized at approximately 10\%, when at least four or five samplings were conducted per day. The optimal recommended sampling times for SS were at around 9:00, 12:00, 14:00, and 16:00 in Deep Bay. The pseudo MODIS SS dataset was obtained from high-frequency in situ SS measurements at 10:30 and 14:00, masked by the temporal gap distribution of MODIS coverage to avoid uncertainties propagated from atmospheric correction and SS models. Noteworthy uncertainties of daily observations from the Terra/Aqua MODIS were found, with mean relative errors of 19.2\% and 17.8\%, respectively, whereas at the monthly level, the mean relative error of Terra/Aqua MODIS observations was approximately 10.7\% (standard deviation of 8.4\%). Sensitivity analysis between MODIS coverage and SS relative errors indicated that temporal coverage (the percentage of valid MODIS observations for a month) of more than 70\% is required to obtain high-precision SS measurements at a 5\% error level. Furthermore, approximately 20\% of relative errors were found with the coverage of 30\%, which was the average coverage of satellite observations over global coastal waters. These results highlight the need for high-frequency measurements of geostationary satellites like GOCI and multi-source ocean color sensors to capture the dynamic process of coastal waters in both the short and long term.},

Abstract = {In situ sensors that collect high-frequency data are used increasingly to monitor aquatic environments. These sensors are prone to technical errors, resulting in unrecorded observations and/or anomalous values that are subsequently removed and create gaps in time series data. We present a framework based on generalized additive and auto-regressive models to recover these missing data. To mimic sporadically missing (i) single observations and (ii) periods of contiguous observations, we randomly removed (i) point data and (ii) day- and week-long sequences of data from a two-year time series of nitrate concentration data collected from Arikaree River, USA, where synoptically collected water temperature, turbidity, conductance, elevation, and dissolved oxygen data were available. In 72\% of cases with missing point data, predicted values were within the sensor precision interval of the original value, although predictive ability declined when sequences of missing data occurred. Precision also depended on the availability of other water quality covariates. When covariates were available, even a sudden, event-based peak in nitrate concentration was reconstructed well. By providing a promising method for accurate prediction of missing data, the utility and confidence in summary statistics and statistical trends will increase, thereby assisting the effective monitoring and management of fresh waters and other at-risk ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The increasingly serious harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Taihu Lake has brought huge losses to the local economy and people's life in Taihu Lake. Satellite remote sensing technology has become one of the most important monitoring methods for HAB disasters due to its large-scale and long-term advantages. GOCI image has become the new data source of HAB monitoring because of its large size and high time resolution. Due to the low spatial resolution (500 m) and the existence of mixed pixels, the error of HAB area obtained by the NDVI method is large. In this paper, the linear mixing model (LMM) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold method are combined to extract the HAB area from GOCI images with 500-m spatial resolution. Compared with the results of the HAB area extracted by Landsat8 OLI and MODIS data, three small areas in the study area were selected to verify the accuracy of the HAB area extracted from the GOCI image on October 2, 2015. The results show that when the NDVI threshold is 0.1, the area error of HABs is the smallest when the extracted HAB pixels mask the decomposition results of mixed pixels; besides, the area error of HABs extracted from the GOCI image is smaller than that from MODIS image; finally, GOCI image can extract the spatial dynamic distribution of HABs in Taihu Lake within 8 h a day, which has higher temporal resolution than the MODIS image. Compared with the NDVI threshold method and LMM method, the inversion accuracy is greatly improved, and the accuracy is stable in different regions. It can provide technical support for the decision-making and assessment of HAB ecological disasters.},

Abstract = {Conservation Units are National Environment Policy instruments that determined the creation of areas for protection and guarantee of ecosystem balance in the Brazilian territory. The Uberaba River Environmental Protection Area (APA) is a water conservation unit in the city of Uberaba -MG. It is characterized as a sustainable use conservation unit, and some highly impacting activities have been occurring in this area, leading to erosion, water eutrophication, and changes in water quality and quantity. The aims of this study were to evaluate soil losses and to diagnose areas of natural potential for erosion (PNE) using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), the Geographic Information System (GIS), and remote sensing products. Adjusted PNE was low (<100 t ha-1 year-1) in 38.72\% of the APA and moderate (100-200 t ha-1 year-1) in 31.29\% of the area. High (200-600 t ha-1 year-1), very high (600-1000 t ha-1 year-1), and extremely high indexes (> 1000 t ha-1 year-1) were observed in 29.99\% of the APA. Estimates of soil loss due to water erosion below 5 t ha-1 year-1 represented 43.81\% of the APA. Estimated losses between 5 and 10 t ha-1 year-1 occur in 12.22\% of the area; from 10 to 20 t ha-1 year-1, 21.82\% of the area; between 20 and 50 t ha-1 year-1,17.89\% of the area; from 50 to 100 t ha-1 year-1, 3.92\% of the area; and losses over 100 t ha-1 year-1 involved 0.34\% of the APA. The use of geotechnology, remote sensing products, geographic information systems, and the Universal Soil Loss Equation enabled spatial identification of sites of greater and lesser potential erosion risk, which enabling the estimation of soil loss rates throughout the Uberaba River Environmental Protection Area.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {161-172},
Abstract = {Optical properties have fundamental importance to water quality, ecology, and remote sensing initiatives. Paired measurements of optically active constituents (OACs), and inherent optical properties (IOPs) and apparent optical properties (AOPs), were made in September 2010 across the optical gradients of Green Bay, extending from the Fox River to Sturgeon Bay (8 sites), and for three near-shore locations in the main basin of Lake Michigan. The array of laboratory and in situ measurements provided a robust characterization of the underwater and emergent light fields of these waters with respect to magnitudes and spectral features of the OACs, IOPs and AOPs. These measurements resolved the character and possible origins of the major gradients within the bay (5 to 10-fold differences) and the substantial differences between the bay and the main basin. The credibility of the characterizations was supported through closure analyses which demonstrated: (1) the approach to equivalence between various field and laboratory measurements, and (2) good matches of AOP observations by values predicted from measured IOPs using accepted radiative transfer expressions. The bay was demonstrated to be an optically complex case 2 system, with uncoupled variations along the spatial gradient(s) in OACs of phytoplankton biomass, colored dissolved organic material, and non-algal particulates. The documented spatial differences in optical properties rival those reported in much larger marine surveys. Radiative transfer expressions are used to predict changes in AOPs of the downwelling (underwater) attenuation coefficient and remote sensing signal in response to scenarios of changes in levels of OACs of potential ecological and management interest.

Title = {Impacts of Landscape Changes on Water Resources},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Changes in land use and land cover can have many drivers, including population growth, urbanization, agriculture, demand for food, evolution of socio-economic structure, policy regulations, and climate variability. The impacts of these changes on water resources range from changes in water availability (due to changes in losses of water to evapotranspiration and recharge) to degradation of water quality (increased erosion, salinity, chemical loadings, and pathogens). The impacts are manifested through complex hydro-bio-geo-climate characteristics, which underscore the need for integrated scientific approaches to understand the impacts of landscape change on water resources. Several techniques, such as field studies, long-term monitoring, remote sensing technologies, and advanced modeling studies have been contributing to better understanding the modes and mechanisms by which landscape changes impact water resources. Such research studies can help unlock the complex interconnected influences of landscape on water resources for quantity and quality at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In this Special Issue, we published a set of eight peer-reviewed articles elaborating on some of the specific topics of landscape changes and associated impacts on water resources.},

Abstract = {This study presents a model budget for groundwater in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt. The stable isotopic composition and hydrochemistry of groundwater samples collected from different aquifers were determined to identify recharge sources and water quality. Stable isotopic values suggest that shallow alluvial and fracture zone aquifers are recharged from seasonal precipitation, while groundwater in deeper sedimentary sub-basins is paleowater that was recharged during periods of less arid regional climate. Hydrochemical analysis indicates elevated salinity in each aquifer type, which is attributed to leaching and dissolution of terrestrial salts and to mixing with marine water. Groundwater from sedimentary sub-basin aquifers can be treated and used for drinking and domestic purposes. Groundwater from shallow alluvial and fracture zone wells is suitable for animal husbandry and mineral ore dressing. A model water budget shows that approximately 4.8 x 10(9) m(3) of recoverable groundwater is stored in sedimentary sub-basin aquifers, or approximately 550 years of water at present utilization rates.

Abstract = {Information on landuse/landcover change is a critical input for natural resource management policy decisions. Remote sensing data under GIS domain were utilized to evaluate the changes in land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) spanning a period of thirty three years during 1975 to 2008 along the Dhansiri River channel, Assam, India. Seven different types of LU/LC were categorized and out of them cropland was evident as the most important landuse/landcover practices followed by dense mixed jungle in 1975 and the settlement in 2008. Significant reduction (13.02\%) in cropland area to settlement was observed. Moreover, teagarden also occupies 0.77\% of the total area from cropland and open mixed jungle. The changes in the areas of swampy land as evident from the present study in turn will impact the environmental quality around it and will help to increase the surface run off leading to enhancement of erosion processes. It is believed that the present study will help to contribute towards sustainable land-use planning and management towards protection of extremely rich biodiversity of the North East India with mighty Brahmaputra River system.},

Abstract = {This study was an attempt to analyse the regional environmental quality with the application of remote sensing, geographical information system, and spatial multiple criteria decision analysis and, to project a quantitative method applicable to identify the status of the regional environment of the study area. Using spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) approach with expert knowledge in this study, an integrated regional environmental quality index (REQI) was computed and classified into five levels of regional environment quality viz. worse, poor, moderate, good, and very good. During the process, a set of spatial criteria were selected (here, 15 criterions) together with the degree of importance of criteria in sustainability of the regional environment. Integrated remote sensing and GIS technique and models were applied to generate the necessary factors (criterions) maps for the SMCE approach. The ranking, along with expected value method, was used to standardize the factors and on the other hand, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was applied for calculating factor weights. The entire process was executed in the integrated land and water information system (ILWIS) software tool that supports SMCE. The analysis showed that the overall regional environmental quality of the area was at moderate level and was partly determined by elevation. Areas under worse and poor quality of environment indicated that the regional environmental status showed decline in these parts of the county. The study also revealed that the human activities, vegetation condition, soil erosion, topography, climate, and soil conditions have serious influence on the regional environment condition of the area. Considering the regional characteristics of environmental quality, priority, and practical needs for environmental restoration, the study area was further regionalized into four priority areas which may serve as base areas of decision making for the recovery, rebuilding, and protection of the environment.},

Abstract = {A constellation of satellites that routinely and frequently images the Earth's land surface in consistently calibrated wavelengths from the visible through the microwave and in spatial detail that ranges from submeter to hundreds of meters would offer enormous potential benefits to society. A well-designed and effectively operated land surface imaging satellite constellation could have great positive impact not only on the quality of life for citizens of all nations, but also on mankind's very ability to sustain life as we know it on this planet long into the future. The primary objective of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Surface Imaging (LSI) Constellation is to define standards (or guidelines) that describe optimal future LSI Constellation capabilities, characteristics, and practices. Standards defined for a LSI Constellation will be based on a thorough understanding of user requirements, and they will address at least three fundamental areas of the systems comprising a Land Surface Imaging Constellation: the space segments, the ground segments, and relevant policies and plans. Studies conducted by the LSI Constellation Study Team also will address current and shorter-term problems and issues facing the land remote sensing community today, such as seeking ways to work more cooperatively in the operation of existing land surface imaging systems and helping to accomplish tangible benefits to society through application of land surface image data acquired by existing systems. 2007 LSI Constellation studies are designed to establish initial international agreements, develop preliminary standards for a mid-resolution land surface imaging constellation, and contribute data to a global forest assessment.},

Title = {Remote Sensing Estimation of Lake Total Phosphorus Concentration Based on MODIS: A Case Study of Lake Hongze},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an important substance for the growth of phytoplankton and an efficient index to assess the water quality. However, estimation of the TP concentration in waters by remote sensing must be associated with optical substances such as the chlorophyll-a (Chla) and the suspended particulate matter (SPM). Based on the good correlation between the suspended inorganic matter (SPIM) and P in Lake Hongze, we used the direct and indirect derivation methods to develop algorithms for the total phosphorus (TP) estimation with the MODIS/Aqua data. Results demonstrate that the direct derivation algorithm based on 645 nm and 1240 nm of the MODIS/Aqua performs a satisfied accuracy (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.029mg/L, MRE = 39\% for the training dataset, R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.033mg/L, MRE = 47\% for the validate dataset), which is better than that of the indirect derivation algorithm. The 645 nm and 1240 nm of MODIS are the main characteristic band of the SPM, so that algorithm can effectively reflect the P variations in Lake Hongze. Additionally, the ratio of the TP to the SPM is positively correlated with the accuracy of the algorithm as well. The proportion of the SPIM in the SPM has a complex effect on the accuracy of the algorithm. When the SPIM accounts for 78\%, the algorithm achieves the highest accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of this direct derivation algorithm was examined in two inland lakes in China (Lake Nanyi and Lake Chaohu), it derived the expected P distribution in Lake Nanyi whereas the algorithm failed in Lake Chaohu. Different water properties influence significantly the accuracy of this direct derivation algorithm, while the TP, Chla, and suspended particular inorganic matter (SPOM) of Lake Chaohu are much higher than those of the other two lakes, thus it is difficult to estimate the TP concentration by a simple band combination in Lake Chaohu. Although the algorithm depends on the dataset used in the development, it usually presents a good estimation for those waters where the SPIM dominated, especially when the SPIM accounts for 60\% to 80\% of the SPM. This research proposed a direct derivation algorithm for the TP estimation for the turbid lake and will provide a theoretical and practical reference for extending the optical remote sensing application and the TP empirical algorithm of Lake Hongze's help for the local government management water quality.},

Title = {A temporospatial assessment of environmental quality in urbanizing Ethiopia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {332},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Global environmental quality has been negatively affected by urbanization, particularly vulnerable in the Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism and driving forces for the change of environmental quality with urbanization process is essential to improve the environmental sustainability. In this study, the compounded night light index (CNLI) and remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) were used respec-tively to evaluate the urbanization level and environmental quality in Ethiopia from 2010 to 2020. On this basis, a temporospatial assessment framework was proposed, followed by methods of coupling coordination degree, spatial autocorrelation, elasticity, and decomposition. The results showed that 63 out of 690 woredas experi-enced environmental deterioration. Socioeconomic effect, carbon intensity, and climate change were decom-posed as drivers to environmental quality, with socioeconomic effects contributing >68\% of environmental improvement, while carbon intensity and climate change were responsible for >51\% and >58\% of environ-mental deterioration from 2010 values. Continuous increase in impervious surfaces resulted in a six-fold increase in surface runoff, which raised the flooding risk in sub areas and rural landscapes. This demands reforms of climate strategies and proper livestock management.},

Title = {Sentinel-2 MSI Observations of Water Clarity in Inland Waters across Hainan Island and Implications for SDG 6.3.2 Evaluation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Freshwater on islands represents a precious resource and highly vulnerable ecosystem. For monitoring freshwater, satellite remote sensing is efficient and has large-scale application. This study proposed a modified model of the quasi-analytical algorithm (Z(SD)-QAAv6m) to retrieve the water clarity of inland waters (>1 km(2)) across Hainan Island, China using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument data. By adjusting the threshold of R-rs(665), the proposed model could accurately estimate water clarity with diverse optical properties on the island and avoid underestimation in moderately clear waters. Based upon this, the first spatiotemporal analysis of recent water clarity in Hainan Island was conducted. The results show that lake water clarity in the central region was generally higher (with average value of 1.4 m) than that of coastal regions (with average value of 1.2 m). Seasonally, the water clarity during the wet season was usually lower than that in the dry season, with average values of 1.1 m and 1.3 m across the island respectively. From 2017 to 2021, the proportion of water bodies with water clarity > 0.5 m increased from 60\% to 100\%. The overall spatial pattern of water clarity was correlated to the regional vegetation cover in Hainan Island, with higher clarity associated with higher vegetation cover in the central regions. The seasonal variation of water clarity may be attributed to heavy rainfall and runoff during the wet season; while the distinct annual variation may be benefited from the strengthened surface water protections in Hainan Province in recent years. This study provides a practical approach for evaluating the SDG 6.3.2 indicator in Hainan Island using remote sensed water clarity as a comprehensive water quality indicator and the findings could facilitate the island's water resource management and conservation.},

Title = {Monitoring basin-scale land cover changes in Kagera Basin of Lake Victoria using ancillary data and remote sensing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {The Kagera Basin is a high value ecosystem in the Lake Victoria watershed because of the hydrological and food services it provides. The basin has faced large scale human induced land use and land cover changes (LUCC), but quantitative data is to date lacking. A combination of ancillary data and satellite imagery were interpreted to construct LUCC dynamics for the last century. This study is an initial step towards assessing the impact of LUCC on sustainable agriculture and water quality in the watershed. The results show that large trends of LUCC have rapidly occurred over the last 100 years. The most dominant LUCC processes were gains in farmland areas (not detectable in 1901 to 60\% in 2010) and a net reduction in dense forest (7\% to 2.6\%), woodlands (51\% to 6.9\%) and savannas (35\% to 19.6\%) between 1901 and 2010. Forest degradation rapidly occurred during 1974 and 1995 but the forest re-grew between 1995 and 2010 due to forest conservation efforts. Afforestation efforts have resulted in plantation forest increases between 1995 and 2010. The rates of LUCC observed are higher than those reported in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and other parts of the world. This is one of the few studies in SSA at a basin scale that combines multi-source spatio-temporal data on land cover to enable long-term quantification of land cover changes. In the discussion we address future research needs for the area based on the results of this study. These research needs include quantifying the impacts of land cover change on nutrient and sediment dynamics, soil organic carbon stocks, and changes in biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {229},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Particulate organic carbon (POC) storage play an essential role in determining carbon sinks and water quality in shallow eutrophic lakes. Although satellite data have been adopted to observe surface POC content, the previous remote sensing results cannot indicate water column-integrated POC storage in shallow eutrophic lakes with vertically nonuniform POC profiles. Based on 272 in-situ POC profiles collected from 19 shallow eutrophic lakes in China's Yangtze-Huai Plain (YHP), this study developed a novel process-oriented method to derive water column-integrated POC storage from OLCI/Sentinel-3A satellite data. The method included three critical steps: remotely estimating surface POC contents, identifying POC profile types (uniform, exponential decay, or power decay) through a binary decision tree, and parameterizing POC profiles using surface POC concentrations. The developed algorithms showed a bias of -25.79\% for in-situ match-ups from 15 lakes (N = 88). The POC in the eutrophic lakes was mainly produced by phytoplankton (R2 = 0.87). As a result, the surface POC content pre-sented a unimodal peak in summer. However, in addition to air temperature regulations (0.52 - 68.53\%), the water level also showed apparent effects on increasing POC storage, with relative contributions of 29.29 - 95.51\% for the six largest lakes. Therefore, multisource satellite data are needed to derive POC storage in global eutrophic lakes remotely. This study is the first attempt to three-dimensionally observe lake POC contents from space and is important for understanding the carbon cycle in shallow eutrophic lakes.},

Abstract = {The primary objective was appraisal of groundwater quality during pre- and post-monsoon seasons for irrigation purposes. Good quality groundwater is required for high crop yields in arid regions. A total of 45 samples were collected from wells and analyzed in the laboratory for this research work. Different water quality parameters were determined from these samples, namely electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium percent (Na\%), and permeability index (PI) during the pre- and post-monsoon season. The water types were identified through a Piper-trilinear diagram. Fifty per cent of the water samples of the total basin area fall under the saline category. The local farmers heavily rely on groundwater for the irrigation of crops. Excess use of groundwater for irrigation raises soil salinity. Some parts of the study area are facing serious problems such as loss of crop yields, and low availability of good quality groundwater even for drinking purposes. The results highlight that the study area has a high salinity content (C3) and low sodium (51). The maps for different water quality parameters were generated using inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method in ArcGIS 10.3 software.},

Abstract = {As an important carrier of material cultural heritage, historical building groups (HBGs) in ancient villages full of historical imprint and architectural aesthetics value. However, the historical building groups undermines from natural and human activities constantly, thus the 3D digital protection for the historical building groups being of great urgency. Aiming at 3D real modeling for historical building groups in ancient villages with high-precise and fine real simulation, this paper put forward a technology process based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) Remote Sensing(RS) and Ground RS technology. During the RS image acquisition, low-altitude RS images acquired by Remote Sensor on Multi-rotor UAV and ground RS images acquired by Remote Sensor on 3-Axis Handheld Stabilized Camera. In the technology process, firstly, the Relative Orientation(RO) of ground RS images solved by Automatic Vertical Aerial Triangulation(AV-AT), the Exterior Orientation(EO) of ground RS images solved by Rigid Registration with the production of AV-AT and Photo Control Point(PCP); Secondly, the EO of low altitude RS images solved by Rigid Registration with PCP and Photo Position Metadata; finally, based on the above EO, Context Capture conduct 3D real modeling process, in which contains supplemental images matching, colored point cloud generating, point cloud optimization, TIN generating and texture mapping. The technology process applied in the 3D real modeling of a typical historical village in Dongguan, and the precision of production was evaluated by geometry measurement. In the 3D real modeling results of large cultural heritage, preliminary experiments shows that the precision of geometry and the spatial resolution of texture mapping is generally better than the Grade. according to the Specification for the Digital Products of 3D Model on Geographic Information. Therefore, the technology process achieves the integrating low-altitude RS images with ground RS images, makes full use of the advantages of different position of the RS from ground and low-altitude, and it is able to acquire more complete image information for large cultural heritages, with obvious advantages in building a 3D real scene model in high accuracy and good recovery.},

Title = {A Systematic Review Investigating the Use of Earth Observation for the Assistance of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Disaster Response and Recovery},

Abstract = {The use of Earth observation technology such as satellites, unmanned aircraft, or drones as part of early-warning systems and disaster risk reduction plans is a widely researched and established area of study. However, the use this technology can have in the provision of water, sanitation and hygiene services in the response and recovery phases of a disaster is not widely researched. A systematic literature review was undertaken assessing relevant literature to identify Earth observation technology and methods that can be applied to the context of water, sanitation and hygiene in disaster response and recovery. Whilst there were many water-related studies, there was a lack of studies looking at the potential uses of Earth observation for sanitation. This is an area that requires further research. Three main common uses of Earth observation technology were identified as relevant: (1) Monitoring of surface water quality; (2) Groundwater Sensing; and (3) Mapping and monitoring of hazards and infrastructure. Whilst the studies of Earth observation in these areas highlight that this technology could be usefully applied to assist with water, sanitation and hygiene during disaster response and recovery, more research is needed and there are limitations to consider-predominantly that funding, communication and integration between many agencies and technologies are required. Additionally, some technologies are subject to local regulations which can cause restrictions to their use over contested or private areas, or trans-national boundaries-common situations in disasters. This review was largely influenced by the search strings inputted during the identification of relevant literature; changing the search strings would likely result in a different combination of literature available for review and subsequent variations in the findings.},

Title = {Using remote sensing to identify liquid manure applications in eastern North Carolina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {317},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Nutrient pollution from farm fertilizers and manure is a global concern. Excess nitrogen and phosphorous has been linked to algal blooms and a host of other water quality issues. In the U.S., most animal production occurs in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) housing a significant number of animals in a confined space. CAFOs tend to cluster in space and thus generate large quantities of manures within a small area. Liquid manure from CAFOs is often stored in open-air lagoons and then applied via irrigation to crops on nearby `sprayfields'. The full scope and extent of CAFO impacts remain unclear because of the paucity of public information regarding animal numbers, barn and lagoon locations, and manure management practices. Where and when manure is applied on the landscape is key missing data that is needed to better understand and mitigate consequences of CAFO management practices. The aim of this study was to detect land applications of liquid manure using a remote sensing approach. We used random forest models incorporating C-Band synthetic-aperture radar, multispectral imagery, and other predictors to examine soil moisture conditions indicating probable liquid manure applications across known sprayfields in eastern North Carolina. Our models successfully distinguished saturated and unsaturated soils within corn, soybean, grassland, and `other' crops, with 93-98\% accuracy against validation for clear weather periods during the dormant, early, and late growing seasons. A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that the mean soil saturation frequency was significantly higher on sprayfields than non-sprayfields of the same crop type (p < 2.2e-16). We also found that manure applications were concentrated within similar to 1 km from the point of generation. This is the first application of satellite-based radar for identifying the location and timing of manure applications over broad areas. Future work can build on these methods to further understand manure management at CAFOs, as well as to improve pollution source tracking and modeling.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB) cause human and ecological health problems in lakes worldwide. The timely distribution of satellite-derived cyanoHAB data is necessary for adaptive water quality management and for targeted deployment of water quality monitoring resources. Software platforms that permit timely, useful, and cost-effective delivery of information from satellites are required to help managers respond to cyanoHABs. The Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) mobile device application (app) uses data from the European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) in near real-time to make initial water quality assessments and quickly alert managers to potential problems and emerging threats related to cyanobacteria. App functionality and satellite data were validated with 25 state health advisories issued in 2017. The CyAN app provides water quality managers with a user-friendly platform that reduces the complexities associated with accessing satellite data to allow fast, efficient, initial assessments across lakes.},

Title = {A Multi-Sensor Approach to Examining the Distribution of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System, NC, USA},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {For many coastal waters, total suspended matter (TSM) plays a major role in key biological, chemical and geological processes. Effective mapping and monitoring technologies for TSM are therefore needed to support research investigations and environmental assessment and management efforts. Although several investigators have demonstrated that TSM or suspended sediments can be successfully mapped using MODIS 250 m data for relatively large water bodies, MODIS 250 m data is of more limited use for smaller estuaries and bays or aquatic systems with complex shoreline geometry. To adequately examine TSM in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES) of North Carolina, the large-scale synoptic view of MODIS and the higher spatial resolution of other sensors are required. MODIS, Landsat 7 ETM+ and FORMOSAT-2 remote sensing instrument (RSI) data were collected on 8 November, 24 November and 10 December, 2010. Using TSM images (mg/L) derived from MODIS 250 m band 1 (620-670 nm) data, Landsat 7 ETM+ 30 m band 3 (630-690 nm) and FORMOSAT-2 RSI 8 m band 3 (630-690 nm) atmospherically corrected images were calibrated to TSM for select areas of the APES. There was a significant linear relationship between both Landsat 7 ETM+ (r(2) = 0.87, n = 599, P < 0.001) and FORMOSAT-2 RSI (r(2) = 0.95, n = 583, P < 0.001) reflectance images and MODIS-derived TSM concentrations, thus providing consistent estimates of TSM at 250, 30 and 8 m pixel resolutions. This multi-sensor approach will support a broad range of investigations on the water quality of the APES and help guide sampling schemes of future field campaigns.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of Daye, Hubei, China, to trace the mining activities and related environment changes during the past 10 years, with an emphasis on land cover changes. Three sets of satellite data have been used in this case study: TM (ETM+), SPOT-5 and QuickBird image data. A multi-temporal dataset consisting of two Land sat 5 Thematic Mapper JM) images and one Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image including 1986, 1994 and 2002 have been used to compare the land cover changes of the Daye area, Hubei Province, China. The combined bands method, iron oxide index and the NDVI index method have been used to investigate the spectrum character and the space character of the different ground objects. The knowledge-based decision tree classification method has been used to get the highly accurate classification result with the TM and ETM+ image data; the interactive interpret Method has been used to interpret the mine distributing with the SPOT-5 and TM fusion image; the visual interpretation method has been used to interpret mine distributing and environment changes with the QuickBird panchromatic and the multi-spectral fusion image. The characteristics of the high accurate classification result and high accurate change detection make quantitative analysis of different mining area features possible. The results of change detection show that the water quality of the whole water body was still bad, although the water quality have been improved in some areas. Vegetation shows degradation trend especially in those areas close to the mining areas, large areas of wood land and plantations are reduced, the increasing bare areas appeared based on the mine database, the reclamation percentage of the abandoned mining is only 20\% from 1986 to 2002. The ecological environment in the study area may become worse unless the efficient management of mining business and effective eco-enviromnent protection in mining area are carried out instantly.},

Title = {Spatial modelling of groundwater quality across a land use and land cover gradient in Limpopo Province, South Africa},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The spatial variability of groundwater quality in rural Mokopane District is investigated. This was achieved by evaluating the variability in groundwater physio-chemical parameters in relation to Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)using Kriging geo-statistical technique and key groundwater physio-chemical parameters namely; ammonia, lead, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), nitrates and chloride. Firstly, we derived the LULC from 30-m Landsat 8-OLI satellite data, with an overall accuracy of 76.67\%. Water quality parameters were modelled in geographic information systems using the kriging interpolation technique. We then compared measured water quality and the drinking standards recommended by the South African Water Quality Standards (SAWS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline standards for drinking water. Results indicated that there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the levels of physio-chemical contents between borehole water and standard values according to the SAWS and WHO. For example, TDS in Mosesetjane exceeded both SAWS and WHO drinking water levels. Nitrate concentrations were also high on the first and second quarter with concentration levels of 5.56-29 mg/l and 30.9 mg/l in Mosesetjane, respectively. However, lead and ammonia were found to be evenly distributed in all the four quarters, but exhibited some slight deviations from the standard levels (+/- 4.7 mg/l) in selected quarters. Results also indicated significant differences in TDS, chloride and nitrate concentrations across different LULC types. Subsistence farming and built-up areas were the main LULC types that were found to have high concentrations of TDS, ammonia and nitrates, exceeding the recommended standards. However, lead and ammonia, did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) and these parameters were fairly distributed, with less spatial variability. The second quarter, extending between October and December, and the fourth quarter, extending from April to June, exhibited high concentrations of nitrates, chloride and TDS during the wet season. On the other hand, the first and third quarter of the dry period were associated with low concentrations. This study indicated that LULC types and seasonal variability have influence on specific groundwater quality parameters.},

Title = {An integrated field data and remote sensing approach for impact assessment of human activities on epifauna macrobenthos biodiversity along the western coast of Aqaba Gulf},

Abstract = {The Egyptian coast of Gulf of Aqaba, north of the Red Sea, suffers from severe destruction and deterioration in habitat and biodiversity due to anthropogenic activities and flooding. The present work aims to evaluate the impacts of different human activities and flooding on the biodiversity of macrobenthic invertebrates along the Egyptian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba. From January 2019 to December 2019, many field trips (12 trips) were conducted to survey macrobenthic invertebrate communities and monitor water quality at nine sites within three sectors along the study area. Each site was divided into four ecological zones and one of five categories, according to the main activities at each site. Furthermore, satellite data were used to monitor the progress of land use and turbidity in the study area. Therefore, the current study assesses the relationship between these factors and water quality and macrobenthic invertebrate distributions, similarity, diversity, dominance and abundance. The results revealed that 53 macrobenthic invertebrate species belonging to three phyla (Mollusca, Echinodermata and Annelida) and one subphylum (Crustacea) were recorded. The echinoderm Echinometra mathaei was the major eudominant species. The northern part of the Gulf was higher in abundance and diversity with low land use and lowest water turbidity, while the south part showed contrary findings. All statistical analysis confirmed that the dissolved oxygen concentration was considered the only limiting factor for the abundance and diversity of macrobenthic invertebrates. Also, the variation in activities at investigated sites affected the dominance state of species in each site. Moreover, GPS data confirmed that the tourism activity had the largest influence on marine ecosystems and biodiversity, followed by fishing and desalination practices. Otherwise, flooding has significant influence on marine habitats and creates a habitat in which other certain species can survive. In the absence of awareness, intervention and disregard for the effective coastal zone management concept, especially for the unique marine ecosystems such as the Gulf of Aqaba, the degradation of biodiversity will continue until extinction, and human life is rendered unsustainable.},

Abstract = {The seasonal variation characteristics of eutrophication based on HJ-1 data and synchronous observation data on the ground were studied to provide a theoretical basis for the restoration and management of eutrophication in Dongting Lake. The remote sensing model of chlorophyll-a concentration inversion was established through the comparative analysis of the linear model, exponential model, logarithmic model and quadratic polynomial model by 38 kinds of band combinations. The average relative error was 22.81\%. The RMSE of 13.71 mg/m(3) was far lower than the average concentration of 34.16 mg/m(3). The results showed the following. (i) From the perspective of time distribution, the eutrophication degree decreased successively in summer, autumn, spring, and winter. Dongting Lake is mainly in the state of moderate nutrition, which may be attributed to its unique hydrological conditions (short water cycle and fast flow rate). (ii) Eutrophicated water bodies are mainly distributed in the East Dongting Lake and inner lake where the water flow is relatively slow. The water bodies with pool nutrient status are mainly distributed in the outer lake areas where the water flows faster, such as West Dongting Lake.},

Title = {A risk assessment method for remote sensing of cyanobacterial blooms in inland waters},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {740},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {The widespread occurrence of Cyanobacterial blooms (CABs) in inland waters is a typical and severe challenge for water resources management and environment protection. An accurate and spatially continuous risk assessment of CABs is critical for prediction and preparedness in advance. In this study, a multivariate integrated risk assessment (MIRA) method of CABs in inland waters was proposed. MIRA was simplified with the trophic levels, cyanobacterial and other aquatic plant condition using remote sensing indexes, including the Trophic State Index (TSI), Floating Algae Index (FM) and Cyanobacteria and Macrophytes Index (CMI). First, the dates of risk assessment were carefully selected based on TSI. Then, we obtained the trophic levels, cyanobacterial, and other aquatic plant condition of water using TSI, CMI and FM on the selected date, and further scored them pixel by pixel to quantify the risk value. Finally, the risk of CABs in water was accurately assessed based on the pixel risk value. Based on Landsat 8 OLI dataset, MIRA was executed and validated in three different lakes of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) with different trophic states. The results demonstrated that the risk of CABs in Lake LongGan was overall higher than that in Lake LiangZi and Lake FuTou. And the risk of CABs in the east part of Lake LongGan was higher than the other parts. Seasonally, the risk level ranking in Lake LiangZi was the highest in summer, while lowest in winter. However, the seasonal risk ranking was spring, summer, autumn, and winter in Lake LongGan. Based on the comparisons with monthly water quality classification data and results of the existing study, including trophic level. ecology risk, and algal extent, the MIRA method was valuable for accurate and spatially continuous identifying the risk of CABs in inland waters with potential eutrophication trends.

Abstract = {Satellite image data were used to detect, monitor and map different pollutants at five study sites along the El-Gamil beach, including El-Debba, El-Manasra, El-Fardous and El-Gamil inlets and the El-Gamil airport. The images were rectified and analysed by ERDAS IMAGINE 8.7. Image processing techniques were applied using ENVI 4.2 to analyse the SPOT image data (10 m resolution) for 2006. Image enhancement, principal component analysis (PCA), band ratios and supervised/unsupervised classifications were applied. Surface water samples were collected during the winter of 2005 and the summer of 2006. Water contamination was found to be higher in the summer than in the winter. SPOT image data from the summer, therefore, was selected to verify the results of metal analysis. Different pollutants detected along the El Manasra and El Debba sites are associated with industrial development, and discharge from natural gas companies and electric power generating stations. Significant water pollution is not unique to this region of the Mediterranean Sea, but is increasingly common at coastal locations throughout the globe. To protect both the marine environment and commercial interests that depend on clean water and beaches (e. g. beach resorts), effective wastewater management practices must be designed, implemented and maintained, along with reasonable development policies. Remote sensing may be an important tool for monitoring the effectiveness of any pollution mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Ports are open systems with direct connection to the sea, therefore any potential impact on port waters may have implications for the health of adjacent marine ecosystems. European WFD addressed ports in the category of Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWBs) and promoted implementation of protocols to monitor and improve their ecological status. TRIX index, which incorporates the main variables involved in the trophism of marine ecosystems (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Chlorophyll a, Dissolved Oxygen), is widely utilized in European coastal areas to evaluate trophic status. The relationships between the variables involved in TRIX computation, particularly Chlorophyll a concentration, and water spectral reflectance provides an alternative method to evaluate the quality and ecological status of the port water. Hyperspectral (380-710 nm) water reflectance data were recorded by a portable radiometric system in five ports from the Western and Eastern Mediterranean Basin. The spectral distance between samples was measured by two metrics using both the original and reduced spectra and was implemented within a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The four spectral classes that emerged from this operation were statistically analysed versus standard water quality descriptors and phytoplankton community features to evaluate the ecological significance of the information obtained. The results indicated a substantial coherence of different indicators with more than 60\% of the total TRIX variability is accounted for by the proposed classification of reflectance spectra. This classification is therefore proposed as a promising Rapid Assessment Technique of ports water ecological quality, which can serve as an effective monitoring tool for sustainable management of ports.

Abstract = {This study uses a combination of remote sensing data, field interviews and observations, and landscape indices to examine the dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC), identify their driving forces, and analyze their effects on the landscape of Abaya-Chamo Basin (ACB) between 1985, 1995, and 2010. The results reveal that the landscape of ACB has changed considerably during the past 25 years between 1985 and 2010. The main changes observed imply a rapid reduction in shrubland (28.82\%) and natural grassland (33.13\%), and an increase in arable land (59.15\%). The basin has become more fragmented and formed less connected patches in 2010 compared to 1985. Rapid population growth, internal migration, policy shifts, and regime change were identified as the key driving forces of LULC changes in ACB. The LULC changes and related trend of increasing landscape fragmentation in the basin increased soil erosion, the volume of surface runoff, and sediment transport in the landscape and, consequently, affected the levels and water quality of the lakes found in the rift floor. Furthermore, the destruction and fragmentation of shrubland and natural grassland led to the decline of wild plants and animals previously prominent in the basin. Therefore, protective measures that take into consideration the economic, social, and ecological dynamics of the basin are urgently needed to save the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems of the basin from further damage.},

Abstract = {The Yellow River Delta is the youngest large river delta in the world and is an important part of the national coordinated regional development strategy. In this paper, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, Landsat remote sensing images in the summer (June-September) of 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were selected to remove clouds and mask water body information. The median value is taken to synthesize the remote sensing images of each year and extract multiple indices of greenness, wetness, heatness, and dryness. Then integrate the population density data by principal component analysis to quickly construct an improved composite remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI). The results showed that the average contribution of the six indicators of greenness (NDVI and FVC), wetness (NDMI), heatness (LST), dryness (NDBSI), and population density (Pop) to the first principal component (PC1) was above 79\%, and the construction of an improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI) based on PC1 was feasible in the Yellow River Delta. In the past 20 years, the ecological and environmental quality of the Yellow River Delta has shown a continuous trend of improvement. The ecological environment quality has improved by 3570.95 square kilometers, accounting for 48.0\% of the total area, while the ecological environment quality has degraded by 712.99 square kilometers, accounting for only 9.6\% of the total area. The improved area is 38.4\% more than the degraded area, which shows that the ecological environment quality has improved in general. The ecological environment quality in Kenli County has improved the most. The ecological projects have been implemented in this area with the most obvious effect, and the investment in ecological environmental protection in this area should be continued or increased. The use of the GEE platform can obtain timely and accurate spatial and temporal patterns and evolution of ecological environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta, which is of great significance for ecological environmental protection and construction.},

Abstract = {Invasive aquatic weeds negatively affect biodiversity, fluvial dynamics, water quality, and water storage and conveyance for a variety of human resource demands. In California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, one submersed species Brazilian egeria-and one floating species-waterhyacinth-are actively managed to maintain navigable waterways. We monitored the spatial and temporal dynamics of these species and their communities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta using airborne hyperspectral data and assessed the effect of herbicide treatments used to manage these species from 2003 to 2007. Each year, submersed aquatic plant species occupied about 12\% of the surface area of the Delta in early summer and floating invasive plant species occupied 2 to 3\%. Since 2003, the coverage of submersed aquatic plants expanded about 500 ha, whereas the coverage of waterhyacinth was reduced. Although local treatments have reduced the coverage of submersed aquatic plants, Delta-wide cover has not been significantly reduced. Locally, multiyear treatments could decrease submersed aquatic plants spread, given that no residual plants outside the treated area were present. In contrast, the spread of waterhyacinth either has been constant or has decreased over time. These results show that (1) the objectives of the Egeria densa Control Program (EDCP) have been hindered until 2007 by restrictions imposed on the timing of herbicide applications; (2) submersed aquatic plants appeared to function as ecosystem engineers by enabling spread to adjacent areas typically subject to scouring action; (3) repeated herbicide treatment of waterhyacinth has resulted in control of the spread of this species, which also appears to have facilitated the spread of waterprimrose and floating pennywort. These results suggest that management of the Delta aquatic macrophytes may benefit by an ecosystem-level implementation of an Integrated Delta Vegetation Management and Monitoring Program, rather than targeting only two problematic species.},

Title = {Studying coral reef patterns in UAE waters using panel data analysis and multinomial logit and probit models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Like coral reefs around the world, the reefs of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are facing global climate change and associated threats. The coasts and islands that flank Abu Dhabi host an important number of corals that should be the focus of conservation actions. Well-designed conservation and management plans require efficient monitoring systems that include understanding coral reef patterns. To understand some of these patterns; coral cover data, satellite-derived and in-situ water quality parameters from nine key reef environments in the UAE from 2011 to 2014 to model coral patterns were used. The objectives were to model coral patterns and realistically predict coral damage intensity with changing environmental variables. Coral damage cover models were defined and estimated for the coral damage cover. Effects of environmental factors were estimated, and predictions of coral damage intensity were presented with changing factors. Main findings, based on the studied data, showed that nutrient enrichment, a proxy for anthropogenic pressure, and salinity are the most influential factors to induce coral damage in UAE waters. Furthermore, results demonstrated that the probability of severe damage increases with decreasing water oxygenation and with increasing temperature, light, salinity, acidity and nutrient levels. The defined and estimated predictions accounted for corals' behavioural aspects, across individual reefs and over time. This approach is more appropriate than estimation predictions that just account for historic trends. Nevertheless, there are, probably, many components within the model framework that can be expanded and/or improved as more information become available. An extended dataset will enable a means to independently validate the defined models and test other modelling approaches. Continually increasing the insitu and remote sensing data sizes, spatially and temporally, defines a long-term priority.},

Title = {Lightweight Deep Neural Network Method for Water Body Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images with Multisensors},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rapid and accurate extraction of water bodies from high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images is of great value for water resource management, water quality monitoring and natural disaster emergency response. For traditional water body extraction methods, it is difficult to select image texture and features, the shadows of buildings and other ground objects are in the same spectrum as water bodies, the existing deep convolutional neural network is difficult to train, the consumption of computing resources is large, and the methods cannot meet real-time requirements. In this paper, a water body extraction method based on lightweight MobileNetV2 is proposed and applied to multisensor high-resolution remote sensing images, such as GF-2, WorldView-2 and UAV orthoimages. This method was validated in two typical complex geographical scenes: water bodies for farmland irrigation, which have a broken shape and long and narrow area and are surrounded by many buildings in towns and villages; and water bodies in mountainous areas, which have undulating topography, vegetation coverage and mountain shadows all over. The results were compared with those of the support vector machine, random forest and U-Net models and also verified by generalization tests and the influence of spatial resolution changes. First, the results show that the F1-score and Kappa coefficients of the MobileNetV2 model extracting water bodies from three different high-resolution images were 0.75 and 0.72 for GF-2, 0.86 and 0.85 for Worldview-2 and 0.98 and 0.98 for UAV, respectively, which are higher than those of traditional machine learning models and U-Net. Second, the training time, number of parameters and calculation amount of the MobileNetV2 model were much lower than those of the U-Net model, which greatly improves the water body extraction efficiency. Third, in other more complex surface areas, the MobileNetV2 model still maintained relatively high accuracy of water body extraction. Finally, we tested the effects of multisensor models and found that training with lower and higher spatial resolution images combined can be beneficial, but that using just lower resolution imagery is ineffective. This study provides a reference for the efficient automation of water body classification and extraction under complex geographical environment conditions and can be extended to water resource investigation, management and planning.},

Abstract = {Today, object-based image analysis provides an option for integrating spatial information beyond conventional pixel-based classifications for high-resolution imagery. Due to its rare applicability in pollution assessment, an attempt has been made to assess the spatial extent of sewage pollution in Malad Creek, Mumbai, India. Based on multiresolution segmentation of an IRS P6 (LISS IV) image and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), the various water quality regions in the creek were classified. The existing literature implies that the reflectance of turbid water is similar to that of bare soil which gives positive NDTI values. In contrast to this, negative values of NDTI are observed in the present study due to the presence of organic matter which absorbs light and imparts turbidity, which is supported by the significant correlation between NDTI and turbidity. A strong relationship is observed between turbidity and water quality parameters, implying the impact of organic matter through discharges of sewage in the creek. Based on the classified regions and the water quality parameters, the extent of pollution was ranked as high, moderate, low and least. The methodology developed in the present study was successfully applied on an IKONOS image for the same study area but a different time frame. The approach will help in impact assessment of sewage pollution and its spatial extent in other water bodies.},

Abstract = {Chemical oxygen demand concentration (CCOD) is widely used to indicate the degree of organic pollution of lakes, res-ervoirs and rivers. Mastering the spatiotemporal distribution of CCOD is imperative for understanding the variation mechanism and controlling of organic pollution in water. In this study, a hybrid approach suitable for Sentinel 3A/ Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data was developed to estimate CCOD in inland optically complex waters embedding the interaction between CCOD and the absorption coefficients of optically active constituents (OACs). Based on in-situ sampling in different waters, the independent validations of the proposed model performed satisfac-torily in Lake Taihu (MAPE = 23.52 \%, RMSE = 0.95 mg/L, and R2 = 0.81), Lake Qiandaohu (MAPE = 21.63 \%, RMSE = 0.50 mg/L and R2 = 0.69), and Yangtze River (MAPE = 29.34 \%, RMSE = 0.83 mg/L, and R2 = 0.64). In addition, the approach not only showed significant superiority compared with previous algorithms, but also was suitable for other common satellite sensors equipped same or similar bands. The hybrid approach was applied to OLCI images to retrieve CCOD of Lake Taihu from 2016 to 2020 and reveals substantial interannual and seasonal var-iations. The above results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and stable for studying spatiotemporal dy-namic of CCOD in optically complex waters, and that satellite-derived products can provide reliable information for lake water quality management.},

Abstract = {Natural resources such as land, air, and water lay a critical foundation for the sustainable development of an urban community. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the most developed and rapidly developing regions in China, with abundant natural resources in water, intertidal zones, aquatic products, and a significant coastal estuary habitat. The PRD also covers two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macao) and two Special Economic Zones (Shenzhen and Zhuhai), critically positioning it domestically and abroad. However, the increasing development of the economy has put pressure on the security of its water resources. These resources have sharply deteriorated in the PRD as the result of a mass and unordered overuse of water and soil resources and the lack of coordinated efforts among different functional departments. Various problems related to the water environment (such as flooding, rapid development of the deposition, water pollution, saltwater intrusion, and waterway atrophy) have directly threatened the social stability, sustainable development of the economy, and the supply of water in the region. To date, the population affected by a shortage of high-quality water has reached 16 million due to pollution of the water supply source in Guangdong province. At this time, the water pollution in the PRD has resulted in ever-increasing economic and environmental losses. Pollution coverage includes Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangdong and, because governmental functions and scientific technologies among these regions differ, there is little in the way of efficient, cooperative efforts to fully make use of their individual advantages to protect the water environment in the PRD. Moreover, the diversity and complexity of the problems even interfere with the abilities of functional departments within one region (e.g., flood prevention, pollution abatement, and channel maintenance) to make decisions and formulate protection policies using advanced spatial technologies such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS). Consequently, the water environment in the PRD lacks unified and synergistic operations, and water resource protection is restricted to satisfying the demands of economic development and the requirements of sustainable development. To date, it is clear that cooperation amongst Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao should be strengthened. More research is also essential, specifically regarding the reduction of gross pollution emissions by 8 to 10 percent. In addition, the water environmental protection of the PRD has engaged with the Integrative Planning of the Environmental Protection in the PRD (2009-2020). This emphasizes strengthening the regional collaborative linkages, constructing an integrative platform of environmental monitoring, and realizing the shared and collaborative management of environmental information among different departments. With this in mind, the study on constructing a unified and synergistic system for water environment analysis in the PRD area are proposed as interdisciplinary and comprehensive research using multiple methods and fields. Based on the analysis of the fusion techniques of multisource, multi-date, and isomerous images, a database for integrating remote sensing monitoring data of water quality and quantity, actual measurement data, and relevant basic geographical data (watercourse data, section data, and a Digital Elevation Model) will be developed. Combining the research on general analytical methods and models, the capsulation mechanism of analytical methods and models will be designed. Lastly, using GIS integration techniques, an integrative monitoring demonstrative platform of water quality and quantity will be developed to assist collaborative research and decision making among the functional departments of the three regions. The goal is to promote the sustainable use of the water resources in the PRD, to achieve sustainable economic development and to increase the informatization of the PRD region. The construction of the system consists of four parts:},

Title = {Using vegetation indices from satellite remote sensing to assess corn and soybean response to controlled tile drainage},

Abstract = {Controlled tile drainage (CTD) is a management practice designed to retain water and nutrients in the field for crop use. CTD has shown promise for improving water quality and augmenting crop yields but findings are often restricted to field and plot scales. Remote sensing is one of the alternatives to evaluate crop responsiveness to CTD at large spatial scales. This study compared normalized and green normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI and GNDVI) for corn (Zea mays L) and soybean (Glycine max L) among CTD and uncontrolled tile drainage (UCTD) fields in a similar to 950 ha experimental watershed setting in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2008. The indices were derived from Landsat-5 and SPOT-4 satellite imagery. Log-transformed NDVI and GNDVI for soybean (R3-R6 growth stage) and corn (VT to R5-R6 growth stage) crops were higher significantly (p <= 0.05) for CTD, relative to UCTD for 50\% (soybean) and 72\% (corn) of both the log-transformed NDVI and GNDVI image acquisitions compared; only 17\% and 13\% were significant (p <= 0.05) in the reverse direction (UCTD > CTD). Log-transformed NDVI and GNDVI standard errors for CTD, relative to UCTD fields, were lower for 65\% of the significant corn and 71\% of the significant soybean NDVI and GNDVI comparisons for the growth stages noted above. This finding suggested overall more uniform crop growth for CTD fields relative to UCTD fields. Observed yields from a subset of commonly managed CTD and UCTD fields in the study area were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05) with respect to tile drainage management practice; however, 87\% of these paired yield comparisons indicated that CTD mean corn/soybean grain yields were greater than or equal to those for UCTD. On average, CTD observed corn and soybean grain yields were 3\% and 4\%, respectively, greater than those from UCTD. From observed yield and NDVI and GNDVI observations, vegetation indices vs. yield linear regression models were developed to predict grain yields over a broader land base in the experimental watershed area. Here, predicted mean yields were 0.1-11\% higher for CTD corn and -5\% to 4\% higher for CTD soybean, relative to UCTD crops: but results varied between manured and non-manured fertilizer practices. Eighty-nine percent of the standard deviations for these yield predictions were lower for CTD relative to UCTD. The results of this study indicate that at a minimum, CTD did not adversely impact corn and soybean grain yields over the time span and field environments of the study, and based on the weight of evidence presented here, CTD shows general promise for augmenting crop performance. Finally, remote sensing derived vegetation indices such as NDVI and GNDVI can be used to assess the impact of agricultural drainage management practices on crop response and production properties.

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The study explored and discussed the water management strategy of Istanbul with more than 16 million inhabitants. Istanbul has quite limited local fresh water resources with an ultimate storage capacity of 868.7 million m(3) and supplies daily approximately 2.8 million m(3) of water at a magnitude of 180 L/ca. 36\% of the water demand is supplied from a water source 190 km away from the city. In this study, the critical balance was evaluated accounting for all important factors, population, expansion; water demand; water quality; protection of water resources. The evaluation was specifically conducted in two major water catchment areas around Buyukcekmece and omerli Basins between 1994 and 2019 using remote sensing technology. The results outlined a significant increase mainly from bare land and green area to artificial surface in Buyukcekmece and omerli Basins with a rate of 217\% and 77\%, respectively. The conversions to artificial surface were mostly observed to occur in long-range protection zones in both basins. This study also interpreted the potential impacts of the proposed ``Canal Project{''} on water resources regarding the existing and future demands of the population living in Istanbul. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations outlined the fact that the following 5 years of Istanbul will be a critical period in terms of survival and collapse of water management, and that Istanbul needs to enrich its local water resources by generating other alternatives, i.e. sea water desalination from Black Sea or Marmara Sea to compete with the increase of population.},

Title = {Anthropogenic transformation of Yangtze Plain freshwater lakes: patterns, drivers and impacts},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {248},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Over the past half century, the Yangtze Plain of China has experienced rapid economic development. Lake reclamation (i.e., conversion of natural lake/wetland areas to agricultural/urban land or aquaculture, thereby reducing the area of natural waters) in particular has greatly contributed to meeting the increasing demands for food and urban development. However, until now, a comprehensive quantification and understanding of historical anthropogenic lacustrine exploitation in this region has been lacking, prohibiting assessment of the impacts of these activities. We used Landsat observations from 1973 to 2018 to track reclamation-induced changes in 112 large lakes (97.8\% of the total lake area) in the Yangtze Plain. We show that 41.6\% (6056.9 km(2)) of the total lake area has been reclaimed since the 1970s. The expansion of agricultural and built-up lands dominated the reclamation activities in the 1970s, while the increase of aquaculture zones has prevailed since the mid-1980s. Reclamation activities were closely connected to government policies and major socio-economic events and had strong impacts on lake hydrology, flood risk mitigation capacity, and water quality as revealed by satellite and in situ observations. This new quantitative understanding of anthropogenic reclamation and its associated impacts on Yangtze Plain freshwater lakes can underpin the development of strategies to reduce the impacts of lake reclamation on environmental quality. The study has also demonstrated the unique strength of using long-term series satellite images in tracking historical environmental changes in a substantial region of the world, and the methods used here are potentially extendable to other inland and coastal areas to understand similar human-environment interaction problems.},

Abstract = {A simple model which predicts radiance reflectance below the waters surface as a function of the concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and suspended particulate inorganic material (SPIM) is described. Model optimisations which matched simulated radiance reflectance to measured reflectance spectra by adjusting the model concentrations of chlorophyll, CDOM and SPIM yielded simulated reflectance spectra which closely matched the measured data. The concentrations of chlorophyll, CDOM and SPIM obtained by the optimisation procedure were in reasonable agreement which measured data. To estimate the variability of radiance reflectance in Lake Malaren (central Sweden); nurmeric distributions of chlorophyll, CDOM and SPIM concentrations were derived from a long term water quality monitoring data base. The distributions of these parameters defined realistic ranges for use in univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis of radiance reflectance. Variations in radiance reflectance were most strongly influenced by variations in SPIM, and CDOM. CDOM related variations in radiance reflectance significantly overlap with variations in radiance reflectance resulting from changes in chlorophyll concentration. As a result estimation of chlorophyll from radiance reflectance was limited to concentrations above a threshold value of approximately 8 mug l(-1). Multivariate sensitivity analysis defined ranges of variation in radiance reflectance which are well matched to the spatial variability in field measurements.},

Abstract = {Optical water classification based on remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(.)) data can provide insight into water components driving optical variability and inform the development and application of bio-optical algorithms in complex aquatic systems. In this study, we use an in situ dataset consisting of hyperspectral Rrs(.) and other biogeochemical and optical parameters collected over nearly five years across a heavily urbanized estuary, the Long Island Sound (LIS), east of New York City, USA, to optically classify LIS waters based on Rrs(.) spectral shape. We investigate the similarities and differences of discrete groupings (k-means clustering) and continuous spectral indexing using the Apparent Visible Wavelength (AVW) in relation to system biogeochemistry and water properties. Our Rrs(.) dataset in LIS was best described by three spectral clusters, the first two accounting for the majority (89\%) of Rrs(.) observations and primarily driven by phytoplankton dynamics, with the third confined to measurements in river and river plume waters. We found AVW effective at tracking subtle changes in Rrs(.) spectral shape and fine-scale water quality features along river-to-ocean gradients. The recently developed Quality Water Index Polynomial (QWIP) was applied to evaluate three different atmospheric correction approaches for satellite-derived Rrs(.) from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensor in LIS, finding Polymer to be the preferred approach. Our results suggest that integrative, continuous indices such as AVW can be effective indicators to assess nearshore biogeochemical variability and evaluate the quality of both in situ and satellite bio-optical datasets, as needed for improved ecosystem and water resource management in LIS and similar regions.},

Abstract = {In the last decade a significant number of projects and programmes in different domains of Earth Observation and environmental monitoring have generated a substantial amount of data and knowledge on different aspects related to environmental quality and sustainability. Big data generated by in-situ or satellite platforms are being collected and archived with a plethora of systems and instruments making difficult the sharing of data and transfer of knowledge to stakeholders and policy makers to support key economic and societal sectors. The overarching goal of ERAPLANET is to strengthen the European Research Area in the domain of Earth Observation in coherence with the European participation in the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and Copernicus. The expected impact is to strengthen European leadership within the forthcoming GEO 2015-2025 Work Plan. ERA-PLANET is designed to reinforce the interface with user communities, whose needs the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) intends to address. It will provide more accurate, comprehensive and authoritative information to policy and decision-makers in key societal benefit areas, such as Smart Cities and Resilient Societies; Resource efficiency and Environmental management; Global changes and Environmental treaties; Polar areas and Natural resources. ERA-PLANET will provide advanced decision-support tools and technologies aimed to better monitor our global environment and share the information and knowledge available in the different domains of Earth Observation.},

Abstract = {The temporal-spatial interaction of land cover and non-point source (NPS) nutrient pollution were analyzed with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the temporal-spatial features of NPS nutrient loading in the upper stream of the Yellow River catchment. The corresponding land cover data variance was expressed by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) that was calculated from MODIS images. It was noted that the temporal variation of land cover NDVI was significantly correlated with NPS nutrient loading. The regression analysis indicated that vegetation not only detained NPS nutrient pollution transportation, but also contributed to sustainable loading. The temporal analysis also confirmed that regional NDVI was an effective index for monthly assessment of NPS nitrogen and phosphorus loading. The spatial variations of NPS nutrient loading can be classified with land cover status. The high loadings of NPS nitrogen in high NDVI subbasins indicated that forestry and farmland are the main critical loss areas. Farmland contributed sustainable soluble N, but the loading of soluble and organic N from grassland subbasins was much lower. Most P loading came from the areas covered with dense grassland and forestry, which cannot directly discharge to local water bodies. However, some NPS phosphorus from suburban farmland can directly discharge into adjacent water bodies. The interactions among nutrient loading, NDVI, and slope were also analyzed. This study confirmed that the integration of NPS modeling, geographic information systems, and remote sensing is needed to understand the interactive dynamics of NPS nutrient loading. Understanding the temporal-spatial variation of NPS nutrients and their correlations with land cover will help NPS pollution prevention and water quality management efforts. Therefore, the proposed method for evaluating NPS nutrient loading by land cover NDVI can be an effective tool for pollution evaluation and watersheds planning. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The application of remote sensing to the social sciences is an emerging research area. People's behavior and values shape the environment in which they live. Similarly, values and behaviors are influenced by the environment. This study explores the relationship between features observable in overhead imagery and direct measurements of attitudes obtained through surveys. We focus on three topic areas: Income and Economic Development Centrality and Decision Authority Social Capital Using commercial satellite imagery data from rural Afghanistan, we present an exploration of the direct and indirect indicators derived from the imagery. We demonstrate a methodology for extracting relevant measures from the imagery, using a combination of human-guided and automated methods. These imagery observables indicate characteristics of the villages which will be compared to survey data in future modeling work. Preliminary survey modeling, based on data from sub-Saharan Africa, suggests that modeling of the Afghan data will also demonstrate a relationship between remote sensing data and survey-based measures of economic and social phenomena. We conclude with a discussion of the next steps, which include extensions to new regions of the world.},

Journal = {FOREST SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Forest ecosystems provide a host of services and societal benefits, including carbon storage, habitat for fauna, recreation, and provision of wood or non-wood products. In a context of complex demands on forest resources, identifying priorities for biodiversity and carbon budgets require accurate tools with sufficient temporal frequency. Moreover, understanding long term forest dynamics is necessary for sustainable planning and management. Remote sensing (RS) is a powerful means for analysis, synthesis, and report, providing insights and contributing to inform decisions upon forest ecosystems. In this communication we review current applications of RS techniques in Spanish forests, examining possible trends, needs, and opportunities offered by RS in a forestry context. Currently, wall-to-wall optical and LiDAR data are extensively used for a wide range of applications-many times in combination-whilst radar or hyperspectral data are rarely used in the analysis of Spanish forests. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) carrying visible and infrared sensors are gaining ground in acquisition of data locally and at small scale, particularly for health assessments. Forest fire identification and characterization are prevalent applications at the landscape scale, whereas structural assessments are the most widespread analyses carried out at limited extents. Unparalleled opportunities are offered by the availability of diverse RS data like those provided by the European Copernicus programme and recent satellite LiDAR launches, processing capacity, and synergies with other ancillary sources to produce information of our forests. Overall, we live in times of unprecedented opportunities for monitoring forest ecosystems with a growing support from RS technologies.},

Abstract = {The importance of lake water surface temperature has long been highlighted for ecological and hydrological studies as well as for water quality management. In the absence of regular field observations, satellite remote sensing has been recognized as a cost-effective way to monitor water surface temperature on large spatial and temporal scales. The thermal infrared sensors (TIRS) onboard of Landsat satellites (since 1984) are adequate tools for monitoring surface temperature of small to medium sized lakes with a biweekly frequency, as well as for performing retrospective analysis. Nonetheless, the satellite data have to deal with effects due to the atmosphere so that several approaches to correct for atmospheric contributions have been proposed. Among these are: (i) the radiative transfer equation (RTE); (ii) a single-channel algorithm that depends on water vapor content and emissivity (SC1); (iii) its improved version including air temperature (SC2); and (iv) a monowindow (MW) algorithm that requires emissivity, atmospheric transmissivity, and effective mean atmospheric temperature. We aim to evaluate these four approaches in a river dammed reservoir with a size of 12 km(2) using data gathered from the band 10 of the TIRS onboard of Landsat 8. Satellite-derived temperatures were then compared to in situ data acquired from thermistors at the time of Landsat 8 overpasses. All approaches showed a good performance, with the SC1 algorithm yielding the lowest root mean square error (0.73 K), followed by the SC2 method (0.89 K), the RTE (0.94 K), and then the MW algorithm (1.23 K). Based on the validation results, we then applied the SC1 algorithm to Landsat 4, 5, and 8 thermal data (1984 to 2018) to extend data series to past years. These data do not reveal any warming trend of the reservoir surface temperature. The results of this study also confirm how the 100-m spatial resolution of TIRS is valuable as an additional source of data to field-based monitoring.

Abstract = {Since the rise of the gold price in 2000, artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a growing economic activity in developing countries. It represents a source of income for several millions of people in West Africa. Exploitation techniques have evolved from traditional gold panning to mechanization and use of chemical products that are harmful for the environment. Government strategies to control and regulate this activity are impeded by the difficulties to collect spatial information, due to the remote location and the mobile and informal natural of ASGM. Here we present and discuss the value of remote sensing techniques to complement the knowledge on artisanal mining impacts, including for detection of illegal sites, the evaluation of the degradation of soils and waters, the deforestation and the monitoring of expansion of ASGM with time. However, these techniques are blind regarding gender issues, labor relations, mobility, migration, and insecurity and need to be considered with knowledges from other disciplines. Remote sensing is also instilled with various powers accruing to those enabled to produce and interpret these data. Remote sensing should be therefore used in a reflexive manner that accounts for the social, ethical and political implications of ASGM governance informed by space observations.},

Abstract = {Dal Lake, a cradle of Kashmiri civilization has strong linkage with socioeconomics of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. During last few decades, anthropogenic pressures in Dal Lake Catchment have caused environmental deterioration impairing, inter-alia, sustained biotic communities and water quality. The present research was an integrated impact analysis of socioeconomic and biophysical processes at the watershed level on the current status of Dal Lake using multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data, simulation modelling together with field data verification. Thirteen watersheds (designated as `W1-W13') were identified and investigated for land use/land cover change detection, quantification of erosion and sediment loads and socioeconomic analysis (total population, total households, literacy rate and economic development status). All the data for the respective watersheds was integrated into the GIS environment based upon multi-criteria analysis and knowledge-based weightage system was adopted for watershed prioritization based on its factors and after carefully observing the field situation. The land use/land cover change detection revealed significant changes with a uniform trend of decreased vegetation and increased impervious surface cover. Increased erosion and sediment loadings were recorded for the watersheds corresponding to their changing land systems, with bare and agriculture lands being the major contributors. The prioritization analysis revealed that W5 > W2 > W6 > W8 > W1 ranked highest in priority and W13 > W3 > W4 > W11 > W7 under medium priority. W12 > W9 > W10 belonged to low-priority category. The integration of the biophysical and the socioeconomic environment at the watershed level using modern geospatial tools would be of vital importance for the conservation and management strategies of Dal Lake ecosystem.},

Title = {Evaluating the influences of harvesting activity and eutrophication on loss of aquatic vegetations in Taihu Lake, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A rapid degradation of aquatic vegetations in Taihu Lake has roused a wide attention in recent years. Giving large-scale harvesting activity on aquatic vegetation since 2012, whether water eutrophication or the human harvest activity induced the degradation remains controversial and unclear. In this study, based on Landsat and HJ-CCD data acquired from 1984 to 2016 and a 12-year field observation (2005-2016) of water quality, a method was proposed to quantitatively assess impacts of harvesting activity and water quality change on degradations of both floating-leaved aquatic vegetation (FAV) and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in Taihu Lake. First, areas of FAV and SAV covers from 1984 to 2016 in Taihu Lake were mapped using the satellite data, and then the mapped areas were modified to those on a reference date by using phenological curves of FAV and SAV covers. Next, correlations between water quality data and FAV and SAV covers were analyzed by using Pearson correlation analysis based on the data before implementing the human harvesting activity (i.e., before 2012), and multiple general linear models were established based on the selected water quality variables with p-value < 0.01 for estimating covers of FAV and SAV from 2012 to 2016. Finally, based on the predicted areas of FAV and SAV covers by the models and the modified areas mapped from satellite data, the influences of water eutrophication and the human harvesting activity on the degradation of FAV and SAV covers were quantitatively assessed. The results indicated that (1) FAV cover exhibited a significant increase from 1984 to 2011 and then a rapid decrease, while SAV cover increased significantly before 2003 and then obviously declined; (2) water level (WL) and total nitrogen (TN) showed significantly negative correlations with FAV and SAV covers, while secchi disk depth (SDD) and SDD/WL had significantly positive correlations with FAV and SAV covers; (3) the human harvesting activity made a major contribution to the loss of FAV cover, and the degradation of SAV cover was mainly due to an increased lake eutrophication and deteriorated underwater light environment. The findings derived from this study could offer a guidance for Taihu Lake ecological restoration and effective management.},

Abstract = {Improving the environment of cities by optimized and green space brings great ecological and social benefits. Urban green space (UGS) is an indispensable component of urban environmental systems and is important to urban residents. In this study, applying remote sensing simulation, green space is explored. A novel methodological framework for integrating these two different data sources to conduct the social functional mapping of UGS has been required. It indicates that Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a powerful and significant predictor to explain variation in runoff. The important role of urban green spaces in attenuating local flooding and may provide planners and decision-makers with a method to consider. Finally, the strategy is proved by simulation and provides hints for future planning of urban green spaces.},

Abstract = {A spatial multiple criteria evaluation analysis (SMCE) was undertaken using GIS and remote sensing techniques with spatial datasets to identify the geo-environmental values for a watershed in central India. All the geo-environmental values were estimated based on this dataset for the development of an ecological system. We have investigated the resources of an environmental status of the region using this methodology. A set of ten natural resource parameters were evaluated using a combination of remote sensing information, GIS technologies and field data, which has significance in regional geo-environment sustainability. An integrated geo-environmental potential index (GPI) has been calculated and the same is used further to derived the final geo-environmental potential map (GEPM) illustrating four classes of geo-environmental resources, i.e., high, moderate, low, and poor. The geo-environmental quality map overall shows a high level of geo-environmental resources in the maximum area (48.30\%). The results of study area are significant for identifying the protection, conservation, and planning management strategies that would be needed to protect the geo-environmental values of the river basin area. The geo-environmental potential zones that were identified are potentially manageable using conservation techniques. The work amply proves the applicability of RS, GIS, and SMCE techniques in the natural resource evaluation procedure.},

Abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) share a common vision and mission to serve society through Earth observation systems. Beginning in the early 1960s, research and development programs conducted by NASA included Earth observation spacecraft focused on improving the capacity to monitor the weather; weather is now one of the societal benefit areas identified by the GEO. From the 1980s through 2004, NASA developed and deployed the Earth Observing System to conduct global research using measurements from the Terra, Aqua, and Aura spacecraft. The research results from these and other NASA space-based observatories are pathfinders for next-generation operational systems and are information sources for evolving computer models used to improve predictions of weather, climate, and natural hazards. Improved understanding of climate change and the prediction and preparedness associated with disasters are two additional societal benefit areas of the GEO. One of NASA's goals is to extend benefits of space research to improve scientific understanding of the Earth system and to demonstrate new technologies with the potential to improve future operational systems. NASA focuses on applications of national priority to transition these benefits systematically, enabling and improving integrated system solutions that inform decisions to serve society. Management of energy, coastal and biological ecosystems, agriculture, water, and human health are applications served by integrating NASA research results into solutions that are consistent with GEO societal benefit areas. NASA and the GEO share a common framework architecture to systematically apply Earth observations and predictions to enable decision support for specific applications areas. Over the next 10 years, NASA plans to continue collaborations with its U.S. and international partners to develop and deploy innovative research spacecraft and instruments. These Systems can demonstrate the capacity for space systems to address targets identified in The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) 10-Year Implementation Plan.},

Abstract = {This paper demonstrates how satellite image data {[}e.g., from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM)], in conjunction with an urban growth model and simple runoff calculations, can be used to estimate future surface runoff and, by implication, water quality within a watershed. To illustrate the method, predictions of land use change and surface runoff are shown for Spring Creek Watershed, a medium sized urbanizing watershed in Central Pennsylvania. Land cover classifications for this watershed were created from images for summertime1986 and 1996 and subsequently used as input to the Clarke urban growth model, called SLEUTH, to predict land use changes to the year 2025. Simulations with this model show a progressive growth in the percentage of urban pixels and in impervious surface area in the watershed but also an increase in woodland, primarily in previously clear-cut areas. Given that woodland area will continue to increase in area, surface runoff into Spring Creek is predicted to remain only slightly above present level. However, should the woodland amount fail to increase, surface runoff is then predicted to increase more significantly during the next 25 years. Finally, the concept of urban sprawl is addressed within the context of predicted increases in urbanization by relating the implied increase in impervious surface area to population density within the watershed.},

Abstract = {With the continuous improvement of satellite remote sensing technology, using super-resolution image reconstruction technology to reconstruct remote sensing images has important application significance for social development. In the generator model proposed in this paper, the standard convolution layer in the residual network structure is replaced by empty convolution to improve the overall performance of the model while keeping the number of parameters unchanged and the receptive field of convolution at each stage unchanged. By analyzing the advantages of residual network, dense connection network, and cavity convolution in the field of image super resolution, an optimized super-resolution reconstruction model of GAN image with cavity convolution is constructed with dense connection block of cavity residue as a generator component. The cloud computing-based service model is introduced into the image reconstruction system, and the background management module is built through the cloud service system, which is responsible for model training, image transmission, image processing request and database reading. Through experimental analysis, it is proved that the whole automatic data processing from automatic matching data to processing data can be completed, and the performance is better than the traditional service mode, which can produce great economic benefits.},

Abstract = {The West Bokaro coalfield is a richest coal-mining belt in the Damodar Valley, India. The extensive mining of the area has resulted in disruption of the groundwater availability in terms of both quantity and quality. This has led to a drinking water crisis, especially during the pre-monsoon period in the West Bokaro coalfield area. The characterization of the hydrogeological system and the artificial recharging of the aquifers might help to better manage the problem of the groundwater-level depletion. For this purpose, seven important hydrogeological factors (water depth, slope, drainage, soil, infiltration, lithology, and landuse) have been considered to define the most suitable locations for artificial groundwater recharging in the mining area. Different thematic maps were prepared from existing maps and data sets, remote-sensing images, and field investigations for identification of the most suitable locations for artificial recharge. Thematic layers for these parameters were prepared, classified, weighted, and integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) environment by means of fuzzy logic. The results of the study indicate that about 29 and 31\% of the area are very suitable and suitable for recharging purposes in the West Bokaro coalfield. However, the rest of the area is moderate to unsuitable for recharging due to the ongoing mining and related activities in the study area. The groundwater recharging map of the study area was validated with measured electrical conductivity (EC) values in the groundwater, and it indicated that validation can be accepted for the identification of groundwater recharging sites. These findings are providing useful information for the proper planning and sustainable management of the groundwater resources in the study area.},

Abstract = {The Water Observation and Information System (WOIS) is an open source software tool for monitoring, assessing and inventorying water resources in a cost-effective manner using Earth Observation (EO) data. The WOIS has been developed by, among others, the authors of this paper under the TIGER-NET project, which is a major component of the TIGER initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) and whose main goal is to support the African Earth Observation Capacity for Water Resource Monitoring. TIGER-NET aims to support the satellite-based assessment and monitoring of water resources from watershed to cross-border basin levels through the provision of a free and powerful software package, with associated capacity building, to African authorities. More than 28 EO data processing solutions for water resource management tasks have been developed, in correspondence with the requirements of the participating key African water authorities, and demonstrated with dedicated case studies utilizing the software in operational scenarios. They cover a wide range of themes and information products, including basin-wide characterization of land and water resources, lake water quality monitoring, hydrological modeling and flood forecasting and mapping. For each monitoring task, step-by-step workflows were developed, which can either be adjusted by the user or largely automatized to feed into existing data streams and reporting schemes. The WOIS enables African water authorities to fully exploit the increasing EO capacity offered by current and upcoming generations of satellites, including the Sentinel missions.},

Title = {LoRa Communications as an Enabler for Internet of Drones towards Large-Scale Livestock Monitoring in Rural Farms},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Abstract = {Currently, smart farming is considered an effective solution to enhance the productivity of farms; thereby, it has recently received broad interest from service providers to offer a wide range of applications, from pest identification to asset monitoring. Although the emergence of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), has led to significant advances in the smart farming industry, farming operations still need more efficient solutions. On the other hand, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, is growing rapidly across many civil application domains. This paper aims to develop a farm monitoring system that incorporates UAV, LPWAN, and IoT technologies to transform the current farm management approach and aid farmers in obtaining actionable data from their farm operations. In this regard, an IoT-based water quality monitoring system was developed because water is an essential aspect in livestock development. Then, based on the Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN(R)) technology, a multi-channel LoRaWAN(R) gateway was developed and integrated into a vertical takeoff and landing drone to convey collected data from the sensors to the cloud for further analysis. In addition, to develop LoRaWAN(R)-based aerial communication, a series of measurements and simulations were performed under different configurations and scenarios. Finally, to enhance the efficiency of aerial-based data collection, the UAV path planning was optimized. Measurement results showed that the maximum achievable LoRa coverage when operating on-air via the drone is about 10 km, and the Longley-Rice irregular terrain model provides the most suitable path loss model for the scenario of large-scale farms, and a multi-channel gateway with a spreading factor of 12 provides the most reliable communication link at a high drone speed (up to 95 km/h). Simulation results showed that the developed system can overcome the coverage limitation of LoRaWAN(R) and it can establish a reliable communication link over large-scale wireless sensor networks. In addition, it was shown that by optimizing flight paths, aerial data collection could be performed in a much shorter time than industrial mission planning (up to four times in our case).},

Abstract = {The study of the Earth as a system is being adopted widely by geoscientists. Numerical models and simulations are providing the capability to rapidly test hypotheses and make forecasts of complex geophysical behavior. International efforts are seeking to integrate existing and emerging Earth observation systems into a global network, with enhanced data distribution, models, and decision support tools. Remote sensing is poised to fulfill the increasing need for a synoptic framework. However, the desire to improve the connection between scientific research and societal benefits has not been matched with resources and tools required to bridge the gap between research and applications. Natural hazards research and disaster management are a prime example. Here, we present a conceptual case for how interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data could make a definitive contribution to understanding earthquake processes while simultaneously supporting policy- and decision-making. InSAR measurements derived from time series of radar observations from Earth orbit uniquely can provide geographically comprehensive maps of surface deformation. Observing system simulations are suggested to evaluate the potential contributions of a future system. Simulations would adopt an open seismic hazard analysis (SHA) framework, OpenSHA, recognizing the need for more physics-based modeling and computational infrastructure. SHA is employed by the HAZUS-MH earthquake module to estimate losses. InSAR measurements of strain accumulation would provide event magnitude recurrence bounds for probabilistic SHA, while coseismic InSAR measurements would add constraints on fault rupture models for deterministic approaches. Moreover, interferograms would be incorporated graphically as proxy seismic risk maps for planning and mitigation.},

Title = {Science meets policy: A framework for determining impairment designation criteria for large waterbodies affected by cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {59-64},

Abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are one of the most significant threats to the security of Earth's surface freshwaters. In the United States, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (i.e., the Clean Water Act) requires that states report any waterbody that fails to meet applicable water quality standards. The problem is that for fresh waters impacted by cyanoHABs, no scientifically-based framework exists for making this designation. This study describes the development of a data-based framework using the Ohio waters of western Lake Erie as an exemplar for large lakes impacted by cyanoHABs. To address this designation for Ohio's open waters, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assembled a group of academic, state and federal scientists to develop a framework that would determine the criteria for Ohio EPA to consider in deciding on a recreation use impairment designation due to cyanoHAB presence. Typically, the metrics are derived from on-lake monitoring programs, but for large, dynamic lakes such as Lake Erie, using criteria based on discrete samples is problematic. However, significant advances in remote sensing allows for the estimation of cyanoHAB biomass of an entire lake. Through multiple years of validation, we developed a framework to determine lake specific criteria for designating a waterbody as impaired by cyanoHABs on an annual basis. While the criteria reported in this manuscript are specific to Ohio's open waters, the framework used to determine them can be applied to any large lake where long-term monitoring data and satellite imagery are available.},

Abstract = {The overall objective of the Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971, is the conservation and wise use of wetlands by national action and international cooperation as a means to achieving sustainable development. This complex and challenging task requires national, local and international bodies involved in the implementation of the convention to rely on suitable geo-information to better understand wetland areas, complete national inventories, perform monitoring activities, carry out assessments and put in practice suitable management plans based on updated and reliable information. In the last years, Earth Observation (EO) technology has been revealed as a key tool and unique information source to support the environmental community in different application domains, including wetlands' conservation and management. In this context, the European Space Agency (ESA) in collaboration with the Ramsar Secretariat launched in 2003 the ``Glob Wetland{''} project in order to demonstrate the current capabilities of Earth Observation technology to support inventorying, monitoring, and assessment of wetland ecosystems. This paper collects the main results and findings of the ``GlobWetland{''} project, providing an overview of the current capabilities and limits of EO technology as a tool to support the implementation of the Ramsar Convention. The project was carried out in collaboration with several regional, national and local conservation authorities and wetland managers, involving 50 different wetlands across 21 countries on four continents. This large range of users provided an excellent test bed to assess the potential of this technology to be applied in different technical, economic and social conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {MODIS-Landsat fusion-based single-band algorithms for TSS and turbidity estimation in an urban-waste-dominated river reach},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {224},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Riverine ecosystem management along an urban stretch mostly depends on high-frequent (daily-scale) monitoring of water quality at finer spatial resolutions. However, with the decrease in the number of in-situ monitoring stations owing to their expensive maintenance cost, there is a need to develop the next-generation remote sensing (RS) tools as an alternate approach with better synoptic coverage of river water quality assessment. This study advocates three novel model variants to estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration at daily -scale using the public-domain MODIS and Landsat satellite datasets. The MODT model variant uses the 1-dayx250 m MODIS public domain datasets, and the FUST model is based on the 1-dayx30 m MODIS-Landsat fusion datasets, whereas the CFUST model integrates the Frank Copula with the FUST model. These hierarchical model variants are assessed in the urban-waste-dominated lower Ganges, namely the Hooghly River and the Brahmani River, in eastern India using the measured in-situ TSS datasets at multiple monitoring stations from 2016 to 2019. The results reveal that the CFUST is the best TSS estimation model variant that performs with the average coefficient of determination of 0.88-0.93, mean absolute error of 0.17-0.19, and normal root mean square error of 0.05-0.09. Conclusively, the proposed CFUST and CFUSTU stochastic models can be used as potential tools for TSS and turbidity assessment along the dynamic river systems, respectively.},

Abstract = {The study sought to assess the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on two wetland systems (Makuleke and Nylsvley Nature Reserve) in the Limpopo Transfrontier River Basin (LTRB) in South Africa between 2014 and 2018. To fulfil this objective, multi-date Landsat images were used. Furthermore, the maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used to identify various LULC classes within delineated wetlands. The LULC changes were mapped from the two wetlands, with high overall accuracies, ranging from 80\% to 89\% for both study areas. The spatial extent of the Makuleke wetland declined by 2\% between 2014 and 2018, whereas the Nylsvley wetland decreased by 3\%. Built-up areas have increased slightly over the 2014 and 2018 period because of population growth and infrastructure development, which occupy a portion of the wetland. In Nylsvley wetland, it was evident that during the 5-year monitoring period, croplands increased steadily in the Nylsvley catchment. Overall, the results demonstrated a steady decline in natural vegetation cover in both wetlands. This information can aid in enforcing wetland legislations and LULC management practices that can help protect them from further encroachment and degradation.},

Abstract = {The newest in the Landsat series of satellites was launched April 15, 1999. The imagery collected by Landsat is used for a myriad of applications, from coral reef studies to land management. In order to take advantage of Landsat 7 data, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) instrument must be calibrated. This study focuses on the immediate postlaunch calibration verification of the Landsat 7 thermal band (Band 6), specifically so that it can be useful in water resource studies. Two year's worth of thermal calibration results using a combination of underflight data and ground truth show the ETM+ to be extremely stable, though the prelaunch calibration produces an offset of 0.261 W/m(2) sr mum. This paper focuses on the details of the calibration process, including problems faced with ground truth instrumentation. While the technical emphasis in this paper is the calibration of Landsat thermal data, it is presented in the context of the water resource studies for which calibrated thermal data are required. At certain times in the year, water quality in large lakes, particularly the spatial structure of water quality, is driven by temperature of lake waters. During the spring warming, a phenomena called the thermal bar drives the current and sedimentation of large water bodies. A long-term goal of this study is to use thermally driven hydrodynamic models of lake processes to better understand and monitor water quality in large lakes. This paper presents the hydrodynamic model and the relationship between temperature and water quality in the Great Lakes as one example of why high-resolution, well-calibrated data are critical to earth observing.

Booktitle = {ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SOIL SCIENCE, VOLS I-III, 3RD EDITION},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {1318-1321},
Abstract = {Geographic information system (GIS) and related technologies (e.g., remote sensing and global position system) have proven to be a valuable tool in land use planning activities. The GIS approach is important in this area because it provides functions to capture, store, organize, and analyze spatially referenced data. Moreover, GIS has been coupled to a variety of models (e.g., crop productivity, hydrology, and water quality simulations) and may be an important component of spatial decision support systems and land resource information systems. GIS enhances model flexibility and efficiency in these systems where it is often regarded as a centralized data analysis, management, and planning system. As a result, decision-makers and land use planners in private companies, in universities, and at various levels of the government are using GIS to develop spatial environmental databases, perform land evaluations, and analyze and manage resources. There is no doubt that the use of GIS and GIS-based systems in land use planning activities will continue to increase in the future, as more detailed digital environmental data sets become available and the capability of computers to handle large volumes of data increases.},

Abstract = {Since the reform and opening-up, the society and economy of China has rapidly developing, and the living standard of person has been greatly improved. However, along with the rapid economic development, China is facing a series of environmental problems such as ecological destruction, environmental pollution and land degradation etc. It is essential to conduct an in-depth research on the existing environmental problems in China. According to the carrying capacity assessment of land and resources, using multi-source remote sensing data such as MODIS data, nighttime light data as well as the socio-economic statistics and meteorological data from 2002 to 2013, the evaluation model of the national ecological environmental quality is established based on the combination of multi-criteria decision making algorithms and principal component analysis. The assessment model of ecological environmental quality is verified by comparing the evaluation results of two different models: environmental performance index, ecological carrying capacity and eco-environmental quality index. All of results have shown a downward trend. Lastly, the better relationship between the ecological environmental quality and the ecological carrying capacity is established. The R-squared reaches 0.5023 and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.7087, which reveals the reliability and scientificity of the ecological environmental quality assessment model of China constructed in this study. The results show that the quality of ecological environment in China shows a downward trend in general. The area of the eco-environmental quality index between 0.6-0.8 performs a downward trend temporally, and then it decreased to the value between 0.4-0.6. The boundary between 0.4-0.6 and 0.6-0.8 spread southward.},

Abstract = {Effective assessment and management of seagrass distributions require a thorough understanding of the water environment, in particular the inherent optical properties (lops) of the water column, and the linkage with environmental forcing such as coastal run-off. Coastal waters off the Suwannee and Steinhatchee rivers in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico where seagrass is abundant were sampled regularly in 2010 and 2011 during periods ranging from normal spring flooding to record-low flow conditions associated with widespread drought. Relationships between surface salinities, chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl-a), and IOPs were examined to characterize the optical variability of this region as well as its connection with river discharge and wind forcing. Significant spatial and temporal variability was observed for Chl-a (0.285-14.4 mg m(-3)), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 443 nm, a(CDOM)(443), (0.042-7.53 m(-1)), and particulate backscattering at 660 nm, b(bp)(660), (0.002-0.067 m(-1)) with gradients evident between nearshore (riverine) and offshore (oceanic) waters. Overall, CDOM was the dominant optically significant constituent (OSC), contributing similar to 74-75 +/- 11\% to total (non-water) absorption at 443 nm and 555 nm. CDOM was mainly controlled by river flow, with an inverse correlation observed between a(CDOM)(443) and salinity (r(2) = 0.66). Chl-a showed less direct dependence on flow, exhibiting elevated concentrations (>5 mg m(-3)) mainly during the summer. Particulate backscattering in this region was relatively low and largely controlled by non-algal particles, as was evident by the strong relationship between b(bp)(660) and detrital absorption at 443 nm, a(d)(443) (r(2) = 0.71). Compared with other coastal waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a(CDOM)(443) was similar to 3-5 times higher and b(bp)(660) was similar to 50\% lower, making the study region very dark. Given that the optical properties of coastal waters in this region are strongly influenced by CDOM derived from terrestrial discharge, remote-sensing algorithms for determining long-term Chl-a trends should focus on utilizing wavebands less influenced by CDOM.

Abstract = {The Catskill/Delaware reservoirs supply 90\% of New York City's drinking water. The City has implemented a series of watershed protection measures, including land acquisition, aimed at preserving water quality in the Catskill/Delaware watersheds. The objective of this study was to examine how relationships between landscape and surface water measurements change between years. Thirty-two drainage areas delineated from surface water sample points (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria concentrations) were used in step-wise regression analyses to test landscape and surface-water quality relationships. Two measurements of land use, percent agriculture and percent urban development, were positively related to water quality and consistently present in all regression models. Together these two land uses explained 25 to 75\% of the regression model variation. However, the contribution of agriculture to water quality condition showed a decreasing trend with time as overall agricultural land cover decreased. Results from this study demonstrate that relationships between land cover and surface water concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria counts over a large area can be evaluated using a relatively simple geographic information system method. Land managers may find this method useful for targeting resources in relation to a particular water quality concern, focusing best management efforts, and maximizing benefits to water quality with minimal costs.},

Abstract = {In this article, we show the development and implementation of the Internet of Maritime Things (IoMT) platform that supports long-range and high-rate communication for remote and online marine water quality monitoring. We first develop the IoMT device and gateway that interwork with international standard Internet-of-Things (IoT) software platforms for universal utilization in the field of marine monitoring. The proposed IoMT device and gateway play a role similar to the IoT device and gateway on land, but it is optimized for marine use with consideration of the practical characteristics of using sensors in the ocean. Furthermore, to realize long-range and high-rate communication between marine sensors and a control center (CC) on land, an automatic beam adjustment system for directional antennas is developed. This enables the use of directional antennas, which can support long-range and high-rate communication by automatically adjusting the beam angle between the antennas while exchanging their control information, despite the antennas being shifted by undulation from the sea. Finally, we conduct real sea experiments to identify the performances of the proposed IoMT platform in various environments. The results show that the proposed IoMT platform can collect data from marine sensors as well as high definition camera video from distances of 25 and 40 km to the CC on land under one-hop and two-hop transmissions, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed IoMT platform provides at least twofold performance improvement in terms of communication coverage under a similar data rate condition, compared with existing commercial wireless networks (e.g., LTE in the ocean) not utilizing satellite communications.},

Title = {Characteristics of the Total Suspended Matter Concentration in the Hongze Lake during 1984-2019 Based on Landsat Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {The Hongze Lake is the fourth largest freshwater lake in China and an important lake for the East Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. The water quality of the lake affects social development and the lives of residents. To assess the impacts of environmental changes and human activities on the distribution of the total suspended matter (TSM) in the Hongze Lake, we developed an algorithm that utilizes the near-infrared (NIR) band to estimate TSM based on in situ measurements. The algorithm was applied to Landsat images to derive TSM distribution maps from 1984 to 2019, revealing significant inter-annual, seasonal, and spatial variability. The relationship between TSM, precipitation, and wind speed was analyzed, and we found that: (1) The estimation model of TSM concentration in the Hongze Lake constructed for TM and OLI has a high accuracy, and it can be used to jointly monitor TSM concentration in the Hongze Lake for long-term series; (2) From 1984 to 2019, the concentration of TSM in the Hongze Lake showed a trend of first rising and then falling, with the maximum value in 2010 at 100.18 mg/L mainly caused by sand mining activities. Precipitation and wind speed weakly influence the inter-annual variation of TSM concentration; (3) The concentration of TSM in the Hongze Lake in summer is easily affected by flooding in the Huai River, and the concentration of TSM in other seasons is significantly negatively correlated with precipitation; (4) TSM is highest in the Huaihe Bay, followed by the Lihe Bay and Chengzi Bay. The main reason for this is that the input of the Huaihe Bay flows directly into this lake area and is also the main navigation channel. The results of this study are of great significance for the protection and management of the water environment of the Hongze Lake.},

Abstract = {The quality of ecological environment is closely related to human life and the method of the evaluating the ecological environmental quality is the main factors for the accuracy of the models. We proposed a novel Ecological Environmental Quality Evaluation (EEQE) model which is constructed by combining the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and the Principal Component Analysis method (PCA) etc. The natural factors, meteorological factors, topographical factors and anthropogenic activities factors are also considered in the EEQE model which can be utilized to effectively assess the quality of the ecological environment. The results showed that the ecological environmental quality of five cities with good level and excellent level is most about 80\%. Besides, we also analyzed the correlations between ecological environmental quality and the impact factors. The results indicate that the dominant factors of the ecological environment quality in Huai'an, Lianyungang, Suqian, Xuzhou and Yancheng are precipitation, land surface temperature, net primary productivity, wetness and slope respectively.},

Title = {Using VIIRS/NPP and MODIS/Aqua data to provide a continuous record of suspended particulate matter in a highly turbid inland lake},

Abstract = {Inland lakes are generally an important source of drinking water, and information on their water quality needs to be obtained in real time. To date, Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have played a critical, effective and long-term role in fulfilling this function. However, the MODIS instruments on board both the Terra and Aqua satellites have operated beyond their designed five-year mission lifespans (Terra was launched in 1999, whereas Aqua was launched in 2002), and these instruments may stop running at any time in the near future. The Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP, which was launched in Oct 2011) is expected to provide a consistent, long-term data record and continue the series of observations initiated by MODIS. To date, few evaluations of the consistency between VIIRS and MODIS have been conducted for turbid inland waters. In this study, we first used synchronous MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data (+/- 1 h) collected during 2012-2015 to evaluate the consistency of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) observations over Lake Hongze (the fourth-largest freshwater lake in China), since accurate remote sensing reflectance (R-rc) values cannot be acquired over turbid inland waters. Second, we used recently developed algorithms based on R-rc in the red band to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP data. Finally, we assessed the consistency of the SPM products derived from MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP. The results show the following. (1) The differences in Rrc among the green (VIIRS 551 nm and MODIS 555 nm) and red bands (VIIRS 671 nm and MODIS 645 nm) indicate a satisfactory consistency, and the unbiased percentage difference (UPD) is < 12\%. Meanwhile, the results for the near infrared (NIR) band (MODIS 859 nm and VIIRS 862 nm) indicate relatively large differences (UPD = 21.84\%). (2) The satellite-derived SPM products obtained using MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/NPP have a satisfactory degree of consistency (0-150 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.81, UPD < 16\% and 0-80 mg/L SPM: R-2 = 0.85, UPD < 12\%, respectively). These results demonstrate that VIIRS/NPP can continue to record the SPM observations initiated by MODIS/Aqua for turbid inland waters and establish environmental datasets over long time periods to support water quality management endeavors.},

Title = {Regional measurements and spatial/temporal analysis of CDOM in 10,000+optically variable Minnesota lakes using Landsat 8 imagery},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {724},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Information on colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is essential for understanding and managing lakes but is often not available, especially in lake-rich regions where concentrations are often highly variable in time and space. We developed remote sensing methods that can use both Landsat and Sentinel satellite imagery to provide census-level CDOM measurements across the state of Minnesota, USA, a lake-rich landscape with highly varied lake, watershed, and climatic conditions. We evaluated the error of satellite derived CDOM resulting from two atmospheric correction methods with in situ data, and found that both provided substantial improvements over previous methods. We applied CDOM models to 2015 and 2016 Landsat 8 OLI imagery to create 2015 and 2016 Minnesota statewide CDOM maps (reported as absorption coefficients at 440 nm, a(440)) and used those maps to conduct a geospatial analysis at the ecoregion level. Large differences in a(440) among ecoregions were related to predominant land cover/use; lakes in ecoregions with large areas of wetland and forest had significantly higher CDOM levels than lakes in agricultural ecoregions. We compared regional lake CDOM levels between two years with strongly contrasting precipitation (close-to-normal precipitation year in 2015 and much wetter conditions with large storm events in 2016). CDOM levels of lakes in agricultural ecoregions tended to decrease between 2015 and 2016, probably because of dilution by rainfall, and 7\% of lakes in these areas decreased in a(440) by >= 3 m(-1). In two ecoregions with high forest and wetlands cover, a(440) increased by >3 m(-1) in 28 and 31\% of the lakes, probably due to enhanced transport of CDOM from forested wetlands. With appropriate model tuning and validation, the approach we describe could be extended to other regions, providing a method for frequent and comprehensive measurements of CDOM, a dynamic and important variable in surface waters.<bold> </bold>},

Title = {Quantifying national and regional cyanobacterial occurrence in US lakes using satellite remote sensing},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are the most common form of harmful algal blooms in freshwater systems throughout the world. However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency Envisat MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008-2011, 2017, and 2018. A total of 2321 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. We examined four different thresholds to define when a waterbody is classified as experiencing a bloom. Across these four thresholds, we explored variability in bloom percentage with changes in seasonality and lake size. As a validation of algorithm performance, we analyzed the agreement between satellite observations and previously established ecological patterns, although data availability in the wintertime limited these comparisons on a year-round basis. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage at the national scale followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a maximum in fall, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in northern regions, were consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage reached a maximum in the winter rather than the summer. Lake Jesup in Florida was used as a case study to validate this observed pattern against field observations of chlorophyll a. Results from this research establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States. In addition, methods presented in this study can be tailored to fit the specific requirements of an individual system or region.},

Title = {Quantifying total suspended matter (TSM) in waters using Landsat images during 1984-2018 across the Songnen Plain, Northeast China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {262},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of total suspended matter (TSM) in waters is necessary to promote efficient water resource management. In our study, we have estimated the spatiotemporal pattern of TSM with the combination of time-series Landsat images and field survey. Among various remote sensing-derived parameters, the red/blue band turns to be robust and the most sensitive to the TSM from field measurements. In Songnen Plain, the mean annual TSM in 60.5\% of the water bodies decreased from 1984 to 2018. The decreasing of TSM is likely due to the increasing of vegetation in the area. The TSM concentration in waters declined from April to July, and then increased from September onwards. We also found the TSM in water bodies in Songnen Plain has very high spatial variation. Our results indicated that the meteorological factors such as wind and precipitation may affect the variation of TSM. Our results demonstrate that long-term Landsat data are useful to examine TSM in inland waters. Our findings can support for water resource management under human activities and climate change.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Area that has been assessed as having a very poor outlook and needing urgent intervention. The eReefs hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models are used to complement monitoring, facilitate data interpretation and support policy decisions. Management and policy for the Great Barrier Reef are politically contentious, so a high standard of model evaluation is required. We report the application of a recently-developed four-level CSPS (Concept/State/Process/System) model evaluation framework to the eReefs biogeochemical model. The framework considers: Level 0, conceptual evaluation; Level 1, simulated state variables; Level 2, process rates; and Level 3, system-level patterns and emergent properties. This paper is the first complete application of this model assessment framework. It highlights both strengths and weaknesses of the eReefs biogeochemical model that might not have been apparent from a traditional model evaluation. The framework can be applied to evaluation of any complex, process-based numerical model.},

Abstract = {Urbanization and land use/land cover (LULC) patterns significantly affect groundwater quality. This study investigated groundwater quality and LULC conversion of Xi'an City in Guanzhong Basin over ten years, from 2005 to 2015. The relationship between groundwater quality and LULC patterns were also explored. Piper diagram, Gibbs diagram, and self-organizing map (SOM) were used to investigate the hydrogeochemistry and groundwater quality in the city. Remote sensing image data generated by Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were used to extract the LULC patterns of Xi'an City in those three years. These data were used to determine the LULC conversion between 2005 and 2010, and between 2010 and 2015. Entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI), curved streamline searchlight model (CS-SLM), and multiple linear regression analysis were used to relate groundwater quality to the LULC patterns of Xi'an City in the three years. The Piper diagram indicated that groundwater in Xi'an City was mainly characterized as HCO3-Na type and/or HCO3-Ca center dot Mg type. The Gibbs diagram indicated that the dominant evolution of hydrogeochemistry was through rock weathering and water-rock interactions. SOM classified the groundwater into eight clusters, and revealed different spatiotemporal patterns of water quality parameters. The LULC classification indicated that the urban land in Xi'an City has expanded by more than 160\%, while forest and agricultural land areas have reduced by 52.54\% and 83.08\%, respectively, from 2005 to 2015. Indicated by the coefficient of multiple linear regression of EWQI and the percentages of LULC types in CS-SLM for the wells, urban land, agricultural land, and industrial land had negative effects on groundwater quality, while the forest positively impacted the groundwater quality in the same period. This study is meaningful and significant because it supports sustainable urban development and groundwater management in Xi'an City.},

Abstract = {Land use-land cover (LULC) change and the associated risk of soil erosion have become a global environmental concern. We herein presented a geospatial analysis to detect LULC changes (1984-2010) in a Canadian watershed by using object-based classification of Landsat satellite images. We found that the watershed experienced a substantial increase in forest clear cutting and built-up areas. The detected LULC changes were implemented into the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to examine the soil erosion potential. We divided the soil erosion risk into five classes ranging from very low (<6 ton ha(-1) year(-1)) to severe (33 ton ha(-1) year(-1)) levels. The random forest algorithm was then implemented and detected that the topography and LULC conditions of 1999 and 2010 had the most influence on the erosion in 2010. The findings of this study will support efficient LULC management to reduce soil erosion and the consequent degradation of water quality.},

Abstract = {A bibliometric analysis based on the Science Citation Index Expanded from Web of Science was carried out to provide insights into research activities and trends of the environmental monitoring from 1993 to 2012. Study emphases covered publication outputs, language, categories, journals, countries/territories, institutions, words, and hot issues. The results indicated that the annual output of environmental monitoring publications increased steadily. The environmental sciences and analytical chemistry were the two most common categories. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment published the most articles. The USA and the UK ranked in the top two in terms of all five indicators. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the leading position of the institutions in terms of publication output. The synthesized analysis by words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus provided important clues for hot issues. Researchers paid more attention on water environment monitoring than other environmental factors. The contaminants including organic contaminants, heavy metal, and radiation were most common research focuses, and the organic contaminants and heavy metal of the degree of concern were gradually rising. Sensor and biosensor played an important role in the field of environmental monitoring devices. In addition to conventional device detection method, the remote sensing, GIS, and wireless sensor networks were the mainstream environmental monitoring methods. The international organization, social awareness, and the countries' positive and effective political and policies promoted the published articles.},

Title = {How can Big Data and machine learning benefit environment and water management: a survey of methods, applications, and future directions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Big Data and machine learning (ML) technologies have the potential to impact many facets of environment and water management (EWM). Big Data are information assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Fast advances in high-resolution remote sensing techniques, smart information and communication technologies, and social media have contributed to the proliferation of Big Data in many EWM fields, such as weather forecasting, disaster management, smart water and energy management systems, and remote sensing. Big Data brings about new opportunities for data-driven discovery in EWM, but it also requires new forms of information processing, storage, retrieval, as well as analytics. ML, a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI), refers broadly to computer algorithms that can automatically learn from data. ML may help unlock the power of Big Data if properly integrated with data analytics. Recent breakthroughs in AI and computing infrastructure have led to the fast development of powerful deep learning (DL) algorithms that can extract hierarchical features from data, with better predictive performance and less human intervention. Collectively Big Data and ML techniques have shown great potential for data-driven decision making, scientific discovery, and process optimization. These technological advances may greatly benefit EWM, especially because (1) many EWM applications (e.g. early flood warning) require the capability to extract useful information from a large amount of data in autonomous manner and in real time, (2) EWM researches have become highly multidisciplinary, and handling the ever increasing data volume/types using the traditional workflow is simply not an option, and last but not least, (3) the current theoretical knowledge about many EWM processes is still incomplete, but which may now be complemented through data-driven discovery. A large number of applications on Big Data and ML have already appeared in the EWM literature in recent years. The purposes of this survey are to (1) examine the potential and benefits of data-driven research in EWM,(2) give a synopsis of key concepts and approaches in Big Data and ML, (3) provide a systematic review of current applications, and finally (4) discuss major issues and challenges, and recommend future research directions. EWM includes a broad range of research topics. Instead of attempting to survey each individual area, this review focuses on areas of nexus in EWM, with an emphasis on elucidating the potential benefits of increased data availability and predictive analytics to improving the EWM research.},

Abstract = {Lake Baiyangdian, a largest wetland ecosystem in North China Plain, has dried up on seven occasions since the 1960s. In recent years, more than one billion of cubic meters of water from upstream reservoirs and Yellow river have been transported to the lake to rescue the shrinking wetlands. Since the Lake Baiyangdian was actually composed of 143 small lakes and more than 70 villages with large or small area of cropland, dynamic distribution of aquatic plants in wetland such as reed and associated growth condition of these allowed to monitor the changes of wetland landscape and water quality to support the policy applications of water conveyance and wetland environmental treatment and control. Assisted with ground survey analyses and Landsat TM image, the MODIS 250 m time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), given its combination of medium spatial and high temporal resolution, were applied to detect the unique rapid growth stage of reed in the spring from adjacent crops such as winter wheat, cotton, and spring maize, of which has a similar phenology in development of leaf area index, and dynamic reed areas were mapped in recent decade. Landscape changes of the wetland were analyzed using maps of reed area and hydrological data.},

Abstract = {The societal benefits of satellite ocean colour include aiding the management of the marine ecosystem, helping understand the role of the ocean ecosystem in climate change, aquaculture, fisheries, coastal zone water quality, and the mapping and monitoring of harmful algal blooms. Ocean colour is also designated as an essential climate variable by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). However, in order to have confidence in earth observation data, measurements made at the surface of the Earth, with the intention of providing verification or validation of satellite mounted sensor measurements, should be trustworthy and of the same high quality as those taken with the satellite sensors themselves. In order to be trustworthy, in situ validation measurements should include an unbroken chain of SI traceable calibrations and comparisons and full uncertainty budgets for each of the in situ sensors used. This metrological traceability is beginning to be demanded by the space agencies for satellite validation measurements and, for ocean colour, should follow the guidelines and protocols of the ESA Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Ocean Colour (FRM4SOC) project (www.frm4soc.org). Until now, this has not been the case for most measurements used for validation, including those taken in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. Subsequently, the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), in cooperation with the Laboratory of Optical Metrology (LOM), has started to follow the FRM direction by ensuring that the radiometers of its optical suite underwent SI- traceable absolute radiometric calibration. This included an estimate of the radiometry calibration uncertainty budget and was performed at the marine optical laboratory of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre prior to their deployment on the recent PERLE- 2 oceanographic cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean (Feb- Mar 2019). As well as irradiance and radiance sensors, the HCMR optical suite also houses instruments for measuring inherent optical properties (IOP) of the water column. Therefore, this paper presents the in-water radiometry matchups from PERLE-2 with Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) measurements, and investigates their validation potential. It also presents the PERLE-2 cruise profile chlorophyll and backscatter measurements that aid this effort through characterizing the light scattering and absorbing constituents that contribute to the signal detected by satellite ocean colour sensors during validation matchups.},

Abstract = {Based on a previously developed and thoroughly validated hydro-optical model, numerical simulations of the spectral composition of water leaving radiance are presented. These simulations take into account absorption, elastic scattering, water Raman ( inelastic) scattering as well as the fluorescence of chlorophyll (chl) and dissolved organics (doc). The results obtained for forward modelling were also used for the inverse problem: retrieval of water quality parameters from water volume reflectance (R) spectra. The Levenberg-Marquardt multivariate optimization procedure was used for this purpose. Unlike water Raman scattering, the chl and doc fluorescence has an impact on R, so the retrieval results can change substantially for waters rich in chl or doc. Suspended minerals (sm) suppress both the chl and doc fluorescence influence on R. The retrieval results indicate that chl can be accurately assessed if the concentration of sm is not low and the doc concentration is less than or equal to2 mgC l(-1). For waters devoid of doc, the concentration of chl can be accurately retrieved even if the sm concentration is very low. Retrieval errors prove to be strongly dependent on the fluorescence yield value of both chl and doc.},

Title = {Potential development of Irish agricultural sustainability indicators for current and future policy evaluation needs},

Volume = {230},
Pages = {434-445},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {There is a significant and detailed range of sustainability indicators for Irish agri-food production, but there remain areas where further indicator development or new indicators could prove valuable. This review provides an outline of potential developments in Irish assessment of agricultural sustainability following the latest research and in order to meet policy demands. Recent research findings have suggested means of improved quantitative modelling of greenhouse gas emissions, but additional dietary and soil data may be important for this, especially for the potential inclusion of any soil sequestration. This information could also benefit more detailed modelling of nutrient losses to water. Specific concerns over pesticide and antibiotic use may require additional survey work on the particular locations or types of farms of interest. Biodiversity monitoring could be improved by expanding the range of results-oriented agri-environment schemes or employing remote-sensing habitat monitoring, likely supplemented with targeted field surveys for specific objectives. Farm-level economic sustainability is largely well-covered, but additional data collection may be of benefit to address specific issues such as labour costs. Recent additional surveys on farm-level social sustainability have addressed important social indicators of isolation and access to local services, and could be rolled out on a larger number of farms in the future. Wider societal concerns such as animal welfare, genetically modified materials in foodstuffs and antibiotic resistance have limited indicators currently available, and could also benefit from additional surveys. The breadth and detail required in agri-food sustainability indicators present a significant challenge to survey design and implementation, but many developments can be achieved without additional surveys through the use of remote sensing and geospatial technologies and integration of existing datasets. Despite the important benefits of further developments in Irish sustainability indicators, consideration must also be given to farmer confidentiality and survey fatigue.},

Our objectives were to develop and evaluate an efficient, low-cost field technique for sampling stream-surface shading using digital images and to evaluate the efficiencies and effectiveness of eight different digital image analysis techniques for shade assessments. We developed a quadrat-based technique and associated field equipment to directly photograph stream-surface shading. Sampling at random points (pixels) within the resultant digital images was the most accurate, efficient, and robust image analysis technique. An approach pairing the photographic field technique and the random point-sampling image analysis technique should enable managers to conduct ground-based assessments of stream shading over extensive stream networks. This approach may also provide an efficient means of collecting ground truth samples for even broader scale, remote sensing-based stream-shade assessments.},

Abstract = {The knowledge of impervious surfaces, especially the magnitude, location, geometry, spatial pattern of impervious surfaces, is significant to urban ecosystem studies, including urban hydrology, urban climate, land use planning and resource management. Impervious surface area (ISA) is considered a key indicator of environmental quality and can be used to address complex urban environmental issues, particularly those related to the health of urban watersheds. ISA is also an indicator of non-point source pollution or polluted runoff. Remote sensing offers a consistent framework for representing spatial patterns and rates of urbanization over time through accurate observations of impervious surface area. Most of the existing methods of extracting impervious surface based on remote sensing concentrate on an urban scale, but the rapid and accurate methods of extracting impervious surfaces in a basin scale are nearly nonexistent in China and abroad. In recent years, with the rapid urbanization especially surrounding the Dianchi water body, the impervious surface coverage rate also grows rapidly and results in severe degradation of basin water environment within Dianchi watershed. In this study, we developed an approach to extract impervious surface for Dianci Basin by synergistic using medium-resolution and high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Subpixel percent impervious surfaces at Thematic Mapper (TM) images were mapped using the classification and regression tree(CART) algorithm. Sub-pixel impervious surfaces at 30m resolution were mapped in this study area through regression tree models. The estimated ISA results were evaluated through independent ISA reference data derived from high resolution QuickBird. The results prove the suitability of the approach for a widely automated and mapping of impervious surfaces in a basin scale.},

Abstract = {The project's case study area is that of the Ill River flood plain between Colmar and Strasbourg on the central Alsace plain in northern France. This area has historically been a wetland forest and prairie grassland region and has been home and resting site to much bird wildlife. Sudden snow melts and intense precipitation in the adjacent Vosges can still cause widespread flooding. In recent times the ploughing in of much of the prairies and intensive maize production has led to a destabilised biotope. Therefore, the close to surface water table is under threat from the infiltration of agricultural pesticides and fertilisers and the bare soils in winter are open to erosion. This wetland has been inscribed in EU circulars under the protection of wetland areas (79/409) and an official flood zone has been defined. Prairie grassland conservation policies have been implemented. Given the area's ecological and agricultural importance it has been the subject of many land-cover, soil moisture and flood event studies at SERTIT using optical and radar remote sensing data (Clandillon et al., 1993; 1995; De Fraipont et al., 1994; Fellah et al., 1995; Fellah and Tholey et al., 1996; SERTIT, 1990; Tholey et al., 1997; Yesou et al., 1995).},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {European countries are obligated to monitor and estimate ecological status of lakes under European Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) for sustainable lakes' ecosystems in the future. In large and shallow lakes, physical, chemical, and biological water quality parameters are influenced by the high natural variability of water level, exceeding anthropogenic variability, and causing large uncertainty to the assessment of ecological status. Correction of metric values used for the assessment of ecological status for the effect of natural water level fluctuation reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in data and decreases the uncertainty of the status estimate. Here we have explored the potential to create synergy between optical and altimetry data for more accurate estimation of ecological status class of lakes. We have combined data from Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter and Cryosat-2 SAR Interferometric Radar Altimeter to derive water level estimations in order to apply corrections for chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biomass, and Secchi disc depth estimations from Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument data. Long-term in situ data was used to develop the methodology for the correction of water quality data for the effects of water level applicable on the satellite data. The study shows suitability and potential to combine optical and altimetry data to support in situ measurements and thereby support lake monitoring and management. Combination of two different types of satellite data from the continuous Copernicus program will advance the monitoring of lakes and improves the estimation of ecological status under European Union Water Framework Directive.},

Abstract = {In this study, Sentinel 2A and Landsat series remote sensing images were used to determine the weights of vegetation coverage, humidity, dryness and heat by using the principal component analysis method. The remote sensing ecological index evaluation model was used to evaluate the ecology of the Fuxian Lake area from 2013 to 2018. Environmental quality in the study area is monitored and analyzed. By developing a unified organization and management module of spatio-temporal data in the collaborative production of multi-source heterogeneous data, the mapping relationship between data and parameters is established. The 3D-web data integration decision platform is constructed. Based on the Cesium engine real-time rendering and interactive visualization network 3D platform, real-time calculation and visualization of the ecological evaluation of the Fuxian Lake area between 2013 and 2018 is realized. The ecological environment of the study area continued to deteriorate from 2013 to 2015, improved slightly in 2016, and improved significantly in 2017-2018. The platform has the functions of searching, selecting the base map, measuring on the map, and positioning the coordinates, which can achieve the real-time ecological analysis function and show the change process of the ecological environment and natural resources.},

Abstract = {The water quality is related to the hydrologic and limnologic properties of ground and surface water, and significant efforts have been made to monitor water sources to understand the effects of land use changes in agricultural areas, with significant socioeconomic activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the qualitative aspects of surface water in subbasins related to land use. Samples were analyzed in terms of physical and chemical parameters on monthly discrete water quality sampling in four representative sites at first order subbasin streams, located at the Polo Regional Centro Norte, Pindorama County, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The land use classification was made by visual detection technique in a multispectral satellite data obtained from LandSat8- spectral bands of the OLI sensor. The watershed was classified into major land cover/use classes and overlay maps generated in ArcGIS 10 indicated a significant shift from natural vegetation to agriculture activities. Water quality monitoring was according to the brazilian protocol and the results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The values obtained differ significantly at each sampling point - subbasins, reflecting the effects of land use on water quality. Soil conservation management is important to optimize soil use in order to contribute to the control of water pollution and the formulation of a public policy is necessary for the conservation of water and soil resources.},

Abstract = {As part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, paired edge-of-field sites were established in high priority subwatersheds to assess the effectiveness of agricultural management practices. One pairing was in Black Creek, a tributary to the Maumee River and Lake Erie.These fields were paired because of similarity in soils, topography, and agricultural management. Following two years of baseline data collection from these fields, consistent differences in water quantity and quality were observed for tile networks draining the fields, despite these fields being adjacent and managed together. Consequently, it was hypothesized that differences in subsurface water movement, specifically tile-drain density and connectivity, were the source of the observed differences. Our objective was to map the tile-drain network using remote sensing methodology in order to improve the understanding of nutrient and water transport as well as management on these fields. A combination of multispectral and thermal imagery, collected in spring of 2017, was incorporated to delineate the tile-drain network within each field.This imagery led to locating a cracked tile, which provided a direct path for overland flow to enter the tile-drain system and suggested that a tile-drain segment under the road connected the two fields.A ground-penetrating radar survey verified multiple tile locations, including the tile segment under the road.The distribution of these tiles helps explain the difference in water quantity and quality in the two fields.},

Abstract = {The per capita fish consumption in the Philippines has not significantly changed through the years (1987-2003), but the increase in human population has created an ever-increasing demand for food fish. The Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has responded to the food fish shortage by promoting mariculture. We support this policy within a comprehensive planning and management framework that includes siting and density of mariculture facilities. The case of Bolinao-Anda, Pangasinan is presented in this article to highlight the multi-faceted process for a successful mariculture enterprise. We use remote sensing tools to track the responses of stakeholder groups to various local legislation, mariculture-induced disasters, and scientific recommendations. Using hydrodynamic models, we assess these responses and highlight potential adjustments that may alleviate the pressure on and maintain the ecosystem health of the Bolinao-Anda coastal waters.},

Title = {The Use of Sentinel-2 for Chlorophyll-a Spatial Dynamics Assessment: A Comparative Study on Different Lakes in Northern Germany},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Eutrophication of inland waters is an environmental issue that is becoming more common with climatic variability. Monitoring of this aquatic problem is commonly based on the chlorophyll-a concentration monitored by routine sampling with limited temporal and spatial coverage. Remote sensing data can be used to improve monitoring, especially after the launch of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2. In this study, we compared the estimation of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from different bio-optical algorithms using hyperspectral proximal remote sensing measurements, from simulated MSI responses and from an MSI image. For the satellite image, we also compare different atmospheric corrections routines before the comparison of different bio-optical algorithms. We used in situ data collected in 2019 from 97 sampling points across 19 different lakes. The atmospheric correction assessment showed that the performances of the routines varied for each spectral band. Therefore, we selected C2X, which performed best for bands 4 (root mean square error-RMSE = 0.003), 5 (RMSE = 0.004) and 6 (RMSE = 0.002), which are usually used for the estimation of chl-a. Considering all samples from the 19 lakes, the best performing chl-a algorithm and calibration achieved a RMSE of 16.97 mg/m(3). When we consider only one lake chain composed of meso-to-eutrophic lakes, the performance improved (RMSE: 10.97 mg/m(3)). This shows that for the studied meso-to-eutrophic waters, we can reliably estimate chl-a concentration, whereas for oligotrophic waters, further research is needed. The assessment of chl-a from space allows us to assess spatial dynamics of the environment, which can be important for the management of water resources. However, to have an accurate product, similar optical water types are important for the overall performance of the bio-optical algorithm.},

Title = {The Impacts of Human Activities on the Hydrogeological Regime of East Nile Delta, Egypt},
Journal = {CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {49-61},
Abstract = {Human activities contribute numerous hydrogeological threats including waterlogging, soil salinization and water pollution in East Nile Delta region. Landsat Thematic Images were utilized to detect the environmental changes in the study area during the last three decades. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems data were integrated to monitor and measure surface areas of agricultural and urban developments. Risk assessment maps were constructed for waterlogging and soil salinization threats. The results cleared that both evaporation from logged and flood irrigation water surfaces cause up to 30\% of water loss. The logged areas increased from 25km(2) in 1984 to 180km(2) in 2014 along the El-Tina plain which represents the most threated zone. The total changes of waterlogging cover at east Nile Delta varies between 930km(2) in 1989, 685km(2) in 1998 after the construction of El-Salam Canal and 1044km2 in 2014. The total estimated water loss by direct evaporation was up to 23.6Mm(3)/year. Following the construction of El-Salam Canal in 1998, water and drainage effluents into Manzala Lake were decreased creating shrinkage in its surface area by 45\%. Consequently, water quality of Manzala Lake was severely deteriorated due to the throwing of municipal and irrigational sewages.},

Title = {River health assessment using macroinvertebrates and water quality parameters: A case of the Orange River in Namibia},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76-78},
Pages = {140-148},
Abstract = {Land use activities that have an effect on water quality and river health are believed to have increased along the Orange River in Namibia. These are mainly agricultural activities, notably irrigation, with more than 2000 ha currently under irrigation and approximately 2000 ha planned for future expansion. Other anthropogenic activities include urban development and weir construction along the Orange River. Population increase along the river has resulted in proliferation of unplanned settlements with no proper sanitation facilities. This study was aimed at assessing the current water quality and overall health status of the Orange River in Namibia. The South African Scoring System 5(SASS5) was applied in eight sites where samples for macroinvertebrates, physical and chemical water quality parameters such as nutrients in the water, pH, turbidity and presence of bacteria were obtained. Satellite images i.e. Landsat images were also used to assess the land-uses over time in the study area with the view of linking such changes to variance in water quality over time. The SASS5 results indicated a fair water quality and river health condition in category C, indicating that the river is moderately modified. Water quality parameters at all sites varied moderately and were within acceptable limits, except for turbidity and chlorophyll a. There was a significant difference in the mean concentrations of nine water quality parameters among sampling periods, whereby F-value > F-critical at alpha = 0.05 among sites, F-value <F-critical at alpha = 0.05, except for turbidity and chlorophyll a. The Landsat images also showed minimal changes in land-use activities between 2002 and 2012, with a net increase of 38 ha in irrigated area. According to National Water Policy White Paper of Namibia of 2000, it was found that policies and legislation address water resources management from a broader spectrum and not specific to river health. Thus, it was concluded that the river health of Orange River is still within acceptable range despite the fact that there is an urgent need to develop an effective and sustainable water quality monitoring and development programme.

Abstract = {Concentrations of the phytoplankton pigment chlorophyll-a (C-a) provide indicators of nutrient over-enrichment that has negatively affected Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A. C-a time-series from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua spacecraft (MODIS-Aqua) provide observations on temporal and spatial scales that far exceed current field and aircraft sampling strategies. These sensors provide consistent, frequent, and high density data to potentially complement ongoing Bay monitoring activities. We used the in situ Water Quality Monitoring Data set of the Chesapeake Bay Program to evaluate decade-long time-series of SeaWiFS and MCDIS-Aqua C-a retrievals in the Bay. The accuracy of the retrievals generally degraded with increasing latitude as the optical complexity increases northward. C-a derived using empirical ({''}band ratio{''}) algorithms overestimated in situ measurements by 10-50 and 40-100\% for SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua, respectively, but with limited variability. C-a derived using spectral-matching algorithms showed less bias for both sensors, but with significant variability and sensitivity to radiometric errors. Regionally-tuned empirical algorithms performed best throughout the Bay, offering a combination of reasonable accuracy and high spatial coverage. The radiometric spectral resolution used as input to the algorithms strongly influenced the quality of C-a retrievals from both sensors. These results establish a baseline quantification of algorithm and sensor performance in a variable and stressed ecosystem against which novel approaches might be compared. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {This paper presents a new technique for mapping detention basins and measuring their spatial attributes using high-resolution airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. An efficient least-cost search algorithm is employed to identify surface depressions from a bare-earth LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM). Surface depressions are automatically delineated into hydrological objects using the connected component identification and indexing algorithm. Various spatial attributes are derived for these hydrologic objects, including location, perimeter, surface area, depth, storage volume and shape properties. Based on spatial attributes, a rule-based classifier is established to separate detention basins from other types of surface depressions. We have successfully applied our technique to an urban watershed in the Houston Metropolitan area, Texas. Detention basins at regional and residential subdivision levels are mapped out for the watershed, and measurements on the spatial attributes are derived for each detention basin. The quantitative information derived from LiDAR data provides a scientific basis for formulating an appropriate management plan for detention basins and for assessing their effects on flood control and storm water quality treatment.

Abstract = {Mentawai Island is adjacent with Indian Ocean that prone to high waves due to the wind in the Australia monsoon periods so that this island affected by coastal erosion. This coastal hazard causes significant risk like physical damage. Accordingly, disaster risk reduction program in coastal areas is indispensable in advance for the next destructive coastal hazard event. This need is answered by conducting disaster risk analysis as the first step in coastal erosion identification in the Mentawai Islands. The risk was obtained using a qualitative approach by combining the multi-dimensional aspects of hazard as well as vulnerability. Hazards aspect was derived from identification of physical variables to erosion and was represented by index value. Vulnerability aspects consist of physical aspect and social aspect. The physical aspect is the distribution of buildings and the social aspect is population density that obtained by modeling process. The result indicated that the eastern Mentawai coast has a wider area of erosion risk than the west coast due to the influence of the Australian monsoon.},

During both ``greenness rising{''} and ``greenness falling{''} transition phases, we found generally good agreement between PhenoCam and MODIS transition dates for agricultural, deciduous forest, and grassland sites, provided that the vegetation in the camera field of view was representative of the broader landscape. The correlation between PhenoCam and MODIS transition dates was poor for evergreen forest sites. We discuss potential reasons (including sub-pixel spatial heterogeneity, flexibility of the transition date extraction method, vegetation index sensitivity in evergreen systems, and PhenoCam geolocation uncertainty) for varying agreement between time series of vegetation indices derived from PhenoCam and MODIS imagery. This analysis increases our confidence in the ability of satellite remote sensing to accurately characterize seasonal dynamics in a range of ecosystems, and provides a basis for interpreting those dynamics in the context of tangible phenological changes occurring on the ground.},

Abstract = {This study examined the current trophic state based on integrated analysis of land use land cover changes (LULCCs), morphometry, bathymetry, and water quality of a semi-urban wetland. The analysis of satellite data indicated that the wetland has lost an area of similar to 93 ha from 1980 to 2017. During the same period, the urban area within the wetland increased from 0.04 to 13.5\%. The natural area of the wetland was lost significantly because of land conversion practices largely related to encroachments, settlements, and unplanned developmental activities. The land cover changes assessed in the immediate vicinity of wetland indicated an increase in the built-up (223\%) and roads (95\%). Morphometric analysis revealed that the maximum length of the wetland decreased by 775 m, while width showed an insignificant decrease. The bathymetric analysis revealed that the depth of the wetland varied from 25 to 246 cm, with a mean depth of 101.6 cm. The Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) ranged between 71 and 80.4, indicating the hyper-eutrophic nature of the wetland. Comparison of water quality data of a wetland with the previous studies indicated a decrease of 29 cm in the maximum depth from 1980 to 2018. While NO3--N increased from 300 mu g L-1 in 1980 to 367 mu g L-1 in 2018, total phosphorus (TP) increased from 300 mu g L-1 in 1980 to 923 mu g L-1 in 2018, thereby indicating continuous nutrient enrichment of the wetland. Based on the data analysis, immediate policy interventions are required to safeguard and/or reclaim this culturally and ecologically important wetland in the Kashmir region.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},

Abstract = {Extensive human activities and climate change in recent decades have triggered severe eutrophication problems in the coastal oceans in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China. However, a comprehensive characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns of chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha, a major indicator of phytoplankton biomass) in this region is not available. Our study attempts to fill this gap by using long-term satellite observations. With massive in situ datasets from underway sampling systems, we developed a novel hybrid Chl-alpha retrieval algorithm combining the recalibrated OC3 and line-height-based (BL443) algorithms for waters with different turbidity levels. Satellite-retrieved Chl-alpha values with the hybrid algorithm agreed well with in situ measurements, with an uncertainty level of 33.8 \%. Long-term analysis revealed significant decreasing trends over the inner Pearl River Estuary (averaged at 0.054 mu g/L yr(-1)), while significant increasing trends were found in eastern Daya Bay (averaged at 0.035 mu g/L yr(-1)). The developed algorithm is expected to aid routine Chl-alpha monitoring in the adjacent oceans of the GBA, and the long-term datasets here can serve as critical information for further coastal conservation and management efforts.},

Title = {Autonomous In Situ Measurements of Noncontaminant Water Quality Indicators and Sample Collection with a UAV},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {The objective of this research was to conduct in situ measurements of electrical conductivity (EC), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature, and collect water samples simultaneously at different depths using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV system consists of a hexacopter, water sampling cartridges (WSC), and a sensor node. Payload capacity and endurance of the UAV were determined using an indoor test station. The UAV was able to produce 106 N of thrust for 10 min with 6.3 kg of total takeoff weight. The thrust-to-weight ratio of the UAV was 2.5 at 50\% throttle. The decision for activating the water sampling cartridges and sensor node was made autonomously from an onboard microcontroller. System functions were verified at 0.5 m and 3.0 m depths in 6 locations over a 1.1 ha agricultural pond. Average measurements of EC, pH, DO, and temperature at 0.5 m depth were 42 mu S/cm, 5.6, 8.2 mg/L, and 31 degrees C, while the measurements at 3 m depth were 80 mu S/cm, 5.3, 5.34 mg/L, and 24 degrees C, respectively. The UAV-assisted autonomous water sampling system (UASS) successfully activated the WSC at each sampling location. The UASS would reduce the duration of water quality assessment and help practitioners and researchers to conduct observations with lower operational costs. The developed system would be useful for sampling and monitoring of water reservoirs, lakes, rivers, and ponds periodically or after natural disasters.},

Abstract = {Water resources in Taiwan are unevenly distributed in spatial and temporal domains. Effectively utilizing the water resources is an imperative task due to climate change. At present, groundwater contributes 34\% of the total annual water supply and is an important fresh water resource. However, over-exploitation has decreased groundwater availability and has led to land subsidence. Assessing the potential zone of groundwater recharge is extremely important for the protection of water quality and the management of groundwater systems. The Chih-Pen Creek basin in eastern Taiwan is examined in this study to assess its groundwater resources potential. Remote sensing and the geographical information system (GIS) are used to integrate five contributing factors: lithology, land cover/land use, lineaments, drainage, and slope. The weights of factors contributing to the groundwater recharge are derived using aerial photos, geology maps, a land use database, and field verification. The resultant map of the groundwater potential zone demonstrates that the highest recharge potential area is located towards the downstream regions in the basin because of the high infiltration rates caused by gravelly sand and agricultural land use in these regions. In contrast, the least effective recharge potential area is in upstream regions due to the low infiltration of limestone.},

Abstract = {Cage-based aquaculture has been gradually discontinued in many lakes and reservoirs in China to reduce eutrophication triggered by the feed. This study aimed to analyse variations in phytoplankton biomass in Daheiting Reservoir before and after cage removal. Cage aquaculture in this reservoir was terminated in the spring of 2017. Changes in phytoplankton biomass were analysed using multispectral satellite data. Chlorophyll a concentration increased from 2016 to 2018, but decreased from 2018 to 2021. Cyanobacterial blooms were absent from 2016 to 2017, but suddenly appeared over an area of similar to 12.76 km(2) in 2018 and gradually decreased to 0.55 km(2) in 2021. Following the removal of cage aquaculture in 2017, phytoplankton biomass of the reservoir initially rapidly increased, peaking in 2018, and then declined. The rapid, short-term increase in phytoplankton biomass after cage removal might be due to sudden lack of algae predators (silver carp, bighead carp, and sturgeon, prey on algae and plankton), as cultured fish were removed from the reservoir. Decreased nutrient input in the water and the growth of wild fish resulted in subsequent decreases in phytoplankton biomass. These findings provide a reference for research methods and decision support for the change in phytoplankton biomass after cage removal.},

Title = {Changes of water clarity in large lakes and reservoirs across China observed from long-term MODIS},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {247},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Water clarity is a well-established first-order indicator of water quality and has been used globally by water regulators in their monitoring and management programs. Assessments of water clarity in lakes over large temporal and spatial scales, however, are rare, limiting our understanding of its variability and the driven forces. In this study, we developed and validated a robust Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) algorithm for lakes across China based on two water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule Index (FUI) and hue angle alpha, retrieved from MODIS data. The MODIS Z(SD) model shows good results when compared with in-situ measurements from 17 lakes, with a 27.4\% mean relative difference (MRD) in the validation dataset. Compared with other empirical Z(SD) models, our FUI and alpha-based model demonstrates improved performance and adaptability over a wide range of water clarity and trophic states. This algorithm was subsequently applied to MODIS measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of water clarity in large lakes (N = 153) across China for the first time. The mean summer Z(SD) of the studied lakes between 2000 and 2017 demonstrated marked spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, the Z(SD) of large lakes presented a distinct spatial pattern of ``high west and low east{''} over China. This spatial pattern was found to be associated with the significant differences in lake depth and altitude between west and east China while China's population, GDP, temperature, and precipitation distribution have also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, the Z(SD) of most lakes increased during this period, with an overall mean rate of 3.3 cm/yr for all lakes. Here, 38.6\% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in their Z(SD) value during the past 18 years while only 8.5\% (N = 13) showed a significant decreasing trend. Significant increases in lake Z(SD) were observed in west China, which were found to correlate with the increase of air temperature and lake surface area. This is possibly a response of the lakes in west China to climate change. In the lake systems of east China, which are predominately used as a drinking water source, the increase in lake Z(SD) was found to be strongly correlated with changes in local GDP (gross domestic production), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and lake surface area, suggesting a combined effect of the implemented management practices and climatic variability. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at a large scale and long-term.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal assessment of potential drivers of salt marsh dieback in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay estuary, South Carolina (1990-2019)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Previous studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic states have suggested that a suite of possibly abiotic and biotic attributes is responsible for salt marsh dieback, e.g., drought, soil waterlogging, soil chemistry, top-down consumers control, etc. However, there are no conclusive answers in current literature explaining what led to marsh dieback in past decades, especially from the spatiotemporal perspective. Exploring all Landsat-retrieved marsh dieback events in 1990-2019, this research investigates the spatiotemporal relationships between the dieback series and the associated environmental variables in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina (SC). Based on our previous study, a series of marsh dieback events in the past 30 years were identified and dieback pixels in the estuary were extracted. Among these were the most severe marsh dieback events (1991, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2013). Daily Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI), daily precipitation data from Parameter Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), and station-based water quality observations (dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, salinity, turbidity, pH, and temperature) in the estuary were retrieved. Integrated with the proof-by-exhaustion method, statistical analysis showed marsh dieback were highly related to moisture imbalance in a period of 90 days before the dieback events. Respectively, pH for Clambank and Debidue Creek, salinity and turbidity for Thousand Acre were found to be the key water quality variables influencing marsh dieback besides drought. This study cogitates the environmental influence on coastal marsh dieback from a spatiotemporal perspective using a long-term satellite time series analysis. The findings could provide insights into marsh ecological resilience and facilitate coastal ecosystem management.},

Abstract = {Due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and population growth, wetland area in China has shrunk rapidly and many wetland ecosystems have been reported to degrade during recent decades. Wetland health assessment could raise the public awareness of the wetland condition and guide policy makers to make reasonable and sustainable policies or strategies to protect and restore wetland ecosystems. This study assessed the health levels of wetland ecosystem at the Hangzhou Bay, China using the pressure-state-response (PSR) model through synthesizing remote sensing and statistical data. Ten ecological and social-economic indicators were selected to build the wetland health assessment system. Weights of these indicators and PSR model components as well as the normalized wetland health score were assigned and calculated based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. We analyzed the spatio-temporal changes in wetland ecosystem health status during the past 20 years (1990-2010) from the perspectives of ecosystem pressure, state and response. The results showed that the overall wetland health score was in a fair health level, but displayed large spatial variability in 2010. The wetland health score declined from good health level to fair health level from 1990 to 2000, then restored slightly from 2000 to 2010. Overall, wetland health levels showed a decline from 1990 to 2010 for most administrative units. The temporal change patterns in wetland ecosystem health varied significantly among administrative units. Our results could help to clarify the administrative responsibilities and obligations and provide scientific guides not only for wetland protection but also for restoration and city development planning at the Hangzhou Bay area.

Abstract = {Rangelands are grasslands, shrublands, and savannas used by wildlife for habitat and livestock in order to produce food and fiber. Assessment and monitoring of rangelands are currently based on comparing the plant species present in relation to an expected successional end-state defined by the ecological site. In the future, assessment and monitoring may be based on indicators of ecosystem health, including sustainability of soil, sustainability of plant production, and presence of invasive weed species. USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are actively engaged in developing quantitative, repeatable, and low-cost methods to measure indicators of ecosystem health using remote sensing. Noxious weed infestations can be determined by careful selection of the spatial resolution, spectral bands, and timing of image acquisition. Rangeland productivity can be estimated with either Landsat or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data using models of gross primary production based on radiation use efficiency. Lidar measurements are useful for canopy structure and soil roughness, indicating susceptibility to erosion. The value Of remote sensing for rangeland management depends in part on combining the imagery with other spatial data within geographic information systems. Finally, ARS scientists are developing the knowledge on which future rangeland assessment and monitoring tools will be developed.},

Abstract = {A temporal assessment of land-cover changes of the province Beykoz in Istanbul has been documented in this article. The. study focuses on the acquisition and analysis of LANDSAT 5 TM images that reflect the drastic land-cover changes between the years 1984 and 2001 utilizing aerial photographs, orthophoto maps, standard topographic maps, and ground truth measurements. The status of the province, including its surrounding villages, were examined together with more specialized maps showing only the city center and part of the province that lies within the watershed of the Elmali Drinking Water Reservoir, The land distribution profiles were also calculated for each of the images to help authorities and decision-makers to better understand the main causes of such remarkable changes and to inform them of the changing quality conditions of the reservoir. Rapid, uncontrolled, and illegal urbanization accompanied by insufficient infrastructure has caused degradation of forests and barren lands in the province, especially within the past two decades. The proximity of the province to the reservoir's watershed, downtown Istanbul, and the transportation network has accelerated the land-cover changes whose adverse impacts on the reservoir water quality are sensed. It is intended that the data gathered and processed in this study will provide a basis for future sustainable urban planning and management activities.},

Abstract = {The majority of the world's population lives and is employed along its shorelines and is economically dependent upon the activities of its coastal facilities. Development of methods to determine the spatial and temporal extent of changes in the health of coastal ecosystems within sufficient time to take effective management and mitigation actions is essential to effective environmental stewardship. The phytoplankton populations of coastal waters are very sensitive indicators of current environmental health and productivity because their nutritional and water clarity requirements are quite specific. These primary producers are the first step of the marine food web and thus, most of the rest of the coastal ecosystem (water quality, organisms which consume algae directly and their consumers, etc.) relies upon a healthy and balanced phytoplankton community. Routine synoptic in situ monitoring of phytoplankton by labor-intensive ship operations is rapidly being replaced by satellite borne ocean color instruments, such as the ADvanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS)/Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS). However, frequent in situ calibration of data from diverse water masses is necessary to develop and maintain algorithms which correctly relate the data provided by remote sensing instruments to the in situ geochemical parameters.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Refined assessments of the available tidal stream energy resource are required to optimize turbines design and guarantee successful implementations and operations of devices in the marine environment. Investigations primary focused on identifying areas with maximum current speeds. However, further information may be reached by exhibiting (i) resource temporal variability, (ii) superimposed effects of meteo-oceanographic conditions (including especially wind-generated surface-gravity waves), and (iii) potential environmental impacts of operating turbines at the regional (e.g., changes in sediment transport and surrounding seabed features, effects on marine water quality, etc.) and local (wake-wake interactions and energy output) scales. These aspects are here investigated by reviewing a series of research studies dedicated to the Fromveur Strait off western Brittany, a region with strong potential for tidal array development along the coast of France. Particular attention is dedicated to the exploitation of combined in-situ and remote-sensing observations and numerical simulations. Beyond a site specific characterization of the tidal stream energy resource, this review promotes a series of original approaches and analysis methods for turbines optimization, thus complementing technical specifications to secure the key steps of a tidal energy project and promote the growth of a reliable tidal stream energy exploitation.},

Abstract = {The problems of coastal wetlands hazards and management are increasingly apparent in the face of rapid population growth in coastal zones worldwide. This has significantly heightened scientific interest in spatio-temporal analysis of the Global Environmental Change (GEC) effects in the coastal zones, particularly of the sandy, swampy depositional coastal environment characteristic of the humid tropical coasts. Evolved with massive sedimentation of the Holocene period which saw the drowning of the mouths of coastal rivers along the humid tropical coastlines, the Cameroon costal lowlands of interest in this paper describes extensive wetlands from the Limbe area to the west and the Douala area to the east, which today is characterized by a lagoon system. This locality is easily the most rapidly urbanized area in Cameroon witnessing extensive spatial expansion in the Limbe, Tiko and Douala areas, which has provoked certain observable environmental problems with the conversion of the wetlands, The area now suffer in form of poor land reclamation practices, highway construction, impaired water quality, dismal domestic sewage disposal, heavy effluent discharge, subsidence etc. This paper utilizes the opportunity offered by remote sensing tools to monitor the wetlands over space and time to cover regional and micro scales. SLAR (Side Looking Airborne Radar) imagery permits quick and accurate mapping of coastline detail, while coverage of changing patterns of features over space and time is enhanced for management implications.},

Title = {Characterizing and classifying urban watersheds with compositional and structural attributes},

Abstract = {Current land-use classifications used to assess urbanization effects on stream water quality date back to the 1980s when limited information was available to characterize watershed attributes that mediate non-point source pollution. With high resolution remote sensing and widely used GIS tools, there has been a vast increase in the availability and precision of geospatial data of built environments. In this study, we leverage geospatial data to expand the characterization of developed landscapes and create a typology that allows us to better understand the impact of complex developed landscapes across the rural to urban gradient. We assess the ability of the developed landscape typology to reveal patterns in stream water chemistry previously undetected by traditional land-cover based classification. We examine the distribution of land-cover, infrastructure, topography and geology across 3876 National Hydrography Dataset Plus catchments in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, USA. From this dataset, we generate metrics to evaluate the abundance, density and position of landscape features relative to streams, catchment outlets and topographic wetness metrics. While impervious surfaces are a key distinguishing feature of the urban landscape, sanitary infrastructure, population density and geology are better predictors of baseflow stream water chemistry. Unsupervised clustering was used to generate a distinct developed landscape typology based on the expanded, high-resolution landscape feature information. Using stream chemistry data from 37 developed headwater catchments, we compared the baseflow water chemistry grouped by traditional land-cover based classes of urbanization (rural, low, medium and high density) to our composition and structure-based classification (a nine-class typology). The typology based on 22 metrics of developed landscape composition and structure explained over 50\% of the variation in NO3--N, TDN, DOC, Cl-, and Br- concentration, while the ISC-based classification only significantly explained 23\% of the variation in TDN. These results demonstrate the importance of infrastructure, population and geology in defining developed landscapes and improving discrete classes for water management.},

Title = {Estimating Chlorophyll-aof Inland Water Bodies in Greece Based on Landsat Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Assessing chlorophyll-a(Chl-a) pigments in complex inland water systems is of key importance as this parameter constitutes a major ecosystem integrity indicator. In this study, a methodological framework is proposed for quantifying Chl-apigments using Earth observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The first step of the methodology involves the implementation of stepwise multiple regression (MLR) analysis of the available Chl-adataset. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to explore Greek lakes' potential interrelationships based on their Chl-avalues in conjunction with certain criteria: their characteristics (artificial/natural), typology, and climatic type. Additionally, parameters such as seasonal water sampling and the date difference between sampling and satellite overpass are taken into consideration. Next, is implemented a stepwise multiple regression analysis among different groups of cases, formed by the criteria indicated from the PCA itself. This effort aimed at exploring different remote sensing-derived Chl-aalgorithms for various types of lakes. The practical use of the proposed approach was evaluated in a total of 50 lake water bodies (natural and artificial) from 2013-2018, constituting the National Lake Network Monitoring of Greece in the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). All in all, the results evidenced the suitability of Landsat data when used with the proposed technique to estimate log-transformed Chl-a. The proposed scheme resulted in the development of models separately for natural (R= 0.78; RMSE = 1.3 mu g/L) and artificial lakes (R= 0.76; RMSE = 1.29 mu g/L), while the model developed without criteria proved weaker (R= 0.65; RMSE = 1.85 mu g/L) in comparison to the other ones examined. The methodological framework proposed herein can be used as a useful resource toward a continuous monitoring and assessment of lake water quality, supporting sustainable water resources management.},

Title = {Ordinary kriging vs inverse distance weighting: spatial interpolation of the sessile community of Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Information about the distribution and abundance of the habitat-forming sessile organisms in marine ecosystems is of great importance for conservation and natural resource managers. Spatial interpolation methodologies can be useful to generate this information from in situ sampling points, especially in circumstances where remote sensing methodologies cannot be applied due to small-scale spatial variability of the natural communities and low light penetration in the water column. Interpolation methods are widely used in environmental sciences; however, published studies using these methodologies in coral reef science are scarce. We compared the accuracy of the two most commonly used interpolation methods in all disciplines, inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK), to predict the distribution and abundance of hard corals, octocorals, macroalgae, sponges and zoantharians and identify hotspots of these habitat-forming organisms using data sampled at three different spatial scales (5, 10 and 20 m) in Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico. The deeper sandy environments of the leeward and windward regions of Madagascar reef were dominated by macroalgae and seconded by octocorals. However, the shallow rocky environments of the reef crest had the highest richness of habitat-forming groups of organisms; here, we registered high abundances of octocorals and macroalgae, with sponges, Millepora alcicornis and zoantharians dominating in some patches, creating high levels of habitat heterogeneity. IDW and OK generated similar maps of distribution for all the taxa; however, cross-validation tests showed that IDW outperformed OK in the prediction of their abundances. When the sampling distance was at 20 m, both interpolation techniques performed poorly, but as the sampling was done at shorter distances prediction accuracies increased, especially for IDW. OK had higher mean prediction errors and failed to correctly interpolate the highest abundance values measured in situ, except for macroalgae, whereas IDW had lower mean prediction errors and high correlations between predicted and measured values in all cases when sampling was every 5 m. The accurate spatial interpolations created using IDW allowed us to see the spatial variability of each taxa at a biological and spatial resolution that remote sensing would not have been able to produce. Our study sets the basis for further research projects and conservation management in Madagascar reef and encourages similar studies in the region and other parts of the world where remote sensing technologies are not suitable for use.},

Title = {Eutrophication assessment in Pannonian Basin (the case of Ludas Lake Special Nature Reserve and Palic Nature Park)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Agricultural, industrial, and human activities in general threaten water quality, as well as the biotic integrity of aquatic ecosystems. The increased concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) affects high concentrations of chlorophyll (Chl-a) in freshwater ecosystems, which causes the process of eutrophication of the waters of shallow lakes. Eutrophication, as an alarming threat to the global quality of surface waters, affects environmental degradation. This research assesses the risk of eutrophication caused by chemical oxygen demand (COD), TN, TP, Secchi disk (SD), and Chl-a using the trophic level index (TLI) in Palic and Ludas lakes. Both lakes have been nominated as potential Natura 2000 areas in 2021 because they belong to important bird areas, and Ludas Lake has the status of Ramsar site 3YU002. In the research period from 2011 to 2021, the results showed that the lake is in an extremely eutrophic state. Laboratory analyses indicate an increased concentration of Chl-a during autumn. In the paper, the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) was calculated using the Google Earth Engine platform, and the result indicates the loading of the lake throughout the year, with an emphasis on winter, summer, and autumn. By using satellite images and remote sensing, it is possible to determine the most degraded spots, which is a help to the researchers in choosing the places where the samples will be taken and thus act more efficiently on the most endangered parts, as well as reduce the costs of standard in situ methods.},

Abstract = {Lake Taihu, as the important drinking water source of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration and the third largest freshwater lake in China, has experienced serious lake eutrophication and water quality deterioration in the past three decades. Growing scientific, political, and public attention has been given to the water quality of Lake Taihu. This study aimed to conduct a comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of the development, current hotspots, and future directions of Lake Taihu research using a bibliometric analysis of eight well-studied lakes (Lake Taihu, Lake Baikal, Lake Biwa, Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, Lake Superior and Lake Victoria) around the world based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) database. A total of 1582 papers discussing Lake Taihu research were published in 322 journals in the past three decades. However, the first paper about Lake Taihu research was not found in the SCI database until 1989, and there were only zero, one, or two papers each year from 1989 to 1995. There had been rapid development in Lake Taihu research since 1996 and a sharp increase in papers since 2005. A keyword analysis showed that ``sediment,{''} ``eutrophication{''}, ``Microcystis aeruginosa{''}, ``cyanobacterial blooms{''}, and ``remote sensing{''} were the most frequently used keywords of the study subject. Owing to its significant impact on aquatic ecosystems, a crucial emphasis has been placed on climate change recently. In addition, the future focuses of research directions, including (1) environmental effects of physical processes; (2) nutrient cycles and control and ecosystem responses; (3) cyanobacteria bloom monitoring, causes, forecast and management; (4) eutrophication and climate change interactions; and (5) ecosystem degradation mechanism and ecological practice of lake restoration, are presented based on the keyword analysis. Through multidisciplinary fields (physics, chemistry, and biology) cross and synthesis study of Lake Taihu, the development of shallow lake limnology will be largely promoted.},

Abstract = {Abandoned mines are typical areas of soil erosion. Landscape transformation of abandoned mines is an important means to balance the dual objectives of regional ecological restoration and industrial heritage protection, but the secondary development and construction process of mining relics require long-term monitoring with objective scientific indicators and effective assessment of their management effectiveness. This paper takes Tongluo Mountain Mining Park in Chongqing as an example and uses a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on Landsat-8 image data to assess the spatial and temporal differences in the dynamic changes in the ecological and environmental quality of tertiary relic reserves with different degrees of development and protection in the park. Results showed that: (1) The effect of vegetation cover, which can significantly improve soil and water conservation capacity. (2) The RSEI is applicable to the evaluation of the effectiveness of ecological management of mines with a large amount of bare soil areas. (3) The mean value of the RSEI in the region as a whole increased by 0.090, and the mean values of the RSEI in the primary, secondary and tertiary relic reserves increased by 0.121, 0.112 and 0.006, respectively. (4) The increase in the RSEI in the study area is mainly related to the significant decrease in the dryness index (NDBSI) and the increase in the humidity index (WET). The remote sensing ecological index can objectively reflect the difference in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the ecological environment in tertiary relic protection, and this study provides a theoretical reference for the ecological assessment of secondary development-based management under difficult site conditions.},

Abstract = {Water scarcity in the dry season is a vital problem in dryland regions such as northeastern Brazil. Water supplies in these areas often come from numerous reservoirs of various sizes. However, inventory data for these reservoirs is often limited due to the expense and time required for their acquisition via field surveys, particularly in remote areas. Remote sensing techniques provide a valuable alternative to conventional reservoir bathymetric surveys for water resource management. In this study single pass TanDEM-X data acquired in bistatic mode were used to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) in the Madalena catchment, northeastern Brazil. Validation with differential global positioning system (DGPS) data from field measurements indicated an absolute elevation accuracy of approximately 1 m for the TanDEM-X derived DEMs (TDX DEMs). The DEMs derived from TanDEM-X data acquired at low water levels show significant advantages over bathymetric maps derived from field survey, particularly with regard to coverage, evenly distributed measurements and replication of reservoir shape. Furthermore, by mapping the dry reservoir bottoms with TanDEM-X data, TDX DEMs are free of emergent and submerged macrophytes, independent of water depth (e.g. >10 m), water quality and even weather conditions. Thus, the method is superior to other existing bathymetric mapping approaches, particularly for inland water bodies. The proposed approach relies on (nearly) dry reservoir conditions at times of image acquisition and is thus restricted to areas that show considerable water levels variations. However, comparisons between TDX DEM and the bathymetric map derived from field surveys show that the amount of water retained during the dry phase has only marginal impact on the total water volume derivation from TDX DEM. Overall, DEMs generated from bistatic TanDEM-X data acquired in low water periods constitute a useful and efficient data source for deriving reservoir bathymetry and show great potential in large scale application.

Abstract = {In order to provide technical support for effective control, scientific prediction and efficient emergency on water pollution accident in Huaihe River Basin, it is very urgent to introduce water quality model and develop DSS integrated with earliest information technology. A water quantity \& quality model for water environment early warning in large scale river networks with multi-sluices has been established based on cross integration of hydrology, hydrodynamics and water quality. And this model was applied in Huaihe middle river network, which is composed of three 1D modules and two 2D modules: 1D modules for important region of water pollution joint-prevention, Shayinghe River, Guohe River; 2D modules for Lutaizi reach and Benbuzha reach. Based upon water environment early warning model, Huaihe water environment early warning and management system based on WEBGIS\&RIA has been developed adopting J2EE. ArcGIS Server has been selected as the GIS platform, and Google Maps API is applied, which make a geospatial environment coupling local vector data with internet satellite images. Adobe FLEX has been adopted as Rich Internet Application development tool, which balances the system loads better and beautifies the client pages. This system could provide technical support for the Huaihe water environmental protection, including digital information management on water environmental data and decision support for water environment early warning. The core function of digital information management is real-time monitoring of hydrology and water quality on GIS pages coupling with Google satellite images. The water environment early warning is divided into 2 parts: real-time early warning and regulated early warning. And it could support routine warning under the absence of water pollution accident and emergency warning under the presence of water pollution accident.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are significantly threatened by multiple environmental stressors associated with climate change. While there is growing recognition of the importance of interacting stressors on coral reefs, so far this has been primarily limited to in situ studies. Satellite remote sensing has potential for investigating coral reef exposure to multiple environmental stressors at a global scale over multiple years; however, current satellite monitoring is primarily focused on thermal stress. Here we collate nine environmental variables (cloud cover, current, depth, salinity, wind, and four sea surface temperature-based metrics) from readily available satellite datasets using the Google Earth Engine geospatial processing platform. Using ecological and health-based thresholds obtained from the literature, we developed, using fuzzy logic (discontinuous functions), a Reef Environmental Stress Exposure Toolbox (RESET) for monitoring environmental stress exposure at multiple scales. Stress exposure scores for 3157 reefs were generated and mapped globally across 12 coral reef ecosystem regions. RESET was also applied to three case-study reefs, previously well monitored for stress and disturbance using other methods. PCA analysis indicated that depth, current, sea surface temperature (SST) and SST anomaly accounted for the greatest contribution to the variance in environmental stress exposure in these three regions. Depth, degree heating weeks, and SST anomaly were identified as the potential drivers of inter- and intra-region variation in environmental stress exposure. Individual variables were then integrated into a multi-metric index of combined stress exposure which corroborated temporal and spatial differences due to known disturbance events. RESET provides a open access, easily interpretable set of tools and associated indices for monitoring environmental stress exposure on coral reefs, designed to inform conservation and management decisions. As such RESET has broad potential to assist in the monitoring of our increasingly imperilled coral ecosystems, in particular, those that are remote or inaccessible.},

Abstract = {Since reform and opening up to outside world, ever-growing economy and development of urbanization of China have caused expansion of the urban land scale. It's necessary to grasp the information about urban spatial form change, expansion situation and expanding regularity, in order to provide the scientific basis for urban management and planning. The traditional methods, like land supply cumulative method and remote sensing, to get the urban area, existed some defects. Their results always doesn't accord with the reality, and can't reflects the actual size of the urban area. Therefore, we propose a new method, making the best use of remote sensing, the population data, road data and other social economic statistic data. Because urban boundary not only expresses a geographical concept, also a social economic systems. It's inaccurate to describe urban area with only geographic areas. We firstly use remote sensing images, demographic data, road data and other data to produce urban boundary respectively. Then we choose the weight value for each boundary, and in terms of a certain model the ultimate boundary can be obtained by a series of calculations of previous boundaries. To verify the validity of this method, we design a set of experiments and obtained the preliminary results. The results have shown that this method can extract the urban area well and conforms with both the broad and narrow sense. Compared with the traditional methods, it's more real-time, objective and ornamental.},

Abstract = {Many catchments in sub-Saharan Africa are subject to multiple pressures, and addressing only point sources from industry does not resolve more widespread diffuse pollution from sediment and nutrient loads. This paper reports on a preliminary study of nutrient transfers into rivers in two catchments in the industrializing city of Kombolcha, North Central Ethiopia. Sampling of rivers and industrial effluents was done over two sampling periods in the wet season of 2013 and 2014. Catchments boundaries and land use map were generated from remote sensing and ground data. Higher total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were found from sub-catchments with largest agricultural land use, whereas highest total phosphorus (TP) was associated with sub-catchments with hilly landscapes and forest lands. Emissions from brewery and meat processing were rich in nutrients (median TN: 21-44mgL(-1); TP: 20-58mgL(-1)) but contributed on average only 10\% (range 4-80\%) of the TN and 13\% (range 3-25\%) of the TP loads. Nutrient concentrations in the rivers exceeded environmental quality standards for aquatic life protection, irrigation, and livestock water supply. In Ethiopia, more than 85\% of farmers operate on less than 2ha of land, with concomitant pressure for more intensive farming. Land is exclusively owned by the State, reducing a sense of land stewardship. As the City of Kombolcha moves to agricultural intensification and increased industrialization, attention is needed to fill gaps in monitoring of nutrient pollution in rivers and use information to reconcile development with land use and its degradation.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Marine processes are observed with sensors from both the ground and space over large spatio-temporal scales. Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.},

Title = {Riparian and landscape disturbance effects on stream fish community composition in an agriculturally-dominated drainage},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {445-456},
Abstract = {We compared historical stream fish community sampling and remote sensing data from 1993-2011 in an agriculturally-dominated drainage basin to determine the effects of varying levels of riparian and landscape disturbances on fish communities. Stream fish guilds were analyzed with National Land Cover Database and aerial imagery products to quantify disturbance levels at a local and watershed scale. Insectivores and benthic insectivores were associated with intact riparian areas, whereas environmentally tolerant and omnivorous species were found in environments with degraded riparian areas. Riparian disturbances had the greatest effect near the stream (0-10 m), and the effects diminished with increasing distance from the stream. This spatial scale corresponds with those reported in the literature whereby allocthonous inputs and riparian filtering influenced stream fish communities and water quality. The landscape disturbance was not a strong predictor for any fish guild, indicating that local riparian conditions were more biologically meaningful. Considering the rapid rates of land conversion to production agriculture across the midwestern United States, ensuring adequate riparian buffering of streams may help protect specialist aquatic species and their habitat. Given the broad temporal and spatial nature of our data, these results suggest that targeted conservation of the 10-m scale of intact riparian vegetation directly adjacent to streams is a sound practice and should be considered the minimum conservation goal for watershed restoration in low-gradient landscapes historically dominated by agricultural land-use practices.},

Title = {Tracking changes in aquaculture ponds on the China coast using 30 years of Landsat images},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although coastal aquaculture ponds provide high-quality fish protein for billions of people, they are threatened by urbanization, pollution, and climate change. Moreover, colossal aquaculture ponds pose damages such as natural wetland shrinkage and water quality deterioration. However, understanding the trends and drivers of coastal aquaculture ponds on a national scale remains a challenge. In this study, a decision-tree classifier was used to quantify the spatiotemporal distribution of aquaculture ponds over last 30 years in 12 provinces located on the coast of China. Moreover, we analyzed their trends and drivers, including geographical conditions, socioeconomic factors, and development policies. The key results of the study include the following: (1) from 1990 to 2020, the cumulative area and holding area of aquaculture ponds reached 21997.90 km(2) and 9613.66 km(2), representing 3.7-fold and 1.6-fold increase, respectively, than the 1990 values. Based on geographical conditions, most aquaculture ponds tend to be located in coastal plains and bays following the distribution of low-lying land. (2) Influenced by different levels of socioeconomic development and changed policies, the holding area of aquaculture ponds experienced a ``rapidly increasing period{''} from 1990 to 2011, growing by 246 km(2) per year; ``stable period{''} between 2011 and 2017; and ``sharply shrinking period{''} after 2017 declining by 417 km(2)/year. (3) Coastal land reclamation played a critical role in the expansion of aquaculture ponds by cumulatively contributing approximately 22\% of the land resource in the past 30 years. In the future, as a result of increasing land competition, the extent of aquaculture ponds on the China coast tends to decrease continually.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},

Volume = {35},

Pages = {1758-1772},

Abstract = {This paper examined the effects of simulated land cover/land use (LC/LU) change from 2000 to 2030 on nutrient loadings to the Chesapeake Bay. The SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed Attributes (SPARROW) model was used with anticipated watershed-wide LC/LU change from a growth forecast model that provides spatially explicit probabilities of conversion to impervious surface. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loadings estimated to enter the Chesapeake Bay were reduced by 20\% and 19\%, respectively. In general, as development replaced other LC/LUs from 2000 to 2030, TN and TP runoff was significantly reduced by losses of non-point, non-urban source loadings, yields, and land-to-water delivery. The simulation results suggest future changes in landscape composition and configuration at catchment and riparian stream buffer width scales could lower TN and TP runoff to the estuary.

Title = {Application of phosphorus loading models to understand drivers of eutrophication in a complex rural lake-watershed system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},
Number = {A},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Several lakes in southwestern Nova Scotia, Canada have experienced reoccurring algal blooms and possess concentrations of phosphorus (P) that are in the eutrophic to hypereutrophic range (>35 mu g/L). In this study a mass balance modeling approach was used to evaluate the relative contribution of P sources within these watersheds and lakes. Primary sources of P included land runoff, septic systems, agricultural activities including mink fur farming, aquaculture, as well as internal loading. These sources were assessed for three different study years (1983, 2008, and 2017), based on availability of water quality data, and to quantify the relative impact of the mink farming industry as it rapidly expanded during this time period. A novel method to estimate P loads from intensive fur farming operations was developed, using agricultural census, remote sensing, and publicly available spatial data. A suite of simulations were generated, using a steady state mass balance model, to examine lake P concentrations and sources for baseline conditions (no anthropogenic sources), no mink farming, and varying levels of P retention on mink farms (25\%, 50\%, 75\%) scenarios. An additional scenario was also constructed which involved calibrating mink farm P retention coefficients using available water quality data. In the baseline scenario it was predicted that all study lakes would be oligotrophic, indicating that cultural eutrophication of these lakes has occurred. In the no mink farming scenario, it was predicted that all study lakes would be oligotrophic except for Hourglass Lake, which was predicted to be mesotrophic due to inputs from an aquaculture facility. Internal loading of P from lake sediments was also identified as an important potential P loading mechanism, which will likely be exacerbated by climate change. These findings indicate that the P from mink farms is the primary driver of cultural eutrophication in the study lakes, and highlights the need to consider these nutrient sources within watershed management plans. It is recommended that lake remediation efforts continue to focus on reducing P inputs from mink farms, and on controlling P loading from any new anthropogenic development in these watersheds.},

Abstract = {Pollution emissions into the drainage basin have direct impact on surface water quality. These emissions result from human activities that turn into pollution loads when they reach the water bodies, as point or diffuse sources. Their pollution potential depends on the characteristics and quantity of the transported materials. The estimation of pollution loads can assist decision-making in basin management. Knowledge about the potential pollution sources allows for a prioritization of pollution control policies to achieve the desired water quality. Consequently, it helps avoiding problems such as eutrophication of water bodies. The focus of the research described in this study is related to phosphorus emissions into river basins. The study area is the upper Iguazu basin that lies in the northeast region of the State of Parana, Brazil, covering about 2,965 km(2) and around 4 million inhabitants live concentrated on just 16\% of its area. The MoRE (Modeling of Regionalized Emissions) model was used to estimate phosphorus emissions. MoRE is a model that uses empirical approaches to model processes in analytical units, capable of using spatially distributed parameters, covering both, emissions from point sources as well as non-point sources. In order to model the processes, the basin was divided into 152 analytical units with an average size of 20 km(2). Available data was organized in a GIS environment. Using e.g. layers of precipitation, the Digital Terrain Model from a 1: 10000 scale map as well as soils and land cover, which were derived from remote sensing imagery. Further data is used, such as point pollution discharges and statistical socio-economic data. The model shows that one of the main pollution sources in the upper Iguazu basin is the domestic sewage that enters the river as point source (effluents of treatment stations) and/or as diffuse pollution, caused by failures of sanitary sewer systems or clandestine sewer discharges, accounting for about 56\% of the emissions. Second significant shares of emissions come from direct runoff or groundwater, being responsible for 32\% of the total emissions. Finally, agricultural erosion and industry pathways represent 12\% of emissions. This study shows that MoRE is capable of producing valid emission calculation on a relatively reduced input data basis.},

Abstract = {Wetland is of interest to water resource management as a natural vegetation filter for improving water quality in fresh water marshes.  Landsat Multispectral Scanner Systems (MSS) data for 9 Feb.  1976 were analyzed to classify spectrally unique wetland areas within the Econlockhatchee (Econ) River Basin, FL.  The results showed that the scatter diagram of Band 4 (0.5-0.6-mu-m) - Band 5 (0.6-0.7-mu-m) can be used to identify most efficiently the wetland areas within the Econ basin.  Both the zoom transfer scope and the geographic information system (GIS) were demonstrated to be very useful tools for wetland assessment from Landsat data.  The major advantages of satellite data include the availability of new data for periodic updating of wetland information, and potential of higher-resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT imagery for achieving vegetation species identification and density analysis in the future.},

Abstract = {Massive and rapidly increasing use of plastics in modern society with short average use times and poor reuse and recycling options has resulted in a global threat with potentially devastating impacts on human and non-human life. Knowledge on the impacts of plastics in all forms on the planetary life-support system is rapidly accumulating and it underlines the scale of the risk humanity is taking. While quantitative information on production and use of plastics is to a large extent available, the fate of plastics discarded or leaked into the environment is highly uncertain. In particular, knowledge of how much plastic at different scales down to micro and nano levels reaches the ocean and the trajectories of the plastic in the ocean remain poorly known. Based on the mounting evidence, the United Nations have recognized the threat and are coordinating the many efforts to limit the amount of plastic that enters the environment uncontrolled. However, the Earth observation community so far has not managed to establish a global tracking and information system that would provide quantitative information on where and how plastics move in the ocean and allow the identification of the points where marine plastic pollution could be reduced most effectively. There are a number of independent projects focused on better monitoring plastics in the environment, including the ocean. In particular, projects in the EU, USA, and Japan have participated in working groups initiated by UN Environment. These projects are focusing on the monitoring of marine litter and plastics, management of information and knowledge, risks assessments, exploitation of opportunities and synergies, and, as far as possible, estimation of relevant costs and benefits. Measurements proposed include satellite and airborne remote sensing, surface and underwater in situ measurements, and crowd-sourcing observations. The need for extensive data processing and the use of deep learning techniques is acknowledged. The sensors considered range from multi- and hyperspectral sensing or other optical sensing to radar imaging aiming at a wide geo-spatial coverage. There is a need to develop global coordination mechanisms to ensure that societal knowledge needs are met and decisions on reducing plastic pollution in the ocean are informed by this knowledge. OES in collaboration with the Blue Planet Initiative of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the UN environment, is leading an initiative aiming at this coordination.},

Title = {Nitrogen enrichment, altered stoichiometry, and coral reef decline at Looe Key, Florida Keys, USA: a 3-decade study},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Increased loadings of nitrogen (N) from fertilizers, top soil, sewage, and atmospheric deposition are important drivers of eutrophication in coastal waters globally. Monitoring seawater and macroalgae can reveal long-term changes in N and phosphorus (P) availability and N:P stoichiometry that are critical to understanding the global crisis of coral reef decline. Analysis of a unique 3-decade data set for Looe Key reef, located offshore the lower Florida Keys, showed increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), chlorophyll a, DIN:soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) ratios, as well as higher tissue C:P and N:P ratios in macroalgae during the early 1990s. These data, combined with remote sensing and nutrient monitoring between the Everglades and Looe Key, indicated that the significant DIN enrichment between 1991 and 1995 at Looe Key coincided with increased Everglades runoff, which drains agricultural and urban areas extending north to Orlando, Florida. This resulted in increased P limitation of reef primary producers that can cause metabolic stress in stony corals. Outbreaks of stony coral disease, bleaching, and mortality between 1995 and 2000 followed DIN enrichment, algal blooms, and increased DIN:SRP ratios, suggesting that eutrophication interacted with other factors causing coral reef decline at Looe Key. Although water temperatures at Looe Key exceeded the 30.5 degrees C bleaching threshold repeatedly over the 3-decade study, the three mass bleaching events occurred only when DIN:SRP ratios increased following heavy rainfall and increased Everglades runoff. Theseresults suggest that Everglades discharges, in conjunction with local nutrient sources, contributed to DIN enrichment, eutrophication, and increased N:P ratios at Looe Key, exacerbating P limitation, coral stress and decline. Improved management of water quality at the local and regional levels could moderate N inputs and maintain more balanced N:P stoichiometry, thereby reducing the risk of coral bleaching, disease, and mortality under the current level of temperature stress.},

Abstract = {Uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) are becoming very popular in the domain of water resource mapping and management (WRMM). Being a cheaper and quicker option capable of providing high temporal and spatial resolution data, UAS has become a much sought-after platform for remote sensing. Still, their application in the field is in its early stage. This paper encompasses basic concepts of UAS, different payloads and sensor technologies available, various methodologies for its application in WRMM, different software available, and challenges associated with them, thus presenting a comprehensive review of multiple applications of UAS in different sub-domains of water resources. From cryosphere, rivers and lakes, and coastal areas to sub-surface water, as well as from water quality to wastewater management, the authors have discussed various applications of uncrewed aerial vehicles. At the end of the paper, the authors have identified the issues posing problems in the wider implementation of UAS in WRMM. Also, the future scope of the UAS in WRMM has been discussed.},

Abstract = {Nuisance blue-green algal blooms contribute to aesthetic degradation of water resources by means of accelerated eutrophication, taste and odor problems, and the production of toxins that can have serious adverse human health effects. Current field-based methods for detecting blooms are costly and time consuming, delaying management decisions. Methods have been developed for estimating phycocyanin concentration, the accessory pigment unique to freshwater blue-green algae, in productive inland water. By employing the known optical properties of phycocyanin, researchers have evaluated the utility of field-collected spectral response patterns for determining concentrations of phycocyanin pigments and ultimately blue-green algal abundance. The purpose of this research was to evaluate field spectroscopy as a rapid cyanobacteria bloom assessment method. In-situ field reflectance spectra were collected at 54 sampling sites on two turbid reservoirs on September 6th and 7th in Indianapolis, Indiana using ASD Fieldspec (UV/VNIR) spectroradiometers. Surface water samples were analyzed for in-vitro pigment concentrations and other physical and chemical water quality parameters. Semi-empirical algorithms by Simis et al. {[}Simis, S., Peters, S., Gons, H. (2005). Remote sensing of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin in turbid inland water. American Society of Limnology and Oceanography 50(11): 237-245] were applied to the field spectra to predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin absorption at 665 nm and 620 nm, respectively. For estimation of phycocyanin concentration, a specific absorption coefficient of 0.0070 m(2) mg PC-1 for phycocyanin at 620 nm, a(PC){*} (620), was employed, yielding an r(2) value of 0.85 (n=48, p<0.0001), mean relative residual value of 0.51 (sigma=1.41) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.54 ppb. Results suggest this algorithm could be a robust model for estimating phycocyanin. Error is highest in water with phycocyanin concentrations of less than 10 ppb and where phycocyanin abundance is low relative to chlorophyll a. A strong correlation between measured phycocyanin concentrations and biovolume measurements of cyanobacteria was also observed (r=0.89), while a weaker relationship (r=0.66) resulted between chlorophyll a concentration and cyanobacterial biovolume.

Abstract = {Aiming at the increasingly serious pollution and ecological damage in mining cites, environmental information urgently are urgently needed to provide basis and decision-making for the economic transit ion of mining cites. This article describes main environmental problems existing in mining cites, as well as ways of monitoring these major environmental problems, such as the Landsat TM images are used in Land use dynamic monitoring, High Spectrum Images are used in the extracted vegetation monitoring, and the water quality change is monitored by the way of NOAA / AVHRR. Particularly, the effectual way of the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) landslides monitoring is introduced, which is well applied to the opencast mine of Haizhou and Fushun in China with this technology. Differential interferometry using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a powerful technology for detecting surface deformation of ground. Surface deformation can be analyzed from different phase of micro-wave between two observed data by SAR. The accuracy of measurement is less than plus-and-minus 1 cm. Achieved research results will provide early warning of environment disasters, rapid \& real-time information and interpretation means for the mining cites.},

Abstract = {Urban stormwater runoff is the primary source of many pollutants to Santa Monica Bay, but its monitoring and modeling is inherently difficult and often requires land use information as an intermediate process. Many approaches have been developed to estimate stormwater pollutant loading from land use. This research investigates an alternative approach, which estimates stormwater pollutant loadings directly from satellite imagery. We proposed a Bayesian network approach to classify a Landsat ETM+ image of the Marina del Rey area in the Santa Monica Bay watershed. Eight water quality parameters were examined, including: total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, nutrients, heavy metals, and oil and grease. The pollutant loads for each parameter were classified into six levels: low, medium low, medium high, high, and very high. The results provided spatial very low, estimates of each pollutant load as thematic maps from which the greatest pollutant loading areas were identified. These results may be useful in developing best management strategies for stormwater pollution at regional and global scales and in establishing total maximum daily loads in the watershed. The approach can also be used for areas without ground-survey land use data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With regard to a multi-dimensional and multi-facetted implementation of the vision of a Digital Earth, capabilities to combine and analyze heterogeneous spatial data sources on the web are becoming increasingly important. In this article, an online system is conceptualized and implemented to facilitate spatial data analysis and decision making specifically for environmental applications. It supports a dynamic search and binding of suitable geoprocessing functionality with respect to the given input data and target description. Geoprocessing patterns are used to create an application-oriented abstraction layer on top of generic geoprocessing services available on the web. As an application scenario the determination and quality assessment for water body structures is taken. For this use case authoritative data, remote sensing imagery and citizen science data gets combined to gain a comprehensive picture of the various spatial, temporal and thematic aspects influencing the quality of inland waters. The prototypical implementation makes use of open standards to facilitate the integration with existing spatial data infrastructures.},

A May 15, 1990 Landsat TM scene (path 177, Row 38) was used to develop a local `village-scale' environmental risk model based on higher resolution satellite sensor data (30 m picture element size at earth surface). Four of ten classes derived from a tasseled cap (Tcap) transformation of the Landsat TM scene were shown to be significantly related to a 5-year Schistosoma mansoni prevalence database from the Ministry of Health. A risk model was developed based on dT and the proportional area of the four Tcap classes in 5 km(2) buffer zones centered on rural health unit (RHU) reporting units. Available historical data on S. mansoni and its snail host Biomphalaria alexandrina as well as recent field collected data were gathered and incorporated as separate themes. Model validation was done using data collected on snail population bionomics-infection rates, water quality, underground water table and cercariometry at 13 hydrologically representative sites. The role of soil type. water table and water quality was studied at 79 of 154 rural health unit sites. The model permitted retrieval of relevant data by RHU point location. For the first time in Egypt. the Kafr El-Sheikh GIS schistosoma prediction model can support MOH efforts to make more accurate control program decisions based on environmental predilection sites of endemic Schistosomiasis mansoni.

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it demonstrates how monitoring stations that collect water quality data can be situated globally via satellite data from Google Earth. Important technical issues such as interoperability and Open Web Services are discussed in this context. Second, it illustrates how researchers at local levels can benefit from this global technology. The discussion draws from the online water quality database, GEMStat, which contains water quality data and sediment load calculations from around the world. These types of data, collected locally, can be shown to bear global implications through Internet technology. GEMStat has been expanded to include Open Web Services to enable interoperability with other online databases. Third, it illustrate an international framework of cooperation through GEMS{[}Water Japan, introducing onsite monitoring activities as well as management of international river basin (Mekong La Plata). Considerations for future application framework are presented in conclusion. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Increased loads of land-based pollutants through river plumes are a major threat to the coastal water quality, ecosystems and sanitary heath. Identifying the coastal areas impacted by potentially polluted freshwaters is necessary to inform management policies and prevent degradation of the coastal environment. This study presents the first monitoring of the Adour River turbid plume (south-eastern Bay of Biscay, France) using multi-annual MODIS data. Satellite data are processed using a regional algorithm that allows quantifying and mapping suspended matter in coastal waters. The results are used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the Adour River turbid plume and to identify the risk of exposure of coastal ecosystems to the turbid plume waters. Changes in river plume orientation and spatial extent as well as suspended matter discharged through the river are correlated to the main hydro-climatic forcings acting in the south-eastern Bay of Biscay. The Adour River turbid plume is shown to be a highly reactive system mainly controlled by the river discharge rates and modulated by the wind changes. Despite the relatively small size of the Adour River, the Adour River turbid plume can have a non-negligible impact on the water quality of the southern Bay of Biscay and the MSM and associated contaminants/nutrients transported within the Adour turbid river plume have the potential to be disseminated far away along the northern shoreline or offshore. The main areas of influence of the river plume are defined over multi-annual (3 years) and seasonal periods. The results presented in this study show the potential of 250-m MODIS images to monitor small river plumes systems and support management and assessment of the water quality in the south-eastern Bay of Biscay.

Title = {An Overview of Flood Concepts, Challenges, and Future Directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This review provides a broad overview of the current state of flood research, current challenges, and future directions. Beginning with a discussion of flood-generating mechanisms, the review synthesizes the literature on flood forecasting, multivariate and nonstationary flood frequency analysis, urban flooding, and the remote sensing of floods. Challenges and future flood research directions are outlined and highlight emerging topics where more work is needed to help mitigate flood risks. It is anticipated that the future urban systems will likely have more significant flood risk due to the compounding effects of continued climate change and land-use intensification. The timely prediction of urban floods, quantification of the socioeconomic impacts of flooding, and developing mitigation strategies will continue to be challenging. There is a need to bridge the scales between model capabilities and end-user needs by integrating multiscale models, stakeholder input, and social and citizen science input for flood monitoring, mapping, and dissemination. Although much progress has been made in using remote sensing for flood applications, recent and upcoming Earth Observations provide excellent potential to unlock additional benefits for flood applications. The flood community can benefit from more downscaled, as well as ensemble scenarios that consider climate and land-use changes. Efforts are also needed for data assimilation approaches, especially to ingest local, citizen, and social media data. Also needed are enhanced capabilities to model compound hazards and assess as well as help reduce social vulnerability and impacts. The dynamic and complex interactions between climate, societal change, watershed processes, and human factors often confronted with deep uncertainty highlights the need for transdisciplinary research between science, policymakers, and stakeholders to reduce flood risk and social vulnerability.

Title = {Reviews and Syntheses: optical sampling of the flux tower footprint},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {14},
Pages = {4509-4523},
Abstract = {The purpose of this review is to address the reasons and methods for conducting optical remote sensing within the flux tower footprint. Fundamental principles and conclusions gleaned from over 2 decades of proximal remote sensing at flux tower sites are reviewed. The organizing framework used here is the light-use efficiency (LUE) model, both because it is widely used, and because it provides a useful theoretical construct for integrating optical remote sensing with flux measurements. Multiple ways of driving this model, ranging from meteorological measurements to remote sensing, have emerged in recent years, making it a convenient conceptual framework for comparative experimental studies. New interpretations of established optical sampling methods, including the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), are discussed within the context of the LUE model. Multiscale analysis across temporal and spatial axes is a central theme because such scaling can provide links between ecophysiological mechanisms detectable at the level of individual organisms and broad patterns emerging at larger scales, enabling evaluation of emergent properties and extrapolation to the flux footprint and beyond. Proper analysis of the sampling scale requires an awareness of sampling context that is often essential to the proper interpretation of optical signals. Additionally, the concept of optical types, vegetation exhibiting contrasting optical behavior in time and space, is explored as a way to frame our understanding of the controls on surface-atmosphere fluxes. Complementary normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and PRI patterns across ecosystems are offered as an example of this hypothesis, with the LUE model and light-response curve providing an integrating framework. I conclude that experimental approaches allowing systematic exploration of plant optical behavior in the context of the flux tower network provides a unique way to improve our understanding of environmental constraints and ecophysiological function. In addition to an enhanced mechanistic understanding of ecosystem processes, this integration of remote sensing with flux measurements offers many rich opportunities for upscaling, satellite validation, and informing practical management objectives ranging from assessing ecosystem health and productivity to quantifying biospheric carbon sequestration.},

Title = {Environmental Factors Controlling the Distribution of Symbiodinium Harboured by the Coral Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {Background: The Symbiodinium community associated with scleractinian corals is widely considered to be shaped by seawater temperature, as the coral's upper temperature tolerance is largely contingent on the Symbiodinium types harboured. Few studies have challenged this paradigm as knowledge of other environmental drivers on the distribution of Symbiodinium is limited. Here, we examine the influence of a range of environmental variables on the distribution of Symbiodinium associated with Acropora millepora collected from 47 coral reefs spanning 1,400 km on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Methodology/Principal Findings: The environmental data included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data at 1 km spatial resolution from which a number of sea surface temperature (SST) and water quality metrics were derived. In addition, the carbonate and mud composition of sediments were incorporated into the analysis along with in situ water quality samples for a subset of locations. Analyses were conducted at three spatio-temporal scales {[}GBR (regional-scale), Whitsunday Islands (local-scale) and Keppel Islands/Trunk Reef (temporal)] to examine the effects of scale on the distribution patterns. While SST metrics were important drivers of the distribution of Symbiodinium types at regional and temporal scales, our results demonstrate that spatial variability in water quality correlates significantly with Symbiodinium distribution at local scales. Background levels of Symbiodinium types were greatest at turbid inshore locations of the Whitsunday Islands where SST predictors were not as important. This was not the case at regional scales where combinations of mud and carbonate sediment content coupled with SST anomalies and mean summer SST explained 51.3\% of the variation in dominant Symbiodinium communities. Conclusions/Significance: Reef corals may respond to global-scale stressors such as climate change through changes in their resident symbiont communities, however, management of local-scale stressors such as altered water quality is also necessary for maintenance of coral-Symbiodinium associations.},

Journal = {REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study conducts the first systematic literature review of climate change adaptation in aquaculture. We address three specific questions: (i) What is aquaculture adapting to? (ii) How is aquaculture adapting? and (iii) What research gaps need to be addressed? We identify, characterise and examine case studies published between 1990 and 2018 that lie at the intersection of the domains of climate change, adaptation and aquaculture. The main areas of documented climate change impacts relate to extreme events and the general impacts of climate change on the aquaculture sector. Three categories of adaptation to climate change are identified: coping mechanisms at the local level (e.g. water quality management techniques), multilevel adaptive strategies (e.g. changing culture practices) and management approaches (e.g. adaptation planning, community-based adaptation). We identify four potential areas for future research: research on inland aquaculture adaptation; studies at the household level; whether different groups of aquaculture farmers (e.g. indigenous people) face and adapt differently to climate change; and the use of GIS and remote sensing as cost-effective tools for developing adaptation strategies and responses. The study brings essential practical and theoretical insights to the aquaculture industry as well as to climate change adaptation research across the globe.},

Title = {Coral population trajectories, increased disturbance and management intervention: a sensitivity analysis},

Abstract = {Coral reefs distant from human population were sampled in the Red Sea and one-third showed degradation by predator outbreaks (crown-of-thorns-starfish=COTS observed in all regions in all years) or bleaching (1998, 2010). Models were built to assess future trajectories. They assumed variable coral types (slow/fast growing), disturbance frequencies (5,10,20years), mortality (equal or not), and connectivity (un/connected to un/disturbed community). Known disturbances were used to parameterize models. Present and future disturbances were estimated from remote-sensing chlorophyll and temperature data. Simulations and sensitivity analysis suggest community resilience at >20-year disturbance frequency, but degradation at higher frequency. Trajectories move from fast-grower to slow-grower dominance at intermediate disturbance frequency, then again to fast-grower dominance. A similar succession was observed in the field: Acropora to Porites to Stylophora/Pocillopora dominance on shallow reefs, and a transition from large poritids to small faviids on deep reefs. Synthesis and application: Even distant reefs are impacted by global changes. COTS impacts and bleaching were key driver of coral degradation, coral population decline could be reduced if these outbreaks and bleaching susceptibility were managed by maintaining water quality and by other interventions. Just leaving reefs alone, seems no longer a satisfactory option.},

Abstract = {Wetlands which are the planet's most important ecosystem have high scientific research -value and will bring us both social and economic benefits. However, duing to various natural and man made factors, more and more wetlands have converted to agricultural land and urban land. Now, the changes in wetlands' area and quantity have caused public's widespread concern. And wetland's management and protection will benefit from the improvement of the wetland information abstraction's precision. Improving the classification precision of the RS image is a difficult problem because of the small scale of remote sensing images. This paper which is about the wetland remote sensing images extraction is based on the LANDSAT ETM remote sensing data, and the result of the Wavelet Packet reconstruction will be used as the sample set of the Active Support Vector Machine.At the end of this paper, a comparative analysis of the experimental results will show between the single classification (SVM, BPNN) method and the solution which is proposed in this article. This method can be proved to obtain very good classification results through many experiments on remote sensing image classification I've done. Experimental results show that this algorithm's classification accuracy is better than the single classification's. Moreover, in the active learning process, the bad influence of the image's isolated and intersection points on the classification is avoided, and the number of training samples are reduced greatly.},

Title = {Tracking historical chlorophyll-a change in the guanting reservoir, Northern China, based on landsat series inter-sensor normalization},

Abstract = {The Guanting Reservoir supplied drinking water to Beijing until 1997, following which the water quality of the reservoir deteriorated. The chlorophyll-a concentration (C (chl-a )) of water is an important indicator of eutrophication. Therefore, changes in the C (chl-a ) of the Guanting Reservoir should be monitored and analysed. For more than 30 years, the monitoring of C (chl-a ) in inland waterbodies has only been possible using the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). However, there are data consistency problems in monitoring C (chl-a ) using these sensors. To address this issue, this study utilized inter-sensor normalization models of the different sensors and a unified C (chl-a ) estimation model for Landsat series data with a long time span. After inter-sensor normalization, the mean relative error (MRE) of remote sensing reflectance (R (rs)) between OLI and TM/ETM+ was corrected to 1-5\%. The unified model of C (chl-a ) estimation employed the normalized ratio index of blue R (B) and near-infrared R (NIR) remote sensing reflectance: (R (NIR) - R (B)): (R (NIR) + R (B)). The MRE for estimating C (chl-a ) was 25.7\% and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 5.65 mg m(-3). The C (chl-a ) of the Guanting Reservoir was then estimated for years between 1985 and 2019. During this time, C (chl-a ) had a distinct seasonal distribution trend; the annual changes go through four stages, and each period shows different change characteristics. This study is the first to systematically understand the history of chlorophyll-a changes in the Guanting Reservoir over the past 30 years and provides references data for its eutrophication process and management.},

Abstract = {Large terrestrial consumers have direct and indirect effects on forest ecosystem function, but few studies have investigated the impacts of terrestrial consumers on freshwater ecosystems. In the Cape Breton Highlands of Nova Scotia, browsing by hyper-abundant moose following a spruce budworm outbreak has transformed boreal forest into grasslands. We conducted a field study to investigate the potential for cross-ecosystem effects of hyper-abundant moose following budworm outbreak on small boreal stream ecosystem structure and function. With our field study, we tested the prediction that watersheds with higher levels of moose-mediated grasslands in their sub-basin would have higher stream temperatures, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate abundances. While our data supported several of our predictions pertaining to moose impacts on the abiotic variables (i.e. temperature range, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity) we found evidence of variable moose impacts on the benthic community. Specifically, we observed lower relative abundance of predatory invertebrates in streams with high moose impacts compared to streams with low moose impacts in their watersheds but no evidence of moose impacts on the relative abundance of shredders, filterers, gatherers, and grazers. This empirical study fills a key gap in our understanding of spatial ecosystem ecology by providing insight into the effects of large terrestrial consumers across ecosystem boundaries with potential implications for landscape-scale management of hyper-abundant ungulates. Given the broad availability and improvement in remote sensing technology, the novel integration of remote sensing and field studies employed here may provide a roadmap for future studies of meta-ecosystem dynamics.},

Title = {Investigation on River Thermal Regime under Dam Influence by Integrating Remote Sensing and Water Temperature Model},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {River water temperature (RWT), a primary parameter for hydrological and ecological processes, is influenced by both climate change and anthropogenic intervention. Studies on such influences have been severely restricted due to the scarcity of river temperature data. This paper proposed a three-stage method to obtain long-term daily water temperature for rivers and river-type reservoirs by integrating remote sensing technique and river water temperature modelling. The proposed three-stage method was applied to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and validated against in situ measured RWTs in the two study sites, Cuntan and Huanglingmiao. The result showed improvements in the method: the quadrate window selection and RWT correction jointly reduce RMSE from 1.8 to 0.9 degrees C in Cuntan and from 2.1 to 1.2 degrees C in Huanglingmiao. As a whole, the estimated daily RWT has a consistent RMSE of 1.1-1.9 degrees C. Meanwhile, by analysing the Landsat-derived daily RWT, we demonstrated that the TGR had a significant impact on the outflow's thermal regime. At the downstream reach of TGR, an apparent increase in RWT in the cold season and interannual thermal regime delay compared to inflow were found with the increasing water level after the dam construction. All the results and analyses indicate that the proposed three-stage method could be applied to obtain long time series of daily RWT and provide a promising approach to qualitatively analyse RWT variation in the poorly gauged catchment for river water quality monitoring and management.},

Abstract = {Monitoring mine waste from sulfide deposits by hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to predict surface water quality by quantitatively estimating acid drainage and metal contamination on a yearly basis. In addition, analysis of the mineralogy of surface crusts rich in soluble salts can provide a record of annual humidity and temperature. In fact, temporal monitoring of salt efflorescence from mine wastes at a mine site in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (Huelva, Spain) has been achieved using hyperspectral airborne Hymap data. Furthermore, climate variability estimates are possible based on oxidation stages derived from well-known sequences of minerals, by tracing sulfide oxidation intensity using archive spectral libraries. Thus, airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data can be used to provide a short-term record of climate change, and represent a useful set of tools for assessing environmental geoindicators in semi-arid areas. Spectral and geomorphological indicators can be monitored on a regular basis through image processing, supported by field and laboratory spectral data. In fact, hyperspectral image analysis is one of the methods selected by the Joint Research Centre of the European Community (Ispra, Italy) to study abandoned mine sites, in order to assess the enforcement of the European Mine Waste Directive (2006/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 March 2006) on the management of waste from extractive industries (Official Journal of the European Union, 11 April 2006). The pyrite belt in Andalucia has been selected as one of the core mission test sites for the PECOMINES II program (Cracow, November 2005), using imaging spectroscopy; and this technique is expected to be implemented as a monitoring tool by the Environmental Net of Andalucia (REDIAM, Junta de Andalucia, Spain).},

Abstract = {Integration of geospatial techniques (remote sensing and geographical information system) for the identification of groundwater potential has become an important tool in evaluating, monitoring and conserving groundwater resources. Effective utilization of groundwater resources has become important due to changing climatic scenario. Hence, estimating the zones of potential groundwater recharge is extremely important for the protection and management of water quality of groundwater systems. In this study, Rambiara river basin, southern-eastern part of Kashmir valley, was examined to assess its groundwater resource potential. Geospatial techniques were used to assimilate five causative factors: lithology/geology, land useand land cover, lineaments, drainage, and slope. The factor weight contributing to the groundwater recharge was acquired using satellite image data, lithological/geological maps, and a land use/land cover database followed by field validations. Based on the results obtained, it was observed that the premier recharge potential zones are located down the slope of the river basin due to the dominance of alluvium and agricultural land. Hard rock lithology located towards upstream areas of the basin allows less water to infiltrate.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are critical components of most ecosystems, providing a broad array of services including support for biodiversity, enhancement of water quality and flood abatement. In spite of their ecological importance, wetlands have been degraded and lost at alarming rates. In the Rainwater Basin (RWB) of south-central Nebraska, an internationally significant staging area for migratory water birds, the adoption of geographic information system (GIS) technology has been critical to managing wetlands. Efforts to employ GIS began with assemblage of dozens of geospatial datasets including digital elevation models, soils data, digital orthophotography, historic aerial photography and land ownership data. Land use and land cover data, which did not exist, were developed using satellite remote sensing. Subsequently, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was implemented via GIS to assess how sediment was impacting wetlands. All geospatial data, RUSLE modeling results, metadata and documentation were made available on a WWW site designed to facilitate both data download and mapping. During the past decade the RWB has developed an independent, robust and forward-looking program to exploit GIS and related technologies. Many new and improved datasets, including LiDAR data, have been developed, and increasingly sophisticated GIS-based models have been implemented for decision support. Examples includes models to establish priorities for wetlands management, to facilitate evaluation of eligibility of candidate sites for enrollment in programs such as the USDA Wetlands Reserve Program, and to assess the RWB landscape's capacity to provide food energy for migrating waterfowl.},

Abstract = {Pollution of freshwater resources is gaining global attention due to increasing freshwater stress and scarcity. This study assessed land use and land cover changes (LULCC) in the Nawuni Catchment of the White Volta Basin and how the change affects water quality in the area. Satellite images from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational land imager of the Nawuni Catchment of the White Volta Basin were acquired and used for this study. These images were analysed to ascertain the influence of land use and land cover changes on water quality parameters such as turbidity, ammonia and total coliform counts for a 10-year period (2007 to 2017). The results of LULCC revealed an increased expanse of grassland/farmland (4.1\%), settlement (0.1\%), bare land (9.4\%) and closed savannah (1.2\%), whilst opened savannah (14.7\%) and water body (0.1\%) recorded a decreasing trend. The study showed an increase in the levels of turbidity and ammonia and a decrease in total coliforms over the study period (2007 to 2017). The study also revealed a positive relationship between LULC categories and water quality parameters, implying that LULCC contribute to the change in water quality in the area. The study therefore recommends frequent water quality monitoring and LULC planning and management to curb pollution of the river basin.},

Abstract = {Soil salinization is one of the significant phenomena accelerating land degradation processes, which in turn cause loss of soil productivity, reduction in biomass production and human health implications. Due to high spatial and temporal variability of soil salinity, mapping and tracking its changes is an essential issue for anticipating natural disasters like desertification and for mitigating severe economic and social consequences in especially arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The main objective of this study is to review the most recent remote sensing applications for soil salinity assessment via various multispectral data such as LANDSAT, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT, IKONOS, Quick Bird and the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) series of satellites, as well as hyperspectral data such as HuanJing-Hyper Spectral Imager (HJ-HSI) and Hyperion Earth-Observing 1 (EO-1). Furthermore, utility of recent remote sensing analysing techniques and methods including linear spectral unmixing, Decision-Tree Analysis (DTA), supervised maximum likelihood classification, principal components analysis, inverted Gaussian function, partial least square regression technique and regression kriging approaches are discussed. Examples of spatio-temporal changes in salt affected Mediterranean soils are referred. In addition, various spectral bands which are sensitive to soil salinity for each of the multispectral data are introduced. Besides, details are given on the generation of salinity and vegetation indices to achieve the most significant correlation with ground electrical conductivity values by means of combining appropriate spectral bands with special focus on the Mediterranean countries.},

Abstract = {The Loess Plateau is a typical ecologically sensitive area that can easily be perturbed by the effects of human activities and global climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to monitor the environmental quality in the LP quickly and accurately. To reveal the spatio-temporal changes in environmental quality in the LP from 2000 to 2020, we used the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products on the Google Earth Engine platform and constructed the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) through principal component analysis (PCA). Then, Sen-Mann-Kendall methods were applied to determine the changing trend of the environmental quality of the LP. Finally, natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the environmental quality were probed using a geographical detector model. The results showed that: (1) the average RSEI values in 2000, 2010 and 2020 were 0.396, 0.468 and 0.511, respectively, displaying an upward trend from 2000 to 2020, with a growth rate of 0.005 year(-1). The overall environment quality was moderate (0.4-0.6). (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the environmental quality was excellent in the southeast and poor in the northwest of the LP. The areas with improved environmental quality (84.51\%) were located in all the counties, whereas the areas with degraded environmental quality (8.11\%) occurred in the north and southeast of the study area. (3) Greenness, heat, wetness, dryness and land use types were prominent factors affecting RSEI throughout the study period; additionally, the total industrial gross domestic product showed a growing influence. The contribution of multi-factor interaction was stronger than that of single factors. The results will provide a reference and a new research perspective for local environmental protection and regional planning.},

Abstract = {Reliable, accurate, and timely information about oceans is important for many applications, including water resource management, hydrological cycle monitoring, environmental studies, agricultural and ecosystem health applications, economy, and the overall health of the environment. In this regard, remote sensing (RS) systems offer exceptional advantages for mapping and monitoring various oceanographic parameters with acceptable temporal and spatial resolutions over the oceans and coastal areas. So far, different methods have been developed to study oceans using various RS systems. This urges the necessity of having review studies that comprehensively discuss various RS systems, including passive and active sensors, and their advantages and limitations for ocean applications. In this article, the goal is to review most RS systems and approaches that have been worked on marine applications. This review paper is divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to the passive RS systems for ocean studies. As such, four primary passive systems, including optical, thermal infrared radiometers, microwave radiometers, and Global Navigation Satellite Systems, are comprehensively discussed. Additionally, this article summarizes the main passive RS sensors and satellites, which have been utilized for different oceanographic applications. Finally, various oceanographic parameters, which can be retrieved from the data acquired by passive RS systems, along with the corresponding methods, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Natural water level fluctuations have associated effects on water quality and resident aquatic communities, although their impacts are magnified if the dams have other non-seasonal designated multiple uses. Research demonstrates that excessive water level fluctuations impair ecosystem functioning, ultimately leading to shifts between clear-water and turbid states in shallow lakes. However, these data lack for Manjirenji Dam in Zimbabwe, thus hampering efforts towards effective freshwater resources management in the shallow reservoir. This study analyzed water levels and their fluctuations, and assessed the effects of climatic factors and catchment dynamics using a combination of historical and remote sensed data for the shallow Manjirenji Dam in Zimbabwe. Time series and multiple regression analysis were used to determine water level trends, and the influence of catchment and climatic components in Manjirenji Dam. Lake levels have increased since construction, though their non-significant seasonal variation in the Manjirenji Dam reflects the overlapping effects of catchment and climatic variables. Despite the inferred high stability and resilience, the high fluctuation widths expose the dam to hydrodynamic and climate shocks which have major ecological and conservation implications. A climate change based integrated water resources management approach is necessary for sustainable water resources utilisation in the Manjirenji Dam.},

Abstract = {Backflow from river to lake (BRL) usually happens in inland lakes and affects water exchange, matter migration, and variations in the water quality and eco-environment. However, at present, discharge data derived from hydrological stations are the only way to monitor BRL, and the influence scope of BRL has not been monitored through hydrological stations. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm to monitor BRL using satellite images of Poyang Lake (the largest freshwater lake in China). The following results were obtained: (1) According to the difference in suspended sediment from rivers and lakes, an algorithm using the total suspended sediment (TSS), which was used as a tracer, was designed for monitoring BRL in Poyang Lake. (2) An innovative extraction method for the mutation line using the TSS was developed to analyze BRL via satellite images. A gradient variation method was developed to extract the mutation line accurately. (3) The satellites with daily acquisition or higher-frequency resolution images (e.g., Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) were satisfactory for monitoring the characteristics of BRL. The MODIS-derived band combination R-rs(645) - R-rs(859))/(R-rs(555) - R-rs(859) yielded a higher fitting accuracy (R-2 = 0.858, RMSE = 10.25 mg/L) derived from an exponential model, which was helpful to highlighting the mutation line. (4) The important parameters of BRL, such as the beginning time, the duration, the end time, and the influence scope, were quantitatively determined by judging the movement of the mutation line. This algorithm was applied to quickly and effectively extract the information of two instances of BRL in Poyang Lake in July 2000 and July to August 2007, and the results were accurate and reasonable. This algorithm can save a great deal on monitoring costs. A BRL monitoring algorithm using remote sensing is an efficient government measure supplement to address the limitations of hydrological stations. These results provide technological support for lake management and can serve as a valuable reference for water bodies similar to Poyang Lake worldwide.},

Title = {Application of extended full resolution MERIS imagery to assist coastal management of the area adjacent to the Guadalquivir estuary},

Abstract = {High concentrations of suspended solids in coastal waters directly affect numerous processes. In the case of the marine region influenced by the Guadalquivir estuary, turbidity is one of the primary factors affecting this complex ecosystem and its adjacent coastal region. Ten-year (2002-2012) ocean color observations from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) at 300 m are used to assess the variability of turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) in this region. The combination of high-frequency data from automated sensors in addition to synoptic imagery results in an excellent complement to better study water quality parameters. Turbidity plumes detected using the backscattering characteristics of the surface waters with Remote Sensing Reflectance at wavelength 665 nm (Rrs665) reveal the effects of physical processes governing both the spatial and temporal turbidity distribution. The results exhibit seasonal and interannual fluctuations driven by rainfall, freshwater discharges from Alcala del Rio dam, and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), with maximum turbidity levels in late autumn and winter. In addition, the temporal 1-month lag of Chl maximum and peak turbidity suggests a coupling between sediment resuspension and blooms, whereas extreme turbidity is limiting light availability for photosynthesis. Furthermore, turbidity varies on fortnightly scales, presenting lower intensity during neap tide and vice versa during spring tide. An asymmetric behavior of plume signals in connection with the semidiurnal tidal cycle is found, with maximum values during low tide. Both fortnightly and semidiurnal regimes appear to be superimposed on the large time-scale variability and occur throughout the year. Chl concentrations are dominated by the fortnightly-driven turbidity features throughout the year with minimum Chl during spring tides. This study evidences the main mechanisms influencing plume patterns and Chl, characterizing for the first time their variability in relation with tidal forcing, and therefore advancing the understanding of sediment dynamics and its relevant impact on the regulation of the pelagic ecosystem of the basin. The information obtained is critical for supporting scientists, stakeholders and ecosystem policy-makers for the challenging sustainable coastal management of the Eastern Gulf of Cadiz and its resources.},

Abstract = {Determination and description of groundwater systems is essential for the management and development of ecological values, especially in the valley parts of river basins. At the land surface, groundwater systems appear as infiltration (relatively dry) and discharge zones (relatively wet). Groundwater discharge zones offer a high potential for nature values because of their constant moisture presence and their specific water quality. Current methods for the determination of discharge and infiltration zones use either detailed time-consuming fieldwork or data intensive numerical simulation models. Consequently, there is a direct need for repeatable, area covering, mapping possibilities for the determination of moisture gradients and more specifically discharge and infiltration zones. Within the framework of the CASI-SWIR campaign 2002, the Department of Hydrology and Hydraulic Engineering of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) executed a combined airborne hyperspectral remote sensing and field campaign to analyze moisture gradients in the Doode Bemde, a riparian nature reserve. The main objective of the study is to test the best hyperspectral analysis method, using the hyperspectral CASI-SWIR data, for the known, based upon field and simulation data, moisture gradients in the Doode Bemde area. Simultaneously with the airborne hyperspectral campaign, field measurements of soil moisture, groundwater levels, vegetation temperature and spectral characteristics of some key vegetation species (phreatophytes) were performed. The method of analysis consists of statistical comparison of moisture gradients, obtained from measurements and simulations, with individual bands, a combination of bands and multivariate derivatives. The paper describes the set-up of the field and airborne measurement campaign, the methodology of analysis as well as first analysis results.},

Title = {Integration of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Remote Sensing to Assess Threats to Preservation of the Oases: Case of Al Ain, UAE},

Abstract = {Identifying threats to historical sites is important for formulating preventive measures to reduce their impacts. The oases in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), are one of the historical sites and were inscribed as cultural sites in 2011 by UNESCO World Heritage Committee. This study assessed the threats to oases based on the UNESCO-listed factors affecting the outstanding universal value of the World Heritage properties. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with remote sensing was used for data collection and analysis. Expert feedback showed that water, urban expansion, soil salinity, palm disease, and the legal framework were major threats. To determine whether urban expansion influences oases preservation, remote sensing images were used to investigate land use and land cover (LULC) around the oases. The LULC change between 1972 and 2022 showed that palm trees, grass, and built-up areas increased by 59\%, 76\%, and 91\%, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were used to assess stress in the oases. The results indicated that oases have not been impacted by urban expansion since 1972, reflecting the UAE's commitment to the preservation of oases. The availability of cloud-based and open-access satellite images coupled with AHP is an effective tool for understanding threats. This research aligns with UN SDG 15-{''}Life on Land{''}. The concept of this study could be used to assess threats to historical sites. It is recommended that policies for the oases' preservation be maintained and updated to cater to issues related to population and climate change. Gray water and smart irrigation systems could be assessed as alternatives to minimize water use. Hyperspectral remote sensing is recommended for future studies related to soil salinity and palm diseases.},

Abstract = {Crop residue left after harvest plays an important role in controlling against soil erosion and in increasing soil organic matter content of agricultural soils. Crop residue management is a practice of great importance in southwestern Ontario, where soil management practices have an effect on Great Lakes water quality. The use of remote sensing data to measure and monitor crop residue can be fast and efficient. However, remote sensing based studies need calibration and validation using field observations. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of ground-truthing field measurements (i.e., digital photographs) required to estimate residue levels. To do so, we compared the residue estimates derived from digital photographs with those derived from the standard line-transect method. Residue was measured from 18 fields located in southern Ontario, and data collected included percentage of crop residue using line-transect and photographic grid methods. Results were analyzed using linear regression, correlation tests, ANOVA, and means tests. Analyses were also conducted to retrospectively determine the minimum number of line transects or digital photos required to estimate crop residue cover at specified levels of power. Results showed that (1) percentage of crop residue estimates derived from using digital photographs were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.83, and n = 90) to those derived from using line transects; (2) counting 50 to 100 points per digital photograph was sufficient to accurately estimate the percentage of residue cover; and (3) there was greater variability in the results for soybean (Glycine max {[}L.] Merr.) than for corn (Zea mays L.), with the highest variability for medium-level soybean residue. Overall, the digital photograph method to estimate percentage of residue was found to be a suitable alternative to the line-transect method, which is more time consuming and labor intensive. Determining the optimal numbers of measurements to estimate crop residue cover is important to those wishing to use digital photo capture methods to record, archive, and measure residue for remote sensing calibration and validation or for handheld mobile device applications.},

Title = {Ecological environment quality assessment based on remote sensing data for land consolidation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {239},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Ecological transformation is inevitable in development of land consolidation (LC) in China. An appropriate approach for assessing ecological environmental quality (EEQ) is fundamental for the analysis of LC efficiency. However, previous studies generally rely on statistical data or land use data, and the objectivity of these data and research periods are generally limited at the project scale. Based on the remote sensing data 6 years before and after LC, this study developed the RS-based theoretical research framework, provided a contrastive analysis between Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) and Ecological Index (EI) and expanded spatio-temporal pattern study to assess EEQ in a typical land consolidation project area (LCPA) of China, with the application of RSEI method. Results suggested that RSEI and EI showed strong comparability in the ecological sense, and RSEI can reflect the changes in EEQ in LCPA more effectively than El. Wetness and greenness indicators had positive effects on EEQ promotion, while heat and dryness indicators had negative effects, and the effect of dryness indicator was more significant than that of other indicators. Before, during, and after LC, EEQ decreased first, increased later, and decreased overall, with the characteristics of degenerating during the construction period, improving during the restoration period, as well as degenerating in the overall process. LC caused persistent disturbance to EEQ but there was a lag for restoration for more than 5 years. Prediction indicated that the selected indicators were the key indicators of EEQ among which wetness and greenness were essential for EEQ improvement. This study provides certain theoretical guidance and method reference for the scientific, objective, direct, and long-term comprehensive monitoring and assessment of EEQ at the project scale.

However, the current increasing energy demand can endanger the energy security of the nations and, as well, could put in risk the planet's environmental quality and human health. Thus, by the issues concern about the fossil fuels utilization, the importance of renewable energy sources is being rescued. In this scenario, the biomass energy planning becomes very important to tropical countries, like Brazil, because it would allow stimulating the production of biomass for energy where it is required, but in a sustainable way, considering the social and environmental aspects. Thus, this study aims to present important aspects related with regional energy planning as a contribution for proposing better solutions to energy demands and to think about better public policies related to energy production from biomass. Besides, a contribution of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System in order to assess areas for biomass energy production and a conceptual model are presented as framework which demonstrates how these techniques can constitute support tools to strategic decision making process in bioenergy issues. Some difficult and constraints to territorial and agro-energy planning in Brazil was also presented.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) techniques and Geographical information system (GIS) applications, which provide more economical and time saving methods than ground-based measurements, have been widely used for earth observation and environmental assessments. Thus, consider Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, the present and past conditions of the coniferous species and land change that are within 100 meters away from the road alignment were evaluated to explain the changes in the road effect zone. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat images of the years between 2000 and 2015 were performed by using thresholds to estimate temporal and spatial changes of the coniferous species. The value of thresholds (0.45<NDVI<0.65) for the NDVI reflections from healthy coniferous species have been taken into consideration in summer season. Binary classification was applied for NDVI reflection values of productive coniferous forests (PcF) and degraded coniferous forests (DcF), and then comparisons were performed to investigate temporal and spatial changes. The results investigated that approximately 18 \% of the coniferous forests within the 100 m road buffer zone were turned into DcF. Beside beekeeping, grazing and social activities are defined as disturbances in research area. In conclusion, current roadside forestry applications and managements for road edges needs improved techniques and planning for sustainable management in forest road zones.},

Abstract = {Information about forest cover is needed by all of the nine societal benefit areas identified by the Group of Earth Observation (GEO). In particular, the biodiversity and ecosystem areas need information on landscape composition, structure of forests, species richness, as well as their changes. Field sample plots from National Forest Inventories (NFI) are, in combination with satellite data, a tremendous resource for fulfilling these information needs. NFIs have a history of almost 100 years and have developed in parallel in several countries. For example, the NFIs in Finland and Sweden measure annually more than 10,000 field plots with approximately 200 variables per plot. The inventories are designed for five-year rotations. In Finland nationwide forest cover maps have been produced operationally since 1990 by using the k-NN algorithm to combine satellite data, field sample plot information, and other georeferenced digital data. A similar k-NN database has also been created for Sweden. The potentials of NFIs to fulfil diverse information needs are currently analyzed also in the COST Action E43 project of the European Union. In this article, we provide a review of how NFI field plot information has been used for parameterization of image data in Sweden and Finland, including pre-processing steps like haze correction, slope correction, and the optimization of the estimation variables. Furthermore, we review how the produced small-area statistics and forest cover data have been used in forestry, including forest biodiversity monitoring and habitat modelling. We also show how remote sensing data can be used for post-stratification to derive the sample plot based estimates, which cannot be directly estimated from the spectral data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Forecasting High-Risk Freshwater Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms in Florida},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Due to the occurrence of more frequent and widespread toxic cyanobacteria events, the ability to predict freshwater cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB) is of critical importance for the management of drinking and recreational waters. Lake system specific geographic variation of cyanoHABs has been reported, but regional and state level variation is infrequently examined. A spatio-temporal modeling approach can be applied, via the computationally efficient Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), to high-risk cyanoHAB exceedance rates to explore spatio-temporal variations across statewide geographic scales. We explore the potential for using satellite-derived data and environmental determinants to develop a short-term forecasting tool for cyanobacteria presence at varying space-time domains for the state of Florida. Weekly cyanobacteria abundance data were obtained using Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Imagery (OLCI), for a period of May 2016-June 2019. Time and space varying covariates include surface water temperature, ambient temperature, precipitation, and lake geomorphology. The hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling approach in R-INLA represents a potential forecasting tool useful for water managers and associated public health applications for predicting near future high-risk cyanoHAB occurrence given the spatio-temporal characteristics of these events in the recent past. This method is robust to missing data and unbalanced sampling between waterbodies, both common issues in water quality datasets.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Abstract = {Understanding the spatial variations in regional eco-environmental quality and their driving factors is essential for environmental management and protection. However, the lack of quantitative analyses in relevant studies has often hindered the formulation and implementation of effective eco-environmental policies. Taking Minjiang River Basin as an example, we used the remote sensing ecological indices (RSEI) to objectively and quantitatively characterize the eco-environmental quality. We also introduced and compared the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and the random forest models to identify the critical driving factors. Results showed that the eco-environmental quality of Minjiang River Basin in 2020 was good overall, and the areas with good or excellent ecoenvironmental quality accounted for 58\%. The areas with poor eco-environmental quality were mainly distributed in the periphery of the basin and the riverine areas. Both the MaxEnt and the random forest models were applicable to identify the critical driving factors and indicated that the degrees of landscape fragmentation and drastic land use were the main factors causing spatial variation of eco-environmental quality in the Minjiang River Basin. This study provides a new perspective and method for quantitative analysis of the driving factors of the spatial variations in regional eco-environmental quality for future eco-environmental management and protection.},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are rapidly changing due to human-caused global warming, rising sea level, changing circulation patterns, sea ice loss, and acidification that in turn alter the productivity and composition of marine biological communities. In addition, regional pressures associated with growing human populations and economies result in changes in infrastructure, land use, and other development; greater extraction of fisheries and other natural resources; alteration of benthic seascapes; increased pollution; and eutrophication. Understanding biodiversity is fundamental to assessing and managing human activities that sustain ecosystem health and services and mitigate humankind's indiscretions. Remote-sensing observations provide rapid and synoptic data for assessing biophysical interactions at multiple spatial and temporal scales and thus are useful for monitoring biodiversity in critical coastal zones. However, many challenges remain because of complex bio-optical signals, poor signal retrieval, and suboptimal algorithms. Here, we highlight four approaches in remote sensing that complement the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). MBON observations help quantify plankton community composition, foundation species, and unique species habitat relationships, as well as inform species distribution models. In concert with in situ observations across multiple platforms, these efforts contribute to monitoring biodiversity changes in complex coastal regions by providing oceanographic context, contributing to algorithm and indicator development, and creating linkages between long-term ecological studies, the next generations of satellite sensors, and marine ecosystem management.},

Title = {Detecting Long-Term Series Eco-Environmental Quality Changes and Driving Factors Using the Remote Sensing Ecological Index with Salinity Adaptability (RSEISI): A Case Study in the Tarim River Basin, China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ecological challenges resulting from soil salinization in the Tarim River Basin (TRB), exacerbated by climate change and human activities, have emphasized the need for a quick and accurate assessment of regional ecological environmental quality (EEQ) and driving mechanisms. To address this issue, this study has developed a remote-sensing ecological index with salinity adaptability (RSEISI) for EEQ assessment in the Tarim River Basin by integrating the comprehensive salinity index (CSI) into the remote-sensing ecological index (RSEI). The RSEISI enhances the sensitivity of soil salinity and characterizes the surface features of arid regions, thus expanding the applicability. Then, we used time-series analysis methods and a geodetector to quantify the spatial temporal trends and driving factors of EEQ in the TRB from 2000 to 2022. The results show that the RSEISI with salinity adaptation effectively monitors the EEQ of the TRB. The EEQ of the TRB displayed the situation of oasis expansion, desert deterioration, and glacier melting, and the multiyear average EEQ grades were dominated by medium and poor grades in desert and saline areas, while medium, good, and excellent grades were concentrated in oasis and mountainous areas. Looking at the trend of change in conjunction with land-use types, the EEQ of the TRB showed a mild degradation trend mainly in unused land, followed by a mild improvement trend in cropland and grassland. The Hurst index indicated that the EEQ of most areas of the TRB will improve in the future. Soil type, land use, precipitation, and temperature were considered to be key factors affecting the EEQ across the TRB, and changes in the EEQ were found to be the interaction of multiple factors. This study may provide innovative concepts and methodologies, scientific and technological support for ecological management, and green development models in the northwest arid zone.},

Title = {Monitoring Sand Spit Variability Using Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Engine in a Mediterranean Estuary},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Estuarine degradation is a major concern worldwide, and is rapidly increasing due to anthropogenic pressures. The Mediterranean Guadiaro estuary, located in San Roque (Cadiz, Spain), is an example of a highly modified estuary, showing severe negative effects of eutrophication episodes and beach erosion. The migration of its river mouth sand spit causes the closure of the estuary, resulting in serious water quality issues and flora and fauna mortality due to the lack of water renewal. With the aim of studying the Guadiaro estuary throughout a 4-year period (2017-2020), the Sentinel-2 A/B twin satellites of the Copernicus programme were used thanks to their 5-day and 10 m temporal and spatial resolution, respectively. Sea-land mapping was performed using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, selecting cloud-free Sentinel-2 Level 2A images and computing statistics. Results show a closure trend of the Guadiaro river mouth and no clear sand spit seasonal patterns. The study also reveals the potential of both Sentinel-2 and GEE for estuarine monitoring by means of an optimized processing workflow. This improvement will be useful for coastal management to ensure a continuous and detailed monitoring in the area, contributing to the development of early-warning tools, which can be helpful for supporting an ecosystem-based approach to coastal areas.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {189},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A commercially available handheld spectroradiometer, the WISP-3, was assessed as a tool formonitoring freshwater cyanobacterial blooms for management purposes. Three small eutrophic urban ponds which displayed considerable within-pond and betweenpond variability in water quality and cyanobacterial community composition were used as trial sites. On-board algorithms provide field measurements of phycocyanin (CPC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from surface reflectance spectra measured by the instrument. These were compared with laboratory measurements. Although significant but weak relationships were found between WISP-3 measured CPC and cyanobacterial biovolume measurements and WISP-3 and laboratory Chl-a measurements, there was considerable scatter in the data due likely to error in both WISP-3 and laboratory measurements. The relationships generally differed only slightly between ponds, indicating that different cyanobacterial communities had little effect on the pigment retrievals of the WISP-3. The on-board algorithms need appropriate modification for local conditions, posing a problem if it is to be used extensively across water bodies with differing optical properties. Although suffering a range of other limitations, the WISP-3 has a potential as a rapid screening tool for preliminary risk assessment of cyanobacterial blooms. However, such field assessment would still require adequate support by sampling and laboratory-based analysis.},

Abstract = {Total suspended sediments (TSS) are an important water quality indicator. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of TSS concentrations in summer in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) remain unclear between 2000 and 2020. Among empirical and machine learning models, the random forest (RF) model exhibits the best performance for the PAD with a coefficient of determination, normalized root-means-square error, and relative root-mean-square error of 0.92, 7.51\%, and 27.36\%, respectively. Our study analyzes the spatiotemporal TSS distribution based on 21 years of Landsat remote sensing data and the RF model. The results showed that the TSS concentrations of the Peace River were elevated in 2000, 2016, 2019, and 2020. The long-term TSS concentration distribution in the PAD showed a decreasing trend from west to east, and the TSS concentrations ranged from 6 to 80 mg/L level and remained stable in Lake Athabasca during the investigated period. Moreover, 57.14\% of the PAD area exhibited no significant change between 2000 and 2020. The results of our study provide detailed information for the local government on the TSS concentrations in the PAD. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

Abstract = {As an iconic species linked to First Nations culture and economy in western North America, wild plains bison (Bison bison bison) currently rely on intensive management to persist. Yet, their presence maintains grassland ecological function, protects biodiversity and preserves important cultural heritage. Estimating carrying capacity is a key to achieve wildlife conservation without risking overall ecosystem health. Plains bison carrying capacity should be estimated to provide guideline for developing subsequent management plans. We reckoned that drivers of plains bison carrying capacity are forage availability and animal requirement, meanwhile its adjusting factors comprise spatio-temporal distribution and sustainable consideration. An integration of remote sensing and GIS can help to investigate variables of carrying capacity. Also Habitat Suitability Model built in Geographic Information System (GIS) is able to compile variables influencing carrying capacity. The review found multiple challenges of carrying capacity estimation in terms of implementing and practicing not only from remote sensing and GIS perspective. We expect that the advancement of remote sensors in accordance with modern GIS technology can provide timely effective carrying capacity estimation to achieve conservation goals of animal species as well as maintain sustainable ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The construction of the Hydroelectric Power Plants has influenced the environment with their accompanying dams and reservoirs, resulting in changes to these ecosystems. Monitoring the reservoirs is important for the decision-making process. In this paper, we present different methodologies for estimating the concentration of Chlorophyll-a, transparency and total suspended solids in reservoir from remote sensing multispectral data, based on artificial neural networks and Leave-One-Out cross-validation. Simulations on different sample station of the study area were performed to determine a relationship between these physico-chemical parameters and the spectral response of the reservoir. Based on the in situ measurements, empirical models are established in order to relate the reservoir reflectance measured by Landsat 7 Enhanced TM+ with the water optical parameters. Four images for each year from 2007 to 2014 are calibrated and atmospherically corrected. Statistical analysis using error estimation is employed, aiming at evaluating the most accurate methodology. Artificial neural networks are trained by hydrological cycle and are shown to be useful in estimating the physico-chemical parameters of water from reflectance of visible and NIR bands of satellite images, with better results for the period with little rain and few clouds in the analyzed region.},

Abstract = {Globally, forests are a crucial natural resource, and their sound management is critical for human and ecosystem health and well-being. Efforts to manage forests depend upon reliable data on the status of and trends in forest resources. When these data come from well-designed natural resource monitoring (NRM) systems, decision makers can make science-informed decisions. National forest inventories (NFIs) are a cornerstone of NRM systems, but require capacity and skills to implement. Efficiencies can be gained by incorporating auxiliary information derived from remote sensing (RS) into ground-based forest inventories. However, it can be difficult for countries embarking on NFI development to choose among the various RS integration options, and to develop a harmonized vision of how NFI and RS data can work together to meet monitoring needs. The NFI of the United States, which has been conducted by the USDA Forest Service's (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program for nearly a century, uses RS technology extensively. Here we review the history of the use of RS in FIA, beginning with general background on NFI, FIA, and sampling statistics, followed by a description of the evolution of RS technology usage, beginning with paper aerial photography and ending with present day applications and future directions. The goal of this review is to offer FIA's experience with NFI-RS integration as a case study for other countries wishing to improve the efficiency of their NFI programs.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of stormwater river plume dynamics is important for the management of lake water quality because river discharge associated with rainstorms can be a major source of pollutants for lake waters. Total suspended matter (TSM) derived from the discharge of sediment-laden rivers is highly variable over a wide range of time and space scales. In the present study, the first use of remote sensing to monitor the river TSM plume was conducted to investigate the effects of heavy rainfall events on Lake Taihu by the largest inflowing river (Tiaoxi River) based on a calibrated and validated model using daily 250 m MODIS imagery in band 1 (620-670 nm). From 2004 to 2013, 48 MODIS images of 20 heavy rainfall events were obtained, showing that the area of the TSM plume significantly increased in the waters adjacent to the inflowing river, reflecting runoff input. The TSM concentration of the river plume after heavy rainfall was significantly higher than that before rainfall (ANOVA, p < 0.001). A significantly positive correlation between the TSM plume area and the rainfall amount in heavy rainfall events (p < 0.01) was also observed. The heaviest rainfall event, in October 2013, caused a river plume with an area of 302.8 km(2), which lasted for more than 10 days. The significant increase in the frequency and rainfall amount of rainstorms and large rain in the past 50 years (1965-2014) in Lake Taihu under global warming indicated an important role of remote sensing in monitoring the river plume resulting from heavy precipitation. The present study demonstrates that remote sensing tools can be valuable instruments in the detection and tracking of the effect of heavy rainfall events on the distribution and diffusion of the TSM concentration in the lake. The results obtained from the present study are valuable for further hydrological research on the Tiaoxi River, particularly for the immediate assessment of flood impacts on soil erosion of the catchment.

Abstract = {Urban environmental management is of profound importance due to increasing urban development alongside the need to develop resilient cities and sustainable urbanization strategies. Spatial explicit urban environmental quality indices can provide policy makers and the public with valuable information for urban planning and policy formation. The aim of this study is the development of a multi-component urban environmental quality index for the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki. The approach was designed to be robust and easily transferred across cities with similar characteristics. Land Surface Temperature (LST) was estimated based on multi-seasonal Landsat-8 images, while Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) was derived from fused Sentinel-2 images and validated using WorldView-2 very high spatial resolution imagery. In addition, several geospatial layers related to atmospheric pollution, petroleum refineries, noise pollution, urban density and distance to green infrastructures were processed within GIS environment and integrated with the satellite extracted information. A multi-criteria Analytical Hierarchical Approach (AHP) was used for integrating the sub-criteria to a final urban environmental quality index using weights from expert knowledge and literature review. The results identified extended areas in the western part of the study region as well as several hot spots in the eastern part, that local planners should develop and implement actions for improving living conditions of residents. Overall, the method proved to be viable and flexible and its application can be expanded to similar Mediterranean cities.},

Abstract = {In the present paper a preliminary study about a coastal environment, using both numerical methods and field measurements, is shown. Pescara river mouth (Adriatic sea, Italy) has been chosen as case-study. Our aim is to describe the behavior of a natural environment heavily modified by human activity. Shallow water equations have been implemented to simulate the hydrodynamic field due to the Interaction of river run-off with coastal water body, taking into account the presence of marine structures. Complicate geometries have been studied by a body forces based approach. Validation tests have been performed for a simple-shaped geometry and preliminary numerical results have been obtained for the Pescara river mouth flow. Field data related to infrared images as well as water quality parameters have been also considered to describe the environmental aspects related to coastal structures. As a result, the combined use of numerical and environmental data is shown to be a very effective tool for coastal environment management.},

Title = {The feasibility of satellite remote sensing and spatial interpolation to estimate cover crop biomass and nitrogen uptake in a small watershed},

Abstract = {The adoption of winter cover crops has been identified as one of the most effective best management practices to reduce nonpoint nitrogen (N) loss via subsurface drainage in a watershed in the midwestern Corn Belt. Understanding the variation of cover crop growth and N cycling is vital for watershed modeling efforts that simulate cover crop adoption. However, there is a dearth of watershed cover crop studies that describe the variation in cover crop growth and N cycling and compare the ability of spatial analytical methodologies to predict cover crop biomass and N uptake within diverse agronomic management practices and heterogeneous soil landscapes. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare the feasibility of satellite remote sensing and spatial interpolation methods to predict cover crop biomass and N uptake in a small watershed (100 to 10,000 ha). This study was undertaken during 2015 to 2017 in the Lake Bloomington watershed (374 ha) in McLean County, Illinois. Within the small watershed, daikon radish (Raphanus sativus L.)/oats (Avena sativa L., R/O), annual ryegrass (Latium multillorunt)/daikon radish (A/R), and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.)/daikon radish (C/R), were adopted on 78\% of row crop land area for both years. Strong linear relationships were observed between soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and triangular vegetation index (TVI) and cover crop biomass, (average R-2 of 0.77, 0.78, and 0.76, respectively) and N uptake (average R-2 of 0.68 for all three vegetation indices). Cover crop biomass and N uptake estimated by the SAVI method were 86\% and 85\%, 93\% and 94\%, and 107\% and 98\% of the ground observed value during 2016 spring, 2016 fall, and 2017 spring, respectively. Moreover, spatial pattern and different cover crop management fields in the study watershed were also captured by the SAVI method. Ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) showed similar mean cover crop biomass and N uptake values for fields with cover crops; however, both spatial interpolation methods showed lower prediction R-2 values than that of the SAVI method.The results of this study suggest that the combination of spatially accurate satellite imagery and limited ground sampling could be used for repeated small watershed assessment of cover crop growth. Furthermore, this can be used to understand cumulative cover crop impacts on soil and water quality in response to conservation practices and weather within a drainage basin.},

Title = {Assessing Soil Cover Levels during the Non-Growing Season Using Multitemporal Satellite Imagery and Spectral Unmixing Techniques},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Growing cover or winter crops and retaining crop residue on agricultural lands are considered beneficial management practices to address soil health and water quality. Remote sensing is a valuable tool to assess and map crop residue cover and cover crops. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of linear spectral unmixing for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season (November-May) over the Canadian Lake Erie Basin using seasonal multitemporal satellite imagery. Soil cover ground measurements and multispectral Landsat-8 imagery were acquired for two areas throughout the 2015-2016 non-growing season. Vertical soil cover photos were collected from up to 40 residue and 30 cover crop fields for each area (e.g., Elgin and Essex sites) when harvest, cloud, and snow conditions permitted. Images and data were reviewed and compiled to represent a complete coverage of the basin for three time periods (post-harvest, pre-planting, and post-planting). The correlations between field measured and satellite imagery estimated soil covers (e.g., residue and green) were evaluated by coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Overall, spectral unmixing of satellite imagery is well suited for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season. Spectral unmixing using three-endmembers (i.e., corn residue-soil-green cover; soybean residue-soil-green cover) showed higher correlations with field measured soil cover than spectral unmixing using two- or four-endmembers. For the nine non-growing season images analyzed, the residue and green cover fractions derived from linear spectral unmixing using corn residue-soil-green cover endmembers were highly correlated with the field-measured data (mean R-2 of 0.70 and 0.86, respectively). The results of this study support the use of remote sensing and spectral unmixing techniques for monitoring performance metrics for government initiatives, such as the Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan, and as input for sustainability indicators that both require knowledge about non-growing season land management over a large area.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion reduces crop productivity and creates negative impacts on water quality. Soil erosion by water has become a problem worldwide and as concerns about the environment continue to grow, soil erosion remains a very active area of scientific research. In this study, based on advanced remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies, the influences of precipitation, soil, topography and vegetation on soil erosion sensitivity are evaluated. An index system and the classification standard for soil erosion sensitivity assessment in the Tongbai-Dabie Mountainous area are established with soil erosion sensitivity being evaluated and analyzed in order to provide a scientific basis for controlling soil erosion and for making sound ecological engineering decisions. According to the regional conditions, sensitivity is classified into five levels: insensitive, mild, moderate, high and extreme. The distribution of erosion sensitivity for the region is analyzed and the various impacts are discussed. The results show that the sensitivity of the Tongbai-Dabie Mountainous area to soil erosion is relatively high, with 4634\% of the total area above the moderate level, and 44.30\% and 9.36\% rated at the mild and insensitive levels, respectively. In regards to the spatial distribution, the sensitivity levels decrease from south to north, with highly sensitive areas found mainly in the south in the areas of Jinzhai, Huoshan, Shangcheng, Yuexi, and Shucheng. The distribution of soil erosion sensitivity levels was very consistent with the intensity of soil erosion. Areas of high sensitivity are found to have severe areas of soil erosion, indicating that regional soil erosion is highly influenced by natural factors, although in some areas it is evident that the impact of human activities has played a significant role in exacerbating the problem. The results of this investigation serve to advance efforts to reduce the impacts soil erosion in the region and prevent further erosion in areas having high erosion sensitivities.

Abstract = {For sustainable irrigation water management as well as ecosystem health monitoring, it is important to provide an estimate of evapotranspiration components, i.e. transpiration and soil evaporation. To do so, Thermal InfraRed data can be used with dual-source surface energy balance models, because they solve separate energy budgets for the soil and the vegetation. But those models rely on specific assumptions on raw levels of plant water stress to get both components (evaporation and transpiration) out of a single source of information, namely the surface temperature. Additional information from remote sensing data is thus required. This works evaluates the ability of the SPARSE dual-source energy balance model to compute not only total evapotranspiration, but also water stress and transpiration/evaporation components, using either the sole surface temperature as a remote sensing driver, or a combination of surface temperature and soil moisture level derived from microwave data.},

Title = {A systematic literature review on the forest health biomonitoring technique: A decade of practice, progress, and challenge},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {The approach for monitoring forest health such as canopy layer, air quality, soil texture has evolved in tandem with the advancement of new technology such as lab analysis, remote sensing etc. The application of biomonitoring techniques for example species diversity and morphological observation, on the other hand, has been positive and has made its own contribution to forest management. Many studies have been conducted in the last decade (2011-2021), which use the biomonitoring techniques in assessing the forest health status. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the forest health biomonitoring techniques in the last decade. This study used the PRISMA guidelines as the protocol to search and analyze all the papers. This study selected 72 out of 538 papers for a thematic analysis which eventually identified four main biomonitoring techniques, namely: 1) diversity distribution, 2) morphological observations, 3) trace elements, minerals and physiological measurements, and 4) behavioral observations. The biomonitoring techniques applied to monitor forest health has evolved with numerous ways that can support existing technologies, as well as help educate people on the necessity of protecting and safeguarding the natural forest environment. This also will give more options to the authority in monitoring the forest health and not only focusing on technology.},

Title = {Determination of Bathing Water Quality Using Thermal Images Landsat 8 on the West Coast of Tangier: Preliminary Results},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {Bathing water quality has been monitored in the west coast of Tangier, Morocco due to increased urban and industrial discharge through the Boukhalef river, using in-situ bacteriological measurements which demand high economical and temporal costs. In this study, Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) images were used as an alternative to the classical method, for determining bathing water quality to help decision makers obtain up-to-date and cost-effective information for coastal environment protection. For this purpose, during spring and summer 2017, seven sampling points were examined in terms of bacteriological parameters: Total Coliforms (TC), Faecal Coliforms (FC), Intestinal Enterococci (IE) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Also, a spatial-temporal analysis was performed in this temporal window to detect temperature anomalies and their spatial distribution along the coastal bathing area. In addition, a relationship between in-situ bacteriological parameter measurements and temperature from satellite images was analyzed. The results of the water temperature distribution showed the highest values next to the Boukhalef river mouth, as well as the poorest water quality according to in-situ measurements, while lower values and better water quality status were observed moving away from the Boukhalef river mouth. The relationship between water temperature and bacterial concentration showed a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.85). Consequently, the model development approaches used may be useful in estimating bacterial concentration in coastal bathing areas and can serve to create a monitoring system to support decision makers in the protection actions of the coast.},

Title = {A review of microplastic pollution in aquaculture: Sources, effects, removal strategies and prospects},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {252},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {As microplastic pollution has become an emerging environmental issue of global concern, microplastics in aquaculture have become a research hotspot. For environmental safety, economic efficiency and food safety considerations, a comprehensive understanding of microplastic pollution in aquaculture is necessary. This review outlines an overview of sources and effects of microplastics in aquaculture. External environmental inputs and aquaculture processes are sources of microplastics in aquaculture. Microplastics may release harmful additives and adsorb pollutants in aquaculture environment, cause deterioration of aquaculture environment, as well as cause toxicological effects, affect the behavior, growth and reproduction of aquaculture products, ultimately reducing the economic benefits of aquaculture. Microplastics entering the human body through aquaculture products also pose potential health risks at multiple levels. Microplastic pollution removal strategies used in aquaculture in various countries are also reviewed. Ecological interception and purification are considered to be effective methods. In addition, strengthening aquaculture management and improving fishing gear and pack-aging are also currently feasible solutions. As proactive measures, new portable microplastic monitoring system and remote sensing technology are considered to have broad application prospects. And it was encouraged to comprehensively strengthen the supervision of microplastic pollution in aquaculture through talent exchange and strengthening the construction of laws and regulations.},

Title = {Airborne hyperspectral data to assess suspended particulate matter and aquatic vegetation in a shallow and turbid lake},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {157},

Pages = {48-57},

Abstract = {This paper presents an application of a physic-based method that relies on spectral inversion procedures to simultaneously estimate concentrations of water constituents, water column heights (cH) and benthic substrate types in Lake Trasimeno (Italy) from airborne imaging spectrometry. Complex waters of this lake are challenging due to the coexistence of optically-deep turbid waters and of optically-shallow waters, mostly characterised by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds. Airborne data acquired on 12 May 2009 by Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) were converted into remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) with the atmospheric correction code ATCOR. A spectral inversion procedure implementing a bio-optical model (namely BOMBER), parameterised with in-situ-data; was-firstly run-to-retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (i.e. a(CDOM)(440)) in the optically-deep waters. The areas where the retrieved optimisation error was higher than 10\% were instead assumed as optically-shallow. In these areas two maps depicting the linear unmixing of three substrate types (i.e., siltyclay, Chara ssp. and other hydrophyte) and the water column heights were produced. The MIVIS-derived products were validated with field data providing a reliable estimation of SPM, chl-a, a(CDOM)(440) and cH (determination coefficients always R-2 > 0.7). SPM concentrations were also similar to a 5.4-km long transect of flow-through turbidity data, and the SAV map was comparable to in situ observations. Generally, the colonisation patterns of SAV were reflecting the spatial distribution of SPM concentrations. In particular, the positive role of Chara on keeping SPM concentrations low was observed. Future research should extend this application to remote sensing data acquired in other seasons to trace the dynamics of SAV and its effect on spatial water clarity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Assessing the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality of lahore region, Pakistan},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 23},
Abstract = {Land use land cover (LULC) dynamics is an important aspect of environmental studies. Lahore is one of the wide-ranging urban cities in the world experiencing rapid development in the form of unplanned urban growth and industrialization, which leads to many adverse consequences. This research focuses on the study of spatio-temporal variability of urbanization and its impact on the water quality index (WQI) in Lahore city using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS). Landsat images (Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI) between 2005 to 2021 were used to observe the changes in urban growth over seventeen years. GIS is used to create the LULC, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) maps, to study the urbanization impact on the WQI. The results of this study indicate that the groundwater quality of metropolitan Lahore city has significantly dropped within 17 years. The extent of the built-up area has been expanded from 22.4\% to 953.04\% with an increase in the poor WQI area from 1.95\% to 37.89\%, reveals a general decline in groundwater quality with urbanization. Indeed, the trends observed by the linear regression modelling showed a positive and negative correlation (R-2 = 0.67 and -0.74) of WQI with \% of urban and vegetation areas respectively. GIS and RS tools have been found effective in assessing spatio-temporal phenomena of urbanization and its impact on groundwater quality. Furthermore, this research would be very helpful in making decisions for managing groundwater resources and illegal urban expansion in Lahore city.},

Title = {Geospatial modeling and assessment of Island ecosystem health after restoration projects: a case study in Qinshan Island, Jiangsu Province, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Comprehensively assessing the ecosystem health of islands provides very important information to assist managers with ecological restoration efforts and to develop protection policies and recommendations for related marine administrators. However, evaluation of the ecosystem health of islands usually involves a single ecosystem health value, which does not assess the situation from the spatial and temporal perspectives. The present study analyzed ecological conditions and the effects of ecological restoration on Qinshan Island and the surrounding sea area using geographic information systems and remote sensing to assess the ecosystem health of Qinshan Island based on vigor-organization-resilience and water, sediment, and bioecological quality models. The results indicated that, from 2009 to 2018, the ecosystem health index of the land area increased from 0.351 to 0.567. The ocean health index of the surrounding sea area improved from 0.91 in 2009 to 0.82 in 2018. The island comprehensive ecosystem health indices were 0.5187 and 0.6427 in 2009 and 2018, suggesting that the ecosystem health of Qinshan Island changed from moderately degraded to healthy. The critical underlying factor for the improvement of the ecosystem health indices for Qinshan Island is the ecological restoration projects performed during 2011-2017, which effectively improved the environmental conditions.

Abstract = {In this special issue, we are able to present a selection of high-level contributions showing the manifold aspects of the monitoring, modeling, and management of water quality. Monitoring aspects range from cyanobacteria in water using spectrophotometry via wide-area water quality monitoring and exploiting unmanned surface vehicles, to using sentinel-2 satellites for the near-realtime evaluation of catastrophic floods. Modeling ranges from small scale approaches by deriving a Bayesian network for assessing the retention efficacy of riparian buffer zones, to national scales with a modification of the MONERIS (Modeling Nutrient Emissions in River Systems) nutrient emission model for a lowland country. Management is specifically addressed by lessons learned from the long-term management of a large (re)constructed wetland and the support of river basin management planning in the Danube River Basin.},

Title = {Algal biomass mapping of eutrophic lakes using a machine learning approach with MODIS images},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {880},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Algal blooms are a widespread issue in eutrophic lakes. Compared with the satellite-derived surface algal bloom area and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration, algae biomass is a more stable way to reflect water quality. Although satellite data have been adopted to observe the water column integrated algal biomass, the previous methods mostly are empirical algorithms, which are not stable enough for widespread use. This paper proposed a machine learning algorithm based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data to estimate the algal biomass, which was successfully applied to a eutrophic lake in China, Lake Taihu. This algorithm was developed by linking Rayleigh-corrected reflectance to in situ algae biomass data in Lake Taihu (n = 140), and the different mainstream machine learning (ML) methods were compared and validated. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) (R2 = 0.67, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 38.88 \%) and support vector machines (SVM) (R2 = 0.46, MAPE = 52.02 \%) performed poor satisfactory. In contrast, random forest (RF) and extremely gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) algorithms had higher accuracy (RF: R2 = 0.85, MAPE = 22.68 \%; XGBoost: R2 = 0.83, MAPE = 24.06 \%), demonstrating greater application potential in algal biomass estimation. Field biomass data were further used to estimate the RF algorithm, which showed acceptable precision (R2 = 0.86, MAPE < 7 mg Chla). Subsequently, sensitivity analysis showed that the RF algorithm was not sensitive to high suspension and thickness of aerosols (rate of change <2 \%), and inter-day and consecutive days verification showed stability (rate of change <5 \%). The algorithm was also extended to Lake Chaohu (R2 = 0.93, MAPE = 18.42 \%), demonstrating its potential in other eutrophic lakes. This study for algae biomass estimation provides technical means with higher accuracy and greater universality for the management of eutrophic lakes.},

Abstract = {It has been found that non-point source pollution excessive nitrogen loading is one of the main reasons for the eutrophication of Miyun Reservoir, Beijing, China. At present, the research about eutrophication is still confined to a single level of analysis lacking a full perspective of monitoring, integrated simulation and evaluation. The model domain is the area of Miyun Reservoir, Beijing. This paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach in the future incorporating 3S (RS, GIS and GPS) high-tech to extract hydro-ecological environment information, coupled with surface water/groundwater hydrologic modeling and Bayesian Decision Networks (BDN) to preliminary estimate the sources and relative contributions of nitrogen deposited into Miyun Reservoir, Beijing. Remote sensing will be used to refine land use, soil moisture, and biomass information maps. Concentrations of nitrogen in precipitation, surface water, groundwater, and runoff will be sampled. Predictive analysis and scenario developments will be performed using a complete BDN to model decision impacts, performing sensitivity analysis, and gaining further understanding regarding the interaction of variables in the system. The expected increase in nitrogen loading as a result of population growth should be married with management of natural resources to best serve the environment as a whole.},

Abstract = {The Mirik lake is a well-known tourist destination in the Darjeeling Himalayan region of West Bengal. In the last few decades, the lake area experienced a surge in demand for the hospitality industry with the consequences of unrestricted municipal town growth. On this perspective, this research work addresses the contemporary problems of the Mirk municipality area involving the lake system using technologies of remote sensing and GIS. In accordance with the primary objective, the detailed land use/land cover change analysis of the past twenty years shows a significant escalating trend in built-up area as it has increased from 149.85 ha in 2000 to 178.25 ha in 2020, where the lake expresses a steady reduction of its perennial part. The gradual shrinkage in the lake area may become of grave concern and therefore, this particular work tries to examine the water quality parameters of Mirik lake. Analyses have shown that the lake shrinkage may be attributed to waste disposal, landfill pollution etc., substantially contributed to the raised level of suspended sediment concentration (3724.26 mg/lit in 2020) near the boundaries. Moreover, the outcome of the developed water pollution model identifies that the western and south-western parts of the lake are the most polluted regions and confirms numerous inlets of the western side push up the level of phosphorus, nitrogen and biological oxygen demand in lake water. Such lake degradation is a real threat to the mountainous lacustrine environment, and it requires comprehensive plans for better management practices at some regular interregnum.},

Title = {Remote detection of cyanobacteria blooms in an optically shallow subtropical lagoonal estuary using MODIS data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Widespread and persistent Ecosystem Disruptive Algal Blooms dominated by marine picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus) commonly occur in the subtropical lagoonal estuary of Florida Bay (U.S.A). These blooms have been linked to a decline in natural sheet flow over the past century from upstream Everglades National Park. Remote sensing algorithms for monitoring cyanobacteria blooms are highly desired but have been mainly developed for freshwater and coastal systems with minimal bottom reflectance contributions in the past. Examination of in situ optical properties revealed that Synechococcus blooms in Florida Bay exhibit unique spectral absorption and reflectance features that form the basis for algorithm development. Using a large, multi-year match-up dataset (2002-2012; n = 682) consisting of in situ pigment concentrations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc(lambda)), classification criteria for detecting cyanobacteria blooms with chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) similar to 5-40 mg m(-3) were determined based on a new approach to combine the MODIS Cyanobacteria Index, CIMODIS, and spectral shape around 488 nm, SS(488). The inclusion of SS(488) was required to prevent false positive classifications in seagrass-rich, non-bloom waters with high bottom reflectance contributions. 75\% of cyanobacteria blooms were classified accurately based on this modified CI approach with < 1\% false positives. A strong correlation observed between cyanobacteria bloom in situ Chl-a and CIMODIS r(2) = 0.80, n = 32) then allowed cyanobacterial chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl(cl)) to be estimated. Model simulations and image-based analyses showed that this technique was insensitive to variable aerosol properties and sensor viewing geometry. Application of the approach to the entire MODIS time-series (2000 present) may help identify factors controlling blooms and system responses to ongoing management efforts aimed at restoring flow to pre-drainage conditions. The method may also provide insights for algorithm development for other lagoonal estuaries that experience similar blooms.},

Abstract = {Eutrophication is characterized by excessive plant and algal growth due to the increased of organic matter, carbon dioxide and nutrients in water body, Although eutrophication naturally occurs over centuries as lakes age, human activities have accelerated it processes and caused dramatic changes to the aquatic ecosystems including elevated algae blooms and risk for hypoxia as well as degradation in the quality of drinking water and fisheries. Monitoring eutrophic processes is therefore highly important to human health and to the aquatic environment. However, the spatial and seasonal distribution of the phenomena and its dynamic are difficult to be resolved using conventional methods as water sampling or sparse acquisition of remote sensing data. This research work proposes a methodology that takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) for monitoring eutrophic reservoir. Specifically, it uses large temporal series of S2 images and advanced temporal unmixing model to estimate the abundance of {[}Chia] and algae species in San Roque reservoir, Argentina, in the period August 2016 to August 2019. The spatial patterns and the temporal tendencies of these aquatic indicators, that have a direct link to Eutrophication, were analysed and evaluated using in situ data in order to assess their contribution to the local water management.},

In addition, on-farm water productivity can be optimized by employing several irrigation scheduling protocols, and this review mainly focuses on commercial applications based on previous scientific findings. New advancements in remote sensing technologies, data processing, and management offer opportunities for optimizing decision making in terms of watering regime, particularly under the absence of water quality restrictions. For reducing deep percolation of water, it is important not only to properly determine the water requirements but also to tailor the frequency of irrigation to the soil characteristics and the growth of plant roots. Soil sensors are appropriate tools for achieving this goal, and several technologies are available and compared by considering their advantages and drawbacks. Current knowledge on models for computing water requirement is also considered for an integrated irrigation scheduling that combines data from different sources from the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. The best irrigation technologies for on-farm water application should be combined with irrigation scheduling programs based on the knowledge of soil characteristics and water requirements of local crops to minimize water contamination risks.},

Abstract = {The growth and concentration of population, housing and industry in urban and suburban areas in the continuous evolution of a city over time causes complex social, economic, and physical challenges. The population and its relationship with the use and development of the land and water is a critical issue of urban growth, and since ancient times land, water and man were directly involved in the human populations' survival. Nevertheless the current potential of study over this relationship between urban growth, water supply, drainage and water resources conditions becomes more and more attractive due to the possibility to make use of the broader variety of information sources and technologies readily available in recent years, with emphasis on the open data and on the big data as primary sources. In this regard we present some new possibilities of analyses over the demographics, land use/land cover and water supply and conservation based on a study over a Romanian region of development (Bucharest-Ilfov). As urban development usually outgrows the existing water supply systems, the resolution consists in drilling new and deeper wells, building new water distribution pipelines, building longer aqueducts and larger reservoirs, or finding new sources and constructing completely new water supply systems, water supplies may evolve this way from a result into a cause and driver of urban growth. The evolution trends of the studied area was estimated based on the open satellite time-series imagery and remote sensing techniques by land use/land cover extraction and the identification of the changes in urbanization. The survey is mainly focused on the expansion of the water network in terms of areal, total length and number of connections correlated with the amount of water produced, consumed and lost within a supply zone. Some urban human activities including the industrial ones alter water resource by pollution, over pumping of groundwater, construction of dams and reservoirs. In areas of rapid growth the worse problems came from the inadequate amount of potable water, the continuous deterioration of water quality and the slow progress in the water resources management and supply. The effects of urban dynamics over the water use and sustainability deserves an increasing study over the recent history in order to provide for an optimal management of the interrelationships between them.},

Abstract = {Cereal rye (Secale cereale sp.) is a cover crop species known to improve soil and water quality. Late-season biomass production is information growers need to maximize cover crop benefits and schedule field operations. Statistical learning, built upon statistical and computational algorithms that ``learn{''} from data, may help to improve predictions of cover crop biomass as a function of initial soil inorganic nitrogen levels. Three models-Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge, and Random Forest (RF)-were trained and optimized on a 3-yr allometric and remote sensing dataset of cereal rye responses to N fertilization in the mid-Atlantic northern and southeastern United States. Shoot biomass (mean, 9,800 kg ha(-1)) was accurately predicted with a RF model (RMSE, 2,039 kg ha(-1)). Targeting shoot N content (mean, 107 kg ha(-1)), on the other hand, LASSO made accurate and more stable predictions (RMSE, 34 kg ha(-1)). Early-season information (cover crop C/N ratio, tiller counts, and ground-sensed normalized difference vegetation index) contributed to enhancing biomass and N content predictions. A final test on untrained data revealed that 92 and 73\% of the predictions from either algorithm corresponded to ground-truthed biomass and shoot N content observed under different N regimes. Modern data-intensive approaches, such as statistical learning, show promise to characterize end-season performance of a cover crop and may contribute to better farm decision-making.},

Abstract = {Chlorophyll-a plays an essential biochemical role in the eutrophication process, and is widely considered an important water quality indicator for assessing human activity's effects on aquatic ecosystems. Herein, 20 years of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were applied to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in the eutrophic Lake Taihu, based on a new empirical model. The validated results suggested that our developed model presented appreciable performance in estimating Chla, with a root mean square error (MAPE) of 12.95 mu g/L and mean absolute percentage error (RMSE) of 29.98\%. Long-term MODIS observations suggested that the Chla of Lake Taihu experienced an overall increasing trend and significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity during 2002-2021. A driving factor analysis indicated that precipitation and air temperature had a significant impact on the monthly dynamics of Chla, while chemical fertilizer consumption, municipal wastewater, industrial sewage, precipitation, and air temperature were important driving factors and together explained more than 81\% of the long-term dynamics of Chla. This study provides a 20 year recorded dataset of Chla for inland waters, offering new insights for future precise eutrophication control and efficient water resource management.},

Abstract = {The Yellow River basin is the largest one in North West and North China, covering 752 thousand km(2) and accounting for 8\% of the area of China. The basin is characterized by arid and semi-and climate, the Loess Plateau, and industrially developing and highly cultivated area. It has been suffering from water shortage and heavy sediment transport. Appropriate allocation of water resources is of importance in the basin for development and sustainability. Appropriate allocation of water resources would bring better ecosystem and higher sustainability with wise water use, efficient water reuse, and discharge of wastewater after appropriate treatment. Allocation of water resources to the sectors; agriculture, industry, daily lives, and ecosystem, is a matter of policy and economy. Water use with high efficiency is of technology and of social systems, and water reuse is of technology, health risk, and economy. In order to reach more appropriate allocation, what have to be done are to construct an integrated modeling on water quality mid quantity in an objective area and to simulate future figures in the area. Since polluted water, even if it is fresh water, does not become water resources, water quality is of necessity for water reuse. In this study, an integrated water quantity and quality model is developed to apply to the Weilie basin, the major tributary of the Yellow River, as an objective area. The model consists of two sub-models, a water circulation sub-model and a water quality sub model, which are based on the GBHM2 model (geomorphology-based hydrological model 2) and the Streeter-Phelps model with the 1-D diffusion term, respectively. In order to make water reuse with high efficiency possible, discharging points are also identified. The pattern of precipitation, surface flow rates, the groundwater flow level, and evapotranspiration rates are taken into consideration in it. The amount of evapotranspinition is estimated with the Penman-Monteith method and with hourly changes of temperature and precipitation. Parameterization and determination of boundary and initial conditions are done by use of GIS data, satellite images, observation data on site, and statistical data by the central and local Chinese Governments. The units of discharged Pollutants and water consumption are developed based on relevant statistical data for simulation. This model constructed is available to simulate the rates of evapotranspiration, penetration, runoff, and river flow rates, especially peak flow rates. Simulated BOD, DO, nitrogens, phosphorus and suspended solids in the Weihe River agreed well with measured ones. It is estimated that water quality in the Weihe River would be improved when the ratio of wastewater treatment reaches 80\%/},

Abstract = {In China, the increase in exogenous-source pollutants from rivers is one of the most important causes of lake eutrophication. The application of remote sensing technology to water quality monitoring of rivers connected to these lakes has special significance for lake management at regional scales. Many research studies have estimated water clarity using Landsat imagery. However, most of this work focused on lakes or reservoirs, for which abundant water-only pixels (i.e., pure pixels of water, PPW) were available. Few of these studies have addressed rivers, especially rivers with an average width less than 100 m. In our study, we sought to determine whether water clarity in the rivers connected to Taihu Lake could be estimated using Landsat imagery. We obtained 18 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images from 2009 for 13 rivers ranging from an average of 37.3 to 173.6 m wide. Three field campaigns conducted in May 2009, September 2009, and January 2010 were used to obtain field measurements of Secchi disk depth (SDD). Our results suggested that the widely used model, a(TM1/TM3) + b(TM1)+ c, was suitable for the estimation of SDD for Taihu Lake. The brightness of the panchromatic band of ETM+ showed significant correlations with TM1, TM3 and TM1/TM3 (p < 0.001). As a result, SDD in the lake could also be estimated using the Landsat panchromatic band. The multispectral image of ETM+ did not provide adequate PPW for estimation of water clarity in rivers. However, PPW derived from the panchromatic image captured about 93\% of the variation in SOD, on average, for the every worst-case scenario in the 13 rivers. Using the PPW in rivers, a significant correlation was found between the brightness of the panchromatic image and SDD (R-2 = 0.64, p < 0.001). Our results demonstrate that the panchromatic image of Landsat, but not the multispectral image, can be used to estimate water clarity in rivers with an average width greater than 40 m in the Taihu basin.

Title = {Monitoring of Urban Black-Odor Water Based on Nemerow Index and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Regression Using UAV-Borne Hyperspectral Imagery},

Abstract = {The formation of black-odor water in urban rivers has a long history. It not only seriously affects the image of the city, but also easily breeds germs and damages the urban habitat. The prevention and treatment of urban black-odor water have long been important topics nationwide. ``Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution{''} issued by the State Council shows Chinese government's high attention to this issue. However, treatment and monitoring are inextricably linked. There are few studies on the large-scale monitoring of black-odor water, especially the cases of using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to efficiently and accurately monitor the spatial distribution of urban river pollution. Therefore, in order to get rid of the limitations of traditional ground sampling to evaluate the point source pollution of rivers, the UAV-borne hyperspectral imagery was applied in this paper. It is hoped to grasp the pollution status of the entire river as soon as possible from the surface. However, the retrieval of multiple water quality parameters will lead to cumulative errors, so the Nemerow comprehensive pollution index (NCPI) is introduced to characterize the pollution level of urban water. In the paper, the retrieval results of six regression models including gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDTR) were compared, trying to find a regression model for the retrieval NCPI in the current scenario. In the first study area, the retrieval accuracy of the training dataset (adjusted\_R-2 = 0.978), and test dataset (adjusted\_R-2 = 0.974) was higher than that of the other regression models. Although the retrieval effect of random forest is similar to that of GBDTR in both training accuracy and image inversion, it is more computationally expensive. Finally, the spatial distribution graphs of NCPI and its technical feasibility in monitoring pollution sources were investigated, in combination with field observations.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {9},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examines urban quality of life by assessing the relationship between observed socioeconomic conditions and urban forest amenities in Terre Haute, Indiana, USA. Using remote-sensing methods and techniques, and ordinary least squares regression, the paper determines the relationship between urban leaf area and a population density parameter with median income and median housing value. Results demonstrate positive correlations between urban leaf area, population density, and their interaction with median income and median housing value. Furthermore, leaf area, density, and their interaction statistically account for observed variance in median income and median housing value, indicating that these variables may be used to study observed quality-of-life metrics. The methods used in this study may be useful to city managers, planners, and foresters who are concerned with urban quality-of-life issues, and who are interested in developing and implementing alternative policy assessment regimes.},

Title = {Remote Sensing of Volcanic Processes and Risk},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Remote sensing data and methods are increasingly being embedded into assessments of volcanic processes and risk. This happens thanks to their capability to provide a spectrum of observation and measurement opportunities to accurately sense the dynamics, magnitude, frequency, and impacts of volcanic activity in the ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), infrared (IR), and microwave domains. Launched in mid-2018, the Special Issue ``Remote Sensing of Volcanic Processes and Risk{''} ofRemote Sensinggathers 19 research papers on the use of satellite, aerial, and ground-based remote sensing to detect thermal features and anomalies, investigate lava and pyroclastic flows, predict the flow path of lahars, measure gas emissions and plumes, and estimate ground deformation. The strong multi-disciplinary character of the approaches employed for volcano monitoring and the combination of a variety of sensor types, platforms, and methods that come out from the papers testify the current scientific and technology trends toward multi-data and multi-sensor monitoring solutions. The research advances presented in the published papers are achieved thanks to a wealth of data including but not limited to the following: thermal IR from satellite missions (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, ASTER, TET-1) and ground-based stations (e.g., FLIR cameras); digital elevation/surface models from airborne sensors (e.g., Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), or 3D laser scans) and satellite imagery (e.g., tri-stereo Pleiades, SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope); airborne hyperspectral surveys; geophysics (e.g., ground-penetrating radar, electromagnetic induction, magnetic survey); ground-based acoustic infrasound; ground-based scanning UV spectrometers; and ground-based and satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging (e.g., TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2). Data processing approaches and methods include change detection, offset tracking, Interferometric SAR (InSAR), photogrammetry, hotspots and anomalies detection, neural networks, numerical modeling, inversion modeling, wavelet transforms, and image segmentation. Some authors also share codes for automated data analysis and demonstrate methods for post-processing standard products that are made available for end users, and which are expected to stimulate the research community to exploit them in other volcanological application contexts. The geographic breath is global, with case studies in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Hawai'i, Alaska, Kamchatka, Japan, Indonesia, Vanuatu, Reunion Island, Ethiopia, Canary Islands, Greece, Italy, and Iceland. The added value of the published research lies on the demonstration of the benefits that these remote sensing technologies have brought to knowledge of volcanoes that pose risk to local communities; back-analysis and critical revision of recent volcanic eruptions and unrest periods; and improvement of modeling and prediction methods. Therefore, this Special Issue provides not only a collection of forefront research in remote sensing applied to volcanology, but also a selection of case studies proving the societal impact that this scientific discipline can potentially generate on volcanic hazard and risk management.},

Abstract = {Regional eco-environmental quality is the foundation of economic sustainable development and rational utilization of resources. It is necessary to understand and evaluate the regional eco-environmental quality correctly. Based on national remote sensing land use data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and some other statistical data, this paper established an eco-environmental quality index (EQI) model to evaluate the ecological status of Jinan from 2000 to 2011. The results of eco-environmental quality showed little variation, with EQI values ranged from 62.00 to 69.01. EQI of each region in Jinan firstly decreased sharply and then increased slowly with the development of local economy. Besides the spatial and temporal variations analysis, affecting factors of eco-environmental quality was also discussed in this article. According to the results of correlation and regression analysis, meteorological conditions (rainfall and sunshine duration) and industrial structure (the proportion of primary industry) had relatively high correlations with eco-environmental quality. To summarize, a better eco-environmental status is associated with increasing rainfall, shorter sunshine duration, and lower proportion of primary industry. This article aims to giving supporting data and decision-making bases to restore the ecological environment and promote the sustainable development of Jinan.},

Abstract = {Expansion of rotational timber harvesting of mangroves is set to increase, particularly given greater recognition of the economic, societal and environmental benefits. Generic and standardized procedures for monitoring mangroves are, therefore, needed to ensure their long-term sustainable utilisation. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), Perak State, Peninsular Malaysia, thematic and continuous environmental descriptors with defined codes or units, including lifeform, forest age (years), canopy cover (\%), above-ground biomass (Mg ha(-1)) and relative amounts of woody debris (\%), were retrieved from time-series data from spaceborne optical and single/dual polarimetric and interferometric RADAR. These were then combined for multiple points in time to generate land cover and evidence-based change maps according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and using the framework of the Earth Observation Data for Ecosystem Monitoring (EODESM). Change maps were based on a pre-defined taxonomy, with focus on clear cutting and regrowth. Uncertainties surrounding the land cover and change maps were based on those determined for the environmental descriptors used for their generation and through comparison with independent retrieval from other EO data sources. For the MMFR and also for other mangroves worldwide where harvesting is occurring or being considered, a new approach and opportunity for supporting management of mangroves is presented, which has application for future planning of mangrove resources.},

Title = {Potential of Applying Novel Monitoring and Management Methods to Siberian Landscapes},
Booktitle = {NOVEL METHODS FOR MONITORING AND MANAGING LAND AND WATER RESOURCES IN SIBERIA},
Series = {Springer Water},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {719-760},
Abstract = {This chapter reviews and summarises the overall content of the book ``Novel Methods for Monitoring and Managing Land and Water Resources in Siberia{''}. The book starts with an extended analysis of water and land resources, characterising the natural conditions of Siberian landscapes, their ecosystems, crucial processes and human impacts on soil and water quality. The status of research and monitoring is characterised in another chapter, pointing both on substantial progress achieved during the past decades, but also on gaps in our knowledge. Both chapters reveal the Siberian landscapes' great potential for economically and ecologically viable business activities, but also inefficient and unsustainable land and water management practices and the decay of the rural infrastructure. Sustainable practices should be introduced soon, and this must be based on modern monitoring and management technologies. Some more studies show that thorough and innovative research and monitoring of water and land quality is provided by Siberian institutes and their leading researchers. Addressing climate change requires innovations in landscape research. Further book chapters deal with modern monitoring and management methods developed outside Siberia but having clear potential for application. We depict some highlights which could (a) lead to a significant knowledge shift, (b) initiate sustainable soil resource use and (c) trigger substantial improvement of the ecosystem status, if introduced into Siberia or applied there very soon on a wide scale. These are (1) soil and hydrological laboratory measurement methods, (2) process-based field measurement and evaluation methods of land and water quality, (3) remote sensing and GIS technology-based landscape monitoring methods, (4) process and ecosystem modelling approaches, (5) methods of resource and process evaluation and functional soil mapping and (6) tools for controlling agricultural land use systems such as nutrient balancing methods, conservation agriculture and their technologies. More than 15 concrete monitoring and management tools could immediately be introduced into research and practice, some of them without monetary investment. We conclude that strengthening international and national research cooperation in these fields will be a key for making novel methods operational. Agri-environmental research projects should have high priority as gaps in our knowledge are particular high, and a particularly large amount of novel measurement, evaluation, modelling and management tools are available. Various tools are ready for immediate introduction into Siberian landscapes in the framework of mutual pilot projects: state-of-the-science field monitoring technologies for soil and forest hydrology (EEM-HYPROP, virtual and real lysimeters), agro-ecological models and DSS (MONICA, LandCare-DSS), soil and land quality classification and evaluation tools (WRB 2014, Muencheberg-SQR), nutrient balancing tools, and technologies of conservation agriculture. The role of internationally linked monitoring capacities is particularly emphasised, with some existing stations established in the vast agri-environmental monitoring network and others to be newly built in remote regions of Siberia and the Far East, and supported by the latest remote sensing technologies. The book contributors represent an immense innovation network which should be employed to achieve both significant disciplinary and synergetic outreach effects. This should be imbedded into more sustainable strategies aiming at research cooperation between partners from EU countries, the Russian Federation and countries of Central Asia. Maintaining the functions of great landscapes for future human generations will be the reward of those efforts.},

Abstract = {The traditional methods of sampling plays an important role in the wetland ecosystem health assessment, but there also exists some problems such as a waste of human and financial resources and the limition of the number of sampling points. Remote sensing technology can obtain surface data for long time series, which has important advantages in wetland structural change and ecological health assessment. In this paper, the characteristics of wetland structure of Wuliangsuhai in the past 40 years from 1977 to 2015 were studied by using multi-temporal LandSAT data. The driving factors of wetland structure change were analyzed. The ecological health of Wuliangsuhai wetland was evaluated based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model. The results showed that: (1) In 1997, the wetland structure was dominated by the water, and the water area was 61.70\% of the whole wetland area. With the decrease of the water area and the increase of the reed area, the reed and water became the main types of wetland structure during the period from 1998 to 2006. The total area of wetland was 50\% higher than that of wetland in 2015, and the structure of wetland was changed from water to reed in 1977. (2) The ecological health status of Wuliangsuhai wetland was in an alert state from 1977 to 1996. The ecological function level of the Wuliangsuhai wetland was degraded, but the ecological system could be maintained. The ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai Wetland in 2006 and 2015 changed from the original alert state to a good state, but the comprehensive evaluation index was in the lower limit of the good condition, which indicated that the ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai wetland had improved, the external pressure was decreased but not obvious. The results provide scientific basis for the management of Wuliangsuhai wetland, and have important reference value for monitoring the structure and health status of wetland via remote sensing data.},

Abstract = {Regulation both promotes and suppresses innovation. Good regulation is effective in terms of realizing social values and objectives, and is efficient in promoting economic activities by minimizing direct and indirect costs. The use of alternatives rather than traditional prescriptive approaches has been encouraged, but is still the challenge of policy makers and researchers who still lack the expertise to introduce alternatives in regulation. In this paper, the authors discuss the regulation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs), because sUAVs are advantageous in a variety of sectors although they also violate the safety of people, buildings, vehicles, and manned aircraft. This paper focuses on the current discourse on sUAV safety regulations in Japan, and extends the System-theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) approach to assess the current regulations. The authors highlight four safety concerns and show alternative ways for more effective and efficient regulation in terms of the expectations of stakeholders for alternative regulation.},

Abstract = {The nonpoint source Pollution model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to understand management options that may improve water quality in the Laguna de Santa Rosa watershed in Sonoma County, California. Surface water quality in the Laguna watershed has been significantly impaired over recent years, as natural land cover has been urbanized or converted,to agricultural uses. We first generated new maps of land cover and major land uses from satellite and airborne imagery for the watershed. The SWAT model Output was checked against six streamflow gauges in the watershed. At the monthly time step, we found that the precalibrated model performed well at all gauges, with the coefficient of determination (r(2)) values ranging from 0.81 to 0.92. Calibration by modifications of groundwater extraction in the watershed resulted in notable increases to correlation Values at all gauges, except at upstream locations on Santa Rosa Creek and Mark West Creek. Measured seasonal trends in sediment concentrations were tracked closely by the SWAT model predictions. Highest sediment loading rates were associated in the model results with pasture, rangeland, and vineyard cover areas. Model scenarios were tested for vegetation filter strips and improved ground cover conditions applied in subbasins, where soil erosion was shown to be elevated in previous simulations.},

Abstract = {Global warming is increasing the frequency and duration of heat waves, which is defined as when air temperature exceeds a threshold for more than specific consecutive days. Ecosystem around the globe will be impaired by heat waves just like the exposures to dangerously high temperatures as a public health threat to human. However, the knowledge of the response of lake and reservoir ecosystem to heat waves is largely unknown although it has been argued that climate warming may increase the incidence of harmful algal blooms. We examined the long-term trend of heat waves and how the variability of phytoplankton biomass responds to lake heat waves on a deep reservoir (Lake Qiandaohu). Long-term (1980-2020) meteorological observation in the lake watershed showed a significant warming trend of 0.36 degrees C per decade for the yearly average of daily average air temperature and the yearly average of daily maximum air temperature of 18.32 degrees C was observed in 2016. Meanwhile, a significant increasing number of heat wave events lasting longer was observed, and Lake Qiandaohu suffered an unusually severe lake heat wave in summer 2016. Significant correlations were found between the yearly average of daily maximum air temperature and heat days, heat wave events, and heat wave days. Nuisance phytoplankton bloom was found in Lake Qiandaohu by high frequency observation and remote sensing monitoring in summer 2016. Remote sensing estimation from two Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images showed that the average chlorophyll a (Chla) was 7.45 +/- 4.89 mu g/L on July 18 before heat wave and 18.96 +/- 0.98 mu g/L on August 19 during the heat wave. Two heat wave events lasting from July 20 to August 2 and August 11 to 26 with average surface water temperature of 29.93 and 31.99 degrees C promoted two marked phytoplankton blooms with average Chla concentrations of 11.75 +/- 4.08 and 10.53 +/- 1.65 mu g/L in the central lake region, respectively, as evidenced by high-frequency buoy data. These findings suggest that heat waves are likely to yield an increased threat of harmful algal bloom in freshwater ecosystems. With lake heat waves projected to increase in frequency, duration, and spatial extent with global climate change, more studies are needed to improve our understanding of lake heat waves and their potential effects on the species, communities, frequency of phytoplankton bloom, and also help providing advanced schemes of water quality management.},

Title = {Mapping groundwater-dependent ecosystems in arid Central Asia: Implications for controlling regional land degradation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {797},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) exist all over the world, especially in water-limited regions. To achieve better water management, it is necessary to map and identify GDEs. Central Asia (CA) is one of the most arid regions in the mid-latitudes and one of the major regions with shallow groundwater tables. However, the role of groundwater in the impacts of climate change and regional anthropogenic activities on environmental risks, especially regional desertification, is inadequately understood due to the limited available research on GDEs. In the present study, a remote sensing-based method was used for mapping GDEs in regional CA, and three means-overlay analysis, correlation analysis, and the water balance method-were adopted to validate the accuracy of the mapping outcomes. Our results indicated that: 1) GDEs were concentrated around large lakes and in central Kazakhstan (between 46 degrees N and 50 degrees N latitudes), and areas ``Very Likely{''} and ``Likely{''} to be GDEs accounted for 36.89\%, and 28.85\% of the total natural vegetation areas, respectively; 2) at the watershed scale, the Sarysu Basin had the largest proportion (94.02\% of the area) of potential GDEs while the Ysyk-Kol Basin had the lowest proportion (17.84\%); 3) all the three validation methods indicated a good performance for our GDE mapping results. We concluded that the remote sensing-based GDE identification method can be considered a potential approach for mapping GDEs regionally. Better recognition of relationships among groundwater availability, ecosystem health and groundwater management policies should be developed by conducting further studies, to protect GDEs and to prevent regional land degradation.

Abstract = {Appropriate assessment of groundwater is important to ensure sustainable and safe use of this natural resource. However, evaluating overall groundwater quality is difficult due to the spatial variability of multiple contaminants. This research proposes a geographical information system (GIS)-based groundwater quality pollution mapping technique, which synthesizes different available water quality data, normalized with the World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The normalized difference index (NDI) is used to perform the normalization process. This study utilizes a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) script (MATLAB 10.0), developed to assign weights to each of the analysed water quality parameters. The consistency of judgments of weight assignment is further analysed using the consistency ratio (CR) and consistency index (CI) techniques. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) C-band radar and Landsat TM satellite image data are used to derive a digital elevation model (DEM) and land-use/land-cover map of the area. A new sensitivity analysis method is introduced to estimate the responsible factors associated with the proposed groundwater pollution zone model (GPZM). Multivariate analysis methods, such as factor analysis (FA), cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), are used to uncover the latent structure of the data, to understand the correlations across hierarchical levels, and for dimensionality reduction, respectively.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {The Iter 34 (Antonine Itinerary XXXIV) is the name of the Roman road that crosses the province of alava from west to east. Since no specific path was officially recognized before our study, the remains of the road did not benefit from heritage protection. In 2017, we made a project to determine the course of the road through rural alava. In addition to traditional archaeological excavation and prospecting techniques, we used UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) to produce NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) orthomosaic plans of ten cultivated areas through which the road is conjectured to pass. NDVI orthomosaics let us see crop marks better than with conventional photography, allowing us to detect the crop marks during times of the year and in places where conventional photography would fail to show them. Thanks to the NDVI orthomosaics, remains of the road were identified not only in places where we knew it existed, but also in previously unknown locations. Furthermore, other archaeological features were identified close to the roadway. This technique heralds a great advance in non-invasive methods of archaeological surveying. By using precision farming techniques we have identified the course of the Roman road Iter 34 in several locations in a short period of time and with few resources.},

Abstract = {Summer tourism is the most important economic factor along the inner and especially outer Baltic Sea coasts of the Oder estuary at the German/Polish border. Due to heavy nutrient load of the river Oder especially the large Oder Lagoon (680 km(2)) suffers from severe eutrophication. Heavy cyanobacteria blooms and high water turbidity are common during summer and a problem for further tourist development. Three applications of a flexible two-dimensional flow and transport model system covering extremely different spatial scales are presented to underline the value of this simple tool for research and coastal management: a) Water flow and transport simulations in the Oder Lagoon during the extreme Oder flood of August 1997 were used to explain the large scale suspended matter and algae (Mycrocystis) distribution, visible on satellite images. b) flow simulations were conducted to analyse an extreme small-scale sub-surface patchiness of Ceratium in a sheltered bay (0.15 km(2)). c) The model was applied to simulate flow in a littoral zone and inside reed stands. Algae patchiness is visible on very different spatial scales and hydrodynamics plays a major role for its formation. The model system with its modifications, like spatial wind inhomogeneity, spatially variable bottom friction and locally increased grid density allowed to tackle problems with different spatial scales and to achieve a closer linkage between hydro-physics and biology. It is a valuable tool to predict the transport of algae and the endangerment of beaches. In this regard remote sensing is an important supporting method.},

Abstract = {Impervious surfaces have a significant impact on urban runoff, groundwater, base flow, water quality, and climate. Increase in Anthropogenic Impervious Surfaces (AIS) for a region is a true representation of urban expansion. Monitoring of AIS in an urban region is helpful for better urban planning and resource management. Cost effective and efficient maps of AIS can be obtained for larger areas using remote sensing techniques. In the present study, extraction of AIS has been carried out using Double window Flexible Pace Search (DFPS) from a new index named as Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (NDAISI). NDAISI is developed by enhancing Biophysical Composition Index (BCI) in two stages using a new Modified Normalized Difference Soil Index (MNDSI). MNDSI has been developed from Band 7 and Band 8 (PAN) of Landsat 8 data. In comparison to existing impervious surface extraction methods, the new NDAISI approach is able to improve Spectral Discrimination Index (SDI) for bare soil and AIS significantly. Overall accuracy of mapping of AIS, using NDAISI approach has been found to be increased by nearly 23\% when compared with existing impervious surface extraction methods.},

Abstract = {The north-central region of Indiana in the Midwestern United States was covered by deciduous forest, but was largely cleared for agriculture during the 1800s. The landscape has experienced tremendous change due to forest restoration, urban expansion, and reservoir construction since the early 1900s. At the same time, ecological health and environmental quality have been dramatically degraded in the region. We used simple landscape indices, such as land proportion, TE, and Shared Edge Length (SEL) between any two classes, to examine changes in the spatial patterning of six land cover types, including agriculture, grassland, closed-canopy forest, open-canopy forest, urban, and water, using aerial photographs dating from 1940 to 1998. The landscape's domination by agriculture did not change (65\% in 1940 and 57\% in 1998), but there were net gains in area for closed-canopy forest (79\%), urban (256\%), and water (125\%). Several landscape indices did not change much but SEL between closed-canopy forest and urban increased over seven fold, and SEL between water and urban increased over eight fold from 1940 to 1998. More forestlands and water bodies were exposed to human activities. The clumped pattern of forest, water, and urban in a landscape can be ecologically detrimental and should be considered in future land-use decisions.},

Abstract = {The study provides an assessment of sand dredging activities from the bottom of the sea during 2016 in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Total Suspended Solids were analyzed from 2010 until 2016 in the northern and eastern locations according to theManual of oceanographic observations and pollutant analyses methods. Fifty five percent of sand dredging companies complied with some legislation such as air quality and occupational health. Almost all lacked any compliancy evidence supporting environmental protection. Only 9\% of these sand companies use siltation processes to the dredged materials. Siltation is an important step to avoid dispersion of sand into the marine environment. Ambient Total Suspended Solids was around 6.1 mgl(-1)+/- Standard Error and the study recommends 10 mgl(-1)level as an accepted concentration in samples taken from 500 meters away from the dredgers and 100 mgl(-1)in samples taken from the middle of the generated silt plumes. The effect of climatic temperatures, dust storms and rain levels on seawater Total Suspended Solids concentration has been briefly discussed. The study concludes no significance seasonal or spatial variation on the ambient Total Suspended Solids concentration. It recommends coupling remote sensing with the conventional data collection and integration of modelling efforts for effective cost benefit monitoring and management of the coastal waters.},

Title = {Applications of Vegetative Indices from Remote Sensing to Agriculture: Past and Future},
Journal = {INVENTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Remote sensing offers the capability of observing an object without being in contact with the object. Throughout the recent history of agriculture, researchers have observed that different wavelengths of light are reflected differently by plant leaves or canopies and that these differences could be used to determine plant biophysical characteristics, e.g., leaf chlorophyll, plant biomass, leaf area, phenological development, type of plant, photosynthetic activity, or amount of ground cover. These reflectance differences could also extend to the soil to determine topsoil properties. The objective of this review is to evaluate how past research can prepare us to utilize remote sensing more effectively in future applications. To estimate plant characteristics, combinations of wavebands may be placed into a vegetative index (VI), i.e., combinations of wavebands related to a specific biophysical characteristic. These VIs can express differences in plant response to their soil, meteorological, or management environment and could then be used to determine how the crop could be managed to enhance its productivity. In the past decade, there has been an expanded use of machine learning to determine how remote sensing can be used more effectively in decision-making. The application of artificial intelligence into the dynamics of agriculture will provide new opportunities for how we can utilize the information we have available more effectively. This can lead to linkages with robotic systems capable of being directed to specific areas of a field, an orchard, a pasture, or a vineyard to correct a problem. Our challenge will be to develop and evaluate these relationships so they will provide a benefit to our food security and environmental quality.},

Abstract = {This paper traces the evolution of space-derived remote sensing data and data products from their initial dissemination to their eventual impact on the nature and outcome of public policy addressing climate change issues. We focus on two examples, renewable energy and Public health and ecosystem assessment, in tracing US policy debate and the influence of science results on that debate. The research seeks to answer the question posed by Congress. NASA administrators. and other decision makers about what has been the contribution of space-derived earth science in ``making a difference{''} in societal well being. We find that even though policymakers themselves can be unaware of the role of earth science. Much of their debate is informed (or not) depending on the extent to which science results have been appropriately translated and communicated for purposes of improving the quality of debate. The usual ``route{''} of influence is by way of ``decision Support systems.{''} or the collection of tools. methods, and data that enable researchers to use earth science in scenarios that ask ``what if{''} or ``what causes.{''} Research results are increasingly being carried forward to policy debate including but not limited to Public and ecosystem health, carbon management, and energy issues.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {190},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces play a significant role in management of physical activity, psychological well-being, and public health of urban residents. With the expansion of urban areas in Turkey during the past decades, urban green spaces have been fragmented and dispersed causing impairment and environmental degradation. The purpose of this study is to model urban green space distribution by focusing on the landscape fragmentation in city of Osmaniye using remote sensing and geographic information system technology. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and urban landscape ratio (ULR) were used to assess the proximity and spatial arrangement of urban green spaces within the neighbor landscapes to quantify the urban land use effect. The geospatial analysis results showed that increase in total built-up area and population has significantly decreased the urban green space cover because of high levels of landscape fragmentation in urban city center. Also, due to high levels of landscape fragmentation, approximately 45\% of the Osmaniye city is estimated to become urbanized by 2030. This study demonstrated the benefits of directional vegetation index application with geospatial analyses in characterizing the environmental quality for planning and management of urban green spaces. This approach could be used for determining the future urban land development scenarios correlating with regional planning procedures.},

Title = {Instability of remote sensing ecological index and its optimisation for time frequency and scale},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {72},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Evaluating regional ecological environmental quality (EEQ) using remote sensing is important for achieving sustainable development. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is a typical EEQ evaluation model used to comprehensively reflect regional ecological quality. However, owing to its complete dependence on remote sensing image information, the RSEI also has inherent issues, including unstable time series and inconsistent resolutions of its four sub-indices. To address these problems, this study used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to propose an optimisation notion for the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) coupled random forest (RF) model and determined the accuracy and image quality of the optimised RSEI (RSEIo) for the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Based on the findings, HANTS could fill the gaps in the images, effectively reducing the noise and discrete degrees of the four indices and thereby improving the stability of the RSEI. The correlation coefficient (R) between the RSEI and RSEIo was 0.93, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13, indicating that RSEIo is reliable. The image quality assessment (based on contrast and information entropy) indicates that HANTS combined with the RF model can produce RSEIo images with higher definitions and richer information at a constant spatial resolution. Further, the pixel-by-pixel coefficient of variation evaluation indicates that the RSEIo image was highly stabilised, yielding higher numbers of effective RSEIo images without changing the temporal resolution. Compared with traditional RSEI calculations, the optimisation proposal herein could highlight ecological differences caused by topographic changes in the YRB, which would produce an RSEI closer to actual surface conditions. Further, this proposed method could be used to obtain more detailed ecological information at a constant spatiotemporal resolution, thereby meeting the needs of long-term ecological monitoring in largescale regions.},

Title = {Evaluating the relationship between groundwater quality and land use in an urbanized watershed},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 30},
Abstract = {Understanding the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality is critical. Effective water management requires understanding the relationship between land use and water quality. The study's goals were to compare the effects of land use, identify the types of land that impact hydrochemistry, and define how different land use affects water quality. For this purpose, the comparative relationship between groundwater quality, land use classes and landscape metrics were established for the years 2016 and 2021. Water samples were collected from 42 wells, and different hydro-chemical variables were considered to calculate the water quality index (WQI). The WQI value in 2016 ranged from 26.49 to 151.03 and 29.65 to 155.62 in 2021. The results indicate that the water quality in most parts of the study area is moderate for drinking and domestic purpose use. The google earth engine platform was used and radiometrically corrected and orthorectified Sentinel-2 satellite images were processed to classify land use classes for selected years. Five buffer zones were established within a 2-km watershed along each well site, and the effects of land use types and landscape metrics on water quality in the buffer zones were analyzed. Results revealed that the effects of land use types on water quality were mainly reflected in buffer 1 (B1), buffer 4 (B4), buffer 5 (B5) in 2016 and B1, buffer 3 (B3), and B5 in 2021. The impacts of landscape-level metrics on water quality are mainly reflected in buffer 2 (B2) and B3 in 2021, while at the class-level, they are mainly reflected in B1 and B4 in 2021. The redundancy analysis revealed that different hydro-chemical variables behaved differently with the land use classes and landscape metrics in the various buffer zones.},

Abstract = {Urban areas have witnessed an inexorable expansion in population density, urban sprawl, industrialization and agricultural activities in the past few decades. Withdrawal of groundwater to meet water demand has resulted in over-drafting of aquifers and, commonly, lowered water tables in many urban centres of India, like Delhi, Lucknow, Patna, Kolkata and others. Overdraft has also deteriorated the chemical and biogeochemical quality of surface water and groundwater. This paper highlights some of the research approaches, namely hydrogeochemical investigation, groundwater modeling, and use of geographic information systems and remote sensing, used worldwide to resolve issues specific to urban groundwater. The paper also highlights approaches that are practiced internationally (combined hydrogeologic and multi-isotopic studies, integrated modeling techniques, etc.) but still need to be developed on a large scale in India. A detailed overview of the literature indicates the need for a more holistic approach incorporating various types of conceptual and management models to strengthen the research level in India and elsewhere. For instance, a computational tool that can incorporate different models, such as for urban water and contaminant balance and pipeline leakage, should be developed to generate predefined scenarios of potential groundwater contamination and help in the socio-economic analysis of different scenarios. In hydrogeochemical approaches, multi-isotope ratios should be coupled with hydrogeologic approaches for better understanding of water quality problems.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a large analysis of environmental data gaps in countries of the Black Sea catchment performed in the context of the FP7 enviroGRIDS project in 2010. We also assessed the level of compatibility of the data to the European directive establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) and to the international standards of data interoperability as advocated by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and implemented in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Many environmental datasets were analyzed at different scales (national, regional, European, and global) and the analysis revealed gaps in spatial and temporal environmental data coverage and problem of data compatibility at different scales. The analysis enabled the identification of areas where further efforts are needed to reinforce the existing observation systems in the region, such as monitoring systems to provide data on water quality in rivers, on the state of marine environments, or on pollution and nutrients loads from land based sources. A significant proportion of environmental datasets is not accessible or has limited access, so further efforts are needed to make them available to decision makers and scientists following the GEO data sharing principles. Compatibilities of many data sets and observation systems to international interoperability standards are low in this region, and we discuss what further efforts are needed to improve the situation and how this is relevant to environmental policies.

Abstract = {Environmental changes significantly affect urban ecological systems that are supported by green infrastructure. Therefore, assessment of the health of green infrastructure is virtually a quality assessment of the residential environment. For the sustainable and healthy management of urban environments, we need an effective system for estimating, diagnosing, and constructing assessment tools for green infrastructure. In this study, remote sensing technology was used to assess the green infrastructure of the Taipei metropolitan area (Taiwan) in a systematic way. To this end, we used the comprehensive index method of vigor, organization, and resilience (VOR) to classify a landscape index and to construct a healthy assessment index. We determined the primary index and weights using the entropy weighting method to establish the assessment model. We show that the core of the metropolitan area lacks green infrastructure with the lowest VOR index, thus indicating that this district requires government-supervised intervention and improvement. We prove that the increase in green infrastructure has a promoting effect on the impact of various health assessment evaluations, and it will gradually slow down and get stabilized after reaching a certain degree. The entropy weighting method can make the data model more stable and reliable, making the results more representative.},

Title = {Flood monitoring by integration of Remote Sensing technique and Multi-Criteria Decision Making method},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Traditional methodologies of flood monitoring are generally time-consuming and demanding tasks. In most cases, there is no possibility of flood monitoring in large areas. Due to the major drawbacks of conventional methods in flood detection of large districts, Remote Sensing (RS) has been efficiently employed as the best solution owing to its being synoptic view and cost-effective methodologies. One of the most challenging issues in RS technologies is choosing the optimal spectral bands to detect changes in the natural environment. In this research, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE), as one of the most widely used Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, was applied to select the optimal bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images for detection of flood-affected areas. For this purpose, the decision-making method was implemented during ten options and six criteria. The properties of the Sentinel-2 satellite images consisted of ten bands (with 10 and 20m spatial resolutions) and the criteria are the signal to noise ratio (SNR) related to sensor, standard deviation, variance, the SNR related to the bands, spatial resolution, and wavelength. Afterward, the ELECTRE technique was used to select six optimal bands among ten bands. The ELECTRE algorithm was programmed in MATLAB programming language that could make decisions with multiple options and multiple criteria. Furthermore, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, as one of the most powerful Machine Learning (ML) models, has been applied to classify the water bodies related to before and after the flood. According to the results of optimal bands classification, Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) for the pre-flood classification were 93.65 percent and 0.923, respectively, and for the post-flood classification, the OA and KC values were 94.52 percent and 0.935 respectively. In the case of before and after flooding, the results of classification model for optimal bands had more accuracy levels in comparison with those obtained by original bands. Generally, it was found that the ELECTRE technique for selecting the best bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and detection of flood-affected areas, in a short period of time with high accuracy, offers remarkable and consistent results.},

Title = {Quantification of lake clarity in China using Landsat OLI imagery data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {243},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The eutrophication of lake and reservoir (hereafter referred to as lakes) has attracted concerns from the public and government in China. Water clarity is a reliable indicator for quantifying eutrophic status because of its strong association with chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter, and nutrients. Traditionally, water clarity is measured using Secchi disk depth (SD). By linking the spectral signal from water surface with in situ measured SD, remote sensing provides a useful tool for SD estimation at a large scale in a repetitive manner. Remote sensing derived water clarity has been reported in many regions with specific models established for different satellite overpasses concurrent with in situ measured SD, but national water clarity remained unknown in China. In this study, 2152 samples were collected from 34 field campaigns in 2013-2018, of which 1792 samples were gathered within +/- 7 days of Landsat OLI overpasses. We used Landsat 8 OLI bands 1-4 to develop regression models (n = 1016), and 782 samples to validate model performances. We further collected three additional in situ SD datasets to validate the best performance model, and eventually used it to map SD at a national scale with OLI images mainly acquired in 2016. Our results indicated that the entire dataset of SD has a strong association with Landsat reflectance, yielding low root mean square error between measured and estimated SD (RMSE = 63 cm) for lakes in China. The national water clarity was averaged to 176 cm in 2016 with large spatial variability (S.D: 216 cm) due to the marked variation between turbid waters in the east plain area and clean water across the Tibet Plateau. Lakes in the northeastern (75 cm) and eastern (84 cm) China had low clarity due to shallow water depth combined with high suspended matter and algal abundance. Lakes in the Yungui Plateau (91 cm), Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions (114 cm) exhibited intermediate clarity; while lakes in the Tibet Plateau (294 cm) displayed the highest clarity. This investigation demonstrated that Landsat imagery with Rayleigh scattering correction reflectance combined with in situ observation can provide quantitative information about the lake clarity with surface area > 8 ha. Moreover, this method has the potential to retrieve SD with archived Landsat imagery to determine the temporal variation of SD at national or continental scale which can be used to support inland water management and decision-maker for improving water quality.},

Title = {Differences in Water Policy Efficacy across South African Water Management Areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {175},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The legacy of the inequitable water policy under apartheid continues to impact water services in economically less developed and rural areas in South Africa. Previous studies typically examine this relationship either by using aggregated data at the national level for large-scale research or by using data collected at the provincial or municipal level only for a specific locality. This study attempts to perform nationwide analysis using fine-scale data to give a spatial representation of the efficacy of water policies in South Africa. We used satellite night-time light data as a proxy of economic development and surface water quality at a quaternary water area level to investigate any income or racial inequality regarding water pollution, controlling for the spatial dependency of the observations. We found a spatial discrepancy in the relationship between water quality and economic development: economic development improves water quality in western provinces and in former white-dominated areas, whereas it generally degrades water quality in other regions of the country. These results suggest the inability of the government to equitably provide the same standards of water policies nationwide and the presence of inequitable policies as legacies of apartheid at the lowest level of water policy implementation.},

Abstract = {This study aims to illustrate and present various techniques for evaluating the performance of check-dams and proposes some suitable approaches for impact assessment of dams built in the Balochistan province of Pakistan. These dams were built during the last decade to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and depleting aquifers due to excessive Groundwater (GW) extraction. It was expected that these dams would recharge the GW resources and save the aquifer system from collapsing. Check-dams have traditionally been the permanent source of water within the province. A check-dam is used to delay the floodwater runoff to make it available for domestic and agriculture purposes or to recharge GW. The water along these dams permeates into the ground to keep the aquifer genuinely stable throughout the year. The data were collected based on studies of published research papers and reports of international organizations containing key characteristics of performance evaluation techniques. This review will help to evaluate procedures, policy, and governance interventions in Balochistan by comparing them with the adopted practices in other regions of the world and its impact on the well-being of the society. In this paper, the performance evaluation of check-dams for specific cases is presented. The knowledge acquired will be utilized to highlight state-of-the-art practices and to identify the need for further research in this field.},

Abstract = {The recovery of land cover/use after the disaster is sometimes disorderly, especially in developing countries. It is necessary to continuously monitor the progress of land cover/use recovery after disaster in order to sustain vegetation around estuarine and coastal areas. The purpose of this study was to assess the recovery progress of vegetation around estuarine and coastal areas after the Indian Ocean tsunami using a simplified method which consisting Google Earth and visual photo interpretation. Vegetation areas were able to be detected with high accuracy (80\%-100\%) using simplified method which consisting Google Earth and visual photo interpretation. We were able to show that all most of area including mangrove forests recovered relatively smoothly. However, the area which has a large vegetation areas have not enough recovered, which reached to half or less than half compare with before tsunami. This may be significant in affecting the role of the coastal ecosystem and bioshield. A large number of small mangrove patches (less than 0.1 ha) were able to found around ponds, a number that rapidly increased after the tsunami. Some site in 2013 was double that in 2004. Fish farmers might have planted them for supplying nutrients to ponds and maintain the water quality. Dozen years have passed since the 2004 tsunami, and it might be time to more focus on the recovery of large vegetation area.},

Abstract = {Managing water resources, in terms of both quality and quantity, in transboundary rivers is a difficult and challenging task that requires efficient cross-border cooperation and transparency. Groundwater pollution risk assessment and mapping techniques over the full catchment area are important tools that could be used as part of these water resource management efforts, to estimate pollution pressures and optimize land planning processes. The Evros river catchment is the second largest river in Eastern Europe and sustains a population of 3.6 million people in three different countries (Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece). This study provides detailed information on the main pollution sources and pressures in the Evros catchment and, for the first time, applies, assesses and evaluates a groundwater pollution risk mapping technique using satellite observations (Landsat NDVI) and an extensive dataset of field measurements covering different seasons and multiple years. We found that approximately 40 \% of the Greek part of the Evros catchment is characterized as of high and very high pollution risk, while 14 \% of the study area is classified as of moderate risk. Both the modeled and measured water quality status of the river showed large spatiotemporal variations consistent with the strong anthropogenic pressures in this system, especially on the northern and central segments of the catchment. The pollutants identified illustrate inputs of agrochemicals and urban wastes in the river. High correlation coefficients (R between 0.79 and 0.85) were found between estimated pollution risks and measured concentrations of those chemical parameters that are mainly attributed to anthropogenic activities rather than in situ biogeochemical processes. The pollution risk method described here could be used elsewhere as a decision support tool for mitigating the impact of hazardous human activities and improving management of groundwater resources.},

Title = {Impact of land use/land cover changes on groundwater resources in Al Ain region of the United Arab Emirates using remote sensing and GIS techniques},
Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urbanisation causes land degradation problems, including an increased pressure on natural resources and management of water resources. This study aims to investigate the impact of the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) changes on groundwater table in the region of Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 2006 to 2016. The Landsat images, Landsat ETM for 2006 and Landsat 8 for 2016, were acquired from the earth explorer site. A semi-supervised hybrid classification method was used for image classification and post-classification techniques for LULC change detection. The study area was categorised into six major LULC classes. These are agriculture/farms/oasis, gardens/playgrounds, urban areas, sandy areas, lake and mixed urban/ sandy areas. Accuracy assessment of LULC were evaluated using confusion matrix and ground truthing. The obtained land use and land cover maps were also correlated with spatial groundwater table maps prepared with groundwater data. It was found that agriculture/farms/oasis and urban areas expanded from 42,560 ha to 45,950 ha (7.38\%) and from 8150 ha to 9105 ha (10.49\%) from 2006 to 2016, respectively. The corresponding water demand was increased by 9.56\% and 22.22\%, respectively. Natural sandy area was found to decrease by 8.10\%. As groundwater is major source of water for agriculture in this region, the spatial maps also revealead average declining rate of groundwater depth 40.44\% with expansion of urban and agricultural areas over the last 10 years. The outcomes of the study would help concerning authorities for a sustainable management of its land and groundwater resources.},

Abstract = {Any sustainable resource utilization plan requires evaluation of the present and future environmental impact. The present research focuses on future scenario generation of environmental vulnerability zones based on grey analytic hierarchy process (grey-AHP). Grey-AHP combines the advantages of grey clustering method and the classical analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Environmental vulnerability index (EVI) considers twenty-five natural, environmental and anthropogenic parameters, e.g. soil, geology, aspect, elevation, slope, rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, drainage density, groundwater recharge, groundwater level, groundwater potential, water yield, evapotranspiration, land use/land cover, soil moisture, sediment yield, water stress, water quality, storage capacity, land suitability, population density, road density and normalized difference built-up index. Nine futuristic parameters were used for EVI calculation from the Dynamic Conversion of Land-Use and its Effects, Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate 5 and Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The resulting maps were classified into three classes: ``high{''}, ``moderate{''} and ``low{''}. The result shows that the upstream portion of the river basin comes under the high vulnerability zone for the years 2010 and 2030, 2050. The effectiveness of zonation approach was between ``better{''} and ``common{''} classes. Sensitivity analysis was performed for EVI. Field-based soil moisture point data were utilized for validation purpose. The resulting maps provide a guideline for planning of detailed hydrogeological studies.},

Title = {Remote observation of water clarity patterns in Three Gorges Reservoir and Dongting Lake of China and their probable linkage to the Three Gorges Dam based on Landsat 8 imagery},

Abstract = {The Secchi disk depth (ZsD) plays a critical role in describing water clarity. Several studies have shown linkages between Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and the downstream lacustrine ecosystem in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin. However, the potential influence on the Zsr, fluctuation in the entire anthropogenic reservoirs of Three Gorges (ER) and Dongting Lake (DTL) has not been reported, possibly due to technical obstacles in obtaining statistically significant spatial and temporal results. We addressed this challenge by using remote sensing technology: the Landsat S Operational Land Imager (OLI) We proposed a new, robust remote-sensing algorithm to estimate Zsr, from OLI imagery using red and green band-ratio, leading to MAPE of 21.68\% and RMSE of 0.076 m for Z50 ranging from 0.1 m to 1.05 nt After satisfactory image-based validation, the algorithm was implemented on OLI data to derive Z(sD) patterns over ER and DTL from 2013 to 2017. Several crucial findings can be drawn: 1) Spatial-temporal patterns of Z(sD) exhibited notable fluctuations over both ER and DTL, and they also demonstrated a significant correlation with each other because of the opposite temporal cycle of Zs0 fluctuations between ER and DTL; 2) Temporally, monthly fluctuations of Z50 between ER and DTL had opposite temporal cycles, which was mainly attributed to the surface runoff and sediment discharge driven by the outbound runoff variations of TGD. Spatially, the heterogeneity of the Z(sD) pattern in ER might have resulted from the different geographical regions being divided by large anthropologic hydrological facilities, such as TGD; 3) The relationship between ZsD and total suspended matter (TSM) showed a significant negative correlation, as did the relationship between ZsD and Kd(490). These findings demonstrate that TSM often plays a principal role in light attenuation of extremely turbid inland waters; 4) An inversed phenomenon of water clarity was observed at the intersection of DTL and the Yangtze River around Chenglingji site (YRAC), which was due to the opposite temporal cycle of ZsD fluctuations between DTL and ER after the impoundment of TGD; and 5) Owing to the analysis of noise-equivalent Z(sD), OLI data can be used to derive Z(sD), since the imagery uncertainty is 0.07 m by means of our band-ratio algorithm, which demonstrates similar results to MODIS. The proposed 40-derived algorithm in this study could be suitable for other turbid lakes or reservoirs to formulate related strategies of water quality management in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin, and the unveiled findings here improve our understanding of ZsD spatiotemporal fluctuations in large river-connected lakes, such as Poyang Lake.

Title = {Assessment and prediction of index based agricultural drought vulnerability using machine learning algorithms},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {867},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The consequences of droughts are far-reaching, impacting the natural environment, water quality, public health, and accelerating economic losses. Applications of remote sensing techniques using satellite imageries can play an influen-tial role in identifying drought severity (DS) and impacts for a broader range of areas. The Barind Tract (BT) is a region of Bangladesh located northwest of the country and considered one of the hottest, semi-arid, and drought-prone regions. This study aims to assess and predict the drought vulnerability over BT using Landsat satellite images from 1996 to 2031. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Differ-ence Water Index (MNDWI), Soil Moisture Content (SMC), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). VHI has been used to identify and predict DS based on VCI and TCI characteristics for 2026 and 2031 using Cellular Automata (CA)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms. Results suggest an increasing patterns of DS accelerated by the reduction of healthy vegetation (19 \%) and surface water bodies (26 \%) and increased higher temperature (>5 degrees C) from 1996 to 2021. In addition, the VHI result signifies a mas-sive increase in extreme drought conditions from 1996 (2 \%) to 2021 (7 \%). The DS prediction witnessed a possible expansion in extreme and severe drought conditions in 2026 (15 \% and 13 \%) and 2031 (18 \% and 24 \%). Understand-ing the possible impacts of drought will allow planners and decision-makers to initiate mitigating measures for enhanc-ing the communities preparedness to cope with drought vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Structure from Motion with Multi-View Stereo photogrammetry (SfM-MVS) is increasingly used in geoscience investigations, but has not been thoroughly tested in gullied savanna systems. The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of topographic models derived from aerial (via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, UAV') and ground-based (via handheld digital camera, ground') SfM-MVS in modelling hillslope gully systems in a dry-tropical savanna, and to assess the strengths and limitations of the approach at a hillslope scale and an individual gully scale. UAV surveys covered three separate hillslope gully systems (with areas of 0.412-0.715 km(2)), while ground surveys assessed individual gullies within the broader systems (with areas of 350-750 m(2)). SfM-MVS topographic models, including Digital Surface Models (DSM) and dense point clouds, were compared against RTK-GPS point data and a pre-existing airborne LiDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Results indicate that UAV SfM-MVS can deliver topographic models with a resolution and accuracy suitable to define gully systems at a hillslope scale (e.g., approximately 0.1 m resolution with 0.4-1.2 m elevation error), while ground-based SfM-MVS is more capable of quantifying gully morphology (e.g., approximately 0.01 m resolution with 0.04-0.1 m elevation error). Despite difficulties in reconstructing vegetated surfaces, uncertainty as to optimal survey and processing designs, and high computational demands, this study has demonstrated great potential for SfM-MVS to be used as a cost-effective tool to aid in the mapping, modelling and management of hillslope gully systems at different scales, in savanna landscapes and elsewhere.},

Title = {A Multi-Scale Approach for Improved Characterization of Surface Water-Groundwater Interactions: Integrating Thermal Remote Sensing and in-Stream Measurements},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The interaction between surface water and groundwater is recognized as a key process for effective management of water resources. However, scale dependency and spatial heterogeneity of the processes at the interface are limiting factors in the characterization of this process. A hierarchical, multi scale methodology has been devised and demonstrated to effectively and efficiently characterize the surface water-groundwater interaction along a 2-km reach in Kirmir stream, Turkey. Our methodology starts with investigation of geological information at the regional scale. At the intermediate scale, thermal infrared imagery is utilized to pinpoint groundwater seepage locations. Discharge measurements helped to understand the gains/losses. Point scale measurements including vertical hydraulic gradients, streambed vertical/horizontal temperature profiles and electrical conductivity profiles are investigated to characterize spatio-temporal variation in the vertical fluid fluxes. The results indicated that the study reach can be separated into three sections; upstream loosing section, downstream gaining section and mid-section with a seasonally variable character. Moreover, dam operation was found to control the exchange process a rapid rise in the river stage resulted in temporary reversal of the exchange processes. Analysis of chloride concentrations indicated that the lower confined aquifer is likely the source for the seepage at a fault-controlled section of the streambed.},

Abstract = {The Mid-Atlantic Regional Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARCOOS) will implement an end-to-end regional ocean data acquisition, management, modeling and product generation system to satisfy user needs as defined by the Middle Atlantic Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (MACOORA). MARCOOS will leverage extensive existing regional assets to augment federal backbone products in response to the MACOORA regional themes of Maritime Safety and Ecological Decision Making. Regional products enabled by MARCOOS will in turn support the development of even higher resolution products at the sub-regional level, including supporting local MACOORA needs for Coastal Inundation and Water Quality. Through MARCOOS, regional scale observations from a network of HF-Radars, satellites, glider AUVs, and an array of meteorological stations will feed 4 operational numerical modeling systems. The HF radar network provides near real-time surface current observations along 1000 kin of coastline with varying coverage from the coast out to the shelf break. The primary goal is to operate the regional system in a coordinated way to guarantee the delivery of quality ocean current and wave data. In this paper we present MARCOOS with an emphasis on the HF Radar network. Particular attention is placed on the setup, operation, and application of the network. Quality control metrics based on comparisons with Coast Guard deployed surface drifters (SLDMBs) have a specific focus to quantifying the uncertainty in the HF radar surface current estimates as applied to search and rescue observations. These metrics will be used to ensure that quality data is going to the Coast Guard and that this information is properly incorporated into existing search planning tools.},

Title = {Mapping Grasslands in Mixed Grassland Ecoregion of Saskatchewan Using Big Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurate spatial distribution information of native, mixed, and tame grasslands is essential for maintaining ecosystem health in the Prairie. This research aimed to use the latest monitoring technology to assess the remaining grasslands in Saskatchewan's mixed grassland ecoregion (MGE). The classification approach was based on 78 raster-based variables derived from big remote sensing data of multispectral optical space-borne sensors such as MODIS and Sentinel-2, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) space-borne sensors such as Sentinel-1. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a data dimensionality reduction technique to mitigate big data load and improve processing time. Random Forest (RF) was used in the classification process and incorporated the selected variables from 78 satellite-based layers and 2385 reference training points. Within the MGE, the overall accuracy of the classification was 90.2\%. Native grassland had 98.20\% of user's accuracy and 88.40\% producer's accuracy, tame grassland had 81.4\% user's accuracy and 93.8\% producer's accuracy, whereas mixed grassland class had very low user's accuracy (45.8\%) and producer's accuracy 82.83\%. Approximately 3.46 million hectares (40.2\%) of the MGE area are grasslands (33.9\% native, 4\% mixed, and 2.3\% tame). This study establishes a novel analytical framework for reliable grassland mapping using big data, identifies future challenges, and provides valuable information for Saskatchewan and North America decision-makers.},

Abstract = {Current information on land use/land cover change and its future evolution is required to support land management planning and policymaking in most developing countries experiencing deforestation and land degradation. Here, we explore the land use/land cover change occurring between 1987 and 2019 in the Mambasa sector, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and used the cellular automata model to predict the 2035 land use/land cover. The results have shown that during the last 32 years, dense forest has lost approximately 5121.54 ha, while secondary forest, fallow land and fields and, built-up area have gained 1786.23 ha, 3140.46 ha and 194.85 ha respectively. The predicted land use/land cover for the year 2035 revealed that dense and secondary forests will continue to experience a decrease of 3.85\% and 13.65\% respectively, while built-up area and fallow land and fields will experience an increase of 6.9\% and 34.25\% respectively. However, the study revealed that the unsustainable agriculture system combined with wood energy and artisanal logging have led to land use/land cover change in Mambasa. To reduce deforestation in the region, it would be necessary to improve agricultural production system, diversify the income and provide others timber product sources.},

Abstract = {The operational monitoring of the risk areas of marine environment requires cost-effective solutions. One of the options is the use of sensor networks based on fixed installations and moving platforms (coastal boats, supply-, cargo-, and passenger vessels). Such network allows to gather environmental data in time and space with direct links to operational activities in the controlled area for further environmental risk assessment. Among many remote sensing techniques the LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) based on Light Induced Fluorescence (LIF) is the tool of direct assessment of water quality variations caused by chemical pollution, colored dissolved organic matter, and phytoplankton composition. The Hyperspectral LIF (HLIF) LiDAR acquires comprehensive LIF spectra and analyses them by spectral pattern recognition technique to detect and classify the substances in water remotely. Combined use of HLIF LiDARs with Real-Time Data Management System (RTDMS) provides the economically effective solution for the regular monitoring in the controlled area. OCEAN VISUALS in cooperation with LDI INNOVATION has developed Oil in Water Locator (OWL (TM)) with RTDMS (OWL MAP (TM)) based on HLIF LiDAR technique. This is a novel technical solution for monitoring of marine environment providing continuous unattended operations. OWLTM has been extensively tested on board of various vessels in the North Sea, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Baltic Sea and Caribbean Sea. This paper describes the technology features, the results of its operational use in 2014-2017, and outlook for the technology development.},

Abstract = {Since the industrial revolution and the production model that has since been used, there has been an intensification in the scarcity of natural resources in terms of qualitative and quantitative parameters. Therefore, studies aiming to understand human actions on these resources are essential for the maintenance and conservation of these assets for current and future generations. The objective here is to identify and analyze land use and land cover changes in the hydrographic basin of Verdinho River (Brazilian Cerrado) and its geographical context between 1986 and 2016 using geotechnological resources. We analyzed a significant replacement of pasture for agricultural areas, decreases in Cerrado vegetation, expansion of industrial areas, rural construction and water availability, and significant increases in areas with laminar erosion. The increase in exposed soil areas from 7.81 ha in 1986 to 262.35 ha in 2016 (3259.15\%) was due to a history of inadequate soil use and management. Anthropic actions have suppressed the natural vegetation and given rise to agricultural activities, which often provide the agroecosystem with favorable conditions for intensifying erosion processes. This study subsidizes the implementation of effective and efficient actions in this hydrographic basin considering the economic and social development aligned with environmental conservation and serves as a basis for other studies conducted at the site and in other regions.},

Abstract = {Impervious cover is a commonly used metric to help explain or predict anthropogenic impacts on aquatic resources; often it is used as a surrogate for intensity of human impacts when evaluating effects on aquatic resources. The most common way to estimate imperviousness is based on relationships with land use. Few studies have evaluated how the relationship between impervious surface and land use varies among geographies with different levels of development and between types of imagery used to assign land use type. In this study, we assess variability in estimates of imperviousness based on two locally available land use datasets: one based on aerial imagery (2-m resolution) and another based on satellite imagery (30-m resolution). The ranges and variability in imperviousness within land use categories were assessed at several spatial scales, including within counties, between counties, and between watersheds. Results indicate that there was considerable variability for all developed land use types. Estimated impervious cover often. varied over a range of 20-40\% points within a land use category. Furthermore, there were clear spatial patterns both between and within counties, with impervious cover for a given land use type being higher near the urban centers and lower at the margins of development. Estimates of imperviousness for 12 study watersheds indicated that variability increased with increasing watershed development, making it difficult to confidently set management or regulatory targets based on impervious cover. This study suggests that locally derived, high resolution satellite or aerial imagery should be used to estimate imperviousness when a high level of accuracy and precision is required for regulatory or management decisions. Furthermore, the error associated with impervious land use relationships should be accounted for when using impervious cover in runoff or water quality models, or when making management decisions regarding stream health.},

Abstract = {The MORERA program has recently been selected as one of the ``Missions Science and Innovation{''} from the Spanish CDTI, an innovative program targeting solutions for deep social problems through innovation. The main Spanish industry is Agriculture (11\% GDP), but this sector is threatened by climate change, as 34\% of the Spanish irrigated surface is considered out of balance. Difficulty of providing useful and fully processed information to the end-users for supporting their decisions severely affect the optimization of the resources. Well informed decisions optimize resources and costs, maximizing productivity. To solve this problem, MORERA involves in a unique project the complete value chain, from sensor to user, thanks to a solid consortium, and it is based on three pillars: Final personalized irrigation requirements that will be directly provided to the user using a mobile device. Artificial intelligence techniques will be used to combine all relevant data to build a final watering recommendation. A compact and highly specific freeform optical instrument will be used to estimate evapotranspiration data at farm level with required TIR bandwidth and spatial resolution. Since no present instrument fulfills these requirements, it will be developed in the framework of the project. The MORERA concept can be extrapolated to many remote sensing applications, and to take advantage of this, it has been conceived as a modular system, where each module may be adapted with minor impact. This first system is focused on providing precise irrigation and fertilization recommendations, as well as self-learning yield estimations.},

Abstract = {The water clarity of many inland water bodies is under threat due to intensifying land use pressures in conjunction with changes in water levels that result from increasing demand and climate variability. The recent launch of Landsat 8 coupled with Geoscience Australia's recent reprocessing of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) archives over the whole of Australia to a consistent surface reflectance product enables sub continental scale spatio-temporal analysis of freshwater optical water quality in support of monitoring and decision making for water management agencies. In this research, we present an objective assessment of the potential of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for monitoring inland water quality dynamics over a number of lakes and reservoirs with a range of optical water types in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. We used bio-optical modelling to develop sensor specific total suspended matter (TSM) retrieval algorithms that account for the difference in relative spectral response between Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. We were able to compare the suitability of the different sensors for optical water quality measurements using water bodies that fell within Landsat path overlaps where Landsat images of surface reflectance were acquired within 24 h between Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ or Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. These water bodies represent a range of hydrological and limnological conditions, and enabled us to assess: 1) the comparability of TSM measurements retrieved from each sensor, and 2) the surface reflectance to image noise characteristics of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. Comparisons of lake surface reflectance and noise equivalent reflectance difference show that the improved radiometric resolution and increased quantization of Landsat 8 OLI relative to Landsat 7 ETM+ significantly reduce image noise and spectral heterogeneity, indicating that Landsat 8 OLI data are expected to provide more precise water quality retrievals relative to Landsat 7 ETM+. We found that: 1) the TSM retrievals from the different sensors are highly comparable; 2) Landsat 5 TM overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 7 ETM+ by 6.4\%; and 3) Landsat 7 ETM+ overestimated TSM relative to Landsat 8 OLI by only 1.4\%. Retrieved TSM values were highly correlated with independent in situ data acquired within 24 h of satellite overpass (r = 0.99) with a mean average error of 14 mg/L. The results demonstrate that time series analysis of TSM retrievals can be conducted across a wide range of lakes at the sub-continental scale to characterise the multi-decadal TSM dynamics.

Abstract = {In Kuwait, an arid country with a low annual average rainfall of about 115 mm, fresh ground-water lenses are found at Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish fields, in the northern part of the country. These lenses are formed due to a combination of unique conditions that include short duration, high intensity rainfall; geomorphology; and lithology that enables rapid infiltration to the underlying ground-water. Large depressions and playas, paleodrainage patterns, and catchment areas, which are necessary for the accumulation of large amounts of water during flash foods, were mapped from aerial photographs, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and digital elevation model (DEM) datasets. From historical pumping and water quality variation data acquired between 1963 and 1977, the sustainable extraction rate for Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish is estimated ttl be 5.5 and 3.5 Ml day(-1), respectively. These rates are fundamental to the delicate management required to extract freshwater from the lenses and yet avoid upconing of the deeper saline water. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Comprehensive and objective evaluation of ecological environment quality is of great significance to regional sustainable development. In this study, Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2000, 2004, 2010, 2013, 2018, and 2019 are selected to evaluate the changes of ecological environment quality in the Headwaters of Dongjiangyuan River by using remote sensing ecological index RSEI. The influencing factors of ecological environment change in Dongjiangyuan River are also discussed. The results showed that, from 1991 to 2019, the ecoenvironmental quality of the Dongjiangyuan River showed a good trend of development. Humidity index, greenness index, and dryness index all fluctuated in a small range; the greenness and dryness showed an overall increase. The average temperature in the Headwaters of the Dongjiangyuan River presents a rising trend. This study establishes the evaluation system of ecological environment quality from two dimensions of time and space and gives the change rule of environmental quality quantitatively, which provides the theoretical basis for the ecological environment management of Dongjiangyuan River.},

Abstract = {The Appalachian region of the United States has experienced significant growth in the production of natural gas. Developing the infrastructure required to transport this resource to market creates significant disturbances across the landscape, as both well pads and transportation pipelines must be created in this mountainous terrain. Midstream infrastructure, which includes pipeline rights-of-way and associated infrastructure, can cause significant environmental degradation, especially in the form of sedimentation. The introduction of this non-point source pollutant can be detrimental to freshwater ecosystems found throughout this region. This ecological risk has necessitated the enactment of regulations related to midstream infrastructure development. Weekly, inspectors travel afoot along new pipeline rights-of-way, monitoring the re-establishment of surface vegetation and identifying failing areas for future management. The topographically challenging terrain of West Virginia makes these inspections difficult and dangerous to the hiking inspectors. We evaluated the accuracy at which unmanned aerial vehicles replicated inspector classifications to evaluate their use as a complementary tool in the pipeline inspection process. Both RGB and multispectral sensor collections were performed, and a support vector machine classification model predicting vegetation cover were made for each dataset. Using inspector defined validation plots, our research found comparable high accuracy between the two collection sensors. This technique displays the capability of augmenting the current inspection process, though it is likely that the model can be improved further. The high accuracy thus obtained suggests valuable implementation of this widely available technology in aiding these challenging inspections.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal dynamics of primary producers in shallow lakes as seen from space: Intra-annual observations from Sentinel-2A},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {32-43},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Under the current high anthropic pressure and climate change scenarios, a trend towards increasing changes in the trophic status of shallow lakes, and the development of opportunistic floating species is to be expected. This raises the need for monitoring and management actions to prevent widespread environmentally negative effects (e.g., anoxia). An efficient approach to monitoring water quality and primary producers in inland waters is to integrate in situ with remote sensing data. In this work, satellite multispectral data acquired by Sentinel-2 A are used to assess the intra-annual spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton abundance, in terms of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and macrophyte Leaf Area Index (LAI) in a shallow eutrophic fluvial lake system (Mantua Lakes, Italy). Chl-a concentrations and LAI were derived from Sentinel-2 A data by applying a semi-empirical band ratio algorithm combined with a bio-optical model (BOMBER) for the former (Chl-a), and a semi-empirical model for the latter (LAI). These products were validated against in situ data (rRMSE = 20\% for both products; R-2 = 0.93 for Chl-a; R-2 = 0.83 for LAI). Phytoplankton maps showed a marked intra-annual spatial and temporal variability, generally revealing a Chl-a concentration gradient from lotic to lentic waters. Air temperature was the main driver of Chl-a concentration, followed by water discharge and precipitation. The macrophyte LAI followed aquatic plant growth seasonally, and was independent of the hydro-meteorological data. Allochthonous and invasive macrophyte species (such as Nelumbo nucifera and Ludwigia hexapetala) had higher LAI compared than the Mantua Lakes' autochthonous floating-leaved species (e.g., Trapa natans and Nuphar lutea). Maps of the abundance of primary producers can be used to follow the temporal and spatial evolution of different communities and support management actions, e.g., by identifying potential algal bloom hotspots, or the optimal timing for measures to control invasive species overgrowth.},

Title = {Blue Carbon stock in Zostera noltei meadows at Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal) over a decade},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {This work assessed the Blue Carbon (C) stock in the seagrass meadows (Zostera noltei) of Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal), and evaluated its spatio-temporal trend over the 2003-2005 to 2013-2014 period. Zostera noltei spatial distribution, restricted to intertidal areas in 2014, was mapped by remote sensing using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and aerial photography. Zostera noltei biomass was also monitored in situ over a year and its Blue C stock was estimated. By 2014, intertidal meadows covered an area of 226 +/- 4 ha and their Blue C stock ranged from 227 +/- 6 to 453 +/- 13 Mg C. Overall, Ria de Aveiro Z. noltei intertidal meadows increased in extent over the 2003-2005 to 2013-2014 period, corroborating the recent declining trend reversal observed in Europe and contrary to the global decline trend. This spatio-temporal shift might be related to a natural adjustment of the intertidal meadows to past human intervention in Ria de Aveiro, namely large-scale dredging activities, particularly in the 1996-1998 period, combined with the more accurate assessment performed in 2014 using the UAV. This recovery contributes to the effective increase of the Blue C stock in Ria de Aveiro and, ultimately, to supporting climate regulation and improving ecosystem health. However, major dredging activities are foreseen in the system's management plan, which can again endanger the recovery trend of Z. noltei intertidal meadows in Ria de Aveiro.},

Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The impact of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) construction on land use change has attracted worldwide concern. However, quantitative evidence is lacking for the drivers of land use change resulting from the TGR during and after construction. We used the Pengxi River basin, located upstream of the Three Gorges dam, to evaluate the effects of large-scale hydrological engineering on land use. Landsat remote sensing images from 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 covering the main construction period of the TGR were obtained. The largest changes were the conversion of land to water bodies and built-up areas, corresponding to reservoir impoundment and population resettlement during TGR construction. These changes were more intensive downstream of the TGR and closer to the river. Compared with 2000-2005, the expansion in water bodies during 2005-2010 moved from lower to higher elevations. The distribution of built-up land during the two periods was similar, mainly because the planned resettlement zones were fixed and spatially concentrated. Geographical and environmental factors, such as elevation, slope, location, soil type and precipitation, still controlled land use patterns. Land use pattern in 2020 under two scenarios was simulated using a multi-criteria evaluation cellular automata-Markov model. Scenario 2 was more realistic and helpful for management decisions. The scenarios highlighted the indirect influences of TGR construction on land use change after 2010. Indirect driving forces were mainly reflected through related policies or plans, especially from the perspective of water conservation in the newly built reservoir.},

Title = {Modeling Methods for Identifying Critical Source Areas of Bacteria: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives},
Journal = {WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {85},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-269},

Abstract = {Identification of critical source areas of bacteria in a watershed is essential to environmental management and restoration. As a result of the nonpoint and distributed nature of bacterial pollution in watersheds, it is often difficult to identify specific source areas of bacteria for remediation because bacteria collected from different sampling sites might display similar fingerprints. Over the past decade, extensive efforts have been made to identify microbial pollution sources, especially in watersheds. The primary objective of this study was to identify effective methods that can be applied to tracking critical source areas of bacteria in a watershed by a review of recent developments in several modeling methods. Comparisons of the models and their applications revealed that comprehensive watershed-scale source area tracking primarily involves two steps-geographical tracking and mathematical tracking. In terms of geographical tracking, bacterial source locations must be identified to prepare structural best management practices or low impact development for site treatments. For mathematical tracking, the quantity (strength) or release history of bacterial sources must be computed to develop total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for bacterial load reduction and water quality restoration. Mathematically, source tracking is essentially an inverse modeling issue under uncertainty, requiring inverse modeling combined with a geostatistical method or an optimization algorithm. Consequently, combining biological methods, mathematical models, and sensor technologies (including remote sensing and in-situ sensing) provides an effective approach to identifying critical source locations of bacteria at the watershed-scale.},

Title = {Synoptic assessment of water resource variability in reservoirs by remote sensing: General approach and application to the runoff harvesting systems of south India},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {44},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {This paper presents a methodological procedure based on remote sensing and image analysis techniques designed to map and quantify water stocks in small irrigation reservoirs over vast, user-defined regions. Because the method is based on unsupervised pixel classification schemes, it is analytically transparent and entirely replicable and can therefore be used in most settings as a tool for integrated water resource management, planning, or policy making, with benefits to irrigation, land use, agriculture, and water-related social issues. Satellite images of semiarid south India are used here to quantify fluctuating water volumes in similar to 2500 reservoirs. In this pilot study, the detection of temporal trends and spatial discontinuities in land use at successive dates within reservoir beds is a proxy for assessing the performance of reservoirs and for formulating hypotheses on the environmental, socioeconomic, or anthropological reasons behind the inferred levels of infrastructural maintenance or disuse. The synoptic approach paves the way for future efforts as better ground truth data become available.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the link between the occurrence of El Nino events in East Africa and water hyacinth blooms in Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria using remote sensing technology. A time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analyzed from data acquired by the multispectral Aqua/Terra sensors aboard the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite are used to monitor areal extent and density of the aquatic plants. We related the NDVI derived from MODIS imagery to data on El Nio South Oscillation (ENSO) events that were obtained from NOAA and rainfall data from the study site. Our results from the 11-year time-series data show a statistically significant positive correlation (R = 0.6, P = 0.021) between the occurrence of El Nio events and water hyacinth blooms in Winam Gulf. The proliferation of water hyacinth rafts in Winam Gulf may be a response to dramatic environmental and water quality changes in Lake Victoria. The patterns of impact of ENSO events and rainfall show spatial and temporal variation patterns in the region, depending on the time and space evolution of each individual ENSO event that could explain the differences in general patterns of water hyacinth cover in Lake Victoria during different El Nio events. Although the problems eutrophication and water hyacinth are severe in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria some of the solutions to the problem are located several hundreds of kilometers away in the rich agricultural farmlands of the Lake Victoria catchment area. These include better land management practices and strategies aimed at limiting pollution and soil erosion within the lake's drainage basin.},

Title = {Monitoring urban growth and detecting land-cover changes on the Istanbul metropolitan area},

Abstract = {Istanbul is the most populated city of Turkey with a population of around 10.58 M (2000) living on around 5,750 km(2). In 1980, the population was only 4.7 M and then it has been more than doubled in only two decades. The population has been increasing as a result of mass immigration. An urbanization process continues and it causes serious increases in urban areas while decreasing the amount of green areas. This rapid, uncontrolled, and illegal urbanization accompanied by insufficient infrastructure has caused degradation of forest and barren lands in the metropolitan area, especially through the last two decades. The watershed basins inside the metropolitan area and the transportation network have accelerated the land-cover changes, which have negative impacts on water quality of the basins. Monitoring urban growth and land cover change will enable better management of this complex urban area by the Greater Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (GIMM). A temporal assessment of land-cover changes of Istanbul has been documented in this study. The study mainly focuses on the acquisition and analysis of Landsat TM and Landsat GeoCover LC satellite images reflecting the significant land-cover changes between the years of 1990 and 2005. Raster data were converted to vector data and used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). A database was created for Istanbul metropolitan area to plan, manage, and utilize statistical attribute data covering population, water, forest, industry, and topographic position. Consequently an overlay analysis was carried out and land use/cover changes through years have been detected for the case study area. The capability of Landsat images in determining the alterations in the macro form of the city are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Groundwater is the main source for agricultural and domestic purposes in the Western Desert of Egypt. Groundwater quality is significantly influenced by the surrounding anthropogenic activities. This paper is one of the attempts to spatially assess groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking and irrigation in Dakhla Oases using Water Quality Index (WQI) and GIS techniques. Calibrated Landsat 8 OLI satellite images were processed to produce Land Use Cover map (LULC) to assess the agricultural and human activities in the study area. Further, eight groundwater quality parameters and WQI were attributed to a GIS layer for 71 investigated wells for mapping purposes using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method in ArcGIS. LULC map showed that 75\% of the study area is a bare land and 25\% is urban and agricultural areas. Almost all the studied wells recorded total dissolved solids and sulfate coinciding with the Egyptian permissible limits for drinking purposes. Fe and Mn levels exceeded the allowable limits for drinking in the majority of Dakhla wells. Based on the WQI, 38\% and 36.6\% of the study area fell within the poor water category according to the Egyptian and WHO standards, respectively. Most of the groundwater wells were of the best quality for irrigation with regard to salinity (less than 2000 mg/L) and the excellent quality in terms of sodium absorption ratio (<10). It can be concluded that GIS analyses of groundwater quality and suitability can provide one of the necessary inputs for management and planning of Dakhla Oases and other similar regions.},

Abstract = {Algal bloom as a common phenomenon in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman had catastrophic effects on environmental, social, economic, and human health aspects from 2008 to 2009. Since 2008, the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman Ecological Research Institute (PGSOERI) has monitored and managed algal blooms in the Hormuzgan coast along the northern Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Management strategies have included regular monitoring of chlorophyll, water quality, and remote sensing. In this regard, relevant departments and the Regional Organization for Protection of Marine Environment (ROPME) collaborated with each other to prevent and forecast algal blooms. We reviewed historical and current monitoring, mitigation, and management systems of algal blooms in the Hormuzgan coast. In addition, complications and challenges of algal bloom monitoring and management were also discussed. Documenting algal bloom monitoring and research, improving forecasting and modeling of blooms, educating the public and fishermen, developing a cooperative monitoring framework, and controlling pollution input entering the ROPME region are the main challenges of algal bloom management in the Hormuzgan coast.},

Abstract = {Three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans and they dominate the overall impact on weather and climate system. Yet much about the ocean still remains to be understood, largely due to lack of detailed and accurate observations over the oceans. A satellite platform, with its synoptic view and capability to give spatially continuous data on a repetitive basis has increased the possibilities for studying oceans and ocean-atmosphere system in greater detail and for providing valuable inputs for modelling efforts. Optimum exploitation of ocean resources calls for detailed knowledge of the hydro-biological and related aspects of the environment. Several studies using passive and active models of satellite measurements have proved their potential in understanding the ocean-atmosphere systems. Complementary conventional systems, e.g., ships and buoys, provide detailed temporal and in-depth coverage at specific points, and are used in conjunction with satellite observations over large areas. Many ocean-related studies have reached near operational level and suitable sensors have been developed. The ocean colour measured by optical sensors is found to bear the direct relation to the suspended material of the water, thermal characteristics and location of greenish biological materials. Sea surface temperature and thermal patterns are amenable to measurements using thermal sensors. The ocean currents caused primarily by surface winds, have been studied with satellite microwave sensors like the altimeter, which also have provided significant information on wave height and wind speed. The thermal structure of ocean layers has been mapped using infrared radiometry. Wind scatterometers are ideal for the measurement of wind speed and direction, while synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides information on bi-directional wave spectra. Microwave sensors have also been found to be useful in mapping sea-ice features, nearshore bathymetry, etc. The updated information on wetlands, geomorphology, erosion/accretion, sediment transport, pollutant dispersal, etc., which could be obtained from satellite based remote sensing, have proved invaluable towards scientific management of the coastal zones. This article reviews the state-of-the-art of various satellites and sensors and expected accuracies from satellite-based measurements and their utility in ocean modelling. It also outlines the future scenario of satellite missions and their impact on scientific studies.},

Abstract = {Urban agglomerations (UA) are the fastest growing regional types during recent years, especially in developing countries. Monitoring and evaluating the eco-environment quality of UA is significant for sustainability. The previous remote sensing models of urban eco-environment are generally based on the vegetation-impervious surface-soil framework, which neglects the air quality in urban areas. We constructed a vegetation-impervious surface-soil-air (VISA) framework and derived a remote sensing model of UA eco-environment (RSUAE) based on the VISA. The RSUAE can integrate the greenness, dryness and imperviousness, moisture, heat, and air turbidity. The new model was evaluated by comparing with land cover types and the existing remote sensing-based ecological index and eco-environmental quality index models. Results demonstrated that RSUAE is valid to depict the difference of eco-environment quality among varied land cover types. The RSUAE model has general consistency with the existing models, while RSUAE takes into account well the air quality. The RSUAE was utilized to evaluate the eco-environment of UA along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China (NXUA) with Mann-Kendall trend test. Results identified 78.69\% of the area has no significant change trend, 18.73\% of the area has a significant increasing trend, and 2.58\% of the area suffers significant decreasing trend in eco-environment quality from 2001 to 2019. The Yanchi county has the best improvement in eco-environment quality, whereas sensitivity analysis indicates that it is more vulnerable than other counties. The analysis tool and method presented in this study provide a reference for other UAs. The evaluation results in NXUA are noteworthy for local management. (C) The Authors.

Structural and dynamic habitat characteristics are described using GIS and integrated with published growth data on juvenile mullet (Mugil spp.) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) to reveal zones of accelerated growth. Both mullet and spot had their greatest growth when water temperature and salinity (dynamic habitat) were physiologically optimal. The lack of spatial difference in the dynamic habitat between distributaries resulted in no growth zone differences for both species. 3. The integration of the growth zones with the structural habitat component showed that the west distributary, with its greater availability and reduced fragmentation of main channel marsh edge, should provide a greater area of essential fish habitat than the east distributary for juvenile spot, a marsh-edge associate. Because juvenile mullet are less associated with structural wetland habitat, growth zones and the stationary (structural) habitat were not integrated. 4. The approach of integrating real-time geo-referenced water quality data with regional fish growth-rate data is an important step towards a quantitative understanding of the hierarchical nature and inherent variability of dynamic coastal environments. The use of this holistic approachshould lead to more effective management of estuarine systems, especially in regard to potential impacts within the estuary's watershed and to its coupling with offshore environments.

Abstract = {Water clarity in North America's Laurentian Great Lakes has undergone considerable change over the last several decades as a consequence of invasive species, eutrophication, and implemented nutrient management practices. Satellite observations from the CZCS, SeaWiFS, and MODIS-Aqua sensors have been used in tandem with long term records of Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) to provide a retrospective analysis of spatial and temporal variations in water clarity over the Great Lakes. A simple empirical algorithm is presented, relating Z(SD) to remote-sensing reflectance at approximate to 550 nm (R-rs approximate to 550). Results suggest remarkable and complex changes in water clarity over the Great Lakes. Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan have seen increases in average Z(SD) over the three sensor periods of 58\%, 49\%, and 62\%, respectively. Lake Erie shows highly variable Z(SD) with no consistent long term trends, while Lake Superior has remained fairly consistent in its lake-wide water clarity conditions. Temporal trends document the decrease in whiting events on Lake Michigan while capturing the ongoing occurrence of these seasonal bright-water events on Lake Ontario. Results indicate a divergence in Z(SD) trends between nearshore and offshore environments; with larger increases in offshore than nearshore Z(SD) and some nearshore areas suggesting a decrease in Z(SD). Offshore regions of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior show diminished Z(SD) seasonality in contrast to increasing seasonal variance in the nearshore. Spatial and temporal variations in Z(SD) are in agreement with documented reductions in Great Lakes bioproductivity, degrading nearshore water quality, and changing biogeochemical processes influencing whiting events and sediment resuspension.},

Title = {Free satellite image data application for monitoring land use cover changes in the kon ha nung plateau, vietnam},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {Remote sensing imagery is the most suitable tool for monitoring, managing, and evaluating land -use overlay fluctuations, especially forest cover for large areas. Free-and medium-resolution satellite imagery is a useful tool that allows scientific researchers and management organiza-tions to monitor forest development in developing countries, such as Vietnam. In this study, we used SPOT 4 and Planet remote sensing data to assess land-use status fluctuations in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau area, Vietnam, between 2000 and 2021 (the overall accuracy was 90.52\%, Kappa value = 0.89). The results showed that from 2000 to 2010, the rate of natural forest loss in this area was 0.32\%/year, of which, more than 6500 ha were converted to other uses. Between 2010 and 2021, the rate of natural forest loss gradually decreased (0.09\%/year) instead of fluctuating between different types of land use. The area of forests, perennial crop land, and annual crop land tended to increase from 2000 to 2010; however, from 2010 to 2021, the area of plantation forests decreased markedly, while the area of perennial crop land and annual crop land continued to expand. The analysis of the policies on forest management, exploitation, and protection was applied locally, to explain the causes of the change in spatiotemporal aspects of the types of land -use cover in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. Restoring forest areas during 2010-2021 initially improved effectiveness in forest management and protection. Furthermore, the results provide a better understanding of the current position and role of the government apparatus, cadres, and ethnic minorities in socioeconomic development associated with forest protection and develop-ment on the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. The results of this study can help managers monitor annual forest-cover fluctuations based on free remote sensing imagery to reduce both the cost of man-agement and surveying, yielding relatively accurate results.},
