Abstract = {Remote sensing is providing voluminous data and value added information products. Electronic Sensors, communication electronics, computer software, hardware, and network communications technology have matured to the point where a distributed infrastructure for remotely sensed information is a reality. The amount of remotely sensed data and information is making distributed infrastructure almost a necessity. This infrastructure provides data collection, archiving, cataloging, browsing, processing, and viewing for applications from scientific research to economic, legal, and national security decision making. The remote sensing field is entering a new exciting stage of commercial growth and expansion into the mainstream of government and business decision making. This paper overviews this new distributed infrastructure and then focuses on describing a software system for on-line catalog access and distribution of remotely sensed information.},

Abstract = {Remotely sensed data have been used extensively for environmental monitoring and modeling at a number of spatial scales; however, a limited range of satellite imaging systems often. constrained the scales of these analyses. A wider variety of data sets is now available, allowing image data to be selected to match the scale of environmental structure(s) or process(es) being examined. A framework is presented for use by environmental scientists and managers, enabling their spatial data collection needs to be linked to a suitable form of remotely sensed data. A six-step approach is used, combining image spatial analysis and scaling tools, within the context of hierarchy theory. The main steps involved are: (1) identification of information requirements for the monitoring or management problem; (2) development of ideal image dimensions (scene model), (3) exploratory analysis of existing remotely sensed data using scaling techniques, (4) selection and evaluation of suitable remotely sensed data based on the scene model, (5) selection of suitable spatial analytic techniques to meet information requirements, and (6) cost-benefit analysis. Results from a case study show that the framework provided an objective mechanism to identify relevant aspects of the monitoring problem and environmental characteristics for selecting remotely sensed data and analysis techniques.},

Title = {An evaluation of the use of remotely sensed parameters for prediction of incidence and risk associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Gulf Coast oysters (Crassostrea virginica)},

Abstract = {The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently published a Vibrio parahaemol.y'ticus risk assessment for consumption of raw oysters that predicts V. parahaemolyticus densities at harvest based on water temperature. We retrospectively compared archived remotely sensed measurements (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity) with previously published data from an environmental study of V. parahaemolyticus in Alabama oysters to assess the utility of the former data for predicting V. parahaemolyticus densities in oysters. Remotely sensed sea surface temperature correlated well with previous in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.86) of bottom water temperature, supporting the notion that remotely sensed sea surface temperature data are a sufficiently accurate substitute for direct measurement. Turbidity and chlorophyll levels were not determined in the previous study, but in comparison with the V. parahaemolyticus data, remotely sensed values for these parameters may explain some of the variation in V. parahaemolyticus levels. More accurate determination of these effects and the temporal and spatial variability of these parameters may further improve the accuracy of prediction models. To illustrate the utility of remotely sensed data as a basis for risk management, predictions based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration V. parahaemolyticus risk assessment model were integrated with remotely sensed sea surface temperature data to display graphically variations in V. parahaemolyticus density in oysters associated with spatial variations in water temperature. We believe images such as these could be posted in near real time, and that the availability of such information in a user-friendly format could be the basis for timely and informed risk management decisions.},

Abstract = {Identifying and reducing uncertainties in future land use projections are becoming critical in integrated assessments of the climate and social change scenarios. Here, we quantified correspondence between remotely sensed land cover and a model-derived projection of European land use to build a calibration and evaluation framework for land use projection models. For an eight-year period (2006-2013), we compared simulated land uses from a model (CRAFTY-EU), defined as agent functional types, against remotely sensed MODIS land cover. Information between two datasets and spatial complexity are calculated, which allowed the evaluation of the CRAFTY model and calibration of the model parameters. The computational cost was high. Thus more efficient searching algorithms are called for. The evaluation framework holds promise for better calibration of land use decision models to increase model usability and improve the value of future land cover projections.},

Abstract = {The transformation from natural to impervious surfaces in an urbanization process and the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is known to significantly compromise urban environmental quality and has been linked to climate change and associated impacts. Whereas the existence of UHI is common knowledge, the implication of urban land use land cover (LULC) gradient on intra-urban thermal characteristics is often poorly understood. A recent proliferation of remotely sensed datasets offer great potential in understanding the relationship between urban LULCs and their respective thermal characteristics, a critical basis for urban environmental management and designing climate change mitigation measures. This study explores the potential of multispectral remotely sensed dataset in determining the influence of rural/urban LULC gradient on urban thermal characteristics. A rectangular eleven band Landsat 8 image subset was delineated from the central business district to the rural periphery and classified into most dominant LULCs and a corresponding Landsat 8 thermal layer used to determine the LULCs thermal characteristics. Digitized point data was used to determine differences in land surface temperature (LST) over gradient's LULC types. Results showed that there was varied contribution of LULCs to the LST. As expected, the density of built up surfaces and LST decreased towards the city's periphery while a decline in vegetation density from the periphery led to an increase in LST. These results provide valuable insights into the value of remotely sensed datasets in understanding the implication of intra-urban LULC gradient on LST characteristics. Specifically, the study demonstrates the value of remotely sensed data as aids to sustainable urban environmental planning.},

Abstract = {The widespread conversion of natural habitats to agricultural land has created a need to integrate intensively managed landscapes into conservation management priorities. However, there are no clearly defined methods for assessing the conservation value of managed landscapes at the local scale. We used remotely sensed landscape heterogeneity as a rapid practical tool for the assessment of local biodiversity value within a predominantly agricultural landscape in Canterbury, New Zealand. Bird diversity was highly significantly correlated with landscape heterogeneity, distance from rivers and the Christchurch central business district, altitude and average annual household income, indicating that remotely sensed landscape heterogeneity is a good predictor of local biodiversity patterns. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using geographic information systems to determine local areas of high conservation value.},

Title = {Evaluation of remotely sensed prediction and forecast models for Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the Chesapeake Bay},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {250},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, an increase of gastrointestinal illness due to Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the consumption of raw shellfish has been reported in multiple regions around the United States. Studies mainly attribute this increase to rising sea surface temperatures and prolonged warm seasons in the mid-latitudes. Historically, temperature has been the main environmental determinant used to predict V. parahaemolyticus concentrations in shellfish and surface water. However, studies using in situ sampling campaigns have shown that additional water quality parameters can be useful in predicting the bacterium. While the time and cost of obtaining in situ samples throughout the Chesapeake Bay at regular time intervals can exceed available resources, satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide predictions at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. This study uses satellite ocean color remote sensing and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the utility of remotely sensed information for Vibrio parahaemolyticus predictions in the Chesapeake Bay and whether additional remotely sensed information can improve predictions over conventional SST-based models. We find that the addition of remotely sensed salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-a generally improves presence and abundance predictions compared to SST-only models. Models using remote sensing reflectances and SST also show potential for V. parahaemolyticus predictions, which could bypass the intermediary step of deriving water quality products from reflectances. Remotely sensed ocean color products and SST from one week prior to in situ V. parahaemolyticus measurements are evaluated and shown to be useful in bacterium predictions, which could provide lead-time for management decisions. The forecast models using ocean color products in addition to SST showed improvement over SST-only forecast models. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing can be a valuable tool to aid in higher resolution V. parahaemolyticus predictions and forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay, particularly when multiple environmental predictors are employed. However, the complexities of using remotely sensed data for ecological modeling applications and evaluating model performance also highlight the need for more research in this area.},

Abstract = {The advent of the new political dispensation in South Africa has seen an exponential growth in the rate of land transformation and encroachment by other land uses into valuable agro-ecological zones. Due to the socio-economic value of the often limited high-potential agricultural land in the country, a reliable determination of encroachment and transformation is necessary for effective monitoring and management of such agro-ecological resources. Using the robust support vector machine classification algorithm, this study adopted multi-temporal, remotely sensed datasets to assess the extent to which the physical development footprint in the uMngeni Local Municipality affected the existing agro-ecological zones from 1993 to 2003 and from 2003 to 2013. The results show a steady increase in built-up areas during the period under investigation. The study demonstrates the value of multi-temporal, remotely sensed datasets and techniques in mapping the vulnerability of existing agricultural land to urbanisation in the study area.},

Abstract = {Assessment of chlorophyll-a, an algal pigment, typically measured by field and laboratory in situ analyses, is used to estimate algal abundance and trophic status in lakes and reservoirs. In situ-based monitoring programs can be expensive, may not be spatially, and temporally comprehensive and results may not be available in the timeframe needed to make some management decisions, but can be more accurate, precise, and specific than remotely sensed measures. Satellite remotely sensed chlorophyll-a offers the potential for more geographically and temporally dense data collection to support estimates when used to augment or substitute for in situ measures. In this study, we compare available chlorophyll-a data from in situ and satellite imagery measures at the national scale and perform a cost analysis of these different monitoring approaches. The annual potential avoided costs associated with increasing the availability of remotely sensed chlorophyll-a values were estimated to range between \$5.7 and \$316 million depending upon the satellite program used and the timeframe considered. We also compared sociodemographic characteristics of the regions (both public and private lands) covered by both remote sensing and in situ data to check for any systematic differences across areas that have monitoring data. This analysis underscores the importance of continued support for both field-based in situ monitoring and satellite sensor programs that provide complementary information to water quality managers, given increased challenges associated with eutrophication, nuisance, and harmful algal bloom events.},

Abstract = {Fine-scale habitat selection modelling can allow a mechanistic understanding of habitat selection processes, enabling better assessments of the effects of climate and habitat changes on biodiversity. Remotely sensed data provide an ever-increasing amount of environmental and climatic variables at high spatiotemporal resolutions, and a unique opportunity to produce fine-scale habitat models particularly useful in challenging environments, such as high-elevation areas. Working at a 10-m spatial resolution, we assessed the value of remotely sensed data for investigating foraging habitat selection (in relation to topography, microclimate, land cover) in nestling-rearing white-winged snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), a high-elevation species highly sensitive to climate change. Adult snowfinches foraged at locations with intermediate vegetation cover and higher habitat heterogeneity, also avoiding extremely warm or extremely cold microclimates. Temperature interacted with other environmental drivers in defining habitat selection, highlighting trade-offs between habitat profitability and thermoregulation: snowfinches likely adopted mechanisms of behavioural buffering against physiologically stressful conditions by selecting for cooler, shaded and more snowy foraging grounds at higher temperatures. Our results matched those from previous studies based on accurate field measurements, confirming the species' reliance on climate-sensitive microhabitats (snow patches and low-sward grassland, in heterogeneous patches) and the usefulness of satellite-derived fine-scale modelling. Habitat suitability models built on remotely sensed predictors can provide a cost-effective method for periodic monitoring of species' habitats both at fine grain and over large extents. Fine-scale models also enhance our understanding of the actual drivers of (micro)habitat selection and of possible buffering behaviours against warming, allowing more accurate and robust distribution models, finer predictions of potential future changes and carefully targeted conservation strategies and habitat management.},

Abstract = {Sustainable biodiversity and land management require a cost-effective means of forecasting landscape response to environmental change. Conventional species-based, regional biodiversity assessments are rarely adequate for policy planning and decision making. We show how new ground and remotely sensed survey methods can be coordinated to help elucidate and predict relationships between biodiversity, land use and soil properties along complex biophysical gradients that typify many similar landscapes worldwide. In the lower Zambezi valley, Mozambique we used environmental, gradient directed transects (gradsects) to sample vascular plant species, plant functional types, vegetation structure, soil properties and land-use characteristics. Soil fertility indices were derived using novel multidimensional scaling of soil properties. To facilitate spatial analysis, we applied a probabilistic remote sensing approach, analyzing Landsat 7 satellite imagery to map photosynthetically active and inactive vegetation and bare soil along each gradsect. Despite the relatively low sample number, we found highly significant correlations between single and combined sets of specific plant, soil and remotely sensed variables that permitted testable spatial projections of biodiversity and soil fertility across the regional land-use mosaic. This integrative and rapid approach provides a low-cost, high-return and readily transferable methodology that permits the ready identification of testable biodiversity indicators for adaptive management of biodiversity and potential agricultural productivity.

Title = {Prediction of butt rot volume in Norway spruce forest stands using harvester, remotely sensed and environmental data},

Abstract = {Butt rot (BR) damage of a tree results from a decay caused by a pathogenic fungus. BR damages associated with Norway spruce (Picea abies {[}L.] Karst.) account for considerable economic losses in timber production across the northern hemisphere. While information on BR damages is critical for optimal decision-making in forest management, maps of BR damages are typically lacking in forest information systems. Timber volume damaged by BR was predicted at the stand-level in Norway using harvester information of 186,026 stems (clear-cuts), remotely sensed, and environmental data (e.g. climate and terrain characteristics). This study utilized Random Forests models with two sets of predictor variables: (1) predictor variables available after harvest (theoretical case) and (2) predictor variables available prior to harvest (mapping case). Our findings showed that forest attributes characterizing the maturity of forest, such as remote sensing-based height, harvested timber volume and quadratic mean diameter at breast height, were among the most important predictor variables. Remotely sensed predictor variables obtained from airborne laser scanning data and Sentinel-2 imagery were more important than the environmental variables. The theoretical case with a leave-stand-out cross-validation resulted in an RMSE of 11.4 m(3).ha(-1) (pseudo-R2: 0.66) whereas the mapping case resulted in a pseudo-R-2 of 0.60. When spatially distinct clusters of harvested forest stands were used as units in the cross-validation, the RMSE value and pseudo-R-2 associated with the mapping case were 15.6 m(3).ha(-1) and 0.37, respectively. The findings associated with the different cross-validation schemes indicated that the knowledge about the BR status of spatially close stands is of high importance for obtaining satisfactory error rates in the mapping of BR damages.},

Abstract = {Coastal islands are located in a transitional environment where land and ocean interact. During the past 20 years, large areas of the natural landscape of Zhoushan islands have been replaced by human features. There is limited research detailing the amount of impervious surface growth in the Zhoushan islands and trends in the land environment using remotely sensed technologies. The purpose of this paper is to assess the influences of anthropogenic activities on land ecological environment in Zhoushan islands based on remotely sensed impervious surfaces. First the impervious surfaces information of 1986, 1995 and 2006 were estimated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, and then an integrated state indicator was built. The results reveal that imperious surfaces areas (ISA) of Zhoushan islands remarkably increased from 19.2 km(2) (2.73\%) in 1986 to 29.5 km(2) (4.20\%) in 1995, and to 58.2 km(2) (8.27\%) in 2006. The average state value for the total area was 0.70, 0.65, and 0.55 respectively for 1986, 1995, and 2006. Of the surrounding islands, the Lujiazhi, Xiaogan, Panzhi, and Cezi suffered the most land disturbance intensity from human activities, followed by the Jintang, Xiushan, and Damao, and the Changbai and Changzhi had the lowest disturbance values. It indicates that the land ecological environment of Zhoushan islands was variously disturbed by growing human activities over time. Further, we found that the topography, island size, spatial location from Zhoushan Island and economic policy had an influence on change of impervious surfaces for each island.},

Abstract = {Rot in commercial timber reduces the value of the wood substantially and estimating the occurrence, severity, and volume of heartwood rot would be a useful tool in decision-making to minimize economic losses. Remotely sensed data has recently been used for mapping rot on a single-tree level, and although the results have been relatively poor, some potential has been shown. This study applied area-based approaches to predict rot occurrence, rot severity, and rot volume , at an area level. Ground reference data were collected from harvester operations in 2019-2021. Predictor variables were calculated from multi-temporal remotely sensed data together with environmental variables. Response variables from the harvester data and predictor variables from remotely sensed data were aggregated to grid cells and to forest stands. Random Forest models were built for the different combinations of response variables and predictor subsets, and validated with both random- and spatial cross-validation. The results showed that it was not possible to estimate rot occurrence and rot severity with the applied modeling procedure (pR(2): 0.00-0.16), without spatially close training data. The better performance of rot volume models (pR(2): 0.12-0.37) was mainly due to the correlation between timber volume and rot volume.},

Title = {The value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance: a case study in traditional orchards},

Abstract = {Understanding environmental effects on the distribution and abundance of species is central to ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology. This led to the development of species distribution models (SDMs) that relate spatial variation in occurrence and abundance to environmental variables. So far, SDMs rarely considered habitat structure, as a major determinant of bird distributions. While remote sensing increasingly provides high-resolution measures of habitat structure, certain structural variables affecting bird abundance still need to be measured with field surveys. In this study, we compare the value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance. Specifically, we analysed abundance data for nine bird species of traditional orchards in South-Western Germany. `Remote sensing SDMs' related abundance to structural variables obtained by aerial photogrammetry of individual orchard trees. Alternative `field survey SDMs' related bird abundance to detailed field surveys of the species composition and pruning state of orchard trees. Additionally, both remote sensing and field survey SDMs included climate and land use variables. Accounting for detailed habitat structure improved abundance predictions for seven of nine study species compared to models only incorporating climate and land use. The impact on model performance differed between remotely sensed and field-surveyed variables: the former improved abundance models for most (n = 7) bird species, whereas the latter had more variable impact, decreasing model performance for five species. The remotely sensed variable with strongest effects was overall tree density, which positively affected abundance of seven species. In contrast, multiple field-surveyed variables had similar effect strength, with the overall strongest effect found for pear tree density, to which seven bird species showed a unimodal response. These analyses have conservation implications since they predict expected responses of bird species to ongoing changes in orchard structure. Moreover, they identify structural variables that will be most promising to measure via remote sensing data in the future.},

Title = {Models of Marine Fish Biodiversity: Assessing Predictors from Three Habitat Classification Schemes},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {Prioritising biodiversity conservation requires knowledge of where biodiversity occurs. Such knowledge, however, is often lacking. New technologies for collecting biological and physical data coupled with advances in modelling techniques could help address these gaps and facilitate improved management outcomes. Here we examined the utility of environmental data, obtained using different methods, for developing models of both uni- and multivariate biodiversity metrics. We tested which biodiversity metrics could be predicted best and evaluated the performance of predictor variables generated from three types of habitat data: acoustic multibeam sonar imagery, predicted habitat classification, and direct observer habitat classification. We used boosted regression trees (BRT) to model metrics of fish species richness, abundance and biomass, and multivariate regression trees (MRT) to model biomass and abundance of fish functional groups. We compared model performance using different sets of predictors and estimated the relative influence of individual predictors. Models of total species richness and total abundance performed best; those developed for endemic species performed worst. Abundance models performed substantially better than corresponding biomass models. In general, BRT and MRTs developed using predicted habitat classifications performed less well than those using multibeam data. The most influential individual predictor was the abiotic categorical variable from direct observer habitat classification and models that incorporated predictors from direct observer habitat classification consistently outperformed those that did not. Our results show that while remotely sensed data can offer considerable utility for predictive modelling, the addition of direct observer habitat classification data can substantially improve model performance. Thus it appears that there are aspects of marine habitats that are important for modelling metrics of fish biodiversity that are not fully captured by remotely sensed data. As such, the use of remotely sensed data to model biodiversity represents a compromise between model performance and data availability.},

Title = {Spatial prediction of brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) distribution using a combination of remotely sensed and field-observed environmental data},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},

Pages = {578-587},
Abstract = {Context. In New Zealand, the introduced brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, is a reservoir of bovine tuberculosis and as such poses a major threat to the livestock industry. Aerial 1080 poisoning is an important tool for possum control but is expensive, creating an ongoing need for ever more cost-effective ways of using this technique. Aims. To develop geographic information system (GIS) models to better predict spatial variation in the distribution of unmanaged possum populations, to facilitate better targeting of control activities. Methods. Relative abundance of possums and their distribution among habitat types were surveyed in a dry high-country area of the northern South Island. Two GIS-based models were developed to predict the relative abundance of possums on trap lines. The first model used remotely sensed (digital) environmental data; the second complemented the remotely sensed data with fine-scale habitat and topographic data collected on the ground. Key results. Digital environmental factors and habitat features proved to be key predictors of relative possum abundance. In both GIS models, height above valley floor, presence of forest cover and mean annual temperature were the strongest predictors. Conclusions. Predictive maps (projections) of relative possum abundance produced from these models can provide useful decision-support tools for pest-control managers, by enabling possum control to be targeted spatially. Implications. Spatially targeted pest control could allow effective control activities for invasive species or disease vectors to be applied at a lower cost for the same benefit.},

Title = {Remotely sensed vegetation productivity predicts breeding activity and drought refuges for a threatened bird in semi-arid Australia},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Refuges play a critical role protecting species against the effects of climate change. Managing high priority refuges could improve species resilience and facilitate dispersal during periods of environmental change. In this study, we identified drought refuges in semi-arid Australia for a threatened bird, the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata. Using a Poisson regression model, we quantified the effect of remotely sensed vegetation indices, rainfall, soil moisture and site characteristics on malleefowl breeding activity at 144 sites surveyed from 2000 to 2017 during and after drought. We tested the effect of two vegetation productivity indices on malleefowl breeding activity - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) - averaged across three temporal and three spatial scales during the mound building and incubation stage of the breeding cycle. We found that NDVI and EVI were better predictors of malleefowl breeding activity than soil moisture and winter rainfall. The model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value contained NDVI averaged over 3 months (June-August) and a 1-km radius. Malleefowl breeding activity had a strong positive association with NDVI (0.42 +/- se 0.03) and a negative association with slope (-0.34 +/- se 0.03) and vegetation patch size (-0.23 +/- se 0.02). We found the proportion of refugia (top 20\% of predicted breeding activity) in protected areas was highly variable, decreasing from 42\% in an extreme wet year (2011) to 14\% in an extreme drought year (2007). Expanding the reserve network to include refugia predicted to occur in the south of semi-arid Victoria could improve resilience of malleefowl to climate change. We demonstrate how remotely sensed vegetation indices combined with citizen science data can identify where to protect native vegetation with high, stable productivity. Our approach could be applied to a broad range of species in semi-arid regions vulnerable to climate change.},

Title = {Lewis's woodpecker nesting habitat suitability: Predictive models for application within burned forests},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {253},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wildfire-generated snags provide key habitat for wildlife associated with recently disturbed forests, offering nesting and foraging resources for several woodpecker species. Snag harvest through post-fire salvage logging provides economic value but reduces habitat in recently burned forests. Managers of recently burned forests often must identify suitable woodpecker habitat within timeframes precluding field surveys. We developed nesting habitat suitability models for the Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis)-a species of conservation concern potentially impacted by salvage logging-to inform post-fire management planning that includes habitat conservation objectives. Using weighted logistic regression, we selected models that maximized predictive performance measured by spatial cross-validation to verify model applicability to novel wildfire locations. From 1994 to 2018, we monitored 348 nest sites, <= 5 years post-fire, at four wildfire locations across the Inland Pacific Northwest, USA. We used both exclusively remotely sensed covariates (to support habitat mapping) and a combination of remotely sensed and field collected covariates (to inform logging prescriptions). Top models proved predictive of nest distribution across novel wildfire locations, describing positive relationships with local and landscape-scale burn severity, landscape-scale open (0-10\%) and low (10-40\%) canopy cover, large nest tree diameters, locally high snag densities, and southeast-facing slopes. The top combination model was more discriminating of nest from non-nest sites compared to the top remotely sensed model (RPI = 0.976 vs. 0.733, AUC= 0.794 vs. 0.716), indicating the value of vegetation field measurements for quantifying habitat. Herein is exemplified an effective process for developing and evaluating predictive habitat models, broadly applicable, and useful for prioritization of post-fire forest management objectives.},

Abstract = {The mangrove forest ecosystem acts as a shield against the destructive tidal waves, preventing the coastal areas and other properties nearby from severe damages; this protective function certainly deserves attention from researchers to undertake further investigation and exploration. Mangrove forest provides different goods and services. The unique environmental factors affecting the growth of mangrove forest are as follows: distance from the sea or the estuary bank, frequency and duration of tidal inundation, salinity, and composition of the soil. These crucial factors may under certain circumstances turn into obstacles in accessing and managing the mangrove forest. One effective method to circumvent this shortcoming is by using remotely sensed imagery data, which offers a more accurate way of measuring the ecosystem and a more efficient tool of managing the mangrove forest. This paper attempts to review and discuss the usage of remotely sensed imagery data in mangrove forest management, and how they will improve the accuracy and precision in measuring the mangrove forest ecosystem. All types of measurements related to the mangrove forest ecosystem, such as detection of land cover changes, species distribution mapping and disaster observation should take advantage of the advanced technology; for example, adopting the digital image processing algorithm coupled with high-resolution image available nowadays. Thus, remote sensing is a highly efficient, low-cost and time-saving technique for mangrove forest measurement. The application of this technique will further add value to the mangrove forest and enhance its in-situ conservation and protection programmes in combating the effects of the rising sea level due to climate change.},

Pages = {12380-12399},

Abstract = {This study used remotely sensed maps of nightlights to investigate the etiology of increasing disaster losses from hydrometeorological hazards in a data-scarce area. We explored trends in the probability of occurrence of hazardous events (extreme rainfall) and exposure of the local population as components of risk. The temporal variation of the spatial distribution of exposure to hydrometeorological hazards was studied using nightlight satellite imagery as a proxy. Temporal (yearly) and spatial (1 km) resolution make them more useful than official census data. Additionally, satellite nightlights can track informal (unofficial) human settlements. The study focused on the Samala River catchment in Guatemala. The analyses of disasters, using DesInventar Disaster Information Management System data, showed that fatalities caused by hydrometeorological events have increased. Such an increase in disaster losses can be explained by trends in both: (i) catchment conditions that tend to lead to more frequent hydrometeorological extremes (more frequent occurrence of days with wet conditions); and (ii) increasing human exposure to hazardous events (as observed by amount and intensity of nightlights in areas close to rivers). Our study shows the value of remote sensing data and provides a framework to explore the dynamics of disaster risk when ground data are spatially and temporally limited.},

Abstract = {Given the advancements of remote sensing technology, large volumes of remotely sensed images with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions are available. To better monitor and understand the changing Earth's environment, fusion of remotely sensed images with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions is critical for distinctive feature retrieval, interpretation, mapping, and decision analysis. A suite of methods have been developed to fuse multisensor satellite images for different purposes in the past few decades. This paper provides a thorough review of contemporary and classic image fusion methods and presents a summary of their phenomenological applications, with challenges and perspectives, for environmental systems analysis. Cross-mission satellite image fusion, networking, and missing value pixel reconstruction for environmental monitoring are described, and their complex integration is illustrated with a case study of Lake Nicaragua that elucidates the state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies for advancing water quality management.},

Abstract = {The geographicaldistribution of a species is limited by factors such as climate, resources, disturbances and species interactions. Environmental niche models attempt to encapsulate these limits and represent them spatially but do not always incorporate disturbance factors. We constructed MaxEnt models derived from a remotely sensed vegetation classification with, and without, an agricultural modification variable. Including agricultural modification improved model performance and led to more sites with native vegetation and fewer sites with exotic or degraded native vegetation being predicted suitable forA. parapulchella. Analysis of a relatively well-surveyed sub-area indicated that including agricultural modification led to slightly higher omission rates but markedly fewer likely false positives. Expert assessment of the model based on mapped habitat also suggested that including agricultural modification improved predictions. We estimate that agricultural modification has led to the destruction or decline of approximately30-35\% of the most suitable habitat in the sub-area studied and approximately20-25\% of suitable habitat across the entire study area, located in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Environmental niche models for a range of species, particularly habitat specialists, are likely to benefit from incorporating agricultural modification. Our findings are therefore relevant to threatened species planning and management, particularly at finer spatial scales.},

Abstract = {We evaluate whether remotely sensed land-cover change within a newly protected area signalled human-driven ecological degradation. Vegetation density changed in a quarter of pixels during the first 13 years (1986-1999) following the sanctuary's formal enclosure, with many patches showing a decrease in density. We use on-the-ground data collected in 2006 in 132 random plots to explore whether these changes in vegetation density reliably signalled latent shifts in local diversity of woody plants and whether they could be attributed to illicit activities including fuel wood collection and livestock grazing. Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan, India. Species richness, species sharing, species assemblages, and incidence of invasive and useful species were statistically similar among plots in which vegetation density had decreased, increased or remained similar. Likewise, intensity of disturbance associated with human activities was similar across these plot types. Our data provide no clear evidence that local changes in vegetation density signalled latent shifts in local diversity of woody plants. They also fail to reveal any clear association between local changes in vegetation density and human-related activities. Finding no evidence that land-cover change led to biotic erosion, we reflect on the utility of resource-use bans in protected areas, particularly those embedded within historically coupled human-nature systems.},

Abstract = {In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, agriculture represents the most important economic sector, and land control can be considered a perpetual source of conflict. Knowledge of the existing production system distribution is fundamental for both informing national land tenure reforms and guiding more effective agricultural development interventions. The present paper focuses on existing agricultural production systems in Katoyi collectivity, Masisi territory, where returning Internally and Externally Displaced People are resettling. We aim to define a repeatable methodology for building evidence-based and updated knowledge concerning the spatial distribution of the two existing production systems: subsistence-oriented agriculture (SOA) and business-oriented agriculture (BOA). To this aim, we used a supervised object-based classification approach on remotely sensed Sentinel-2 imagery to classify land cover. To classify production systems further within the ``agriculture{''} and ``pasture{''} land use classes, binary classification based on an entropy value threshold was performed. An iterative approach was adopted to define the final H-NDVI threshold that minimised commission and omission errors and maximised overall accuracy and class separability. The methodology achieved acceptable observed accuracy (OA equal to 80-90\% respectively for agricultural and pasture areas) in the assessment. SOA and BOA respectively covered 24.4 and 75.6\% of the collectivity area (34,606 ha). The results conclude that land use and entropy analysis can draw an updated picture of existing land distribution among different production systems, supporting better-adapted intervention strategies in development cooperation and pro-poor agrarian land tenure reforms in conflict-ridden landscapes.},

Abstract = {Understanding how species respond to environmental conditions can assist with conservation strategies and harvest management, especially in arctic and boreal regions that are experiencing rapid climate change. Although climatic influences on species distributions have been studied, broad-scale effects of climate on survival are less well known. We examined the interactive effects of meteorological and remotely sensed environmental variables on survival of Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) lambs and adults by synthesizing radio-telemetry data across their range. We used data from 9 studies of adult sheep and 2 studies of lambs that were conducted between 1997 and 2012 at sites spanning the species' range in Alaska, USA, and northwestern Canada. We obtained environmental variables throughout the range of Dall's sheep, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from optical remote sensing, freeze-thaw frequency (FTF) from passive microwave remote sensing, and gridded climate variables such as snow water equivalent, temperature, and precipitation. We used Cox proportional hazard regression to investigate the effects of environmental variables recorded during summer, winter, and the previous winter on annual survival rates of Dall's sheep lambs and adults. Summer NDVI was the most influential environmental factor affecting lamb survival, with improved lamb survival occurring in years with a high maximum NDVI. Also, lamb predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) decreased substantially with increasing NDVI. The previous winter FTF had the strongest effect on adult survival, with decreased survival occurring after winters with high FTF. In addition, these remotely sensed environmental factors interacted with meteorological factors to affect survival, such that effects of winter temperature depended on summer NDVI and winter FTF. Warm winters increased lamb survival only when preceded by summers with high NDVI, and warm winters increased adult survival only when winter FTF was low. Thus, potential benefits of climate warming may be counteracted if wintertime freeze-thaw events markedly increase. Correlations among environmental variables across sites were low, and regional climate cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) had weak effects, indicating substantial local variability in climatic conditions experienced by Dall's sheep across their range. These findings can help managers anticipate how Dall's sheep populations will respond to changes in local environmental conditions. Our results also highlight the utility of multiple remotely sensed environmental conditions for ungulate management, especially passive microwave products that provide valuable information on winter icing events.

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems for their important multifunctional value, need a complex and increasing amount of descriptive information to support their management. Ecological and environmental related attributes have became nowadays important as traditional ones, such as wood growing stock and basal area. The correct application of Sustainable Forest Management criteria is boosted by spatial contiguous knowledge of such attributes. For such a reason in the last years a huge number of scientific experiences in the forest area have been concentrated to study the relationship between data acquired in the field and remotely sensed multispectral images. Models based on such relationships can be used to estimate and map forest attributes acquired in the field on the basis of a statistical sampling design, can be su- could not take in consideration spatially structured data. In last years many researches have focused on possible relationships between field data and remote sensed informations derived from multispectral imagery. Modeling these relationships allows to extend inventory data to not explored surfaces. In this paper were discussed results on spatializing forest biomaterial attributes, tree heterogeneity and dimensional heterogeneity assessed during an inventory of Mountain Community ``Alto Molise{''} (IS) throw Spot 5 and Landsat TM 7 imagery. For this purpose a multilinear regression and a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier were used.},

Title = {Detecting and mapping the spatial distribution of Chromoleana odorata invasions in communal areas of South Africa using Sentinel-2 multispectral remotely sensed data},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Alien Invasive Plants (AIPs) have been proclaimed to be a significant non-climatic driver of global change. The Siam weed (Chromoleana odorata) is highly invasive in South African rangelands, with serious environmental, agricultural and socio-economic consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of C.odorata's spatial distribution is necessary for implementing relevant mitigation and management approaches to vulnerable and invaded landscapes. Remotely sensed data offer a viable opportunity for detecting and mapping AIPs spatial extents. Hence, this study sought to compare the value of algorithms (i.e. maximum likelihood and random forest) in detecting and mapping C.odorata's spatial distribution in relation to other land use land cover classes (LULC) using the freely available Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. The findings of the study revealed that the vegetation red edge and near-infrared spectral bands of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI) sensor were the most important spectral variables for discriminating C.odorata from other land cover classes. The random forest algorithm yielded the highest overall classification accuracy of 83\%, outperforming the traditional maximum likelihood classifier (75\%) in classifying C.odorata's spatial distribution. Overall, results demonstrate that the combination of freely available Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data and machine learning random forest algorithm produces the highest accuracies for detecting the spatial distribution of C.odorata, particularly in heterogeneous environments. These results could be beneficial to sustainable rangeland management and the adoption of sitespecific mitigation approaches in areas invaded by C.odorata.},

Abstract = {After independence, Zimbabwe adopted two major land reform programmes to address the racially skewed land ownership. Due to the perceived failure of these programmes, the country embarked on a highly politicised and forceful acquisition and re-distribution of white owned commercial farms under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP). Whereas a large number of Zimbabweans have been allocated land under the programme, there has been a significant decline in agricultural productivity and an increase in degradation of land and associated resources. Popular opinion has even suggested the country's current socio-economic challenges are linked to the programme. Mitigating land degradation, enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting natural resources sustainability requires an objective understanding and determination landscape transformation within relevant administrative decision making spatial extents. In this study, we adopted multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery to determine landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP in Chipinge administrative district, characterised by heterogeneous land usage and natural resources. Major land use-land-cover types were determined using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm and accuracy established using field survey and ancillary data. Results show significant landscape transformation after the implementation of the FTLRP. Specifically, there was a decline in plantations, small farms, water bodies and forests and an increase in bare areas and settlements. This study demonstrates the value of remotely data in monitoring landscape transformation arising from a shift in policy. Furthermore, these results provide an insight into multi-temporal spatial changes in cultivated, natural and degraded lands, valuable for designing measures to improve landscape productivity and to adopt relevant rehabilitation measures. Understanding multi-temporal landscape change within an administrative boundary is particularly valuable for area specific planning, policy formulation and adoption of desired mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {Accumulating remotely sensed and ground-measured data and improvements in data mining such as machine-learning techniques open new opportunities for monitoring and managing algal blooms over large spatial scales. The goal of this study was to test the accuracy of remotely sensed algal biomass determined with machine-learning algorithms and Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery. We used chlorophyll-a concentration data from the 2007 National Lake Assessment (NLA) (lake N = 1157) by the US Environmental Protection Agency to train and test Landsat TM/ETM+ algorithms. Results showed significant improvements in chlorophyll-a retrieval accuracy using machine-learning algorithms compared with traditional empirical models using linear regression. Specifically, the results from boosted regression trees and random forest explained, respectively, 45.8\% and 44.5\% of chlorophyll-a variation. Multiple linear regression could only explain 39.8\% of chlorophyll-a variation. The chlorophyll-a concentration derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ and a simple to use Google Earth Engine application, accurately characterized a 2009 algal bloom in western Lake Erie to show the model worked well for the analysis of temporal changes in algal conditions. Compared with chlorophyll-a data from the NLA, chlorophyll-a measurements with our Landsat TM/ETM+ model had almost the same correlation with lake's total phosphorus concentrations, especially when using multiple Landsat images. Therefore, Landsat measurements of chlorophyll-a have value for ecological assessments and managing algal problems in lakes. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

Title = {Data-driven regionalization of forested and non-forested ecosystems in coastal British Columbia with LiDAR and RapidEye imagery},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {35-50},

Abstract = {Traditionally, forest inventory and ecosystem mapping at local to regional scales rely on manual interpretation of aerial photographs, based on standardized, expert-driven classification schemes. These current approaches provide the information needed for forest ecosystem management but constrain the thematic and spatial resolution of mapping and are infrequently repeated. The goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of an unsupervised, quantitative technique based on Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-spectral satellite imagery for mapping local-scale ecosystems over a heterogeneous landscape of forested and non-forested ecosystems. We derived a range of metrics characterizing local terrain and vegetation from LiDAR and RapidEye imagery for Calvert and Hecate Islands, British Columbia. These metrics were used in a cluster analysis to classify and quantitatively characterize ecological units across the island. A total of 18 clusters were derived. The clusters were attributed with quantitative summary statistics from the remotely sensed data inputs and contextualized through comparison to ecological units delineated in a traditional expert-driven mapping method using aerial photographs. The 18 clusters describe ecosystems ranging from open shrublands to dense, productive forest and include a riparian zone and many wetter and wetland ecosystems. The clusters provide detailed, spatially-explicit information for characterizing the landscape as a mosaic of units defined by topography and vegetation structure. This study demonstrates that using various types of remotely sensed data in a quantitative classification can provide scientists and managers with multivariate information unique from that which results from traditional, expert-based ecosystem mapping methods.

Title = {Scale of inference: on the sensitivity of habitat models for wide-ranging marine predators to the resolution of environmental data},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Understanding and predicting the responses of wide-ranging marine predators such as cetaceans, seabirds, sharks, turtles, pinnipeds and large migratory fish to dynamic oceanographic conditions requires habitat-based models that can sufficiently capture their environmental preferences. Marine ecosystems are inherently dynamic, and animal-environment interactions are known to occur over multiple, nested spatial and temporal scales. The spatial resolution and temporal averaging of environmental data layers are therefore key considerations in modelling the environmental determinants of habitat selection. The utility of environmental data contemporaneous to animal presence or movement (e.g. daily, weekly), versus synoptic products (monthly, seasonal, climatological) is currently debated, as are the trade-offs between near real-time, high resolution and composite (i.e. synoptic, cloud-free) data fields. Using movement simulations with built-in environmental preferences in combination with both modelled and remotely-sensed (ROMS, MODIS-Aqua) sea surface temperature (SST) fields, we explore the effects of spatial and temporal resolution (3-111 km, daily-climatological) in predictive habitat models. Results indicate that models fitted using seasonal or climatological data fields can introduce bias in presence-availability designs based upon animal movement datasets, particularly in highly dynamic oceanographic domains. These effects were pronounced where models were constructed using seasonal or climatological fields of coarse (>0.25 degree) spatial resolution. However, cloud obstruction can lead to significant information loss in remotely-sensed data fields. We found that model accuracy decreased substantially above 70\% data loss. In cloudy regions, weekly or monthly environmental data fields may therefore be preferable. These findings have important implications for marine resource management, particularly in identifying key habitats for populations of conservation concern, and in forecasting climate-mediated ecosystem changes.},

Title = {Species Distribution Modeling for Conservation of Rare, Edaphic Endemic Plants in White River Valley, Nevada},
Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-158},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sites where edaphic endemic plants have evolved exist in isolated, often small patches throughout the Great Basin. Gypsophytes, plants that live on gypsum soil outcrops, are one group of edaphic endemic plants about which information on localities and habitat requirements is needed. An opportunity to provide some protection to gypsophyte species in White River Valley, Nevada, arose with the revision of Ely BLM's Resource Management Plan. Field surveys to gather locality data were performed in 2005 and 2007, and 1840 new localities were identified. Species distribution modeling can be a useful tool for delineating areas for special management to benefit species of concern. Species distribution model inputs included gypsophyte localities, elevation, slope, aspect, and remotely sensed data on probability of gypsum springmound occurrence. Model outputs were refined using field surveys, and four sites with gypsum springmounds with BLM sensitive-status gypsophytes for Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) status were proposed. These four sites have since been designated, and provide some degree of protection to gypsophytes, though the scattered, isolated nature of gypsum springmounds and other edaphic endemic plant habitats highlights the importance of the use of rare plant locality point data, as well as remotely sensed data and field surveys by land management agency staff in carrying out National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning for projects that have the potential to harm rare plant populations. ``On the alkaline flats by the lower waters of the White River, where the deep, somewhat sandy, alluvial soil is overlaid with a dazzling rime of mineral salts, {[}F. gypsicola] occurs in abundance over a small area, and the heavy, depressed tufts of pale, grass-like foliage, which erupt towards midsummer into innumerable slender panicles of blossom, form a striking feature of the sparse but highly interesting saline flora.{''}},

Title = {Optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling for survey of China's land with remotely sensed data},

Abstract = {In the remote sensing survey of the country land, cost and accuracy are a pair of conflicts, for which spatial sampling is a preferable solution with the aim of an optimal balance between economic input and accuracy of results, or in other words, acquirement of higher accuracy at less cost. Counter to drawbacks of previous application models, e.g. lack of comprehensive and quantitative-comparison, the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is proposed. This model first acquires the possible accuracy-cost diagrams of multiple schemes through initial spatial exploration, then regresses them and standardizes them into a unified reference frame, and finally produces the relatively optimal sampling scheme by using the discrete decision-making function (built by this paper) and comparing them in combination with the diagrams. According to the test result in the survey of the arable land using remotely sensed data, the Sandwich model, while applied in the survey of the thin-feature and cultivated land areas with aerial photos, can better realize the goal of the best balance between investment and accuracy. With this case and other cases, it is shown that the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is a good choice in the survey of the farm areas using remote sensing, with its distinguished benefit of higher precision at less cost or vice versa. In order to extensively apply the model in the surveys of natural resources, including arable farm areas, this paper proposes the prototype of development using the component technology, that could considerably improve the analysis efficiency by insetting program components within the software environment of GIS and RS.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forest is an integral part of inter-tidal zone of the coastal environment extending throughout the tropics and subtropics of the world. There is a wide spectrum of economic and ecological utility of Indus delta mangrove forests, sixth largest mangroves forest of 92 countries. Over the last decades, numerous classification techniques/software have been used to extract deltaic vegetation information through remotely sensed data. In the present research paper, two different techniques (Maximum Likelihood Classification and SubPixel Classification) were applied at high and low resolution satellite data. The aim was to propose best classification technique for the mapping and management of coastal greengold. Study highlights the draw backs of traditional classification results at low resolution satellite dataset. Subpixel classification results applied on medium resolution image were satisfactory and comparable with Maximum Likelihood Classification results at high resolution satellite data.},

Abstract = {We assessed the utility of several LIDAR-derived seascape metrics (e.g. depth, rugosity, slope, variance in depth) to determine which measures of the seascape demonstrated important relationships with fish assemblage structure and would ultimately serve as the best ecological criteria to advance predictive modeling of fish assemblages using remote sensing and GIS analysis. Variance in depth (within a 75 m radius) was the seascape metric that had the strongest relationships with most fish assemblage metrics, followed by depth and slope. Our results demonstrate the potential for using remotely sensed measures of the seascape to support predictive mapping and modeling of fish assemblages.},

Abstract = {Coal mining generates a number of significant environmental impacts. Due to its synoptic coverage and repetitive data acquisition capabilities, remote sensing has been extensively used to monitor effects of surface mining. Availability of low cost and high resolution data in recent years has focused increased attention on the use of satellite data for monitoring surface mining activity. This article presents an overview of some of the important studies that have used satellite and airborne remote sensing data to assess environmental impacts of coal mining and to monitor reclamation activities. Detection and delineation of subsurface coal mine fires using remotely-sensed thermal data is also briefly discussed. The utility of interfacing remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems for effective environmental management of mining areas has been emphasized.},

Abstract = {The environmental quality of urban streets renders distinctive characteristics to the neighbourhoods of a city and has a direct impact on the land value. This research investigates whether and to what extent the environmental quality of a city's streets can be recorded and quantified in order to achieve classification. The paper presents the methodology that was followed in a pilot area of Chania, where environmental indices were defined, quantified, examined and statistically classified. Multispectral satellite data Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) were then used in a supervised classification procedure. The results of this supervised classification were compared to reality, through a geodatabase that was created specifically for this research. The methodology that was followed produced very promising results that can be applied in urban and spatial studies, in sustainable city development and in environmental policy design.},

Abstract = {Sub-pixel mapping of flood inundation (SMFI) is one of the hotspots in remote sensing and relevant research and application fields. In this study, a novel method based on the integration of Bayesian regulation back-propagation neural network (BRBP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), so-called IBRBPPSO, is proposed for SMFI in river basins. The IBRBPPSO-SMFI algorithm was developed and evaluated using Landsat images fromthe Changjiang river basin in China and the Murray-Darling basin in Australia. Compared with traditional SMFI methods, IBRBPPSO-SMFI consistently achieves the most accurate SMFI results in terms of visual and quantitative evaluations. IBRBPPSO-SMFI is superior to PSO-SMFI with not only an improved accuracy, but also an accelerated convergence speed of the algorithm. IBRBPPSO-SMFI reduces the uncertainty in mapping inundation in river basins by improving the accuracy of SMFI. The result of this study will also enrich the SMFI methodology, and thereby benefit the environmental studies of river basins.},

Abstract = {The Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment Tool (AGWA) and the Rangeland Hydrology Erosion Model (RHEM) were used to evaluate conservation practices on the Cienega Creek watershed (CCW) that were implemented under the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) on Grazing Lands. CEAP on Grazing Lands is a multi-agency effort to quantify the environmental effects of conservation practices and programs, and develop the science base for managing rangelands for environmental quality using conservation practices (Spaeth et al. 2013). The evaluation was performed on the CCW and the Empire Ranch, located in southeastern Arizona, where numerous conservation practices have been implemented to achieve their management goals of maintaining desired plant communities and watershed processes. To assess the effects of the conservation practices on long-term soil and water loss, RHEM was applied to the entire CCW using National Resources Inventory (NRI) data. Four analysis periods were selected based on climatic contrasts, conservation spending, and availability of NRI sample points. The CCW results showed that the simulations using RHEM parameters derived from NRI data could be used to demonstrate the impact of climate on vegetation condition and sediment yield. A subsection, dubbed ``select treatment areas,{''} of the CCW, which received extensive treatments with brush removal, prescribed burns, and stock ponds, was assessed using remotely sensed data.The select treatment areas were modeled over three different periods, representing preconservation spending, postconservation spending, and later postconservation spending. Remote sensing was capable of detecting and estimating the changes in vegetation cover from brush removal and prescribed burns. Simulations of sediment yield using pre- and posttreatment data indicated a modest reduction in sediment yield. Simulations in the select treatment areas indicated mechanical brush treatments were typically more effective than prescribed burns for improving watershed condition as estimated by reductions in sediment yield, but were more costly to implement. Stock ponds had a larger impact on sediment yield than the land treatments. The assessment demonstrated the utility of remotely sensed estimates of plant growth form and cover for model inputs to estimate changes in runoff and sediment yield with changing cover conditions over large areas.},

Abstract = {In an effort to increase conservation effectiveness through the use of Earth observation technologies, a group of remote sensing scientists affiliated with government and academic institutions and conservation organizations identified 10 questions in conservation for which the potential to be answered would be greatly increased by use of remotely sensed data and analyses of those data. Our goals were to increase conservation practitioners' use of remote sensing to support their work, increase collaboration between the conservation science and remote sensing communities, identify and develop new and innovative uses of remote sensing for advancing conservation science, provide guidance to space agencies on how future satellite missions can support conservation science, and generate support from the public and private sector in the use of remote sensing data to address the 10 conservation questions. We identified a broad initial list of questions on the basis of an email chain-referral survey. We then used a workshop-based iterative and collaborative approach to whittle the list down to these final questions (which represent 10 major themes in conservation): How can global Earth observation data be used to model species distributions and abundances? How can remote sensing improve the understanding of animal movements? How can remotely sensed ecosystem variables be used to understand, monitor, and predict ecosystem response and resilience to multiple stressors? How can remote sensing be used to monitor the effects of climate on ecosystems? How can near real-time ecosystem monitoring catalyze threat reduction, governance and regulation compliance, and resource management decisions? How can remote sensing inform configuration of protected area networks at spatial extents relevant to populations of target species and ecosystem services? How can remote sensing-derived products be used to value and monitor changes in ecosystem services? How can remote sensing be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts? How does the expansion and intensification of agriculture and aquaculture alter ecosystems and the services they provide? How can remote sensing be used to determine the degree to which ecosystems are being disturbed or degraded and the effects of these changes on species and ecosystem functions?},

Title = {Spatial modeling of litter and soil carbon stocks on forest land n the conterminous United States},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems contribute substantially to carbon (C) storage. The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NEI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phonology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 +/- 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 +/- 2.38 Mg ha(-1), and the soil C stock at 0-20 an depth was 14.68 +/- 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 +/- 8.98 Mg ha(-1). This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables.

Abstract = {The paper explores connections between decision support systems, remotely sensed and GIS data for environmental planning, and monitoring secondary soil salinization. The paper introduces a decision support knowledge base system called SALT MANAGER used as the starting point for three experiments in data mining which structure the paper. In the first, classified GIS data is passed to an inductive learning programme. The task is to reconstruct the classification rules. The resulting rules are used to improve knowledge base system performance. The second experiment reports on patterns of attribute value combinations occurring for specific classification classes. These patterns can be used to elicit new knowledge in the domain and lead to a form of knowledge discovery. This process is commonly referred to as `data mining'. The third experiment measures the effect of an additional electromagnetic data layer on the knowledge base system. Again, our efforts yield novel knowledge discovery results from the application of data mining techniques. Finally, a comparison of different machine learning algorithms in the secondary salinization domain is given.},

Abstract = {We used a value of information approach to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of using satellite imagery as part of the Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER), a US federal program that identifies imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property and critical natural or cultural resources. We compared the costs associated with producing a Burn Area Reflectance Classification map and implementing a BAER when imagery from satellites (either Landsat or a commercial satellite) was available to when the response team relied on information collected solely by aerial reconnaissance. The case study included two evaluations with and without Burn Area Reflectance Classification products: (a) savings of up to US\$51 000 for the Elk Complex wildfire incident request and (b) savings of a multi-incident map production program. Landsat is the most cost-effective way to input burn severity information into the BAER program, with savings of up to US\$35 million over a 5-year period.},

Journal = {SPACE POLICY},

Volume = {36},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Remotely sensed data can be used to understand and,devise measures to address important global issues such as climate change, disaster and disease outbreak. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is one of the largest producer and gatekeeper of satellite earth observation (EO) data that plays a crucial role in ensuring that these resources are used for solving global societal problems. However, the extent of remote sensing application is highly disparate in different parts of the world. This paper provides a general overview of key societal applications that have been enabled globally with the use of EO data. It also summarizes the impact of various NASA-supported programs for promoting applications on the targeted beneficiary communities. The themes addressed here are land cover/land use mapping, carbon biomass assessment, food security, disaster management, water resources, ocean management and health and air quality. The paper also argues for capacity building that is crucial to building sustainable solutions when using EO data for science-based decision making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme, since its inception has been applications driven and national development has been its main motivation. In order to meet the observational requirements of many societal benefit areas, a series of EO systems have been launched in both polar and geo synchronous orbits. Starting from Bhaskara, the first experimental EO satellite in 1979 to Cartosat-1 successfully launched in May 2005, a large number of sensors operating in optical and microwave spectral regions, providing data at resolutions ranging from I kin to a meter have been built and flown. Data reception and processing facilities have been established not only in the country but also at various international ground stations. Remotely sensed data and its derived information have become an integral component of the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS), a unique concept evolved and established in the country. The paper discusses the evolution of IRS satellite systems, application programmes in different societal benefit areas and the road ahead. How it complements and supplements the international efforts in the context of Global Earth Observation System of Systems has also been indicated.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the growth of rice and forecasting its yield before harvest season is important for crop and food management. Remote sensing images are capable of identifying crop health as well as in predicting its yield. This study was conducted to develop a functional model for predicting rice yield from remotely sensed data. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from remote sensing images has been widely-used to monitor crop growth and relate it to crop yield. This study used 16-d composite Terra MODIS NDVI data from December 2008 to April 2009 to predict rice yield in Dingras, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Nine yield prediction models were developed through linear regression analysis (stepwise method) between NDVI and observed yield, among which Model 3 had the highest potential. It can predict yield way ahead before harvesting. The R-2 value of the models ranged 0.36-0.75, which means that about 39-75\% of the yield variability could be explained by the models. The variability between predicted and actual yields are due to factors not considered in the model such as type of soil, varieties planted, weather and other cultural management practices, such as water, nutrient and pest managements used on the standing crop studied.},

Abstract = {Decision makers, planners and actors in cities design policies, plan, invest money and build infrastructure, and consumers buy houses and use transport infrastructure without sound information about the environmental consequences of many of those decisions. Decisions, however, that have a lasting impact on sustainable development outcomes. In this study, we employ novel analytical techniques to align the spatial characteristics of the built urban environment with information for building materials and GHG embodiment to inform planning and investment decisions at the district, suburb and city scale. We represent a three-dimensional model of a suburb established from remotely sensed data and use algorithms to identify building types and align those with their typical material composition. We analyse the urban development of the modelled suburb in three historical time steps - 1955, 1981 and 2015 - and establish the consequence of urban planning decisions on material use and GHG embodiment. We test the new methodology for its applicability for a whole of city analysis and discuss the benefit for environmentally sustainable urban planning and design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {An economic approach to remote-sensing applications needs to be developed to demonstrate the cost-advantage ratio of Earth observation for decision makers. This article aims to conduct such an analysis of the information derived by remote sensing for a specific operational project, following some general chemical consideration about the economic value the economic value of information highlight that: of information. In our study of tropical deforestation modelling the main advantages of the remote-sensing-based information system came from: (i) an improvement of decision making as decisions could be made with a higher degree of confidence, leading to a shorter and less expensive decision cycle, and to earlier implementation of decisions; and (ii) avoidance of bad bad decisions, as the rate of project failure, and the associated resource wastes, was expected to decrease as a result of the availability of more accurate information. The costs of the model development and calibration and model implementation are also discussed. The economic approach is then generalised to three generic categories of remote-sensing projects (private, public with short-term implications and public with long-term implications).

Abstract = {In the US, the EFA has recently made several product registration decisions involving products for which a `'presumed risk'' existed. Through innovative technologies, regulatory negotiation and environmental modeling or monitoring, the Agency and agribusiness have been able to reach mutual goals of risk assessment and new product registration. In this process, environmental risk, fate and impact assessment have grown from a fledgling science which estimated a predicted effect to a more mature process which quantifies risk, identifies environmental variability and utilizes modeling or monitoring to prove the underlying thesis about `'risk''. The weakest link in the prediction of risk, however, is in the interpretation of a given event or condition with respect to its meaning for a broad geographic area Along with other tools and strategies, Geographic Information Systems, which analyze data while maintaining their spatial relationships, and remotely sensed data, which define land cover variables, provide `'real world'' characterization of the environment for the region of interest and contribute data which can be used not only for probabilistic meddling but also for market development, product distribution analysis or test site selection. Through this approach, regulatory needs are met by data which then have further utility in product development and management.},

Abstract = {Utilizing timber harvest residues (biomass) for renewable energy production provides an alternative disposal method to onsite burning that may improve the economic viability of hazardous fuels treatments. Due to the relatively low value of biomass, accurate estimates of biomass volumes and costs of collection and delivery are essential if investment in renewable energy production is to occur. We have established a spatial framework for estimating biomass volumes and costs of availability using publicly available data and models for Ravalli County in Western Montana. We used forest inventory data to estimate forest conditions and remotely sensed data to identify lands suitable for treatment and the spatial distribution of biomass resources. Using our framework, we geographically identified approximately 67,000 acres of low elevation, frequent fire interval forestland potentially available for fuel reduction treatment. Our analysis of forest inventory data shows that if a comprehensive forest restoration treatment is applied to these selected forestlands, 12 to 14 green tons per acre of biomass are potentially available for energy production in Ravalli County, Montana, at reasonable delivered costs.},

Abstract = {Near real-time (NRT) forest monitoring and alert systems based on remotely sensed data are among the most recently developed tools to help manage and protect forest resources. The use of satellite and airborne remote sensing to quickly and accurately detect activities associated with deforestation has great potential for catalyzing local response teams responsible for assessing and interdicting threats to tropical forest ecosystems. To better understand the utility of NRT monitoring technologies in improving environmental protection and management, from 2008 to 2016 Conservation International conducted a series of surveys and interviews with users of these systems in four countries where wildfires threaten tropical forest ecosystems: Madagascar, Indonesia, Bolivia and Peru. Users reported that NRT forest monitoring systems made significant contributions to improving the ability of conservation and forest management organizations to respond to and reduce the impacts of fire, deforestation and other illegal or undesirable forest activity. Understanding the types of applications for which users successfully employed forest monitoring data, the challenges they faced in accessing, analyzing or disseminating these data, and the lessons learned from our attempts to develop and deploy NRT forest monitoring systems is useful to institutions interested in successfully incorporating NRT monitoring into their work.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Arabian Gulf is one of the regions in the world experiencing major changes due to increased economic growth rates and development practices. As a shallow water body within a hot desert, the Gulf is exposed to obvious warming in the sea surface temperatures (SST). Remotely sensed SST data were utilized to estimate decadal change in SST with a focus on coral reef locations. There is a positive trend in monthly time series SSTs, with a maximum value of about 0.7 degrees C/decade for the western side of the Gulf. This high trend of SST is associated with significant coral reef bleaching and it coincides with major climate/ocean interactions. Most of the Arabian countries along the Gulf have coastal developments at low-land areas of high vulnerability to sea level rise. Digital elevation models showed that there are more than 3100 km(2) of coastal areas that occur at 1 m level along the Arabian countries of the Gulf. Coastal protection and conservation measures are crucial to protect low-lying coasts of urban use.},

Abstract = {Over the last 25 years, economic water policy models have evolved in concept, theoretical and technical methods, scope and application to address a host of water demand, supply, and management policy questions. There have been a number of theoretical and empirical advances over this period, particularly related to estimation of nonmarket, public good water-related values involving different methods of valuation. We discuss modeling advances including modeling multiple, competing demands, types of incentives and technologies and behavioral responses, incorporation of groundwater and other supply alternatives, integration of institutional factors, and increasing attention to system-wide impacts. The largest changes in hydroeconomic policy models have been the integration of the individual demand and supply components, inclusion of environmental values, incorporation of governance and institutional conditions (laws, regulations and policies), and expansion to river basin and even interposing scales of analysis. Important areas of future hydroeconomic model advances will be the use of genetic and neurological based algorithms for solving dynamic, stochastic problems, reconstruction of hydrological and economic relationships for remotely sensed data, and the expansion of models to understand and address transboundary water resource economic, hydrologic, environmental and institutional policy, and interdependencies.},

Abstract = {Heat-related death is considered the number one weather-related cause of mortality throughout the world. There is growing concern that, heat waves, the primary meteorological phenomena responsible, will become more intense and numerous in the near future. Provided with this growing hazard the responsibility for mitigation, early detection and warning rests with emergency response agencies as well as academic researchers. Numerous tools exist in the present time to model very complex relationships that truly define vulnerability to such impending disasters. However, compared to other disasters (i.e. flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.) heatrelated effects have not been thoroughly investigated in a geospatial framework. It seems likely that such approaches will provide significant benefit to the vulnerable communities and to policy makers responsible for planning. These approaches involve the usage of multiple sensor data (multi-sensor data fusion) coupled with socioeconomic characteristics to truly capture the fabric of social vulnerability. Evidence is growing that these approaches are beginning to have an impact in forecasting and planning for heat-related health disasters.},

Title = {Detecting and predicting forest degradation: A comparison of ground surveys and remote sensing in Tanzanian forests},

Abstract = {Societal Impact Statement Large areas of tropical forest are degraded. While global tree cover is being mapped with increasing accuracy from space, much less is known about the quality of that tree cover. Here we present a field protocol for rapid assessments of forest condition. Using extensive field data from Tanzania, we show that a focus on remotely-sensed deforestation would not detect significant reductions in forest quality. Radar-based remote sensing of degradation had good agreement with the ground data, but the ground surveys provided more insights into the nature and drivers of degradation. We recommend the combined use of rapid field assessments and remote sensing to provide an early warning, and to allow timely and appropriately targeted conservation and policy responses. Summary Tropical forest degradation is widely recognised as a driver of biodiversity loss and a major source of carbon emissions. However, in contrast to deforestation, more gradual changes from degradation are challenging to detect, quantify and monitor. Here, we present a field protocol for rapid, area-standardised quantifications of forest condition, which can also be implemented by non-specialists. Using the example of threatened high-biodiversity forests in Tanzania, we analyse and predict degradation based on this method. We also compare the field data to optical and radar remote-sensing datasets, thereby conducting a large-scale, independent test of the ability of these products to map degradation in East Africa from space. Our field data consist of 551 `degradation' transects collected between 1996 and 2010, covering >600 ha across 86 forests in the Eastern Arc Mountains and coastal forests. Degradation was widespread, with over one-third of the study forests-mostly protected areas-having more than 10\% of their trees cut. Commonly used optical remote-sensing maps of complete tree cover loss only detected severe impacts (>= 25\% of trees cut), that is, a focus on remotely-sensed deforestation would have significantly underestimated carbon emissions and declines in forest quality. Radar-based maps detected even low impacts (<5\% of trees cut) in similar to 90\% of cases. The field data additionally differentiated types and drivers of harvesting, with spatial patterns suggesting that logging and charcoal production were mainly driven by demand from major cities. Rapid degradation surveys and radar remote sensing can provide an early warning and guide appropriate conservation and policy responses. This is particularly important in areas where forest degradation is more widespread than deforestation, such as in eastern and southern Africa.},

Abstract = {Environmental compliance assessment and enforcement are complex, labor intensive tasks that would benefit from some form of decision support. Despite the well-documented application of remote sensing in environmental analysis and assessment, the operational use of this technology for environmental compliance enforcement remains in its infancy. Because the majority of environmental laws and regulations in the United States were enacted prior to the emergence of a mature science of remote sensing, there exists a degree of skepticism regarding the operational utility and reliability of remotely sensed data as an environmental compliance tool. This paper provides a review of the role of remote sensing in environmental compliance assessment and introduces a framework to guide the application of this technology based on the use of artificial neural networks. The customized neural networks developed in this study serve as a simplifying strategy to assist the process of compliance monitoring. Functioning as ``intelligent{''} classifiers, the network models provide a spatial characterization of activities likely to cause damage; achieving mapping accuracies that ranged from 68 to 90\% for the test case samples selected for investigation.

Abstract = {Most recent research on querying and managing data streams has concentrated on traditional data models where the data come in the form of tuples or XML data. Complex types of streaming data, in particular spatio-temporal data, have primarily been investigated in the context of moving objects and location-aware services. In this paper, we study query processing and optimization aspects for streaming Remotely-Sensed Imagery (RSI) data. Streaming RSI is typical for the vast amount of imaging satellites orbiting the Earth, and it exhibits certain characteristics that make it very attractive to tailored query optimization techniques. Our approach uses a Dynamic Cascade Tree (DCT) to (1) index spatio-temporal query regions associated with continuous user queries and (2) efficiently determine what incoming RSI data is relevant to what queries. The DCT supports the processing of different types of RSI data, ranging from point data to more general spatial extents in which the incoming imagery can be single pixels, rows of pixels, or discrete parts of images. The DCT exploits spatial trends in incoming RSI data to efficiently filter the data of interest to the individual query regions. Experimental results using random input and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data give a good insight into processing streaming RSI and verify the efficiency and utility of the DCT.},

Abstract = {A decision framework is developed for quantifying the economic value of information (VOI) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission for drought monitoring, with a focus on the potential contributions of groundwater storage and soil moisture measurements from the GRACE data assimilation (GRACE-DA) system. The study consists of (i) the development of a conceptual framework to evaluate the socioeconomic value of GRACE-DA as a contributing source of information to drought monitoring; (ii) structured listening sessions to understand the needs of stakeholders who are affected by drought monitoring; (iii) econometric analysis based on the conceptual framework that characterizes the contribution of GRACE-DA to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) in capturing the effects of drought on the agricultural sector; and (iv) a demonstration of how the improved characterization of drought conditions may influence decisions made in a real-world drought disaster assistance program. Results show that GRACE-DA has the potential to lower the uncertainty associated with the understanding of drought and that this improved understanding has the potential to change policy decisions that lead to tangible societal benefits.},

Title = {Comparing different approaches for mapping urban vegetation cover from Landsat ETM+ data: A case study on Brussels},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Urban growth and its related environmental problems call for sustainable urban management policies to safeguard the quality of urban environments. Vegetation plays an important part in this as it provides ecological, social, health and economic benefits to a city's inhabitants. Remotely sensed data are of great value to monitor urban green and despite the clear advantages of contemporary high resolution images, the benefits of medium resolution data should not be discarded. The objective of this research was to estimate fractional vegetation cover from a Landsat ETM+ image with sub-pixel classification, and to compare accuracies obtained with multiple stepwise regression analysis, linear spectral unmixing and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) at the level of meaningful urban spatial entities. Despite the small, but nevertheless statistically significant differences at pixel level between the alternative approaches, the spatial pattern of vegetation cover and estimation errors is clearly distinctive at neighbourhood level. At this spatially aggregated level, a simple regression model appears to attain sufficient accuracy. For mapping at a spatially more detailed level, the MLP seems to be the most appropriate choice. Brightness normalisation only appeared to affect the linear models, especially the linear spectral unmixing.},

Title = {Estimating District-Level Electricity Consumption Using Remotely Sensed Data in Eastern Economic Corridor, Thailand},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The intensive industrial development in special economic zones, such as Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, increases energy consumption, leading to an imbalance of energy supply and a challenge for energy management. Electricity consumption at a local level is crucial for utility planners to manage and invest in the electrical grid. With this study, we propose an electricity consumption estimation model at the district level using machine learning with publicly available statistical data and built-up area (BU), area of lit (AL), and sum of light intensity (SL) data extracted from Landsat 8 and Suomi NPP satellite nighttime light images. The models created from three machine learning algorithms, which included Multiple Linear Regression (MR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were compared. The results show that (1) electricity consumption is highly correlated with SL, AL, and BU; and (2) the DT model demonstrated a better performance in predicting local electricity consumption when compared to MR and SVR with the lowest error rate and highest R-2. The local government in developing countries with limited data and financial resources can adopt the proposed approach to benefit from utilizing commonly available remote sensing and statistical data with simple machine learning models such as DT (regression method) for sustainable electricity management.},

Abstract = {Concerns on urban environmental quality, increasing knowledge on impacts of climate change and pursuit for sustainable development have increased the need for past, current and future knowledge on the transformation of remnant urban fringe green ecosystems. Using land-cover change modeler and a Markov chain analysis on multi-temporal SPOT imagery, this study sought to determine a twenty two-year past and future land use and land cover trend and its implication on green spaces in an eThekwini Municipal Area's peripheral settlement. Results show a consistent pattern of decline in land use and land cover types associated with green spaces and an increase in impervious surfaces. The study confirms recent urban bio-physical transformation and anticipated increased pressure on peripheral urban green spaces in eThekwini Municipality. These changes can be attributed to natural urban growth and government led efforts like the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Findings in the study highlight the challenges faced by eThekwini Municipality, and indeed other South Africa's urban areas in maintaining urban green spaces and mitigating related implications like those associated with climate change. This study further demonstrates the value of multi-temporal remotely sensed datasets in planning, optimization and sustainable management of urban landscapes.},

Abstract = {Salinization is one of the most widespread environmental threats in arid and semi-arid regions that occur either naturally or artificially within the soil. When exceeding the thresholds, salinity becomes a severe danger, damaging agricultural production, water and soil quality, biodiversity, and infrastructures. This study used spectral indices, including salinity and vegetation indices, Sentinel-2 MSI original bands, and DEM, to model soil salinity in the Great Hungarian Plain. Eighty-one soil samples in the upper 30 cm of the soil surface were collected from vegetated and nonvegetated areas by the Research Institute for Soil Sciences and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC). The sampling campaign of salinity monitoring was performed in the dry season to enhance salt spectral characteristics during its accumulation in the subsoil. Hence, applying a partial least squares regression (PLSR) between salt content (g/kg) and remotely sensed data manifested a highly moderate correlation with a coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.68, a p-value of 0.000017, and a root mean square error of 0.22. The final model can be deployed to highlight soil salinity levels in the study area and assist in understanding the efficacy of land management strategies.},

Title = {A NOVEL APPROACH TO QUANTIFYING THE DEGREE OF ANTHROPOGENIC SURFACE TRANSFORMATION - THE CONCEPT OF `HEMEROMORPHY'},
Journal = {ERDKUNDE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-57},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The degree of human geomorphological impact was estimated as a ratio of natural geomorphological processes and geomorphological processes triggered or facilitated by humankind. A typical Central European cultural landscape of diverse land use and relief was considered as a pilot area. Based on topography maps and landforms the natural material fluxes were calculated. By overlapping historical maps, modern maps and remotely sensed data, the duration and extent of different land use types were mapped, and were assigned to each landscape unit. Anthropogenic material fluxes were calculated for the land use types identified. Dividing the summarized anthropogenic material fluxes by natural ones, the anthropic geomorphological transformation ratio (r(AG)) was estimated. The value of r(AG) is independent of the efficiency and intensity of processes; it merely expresses the relation of effectiveness between human induced and natural processes. Since the calculated index is based on estimated values and there is, at least theoretically, no upper limit, the term `hemeromorphy' was introduced and the values were classified in corresponding `hemeromorphy' categories. For the smallest landscape units with the same degree of `hemeromorphy' the term `hemeromorphotop' was applied. This interpretation makes the comparison of landscape units possible according to their anthropogeomorphological transformation, independently of the intensity and quality of their geomorphological processes.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Mekelle city region is facing severe ecosystem degradation. The study area has experienced unprecedented land-use dynamics over the past 47 years, but the effect of these dynamics on ecosystem-service values remains unknown. Estimating the various ecosystem services from a city region perspective has not been attempted so far. The rationale of this study was to estimate the spatial-temporal ecosystem-service value variations. The methodology employed was land-use/land-cover (LULC) datasets of remotely sensed datasets of the years 1972, 1984, 2001, 2012, and 2019, and ecosystem service value coefficient, expert focus group discussion, and document review were used. The digital satellite images were processed, classified, and analyzed using Earth Resource Development Assessment System (ERDAS) Imagine. Computations of changes in the land-use categories were made using Arc GIS 10.5.1, Eviews for time series data analysis, and XLSTAT analytical tools were used. Over the whole study period from 1972 to 2019, a loss of USD 128.6 million was observed, which is a reduction of 501.9\%. The study shows that due to land-use changes, the total ecosystem service value is decreasing annually, suggesting that much more severe ecosystem degradation is due to occur. The results are relevant to policy development and indicate that ecological restoration is the best option in the study area.},

Title = {A review of applications of remote sensing for drought studies in the Andes region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Study region: As climate change intensifies, drought events are becoming more frequent and intense in the Andes region. Remote sensing offers new opportunities to characterize and monitor drought and its impacts for the benefit of disaster risk reduction, water governance, and climate change adaptation. However, it remains to be seen the extent to which remotely-sensed data has been integrated into the Andes regional drought literature.Study focus: Through a semi-systematic literature review, this study evaluates the existing literature in the Andes on the topic, assesses how, where, and the extent to which remote sensing is being deployed in drought studies in the region, and points to key gaps in our regional understanding of this topic of high societal and environmental concern.New hydrological insight for the region: Remote sensing applications in drought studies remain limited in the Andes but have grown substantially since 2020. The reviewed studies concentrate on Chile and offer new insight into the impact of drought on vegetation, water bodies, the cryosphere, and wildfire incidence. Human activity, through agricultural decision-making and other socioeconomic dimensions, plays a role in propagating or deepening drought in the region. This literature offers new insight into the interplay between different drought types and the role of remote sensing in social-environmental research, although further research across geographies and drought types in the Andes region is urgently needed.},

Abstract = {The dependence of coastal communities on mangrove forests for direct consumptive use due to the scarcity of alternate resources makes them one of the highly disturbed landscapes. This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14\% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30\% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.},

Abstract = {We present a spatially explicit, multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) that uses twelve input layers derived from Landsat-7 and other data derived from remotely sensed observations to create composite maps that integrate information on infrastructure, biology, and physical factors related to known threats to biodiversity in the province of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Composite maps were evaluated statistically using a set of land-use maps related to conservation threats. The composite layer that weighed physical factors most heavily provided a result that was easily distinguishable from other MCE composite maps and yielded a number of statistically significant differences between land-use categories. Specifically, areas designated for forest conversion were more highly threatened than areas not designated for conversion and upland forest areas were less threatened than lowland areas when physical factors were weighed more heavily. However, we reject the hypothesis that established protected areas were generally less threatened than areas that do not benefit from formal protection, which is consistent with assertions concerning the state of East Kalimantan's protected areas. By demonstrating the validity of inexpensive, publicly available spatial data and simple, integrative decision support tools, our methods may be replicated broadly in other regions where forest conversion threatens remaining biodiversity.

Abstract = {The water body on the earth's surface is an important element of the environmental ecosystem. Floating matter, suspended matter, and dissolved matter negatively affect most traditional methods used to extract water body information from remotely sensed images. As a result, extracting water body information with high precision from a wide range from remote sensing images that contain complex ground-based objects has proved difficult. In this study, we proposed a method of extracting water body information from a remote sensing image that considers the wetness of ground-based objects, and we carried out threshold value selection using the Otsu method and post-processing supported by mathematical morphology. Hangzhou Bay, which is rich in inland water resources and marine resources, was selected as the study area. The results obtained from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image show that the contours and spatial extent of the water extracted by the method arc highly consistent, with reduced effects of floating matter, suspended matter, and dissolved matter; the producer's accuracy and user's accuracy are 0.9706 and 0.9572, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can provide technical support for the accurate extraction of water body information, which is of great significance for the scientific management of water resources.},

Abstract = {Waste management involves various procedures and resources for proper handling of waste materials in compliance with health codes and environmental regulations. Landfills are one of the oldest, most convenient, and cheapest methods to deposit waste. However, landfill utilization involves social, environmental, geo-technical, cost, and restrictive regulation considerations. For instance, landfills are considered a source of hazardous air pollutants that can cause health and environmental problems related to landfill gas and non-methanic organic compounds. The increasing number of sensors and availability of remotely sensed images along with rapid development of spatial technology are helping with effective landfill site selection. The present study used fuzzy membership and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in a geo-spatial environment for landfill site selection in the city of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Macro- and micro-level factors were considered; the macro-level contained social and economic factors, while the micro-level accounted for geo-environmental factors. The weighted spatial layers were combined to generate landfill suitability and overall suitability index maps. Sensitivity analysis was then carried out to rectify initial theoretical weights. The results showed that 30.25\% of the study area had a high suitability index for landfill sites in the Sharjah, and the most suitable site was selected based on weighted factors. The developed fuzzy-AHP methodology can be applied in neighboring regions with similar geo-natural conditions.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to quantify, analyze and map soil erosion risk areas using remotely sensed data and GIS-based Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model at Mihtsab-Azmati Irrigation Dam Watershed, Northern Ethiopia. Based on the result, the watershed has potential soil erosion risk which ranges from 0 ton hectare(-1) year(-1) to 2980.12 ton hectare(-1) year(-1) with an average annual soil erosion rate of 110.06 ton hectare(-1) year(-1). From the entire watershed area, only 27\% of it has a soil loss a value less than 15 ton hectare(-1) year-1 which is relatively categorized under low soil erosion risk, while the remaining area (73\%) experiences moderate to very high soil loss rates. A large area (50.7\%) is under high to very high soil loss (>50 ton hectare(-1) year(-1)). The majority of the study watershed area experiences a very high soil erosion rate and this could be a major threat to the new irrigation dam constructed at the outlet of the watershed due to the sedimentation problem, which could decrease the economic lifespan of the dam. Hence, from the conservation perspective, a large proportion of the upper watershed area requires immediate and appropriate soil conservation measures.},

Title = {Assimilation of weather radar and binary ubiquitous sensor measurements for quantitative precipitation estimation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {598-613},
Abstract = {Assimilation of data from heterogeneous sensors and sensor networks is critical for achieving accurate measurements of environmental processes at the time and space scales necessary to improve forecasting and decision-making. Owing to different measurement accuracies and types of spatial and/or temporal measurement support of the component sensors, it is often unclear how best to combine these data. This study explores the utility of ubiquitous sensors producing categorical wet/dry rainfall measurements for improving the resolution of areal quantitative precipitation estimates through fusion with weather radar observations. The model developed in this study employs a Markov random field model to compute the probability of rainfall at sub-grid pixels. These likelihoods are used to `unmix' the cell-averaged rainfall rate measured by the radar. Simulation studies using synthetic and known rainfall fields reveal that the model can improve remotely sensed quantitative rainfall intensity measurements by 40\% using networks of ubiquitous sensors with a density of 56 sensors per square kilometer, and for denser networks, the accuracy can increase by as much as 50\%.},

Abstract = {Phragmites australis populations in native areas have been gradually declining since the mid-20th century. We developed a logical approach based on remote sensing to monitor the conservation status of P. australis beds in response to environmental gradients and orient future management actions in Lake Garda (northern Italy). During the 2010 growing season we collected data on: (i) the structural and functional status of seven P. australis beds and (ii) land cover in a 50-m buffer around each bed, and we tested four different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from a multi-temporal and multisensor dataset. Double hierarchical clustering based on the VI statistics and environmental variables (morphological, functional and land-use) showed a good consistency between the outputs of the vigor-function analysis and the environmental classification of the P. australis beds considered. Overall, the bed's area was the most influential factor in the data clustering procedures, followed by the descriptors derived from the enhanced vegetation index. Our results confirmed the importance of temporal characteristics of remote sensing data to assess the conservation status of common reed beds and proved the sensitivity of VIs and derived descriptors to local environmental conditions within a homogeneous littoral area. This study supports the utility of remote sensing for monitoring riparian vegetation and analyzing the spatial and temporal response of P. australis populations to human pressure and management actions.},

Abstract = {We combine mixed-methods research with integrated agent-based modeling to understand land change and economic decision making in the United States and Mexico. This work demonstrates how sustainability science benefits from combining integrated agent-based modeling (which blends methods from the social, ecological, and information sciences) and mixed-methods research (which interleaves multiple approaches ranging from qualitative field research to quantitative laboratory experiments and interpretation of remotely sensed imagery). We test assumptions of utility-maximizing behavior in household-level landscape management in south-central Indiana, linking parcel data, land cover derived from aerial photography, and findings from laboratory experiments. We examine the role of uncertainty and limited information, preferences, differential demographic attributes, and past experience and future time horizons. We also use evolutionary programming to represent bounded rationality in agriculturalist households in the southern Yucatan of Mexico. This approach captures realistic rule of thumb strategies while identifying social and environmental factors in a manner similar to econometric models. These case studies highlight the role of computational models of decision making in land-change contexts and advance our understanding of decision making in general.},

Abstract = {Plant phenology is recognized as important for ecological dynamics. There has been a recent advent of phenology and camera networks worldwide. The established PhenoCam Network has sites in the United States, including the western states. However, there is a paucity of published research from semi-arid regions. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of camera-based repeat digital imagery and use of R statistical phenopix package to quantify plant phenology and phenophases in four plant communities in the semi-arid cold desert region of the Great Basin. We developed an automated variable snow/night filter for removing ephemeral snow events, which allowed fitting of phenophases with a double logistic algorithm. We were able to detect low amplitude seasonal variation in pinyon and juniper canopies and sagebrush steppe, and characterize wet and mesic meadows in area-averaged analyses. We used individual pixel-based spatial analyses to separate sagebrush shrub canopy pixels from interspace by determining differences in phenophases of sagebrush relative to interspace. The ability to monitor plant phenology with camera-based images fills spatial and temporal gaps in remotely sensed data and field based surveys, allowing species level relationships between environmental variables and phenology to be developed on a fine time scale thus providing powerful new tools for land management.},

Title = {Reducing the cost of multi-spectral remote sensing: combining near-infrared video imagery with colour aerial photography},

Abstract = {Land managers are often confronted with management problems that could be addressed using decision support or management information systems. The use of such tools, however, depends on the availability of appropriately resolved spatial data. One source of such data is multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery. The cost of such imagery, particularly where environmental goals are most important, is often prohibitive. Even when the cost of such imagery can be met; other factors, such as cloud cover for satellite-based systems or sensor scheduling for sophisticated airborne systems, may mean that imagery is not available. This paper investigates the utility of a system that combines near-infrared imagery from a video camera with conventional medium-format aerial photography deployed in a light aircraft platform. Previously, imagery obtained from video cameras has suffered from limited spectral range and from significant image motion effects. These problems were eliminated by the use of an electronic-shutter charge-coupled device video camera with a strong IR response. The systems components and the approach to their operational deployment are described and the options, for transforming the raw imagery into survey coverage discussed. The image quality and cost is presented for a site characterisation application where the aim is the generation of normalised difference vegetation index values. It is concluded that the system has significant potential-utility for decision support and land-management applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems provide social, ecological and economic benefits and are linked through the landscape. Landscape degradation and loss of biodiversity undermine ecosystem functioning especially in vital ecosystems such as the Mara Basin in Africa. Holistically monitored and assessed landscape provide values to support conservation strategy which could enhance sustainable resource utilisation. The study relied on high resolution 10-m Sentinel 2A, Landsat 30-m and SEBAL to generate biophysical parameters for valuation in the landscapes. A household survey was used to derive forest benefits to local livelihoods. The well conserved Trans Mara forest provided high ecological benefits but few social benefits to the local community. Tea buffers have proven to be an effective conservancy strategy for the forest ecosystem. The long term carbon-based benefits in conservation areas of rural Africa is hindered by communities' high dependency on firewood and charcoal energy. The land policy on limited livestock access to the pastoralists in the conservancies should be based on the livestock carrying capacity of the lands. Further, the valuation maps can be used for land use planning where critical wildlife protection areas, movement corridors and mixed use zones of high livestock value can be identified. The holistic assessment of value of African landscape based on key functionalities and linked spatially over the landscape using remotely sensed data is indeed crucial to improve decision making and conservation strategy towards sustainable ecosystem management.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {209-217},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Studies have quantified urban forests using well established field sampling methods. Other studies have used hedonic regression with real estate prices and remotely sensed vegetation cover data in valuation models. However, remote sensing introduces unfamiliar perspectives since it changes the scale and resolution perceived by humans. Real estate prices also fluctuate and are not regularly used in urban decision-making processes. This study values an urban forest cultural ecosystem service by integrating an explanatory hedonic regression model with randomly field-measured tree, shrub, and turf data horn Foul cities across Florida, USA, during 2006-2009, and congruent parcel tract-level home attributes and appraised property values from single and multi-family units for 2008-2009. Results, on average, indicate trade-offs in that more trees with greater Leaf Area Indices (LAIs) add to property value, while biomass and tree-shrub cover have a neutral effect, and replacing tree with grass cover has lower value. On average, property value increased by \$1586 per tree and \$9348 per one-unit increase in LAI, while increasing maintained grass from 25\% to 75\% decreased home value by \$271. Our ecological approach is an alternative, applied method that can be used by decision-makers for policy and cost-benefit analyses that calculate the stream of net benefits associated with urban forests.

Title = {Unplanned Natural Experiments: The Case of Remote Sensing of Primary Production and Its Environmental Correlations in the Negev},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Studies of the correlations of environmental factors with vegetation growth using remotely sensed measurements are necessarily made against a background of biophysical and anthropogenic factors, such as local fertility, microclimate, and the effects of human land use, in addition to the factors of interest. This is an inevitable outcome of a natural (unplanned) design where the effects of the factors of interest are confounded with other, often unknown factors, possibly rendering the results inaccurate or poorly-constrained. The problems associated with a natural design would be reduced if sites could be identified in which uncontrolled variables had no impact. However, rarely are such sites known a priori. Here, a component of the net primary production (NPP) local scaling (LNS) method was used to estimate the potential NPP in the absence of confounding factors. Subsequent analyses of the effects of the selected environmental variables were carried out using the potential NPP. The method was tested in relation to NPP along the transitional ecotone from desert to semiarid conditions in the northern Negev, Israel. The effects of four environmental factors were tested: precipitation, topography, land cover, and interannual variability. While precipitation is generally the only environmental variable that is considered in drylands, the other factors were found to be significant. The results provided unambiguous evidence of the value of the method.},

Abstract = {On 24 February 2019, strong winds behind an Arctic cold front led to widespread blowing snow across the northern Great Plains including areas in eastern North/South Dakota and western Minnesota. Impacts of the event ranged from blizzard conditions in northwest Minnesota to sporadic, minor reductions in visibility across the region. This study documents the event using remotely sensed observations from platforms including geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, an S-band radar, and time-lapse images from a camera located at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Blowing snow is observed as plumes that resemble horizontal convective rolls (HCRs). Variations in near-infrared imagery are documented, and supporting observations suggest this is due to the occurrence or absence of clouds on top of the blowing snow layer. While lack of in situ observations preclude further investigation of physical differences between plumes, the utility of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) satellite to operational forecasters is discussed. Improvements to spatial, radiometric, and temporal resolution courtesy of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board GOES-I6 allows for daytime detection of blowing snow events that previously, was only possible with instruments on board polar-orbiting satellites. This has improved Impact-Based Decision Support Services (IDSS) at National Weather Service offices that deal with the hazard of blowing snow.},

Title = {Physical and Socioeconomic Driving Forces of Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes: A Case Study of Wuhan City, China},
Journal = {DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {To investigate precise nexus between land-use and land-cover changes (LUCC) and driving factors for rational urban management, we used remotely sensed images to map land use and land cover (LULC) from 1990 to 2010 for four time periods using Wuhan city, China, as a case study. Partial least squares (PLS) method was applied to analyze the relationships between LUCC and the driving factors, mainly focusing on three types of LULC, that is, arable land, built-up area, and water area. The results were as follows: (1) during the past two decades, the land-use pattern in Wuhan city showed dramatic change. Arable land is made up of the largest part of the total area. The increased built-up land came mainly from the conversion of arable land for the purpose of economic development. (2) Based on the Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), the joint effects of socioeconomic and physical factors on LUCC were dominant, though annual temperature, especially annual precipitation, proved to be less significant to LUCC. Population, tertiary industry proportion, and gross output value of agriculture were the most significant factors for three major types of LULC.

Abstract = {Globally, alien invasive plant species are considered a serious threat to native flora and fauna. In the eastern parts South Africa, the American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) has been identified as one of the major threats to social and ecological systems. Optimal management and mitigation of American bramble spread requires reliable and cost effective approaches to determine invaded spatial extents. In this study, we test the value of the recently launched, freely available Sentinel-2 (S2), as opposed to conventional Landsat 8 imagery in mapping the American bramble. Using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm, we seek to identify the optimal season for mapping the American bramble as well as the most influential bands in the classification process. Results show that Sentinel-2 out-performed Landsat 8 in all seasons, with summer providing the highest classification accuracy (77\% accuracy). The study also shows that strategically placed Sentinel-2 bands of Near Infrared, Red edge and Short Wave Infrared significantly contribute to an increase in overall bramble mapping accuracy. This study demonstrates the value of freely available multispectral imagery in mapping American bramble at large spatial extents, hence valuable for cost-effective operational use.},

Abstract = {Long-term hydrological data and remotely-sensed satellite images were used to analyze the effects of the water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) implemented in the lower Yellow River (LYR), China, between 1983 and 2013. The WSRS aimed to control channel scouring in the LYR and maintain the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Channel erosion in the LYR has primarily depended on the incoming sediment concentration at Xiaolangdi, where the concentration must be lower than approximately 9.17 x 10(-3) t m(-3) to avoid rising of the riverbed. In 1996, an artificial diversion altered the evolution of the YRD. To maintain delta equilibrium, an average sediment load of about 441 x 10(6) t year(-1) was required before 1996, after which this value decreased to 167 x 10(6) t year(-1). We provide a preliminary estimate of the incoming water and sediment conditions required at the Xiaolangdi station to guarantee both LYR channel scouring and maintenance of the YRD. Our results show that it is feasible to transport sediment originally deposited in the LYR to the river mouth to maintain the delta, which is of great significance for the future management and environmental protection of the LYR.

Title = {Convergence of fishers' knowledge with a species distribution model in a Peruvian shark fishery},
Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Limited data on the spatial, environmental, and human dimensions of small-scale fisheries hinder conservation planning, so the incorporation of fishers' local ecological knowledge may be a valuable way to fill data gaps while legitimizing management decisions. In Peru, vulnerable and poorly assessed juvenile smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) are the most commonly caught shark species in a small-scale drift gillnet fishery. We conducted semistructured interviews with 87 hammerhead fishers in three major Peruvian ports to elucidate the spatiotemporal niche of the hammerhead fishery and environmental drivers of juvenile hammerhead catch. We also built a biophysical model of hammerhead distribution that correlated remotely sensed environmental variables with a spatially explicit fishery observer dataset. Overall, we found a consensus between fishers' knowledge and species distribution modeling. Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a emerged as important environmental drivers of juvenile hammerhead catch, with both fishers' knowledge and the biophysical model identifying similar habitat preferences (similar to 20-23 degrees C and log chl-a >-1.6 mg/m(3)). Participatory mapping of fishing grounds also corresponded to the spatiotemporal patterns of predicted hammerhead distribution. This study points to the utility of combining fishers' knowledge and biophysical modeling for spatial, temporal, and/or dynamic management of these sharks in Peru and in other data-poor fisheries globally.},

Title = {Digital mapping of soil classes using spatial extrapolation with imbalanced data},
Journal = {GEODERMA REGIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Digital mapping of soil classes using the extrapolation approach is timesaving, economically cheap, and helps collecting soil data from areas with difficult sampling. However, it has not been explored widely enough for digital mapping of soil classes. This study seeks to evaluate and compare several machine learning and regression algorithms for the extrapolation of soil sub-groups. Also the issue of imbalanced number of observations was addressed and oversampling technique was applied on the minority soil class to improve the models performance. The study area is located in central north Iran with 84 and 72 soil profiles sampled in the donor and recipient areas, respectively. A set of various environmental covariates including remotely sensed data, digital elevation model derivatives and geomorphology map were used as explanatory variables for predicting soil classes. Results showed that among eleven investigated models, C5.0 decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and multinomial logistic regression (MNL) had the highest overall accuracy of 46\%, 42\% and 38\%, respectively, for the extrapolation of soil classes. Also the Kappa statistic values for these models were 0.30, 0.24 and 0.22, respectively. Oversampling of the minority soil class led to an increase in overall accuracy for some of the models with the highest ones being DT = 53\% and RF = 50\%. Also, the Kappa value for DT and RF models increased to 0.39 and 0.35, respectively. In addition, oversampling of the minority soil class led to the prevention of losing this class in the final map.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the ecosystem service value (ESV) associated with the observed land use changes is critically important for environmental assessment and sustainable urban development. This research evaluate the effects of land use on ESV in Chengdu based on remotely sensed data and GIS, assessment model, transfer and flows model, sensitivity and variable ratio function. The results show that the ESV is mainly composed of forest land and cultivated land. ESV substantially and continuously decreased by 92 x 10(8) Chinese Yuan (CNY) or about 45 \% in Chengdu during the study period and ESV from urban areas in the city center and its surroundings were much lower than those from the natural landscape in the northern and western Longmenshan mountainous region. Land use changes were the major causes of the observed transfer and flows in ESV. The flows of ESV both positive and negative were associated with observed land use changes, but overall land use changes had a negative impact on ESV. The results further indicate that the coefficient change relative to the ESV was inelastic, and the relative sensitivity index was as follows: forest land > cultivated land > water areas, but changes in water area had the largest influence and amplification effect on the ESV. This research offers important insights for use in planning fast urbanizing regions and can assist to achieve more sustainable land use and policy making.},

Title = {Probabilistic forecasting of remotely sensed cropland vegetation health and its relevance for food security},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {838},
Number = {2},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {In a world where climate change, population growth, and global diseases threaten economic access to food, policies and contingency plans can strongly benefit from reliable forecasts of agricultural vegetation health. To inform decisions, it is also crucial to quantify the forecasting uncertainty and prove its relevance for food security. Yet, in previous studies both these aspects have been largely overlooked. This paper develops a methodology to anticipate the agricultural Vegetation Health Index (VHI) while making the underlying prediction uncertainty explicit. To achieve this aim, a probabilistic machine learning framework modelling weather and climate determinants is introduced and implemented through Quantile Random Forests. In a second step, a statistical link between VHI forecasts and monthly food price variations is established. As a pilot implementation, the framework is applied to nine countries of South East Asia (SEA) with consideration of national monthly rice prices. Model benchmarks show satisfactory accuracy metrics, suggesting that the probabilistic VHI predictions can provide decision-makers with reliable information about future cropland health and its impact on food price variation weeks or even months ahead, albeit with increasing uncertainty as the forecasting horizon grows. These results ultimately allowing to anticipate the impact of weather shocks on household food expenditure contribute to advancing the multidisciplinary literature linking vegetation health, probabilistic forecasting models, and food security policy.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Estimating the economic value of irrigation water in monetary terms is a crucial water management tool to address water scarcity, shortage, and overuse problems. This study seeks to couple remote-sensing-based, biophysical water productivity with empirical economic valuation of water to estimate irrigation water's near real-time economic value and the gross return that farmers can earn from using the irrigation water. The study was done at the Koga large-scale community-managed irrigation scheme in the Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. Water productivity based on open sources remotely sensed data (WaPOR) datasets and Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) were used to analyze near real-time crop water productivity (CWP), and determine irrigation water's economic value. Results showed that the average CWP was 1.08 kg/m(3). Farmers were willing to pay 0.074 US\$/m(3), which ranged from 7.5 to 23.5\% of their gross benefit from irrigation water. The study evidenced that coupling the remote-sensing-based CWP data with an empirical analysis of farmers' willingness to pay for irrigation water can generate an agreeable estimate of the economic value of irrigation water and showed the income generated from the irrigation business. Therefore, the method and result help to plan a suitable water pricing modality, which enhances sustainable irrigation management and water productivity.},

Title = {Fitting the Stocking Rate with Pastoral Resources to Manage and Preserve Mediterranean Forestlands: A Case Study},

Abstract = {Pasture practices have affected Mediterranean forest ecosystems for millennia, and they are still quite widespread in mountainous areas. Nevertheless, in the last decades, the stability of forest ecosystems has been jeopardized due to the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral practices, so that the gradual reduction of open areas due to progressive succession processes has caused a high increase of grazing pressure by livestock and wild ungulates feeding on forest areas. This paper aims at showing a methodological approach for evaluating the effect of applying measures in order to improve the grazing value of grasslands and ecotonal patches and lower the grazing impact on native woodlands. A protected area in Sicily (Italy) is considered as a representative case study. The analysis of remotely sensed imagery and several field surveys enabled to identify and map six different land use units subject to grazing, i.e., (1) forests; (2) grasslands (pastures dominated by palatable herbs and grasses); (3) overgrazed grasslands (dominated by poisonous and/or thorny herbs and forbs, not palatable); (4) encroached pastures; (5) roadside firebreaks (dominated by palatable herbs) with no shrubs; and (6) wooded/encroached roadside firebreaks. Several data were collected through sample plots selected within each land use unit, in order to assess their pastoral value. These data have been used to define current and optimal animal stock rates aiming at addressing pasture management planning towards a sustainable use of forestland and shrubland.},

Title = {Safe Shelter: A Case for Prioritizing Housing Quality in Climate Adaptation Policy by Remotely Sensing Roof Tarps in the San Francisco Bay Area},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The number and intensity of climate-related hazards are increasing globally, but some communities are much more heavily impacted than others by the same event. One factor among many is housing quality because an intact house is a household's first line of defense against the wrath of nature. By taking the San Francisco Bay Area as a proof-of-concept, we develop a deep-learning algorithm to show that blue roof tarps, used in the area as semipermanent fixtures to reduce roof leakage, can serve as a proxy for poor-quality housing. Our cascading structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner by first identifying buildings and then classifying them as containing a blue roof tarp or not, achieving a recall of 89.6\% and a precision of 34.3\% in our study area. Our work suggests that up to 5\% of houses are of poor quality in some low-to-intermediate income communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, the percentage of poor-quality houses varies by an order of magnitude even in communities with a comparable median income or social vulnerability index, suggesting that prioritizing climate adaptation investments based on these common indicators could be ineffective. Our work emphasizes the value of a community-centric approach to improving housing quality and reducing the disproportional impacts of not only one but multiple climate hazards.},

Abstract = {Global forest loss depends on decisions made in the rural, often poor communities living beside the Earth's remaining forests. Gov-ernance problems in these forest-edge communities contribute to rapid deforestation and household vulnerability. In coordina-tion with experimental studies in 5 other countries, we evaluate a program that recruits, trains, and deploys citizens to monitor communal forestland in 60 communities in rural Liberia. The year-long intervention is designed to promote more informed and inclusive resource governance, so that that citizens' preferences (and not just leaders' interests) are reflected in forest manage-ment. In our control communities, households are uninformed and disengaged; leaders' authority is unchecked. The program both engages and mobilizes community members: households are better informed and participate more in the design and enforce-ment of rules around forest use. They also report receiving more material benefits from outside investors' activities in their com-munity forests. The chiefs who lead these communities attest to strengthened accountability. Using both on-the-ground environ-mental assessments and remotely sensed data, we find no effects on forest use or deforestation. Households do not favor more con-servation, and, thus, more inclusive management does not reduce forest use. Conservation likely requires compensating community members for foregoing forest use; citizen monitoring, we argue, could ensure that such schemes enjoy popular support and do not just benefit local elites.},

Volume = {49},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Watershed protection is one of the many goods and services provided by the world's fast disappearing tropical forests. Among the variety of watershed protection benefits, flood damage alleviation is crucial, particularly in upland watersheds. This study is a rare attempt to estimate flooding alleviation benefits, resulting from the protection of upland forests in Eastern Madagascar. A three stage model is used to examine the relationship between the economic concept of value and the bio-physical dimensions of the protected area. This approach combines techniques from remote sensing, soil and hydrologic sciences and economics. In stage one, the relationship between changes in land use practices and the extent of flooding in immediate downstream is established by using remotely sensed and hydrologic-runoff data. Stage two relates the impact of increased flooding to crop production by comparing the hydrologic data with the agronomic flood damage reports for the same time period. In stage three, a productivity analysis approach is adopted to evaluate flood damage in terms of lost producer surplus. The presence of the Mantadia National Park, in eastern Madagascar, is designed to prevent land conversions and changes in hydrologic patterns, thereby alleviating flood damage. This averted flood damage is a measure of the watershed protection benefits to society. Given that natural systems are subject to considerable stochastic shocks, sensitivity analysis is used to examine the uncertainty associated with the key random variables. The results of this analysis should help policy makers assess trade-offs between the costs and benefits of protecting tropical rainforest. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

Abstract = {To have a better understanding of the ecological factors that may contribute to moose Alces alces and vehicle collisions in northern British Columbia, we analyzed Wildlife Accident Reporting System data that were collected between 2000 and 2005 by highway maintenance contractors. We delineated 29 moose-vehicle collision hotspots and 15 control sites at which we assessed environmental and road infrastructure attributes through field surveys and remotely sensed data. A logistic regression model including both coarse-and fine-scale environmental factors suggested that hotspots were more likely to be characterized by the number of roadside mineral licks and bisection of the highway corridor through black spruce forest-sphagnum bog habitat and swamps. The absence of rivers within 1 km and less lake area within 500 m of the highway also better characterized hotspots than controls. At the fine scale, deciduous forest cover along the highway edge and the proportion of browse to nonbrowse vegetation between the road shoulder and forest edge were also related to collision sites. Based on these data, the mitigation of collision hotspots should include decommissioning roadside mineral licks where they occur and cutting roadside brush to improve driver visibility and reduce browse resprouting and attractiveness. Where new road construction or road realignments are being contemplated, we recommend considering routes with more lake area, more rivers, fewer swamps, and fewer black spruce forest-sphagnum bog habitats to help reduce collisions. We discuss the utility of installing novel warning signage in areas where collisions are recurrent.},

Title = {A Multiscalar Approach to Mapping Marginal Agricultural Land: Smallholder Agriculture in Malawi},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {108},
Number = {4},
Pages = {989-1005},
Abstract = {Marginal agricultural lands are defined here by suboptimal biophysical conditions and historically variable or low agricultural production. We characterize these areas using remotely sensed information to disentangle the biophysical and possible social factors driving marginality. Considering both the modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy problem, the heuristic we propose is generalizable across geographies and scales and provides information at multiple decision-making levels through a multiscalar interannual variability model. We present results from our study of Malawi, where the landscape is densely cultivated and smallholder farmers frequently occupy marginal lands, to illustrate the potential of a multiscalar analysis in a place where food insecurity alleviation is needed and where remote sensing can provide necessary information. Our framework for identifying marginal agricultural lands consists of (1) locating long-term agricultural land, (2) measuring interannual productivity of long-term farmed locations, and (3) assessing marginal biophysical land characteristics and the fundamental climate niche for the dominant crop (in this case maize). Productivity and marginality in Malawi are spatially organized, and an assessment of productivity at multiple scales highlights the importance of presenting both global and local spatiotemporal variability for managing agroecological variance. By disaggregating broad classes of historically marginal production and the underlying drivers of marginality, different intervention efforts can intelligently target areas most likely to receive maximum benefit. These methodologies can be applied by both policymakers and scholars to identify and target marginal agricultural areas for improved productivity and for the support of smallholder farmer livelihoods.},

Title = {Linking people, pixels, and pastures: A multi-method, interdisciplinary investigation of how rangeland management affects vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {147-162},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Studies of rangeland cover changes on the Tibetan Plateau have generally not taken pasture management into account beyond grazing pressure proxies. To address this gap we conducted a study in Qinghai Province, China that brings together results from four years of systematic vegetation sampling (2009-2012) with qualitative interview data and a time series of satellite imagery (1990-2010) to analyze the extent to which herders judged to have different levels of skill were able to manage for rangeland production over time. Our analysis demonstrated that NDVI-derived production estimates may have limited utility given their inability to distinguish between palatable and unpalatable vegetation. The analysis suggested that less skilled herders were less able to improve the productivity of their pastures over time relative to more skilled managers, but management was less significant than other environmental variables. At the same time, non -environmental factors weighed strongly in how households managed their land and livestock. The study illustrates some of the challenges of integrating social science, remotely sensed, and biophysical data, particularly in terms of the scale at which different types of data are collected and the nature of extensive pastoralism. Nevertheless linking people, pastures and pixels provides a more nuanced and complex understanding of human-environment relations on the Tibetan Plateau than reflected in current policy.},

Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 1-22. DOI: 10.1111/jawr.12008 Abstract: Airborne bathymetric Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems designed for coastal and marine surveys are increasingly sought after for high-resolution mapping of fluvial systems. To evaluate the potential utility of bathymetric LiDAR for applications of this kind, we compared detailed surveys collected using wading and sonar techniques with measurements from the United States Geological Survey's hybrid topographic/bathymetric Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL). These comparisons, based upon data collected from the Trinity and Klamath Rivers, California, and the Colorado River, Colorado, demonstrated that environmental conditions and postprocessing algorithms can influence the accuracy and utility of these surveys and must be given consideration. These factors can lead to mapping errors that can have a direct bearing on derivative analyses such as hydraulic modeling and habitat assessment. We discuss the water and substrate characteristics of the sites, compare the conventional and remotely sensed river-bed topographies, and investigate the laser waveforms reflected from submerged targets to provide an evaluation as to the suitability and accuracy of the EAARL system and associated processing algorithms for riverine mapping applications.},

Abstract = {There is growing research interest in the ethnobiology, socio-economics and management of mangrove forests. Coastal residents who use mangroves and their resources may have considerable botanical and ecological knowledgeable about these forests. A wide variety of forest products are harvested in mangroves, especially wood for fuel and construction, tannins and medicines. Although there are exceptions, mangrove forest products are typically harvested in a small-scale and selective manner, with harvesting efforts and impacts concentrated in stands that are closer to settlements and easiest to access (by land or by sea). Mangroves support diverse, local fisheries, and also provide critical nursery habitat and marine productivity which support wider commercial fisheries. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services that benefit coastal communities, including coastal land stabilization and storm protection. The overlapping of marine and terrestrial resources in mangroves creates tenure ambiguities that complicate management and may induce conflict between competing interests. Mangroves have been cut and cleared extensively to make way for brackish water aquaculture and infrastructure development. More attention is now given to managing remaining forests sustainably and to restoring those degraded from past use. Recent advances in remotely sensed, geo-spatial monitoring provide opportunities for researchers and planners to better understand and improve the management of these unique forested wetlands.

Title = {Towards an Environmental Classification of Lentic Aquatic Ecosystems in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica},

Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Pages = {600-622},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest single ice-free area in Antarctica, and of considerable scientific and conservation value as an extreme polar desert. This is recognised through the McMurdo Dry Valleys Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), where management's goals focus on protection of its unique features, while facilitating science access. Using a mix of remote sensing and existing cartography, we have identified over 6000 lakes and ponds in the ASMA. This study develops a classification of those aquatic ecosystems to provide a framework for management. It uses a limited top-down, hierarchical classification to define 13 class separations based on physical attributes that could largely be ascribed from existing databases or remotely sensed information. The first hierarchical level was based on landscape position, separating coastal kettle holes (reflecting recent glacial history), from other ``topographic{''} water bodies. The second level was based on endorheic vs exorheic drainage, the third on mid-summer ice condition (no-ice cap; ice capped; frozen to base) and the fourth on source of inflow (glacial or non-glacial). Kettles were sub-classed by mid-summer ice only. Classes were tested against a set of field observations and an expert workshop validation process considered management implications for the ASMA. This study shows how the classification assists our understanding of Dry Valley landscapes and addresses management issues faced by researchers, environmental managers and policy makers. The approach to classification, rather than the detailed classes that may be specific to the Dry Valleys, has potential for wider use in other polar landscapes.},

Abstract = {Agricultural transition represents an essential component of land use and land cover change in countries across the world, as economic and social factors pressure agriculturalists out of traditional subsistence farming into commodity production. Modernization has altered modes of income, land ownership, and livelihood in Southeast Asia drastically in recent years. The Binh Thuan Province of southern Vietnam experienced a particularly radical transformation with the introduction of dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus) cultivation, which has been profoundly encouraged by outside markets in China, Australia, Japan, and the United States. Dragon fruit plantation dynamics and recent expansion are captured via remotely sensed nighttime lights (NTL) data acquired by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible/Infrared Imager/ Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), revealing a seasonal signal important for differentiating various land uses on the ground. We employed the Breaks for Additive and Seasonal Trend (BFAST) algorithm to reduce and summarize seasonal trends in NTL data and then used the BFAST output combined with a Normalized Difference Lights Index (NDLI) value for each year in the period of 2012 through 2018 in a decision tree classifier to differentiate dragon fruit land use from city lights across the province. The final output was contextualized with a series of semistructured interviews to examine and characterize a changing agricultural landscape associated with dragon fruit cultivation. Dragon fruit plantation in southern Vietnam follows the land system transition pathways of many other agricultural contexts but presents unique physical and social outcomes for further investigation.},

Pages = {471-484},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In China, sonic people believe that urban land has a large potential for absorbing more of the urban population. while others think that urban population density is very high, and has already caused many urban problems. The population density of 135 major cities is studied by using the city population data (Shiren kou) front the Fifth Census of China in 2000. The data included the floating population who lived in cities for more than 6 months/year, so it could more closely reflect the real size of the urban population. Land-use data were obtained from a digital map interpreted front remotely sensed data collected in 2000. The results show that urban population density was fairly high in China and the average urban land per capita of these cities was only about 76 m(2) in 2000, but that the corresponding value was 106 m(2) if it was calculated with the non-agricultural population. Moreover, urban population density varied greatly between cities: from 4 x 10(3) to 22 x 10(3)/km(2). Regression results show the differences in urban population density were strongly related to six independent variables, including wage per capita, city size and shape index of urban land, etc. The policies derived from the results deserve more attention in the new land-use planning with the target year of 2020 in China.

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Latin America harbors a large potential for carbon sequestration and biomass production. This paper deals with the estimation of carbon supply curves for afforestation and reforestation and its implicit carbon sequestration in wood products. The methodology presented aims at determining sequestration costs for individual geographical entities, based on unit-specific land use and ecosystem information, and economic data. This approach allows us to supplement local statistics that are typically scarce and unreliable in developing countries, with independent remotely sensed data in order to have a consistent method that can be applied over a large region. The results are mapped, which allows in-depth appraisal of results in an interactive mode and quick identification of least-cost carbon sequestration sites. The model is dynamic to support decision making at various stages in the Kyoto process. After model calibration and sensitivity analysis, we conducted scenario analysis. For a carbon price scenario of \$20/tC, we find that the cumulative carbon sequestration by 2012 and 2020 is about 125 MtC and 337 MtC, respectively. The net benefit by 2020 could amount up to US\$ 2.3 billion using less than 4\% of the area suitable for afforestation and reforestation in the next 20 years. Our long-term estimates of the cumulative sequestration potential for 100 years imply that tree planting could compensate for more than 7 years of current CO2 emissions of the region's energy sector at low costs.

Abstract = {We present a knowledge-based raster mapping (KBRM) approach to assessing wetlands based on the wetland-environment model, which is built by local experts using their knowledge and experience. The Delphi method and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were employed to improve the consistency and the quality of the elicited expert knowledge. The environmental factors selected by local experts include edge density, aquatic connectivity, water-body density, road density, urban area density, vegetation screening index, and slope gradient. The experts assigned weights to those environmental factors and created optimality function curves to characterize the relationships between individual factors and the wetland condition. At each raster cell, an optimality value for each environmental factor was calculated based on the local value of that factor, and an overall optimality score was then calculated as the weighted average of the optimality values for individual factors. As a case study, we implemented this approach in assessing the wetlands in Suzhou, China. While our approach does not directly require field information, its result is comparable with the result of the rapid field method that is directly based on field data. In addition, our approach is advantageous in representing interior details of a wetland.},

Abstract = {Quantifying factors that influence marine predator distributions is essential to understanding the current and future change in marine biodiversity. Here, we test whether marine predator distribution relates to prey, or is better predicted by other specific habitat features. We examine the correlation between spatial distribution of three seabird species and their prey, as well as environmental proxies (oceanographic characteristics) in the Gulf of Cadiz, NE Atlantic. We modeled the at-sea distribution of Cory's shearwater, Balearic shearwater and Northern gannet, based on: (i) pelagic fish abundance according to acoustic surveys, and (ii) a forecast-model of remotely sensed environmental variables (productivity, sea surface temperature, and salinity). In general, seabird distributions were better predicted by abundance of fish than by environmental variables at the habitat scale. We obtained consistent correlations between seabird presence and the abundance of medium-sized (10-20 cm) sardines, anchovies and Mediterranean horse mackerel, providing information on their preferred prey. Additionally, oceanographic productivity variables moderately contributed to seabird distribution models, with better predictive value for the critically endangered Balearic shearwater and Northern gannet in the summer, whilst the model for Cory's shearwater's produced poorer predictions. Predator-prey combined studies may represent essential tools for an efficient ecosystem-based management of marine environments.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The effectiveness of parks as management regimes is hotly contested. Much of the current discussion centered around comparisons of management regimes can be traced to a dearth of cross-site quantitative evaluations, Remote sensing provides a particularly effective tool for this purpose, yet analysis of remotely sensed data requires fieldwork to interpret human activities and the socioeconomic and political contexts that relate to land cover change. This paper examines the effect of establishment of the Celaque National Park, Honduras, and the Royal Chitwan National Park buffer zone, Nepal, on limiting deforestation. In Celaque, the park itself has been largely successful in maintaining forest cover. However, recent changes in land use patterns have led to increasing pressure on the park boundaries, exacerbated by the lack of involvement of local residents. In the Royal Chitwan National Park, in contrast, participatory approaches towards co-management have been implemented over the past decade in the park buffer zone. With significant incomes derived from ecotourism, complete protection of the buffer zone forest has been adopted, leading to significant regrowth of tree cover. However, local decision-making power is limited, and buffer zone management has largely proven successful due to the investment and support provided by international donor agencies. These two case studies demonstrate the utility of remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems analysis in providing a spatiotemporal perspective for assessing management policies. They also demonstrate the importance of fieldwork to provide a nuanced understanding of the socioeconomic and institutional conditions affecting the outcomes of forest management regimes.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {For conservation decision making, species' geographic distributions are mapped using various approaches. Some such efforts have downscaled versions of coarse-resolution extent-of-occurrence maps to fine resolutions for conservation planning. We examined the quality of the extent-of-occurrence maps as range summaries and the utility of refining those maps into fine-resolution distributional hypotheses. Extent-of-occurrence maps tend to be overly simple, omit many known and well-documented populations, and likely frequently include many areas not holding populations. Refinement steps involve typological assumptions about habitat preferences and elevational ranges of species, which can introduce substantial error in estimates of species' true areas of distribution. However, no model-evaluation steps are taken to assess the predictive ability of these models, so model inaccuracies are not noticed. Whereas range summaries derived by these methods may be useful in coarse-grained, global-extent studies, their continued use in on-the-ground conservation applications at fine spatial resolutions is not advisable in light of reliance on assumptions, lack of real spatial resolution, and lack of testing. In contrast, data-driven techniques that integrate primary data on biodiversity occurrence with remotely sensed data that summarize environmental dimensions (i.e., ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling) offer data-driven solutions based on a minimum of assumptions that can be evaluated and validated quantitatively to offer a well-founded, widely accepted method for summarizing species' distributional patterns for conservation applications.},

Journal = {COGENT FOOD \& AGRICULTURE},

Abstract = {Central Rift Valley (CRV) Ethiopia is an important region in terms of its vast ecosystem services (ES)and enriched biodiversity. However, its ES and biodiversity are under terrific pressure from hurried population growth, unsustainable developmental activities, unplanned urbanization, aggressive agricultural expansion, climate change, and the associated changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This study was aimed at analyze LULC changes in the Ethiopia CRV areas from 1985 to 2015 through Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. Satellite images were accessed, pre-processed and classified. Field observations, discussion with dwellers (elders) were also employed to validate results from remotely sensed data. Major LULC types were detected and change analysis was executed. Consequently, nine LULC changes were successfully evaluated. The classification result revealed that in 1985 the area was covered by 44.34\% with small-scale farming followed by mixed cultivated/acacia (21.89\%), open woodland (11.96\%), and water bodies (9.77\%), respectively. Though the area measure varied among land use classes, the trend of share occupied by the LULC types in the study area remained the same in 1995 and 2015. In this research increase in small and large-scale farming, settlements and mixed cultivation/acacia while a decrease in water bodies, forest, and open woodlands is noted. Accordingly, the overall accuracy of this study was 84.46, 86.86 and 88.86 with kapa value of 0.82, 0.84 and 0.87, respectively. Lastly, the DPSIR framework analysis was done and integrated land use and policy reform are suggested as a response for sustainable land use planning and management.},

Abstract = {Remotely sensed data and imagery have revolutionized the way we understand archaeological sites and landscapes. LiDAR / airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been used to capture the often subtle topographic remnants of previously undiscovered sites even in intensely studied landscapes, and is rapidly becoming a key technology in survey projects with large extents and/or difficult terrain. This paper examines the practical application of this technology to archaeological heritage management, with special attention given to how ALS can support the World Heritage List nomination process and management of WHS archaeological sites and landscapes. It presents a number of examples from published ALS studies alongside case studies from projects undertaken by the authors at Cultural Site Research and Management and the Cultural Site Research and Management Foundation, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The paper opens with a review of how ALS has been used at established World Heritage Sites, focusing on the Archaeological Ensemble of the Bend in the Boyne, Ireland, and the Angkor Archaeological Site in Cambodia. ALS applications for site prospection and demarcation, and viewshed analysis is explored in this section. Following this, we explore how ALS has been used to support two recent applications: the successfully nominated Monumental Earthworks at Poverty Point, USA and the recently nominated Orheiul Vechi Archaeological Landscape in Moldova. We propose that the detail offered by ALS data greatly strengthens nomination dossiers by emphasizing the outstanding universal value of sites, highlighting significant features and providing greater context to wider landscapes, and is particularly efficacious in delineating site boundaries for legal protection and long-term management. Finally, we conclude with a look at some of the practical considerations involved in the use of ALS, including access and training.},

Abstract = {The purpleback flying squid (Ommastrephidae: Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) is an important species at higher trophic levels of the regional marine ecosystem in the South China Sea (SCS), where it is considered to show the potential for fishery development. Accordingly, under increasing climatic and environmental changes, understanding the nature and importance of various factors that determine the spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of S. oualaniensis in the SCS is of great scientific and socio-economic interest. Using generalized additive model (GAM) methods, we analyzed the relationship between available environmental factors and catch per unit effort (CPUE) data of S. oualaniensis. The body size of S. oualaniensis in the SCS was relatively small (<19.4 cm), with a shorter lifespan than individuals in other seas. The biological characteristics indicate that S. oualaniensis in the SCS showed a positive allometric growth, and could be suitably described by the logistic growth equation. In our study, the sea areas with higher CPUE were mainly distributed at 10 degrees-11 degrees N, with a 27-28 degrees C sea surface temperature (SST) range, a sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) of -0.05-0.05 m, and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) higher than 0.18 mu g/L. The SST was the most important factor in the GAM analysis and the best fitting GAM model explained 67.9\% of the variance. Understanding the biological characteristics and habitat status of S. oualaniensis in the SCS will benefit the management of this resource.},

Abstract = {Agriculture requires the dedication of many natural resources, including land, water, and energy. The quality and quantity of these natural resources has degraded over the years due to various economic problems associated with increased cost of inputs, decreased farm incomes, ever declining land, labour, energy resources and also ecological problems such as soil, water pollution and soil erosion, putting the viability of future agricultural operations at risk. The remedy to this is to adopt sustainable agriculture which supports careful management and cultivation of crops involving less use of fertilizer, pesticides, calculated use of precious natural resources like energy, water through controlled irrigation and fertigation practices with the help of green sensor technology and electronic control systems. The paper provides efficient automated farm monitoring and irrigation techniques which incorporate wide range of sensors to remotely sense and monitor various parameters of the soil like temperature, moisture, fertility and regulate the supply of water and fertilizer to the land based on the requirement. An algorithm formulated with the threshold values of sensor outputs is used to code the microcontroller which performs the required actions by employing relays until the strayed-out parameter has been brought back to its optimum level. The cloud based user friendly interface facilitates real-time data logging of environmental parameters while also supporting analysis of past statistics for future growth by means of a web-based customizable application. Furthermore, the project aims to optimize the use of land and labour, conserve water, increase crop yield, avoid wastage of energy and provide maximum automation and benefit the society by adopting smart environment friendly technology to implement newer and sustainable ways of agriculture.},

Abstract = {Remotely sensed imagery is used as a tool to aid decision makers and scientists in a variety of fields. A recent world event in which satellite imagery was extensively relied on by a variety of stakeholders was the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article we aim to give an overview of the types of information offered through remote sensing (RS) to help address different issues related to the pandemic. We also discuss about the stakeholders that benefited from the data, and the value added by its availability. The content is presented under four sub-sections; namely (1) the use of RS in real-time decision-making and strategic planning during the pandemic; how RS revealed the (2) environmental changes and (3) social and economic impacts caused by the pandemic. And (4) how RS informed our understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for the pandemic. High resolution optical imagery offered updated on-the-ground data for e. g., humanitarian aid organizations, and informed operational decision making of shipping companies. Change in the intensity of air and water pollution after reduced anthropogenic activities around the world were captured by remote sensing - supplying concrete evidence that can help inform improved environmental policy. Several economic indicators were measured from satellite imagery, showing the spatiotemporal component of economic impacts caused by the global pandemic. Finally, satellite based meteorological data supported epidemiological studies of environmental disease determinants. The varied use of remote sensing during the COVID-19 pandemic affirms the value of this technology to society, especially in times of large-scale disasters.},

Abstract = {Precipitation is a vital process in the water cycle. Accurate estimation of the precipitation rate underpins the success of hydrological simulations, flood predictions, and water resource management. Satellite infrared (IR) data, with high temporal resolution and wide coverages, have been commonly used in precipitation inversion. However, exist-ing IR-based precipitation retrieval algorithms suffer from various problems such as overestimation in dry regions, poor performance in extreme rainfall events, and reliance on an empirical cloud-top brightness-rain rate relationship. To re-solve these problems, we construct a deep learning model using a spherical convolutional neural network to properly represent Earth's spherical surface. With data input directly from IR bands 3, 4, and 6 of the operational Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), our new model of Precipitation Estimation based on IR data with Spheri-cal Convolutional Neural Network (PEISCNN) was first trained and tested with a 3-month-long dataset, and then validated in a 2-yr period. Compared to the commonly used IR-based precipitation product PERSIANN-CCS (Precipi-tation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System), PEISCNN showed significant improvement in the metrics of POD, CSI, RMSE, and CC, especially in the dry region and for extreme rainfall events. Decomposed with the four-component error decomposition (4CED) method, the overesti-mation of PEISCNN was averaged 47.66\% lower than the CCS at the hourly scale. The PEISCNN model may provide a promising way to produce an improved IR-based precipitation product to benefit a wide range of hydrological applications.},

Title = {The seasonal imperative: Environmental drivers of livestock mobility in East Darfur, Sudan},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {At their furthest extent, the livestock migrations examined in this paper traverse a distance of 400 km or more along a north-south transect, crossing up to half a dozen distinct ecological zones and, upon occasion, the international border between Sudan and South Sudan. Official Sudanese recognition of the value of migratory livestock production has led in recent years to policy and legal changes that support pastoral mobility, but there remains a gap in the scientific evidence that can be called upon to inform this emerging awareness. This paper uses remotely sensed livestock tracking data to document pastoral behaviour in relation to some of the biophysical factors that are important for livestock survival and production. This research supports several policy relevant conclusions: 1. In East Darfur, long-distance migratory livestock production is remarkably resilient to rainfall fluctuations, including drought and flooding, because movement cycles are already designed to accommodate this kind of variability. 2. Mobile livestock producers are exposed to human-generated disruption and increasing pressures on their mobility from expanding farms, localized conflict and insecurity, and a new international border. 3. Pastoralists need sympathetic governance to mediate their interactions with other forms of land use, which is unlikely to happen unless authorities appreciate the technical sophistication and economic advantages of migratory systems. 4. Migratory production in East Darfur uses locally available resources which leaves livestock owners and government free to expend cash reserves on other kinds of inputs, investments or activities.},

Title = {Scenario modeling for spatial-temporal change detection of carbon storage and sequestration in a forested landscape in Northern Iran},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {The present study was conducted, based on scenario modeling approach, in the Do-hezar and Se-hezar forested landscape in the Mazandaran Province in Northern Iran in order to detect spatial-temporal changes of carbon storage and sequestration in four different carbon pools, i.e., aboveground and belowground biomasses, dead organic matter, and organic soils. For this purpose, firstly, the changing trend of land use/land cover (LULC) was detected by analyzing and comparing remotely sensed data of the landscape during the period of 1984-2016. Then, the impacts of future LULC changes on carbon storage and sequestration were predicted and valued using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model under two future plausible scenarios of business as usual (BAU) and balanced development (BD). According to the results of BAU scenario, continuation of the current trend will lead to a significant reduction in the carbon sequestration and a huge amount of social cost due to the loss of carbon stored in the landscape and its release to the atmosphere. The BD scenario which refers to the principled and under control development of human settlements simultaneously with forest conservational and restoration activities, could potentially reverse the downtrend of carbon sequestration service and avoid future socioeconomic costs, hence add to the economic value of the forest landscape in terms of providing a better sink for carbon storage. The results of this research can facilitate the quantitative and accurate assessment of carbon storage and sequestration relying on more precise biophysical and economic data as well as provide insight for effective land-use planning.},

Abstract = {Cities around the world are experiencing the effects of climate change via increasing extreme heat wors-ened by urbanization. Within cities, there are disparities in extreme heat exposure that are apparent in various surface and remotely sensed observations, as well as in the health impacts. There are, however, large data gaps in our ability to quantify the heat experienced by people in their daily lives across urban areas. In this paper, we use hyperlocal observations to mea-sure heat around Miami-Dade County, Florida. Temperature and humidity measurements were collected at sites through-out the county between 2018 and 2021 with low-cost sensors. By comparing these hyperlocal observations with a National Weather Service (NWS) site at the Miami International Airport (MIA), we show that maximum temperatures are on aver-age 6 degrees F (3.3 degrees C) higher and maximum heat index values are 11F (6.1 degrees C) higher at sites in the county than at MIA. These measurements show that many sites frequently record a heat index above the local threshold value for heat advisory. This is in contrast with the fact that few forecast advisories are issued, and there are correspondingly few exceedances of the threshold at MIA. We use these results to motivate a discussion about the issues of this particular threshold for Miami- Dade County. We highlight the need for data that are closer to residents' lived experience to assess the impacts of heat and help inform local and regional decision-making, particularly where heat exposure may be underappreciated as a potential public health hazard.},

Abstract = {Socio-ecological benefits provided by floods and use of flood-prone land can be essential, particularly where livelihoods are tied to natural hydrologic cycles, for instance in many developing countries. We use a physically based rainfall-runoff model and remotely sensed data to characterize seasonal inundation in Candaba, Philippines. Through community surveys and focus groups, we identify strategies that allow residents to cope with floods and benefit from the use of flood-prone lands. We apply direct market pricing methods to assess seasonal land use benefits in flood-prone and dry villages. While primary benefits are associated with rice cultivation, we find that flood-prone communities adapt their livelihoods to seasonal inundation, for instance, by using land alternately for agriculture and wild catch fisheries during dry and wet seasons, respectively. Livelihood benefits in flood-prone villages (US \$ 2266/ha) were similar to benefits in non-flooded villages (US \$ 2746/ha). In flood-prone villages, mean benefits from wild fish capture (US \$ 190/ha) are marginal to mean benefits from farming during the wet season (US \$ 1200/ha). However, the adaptive practice of wet season fisheries and dry season agriculture in flood-prone lands yields annual benefits (US \$ 1754/ha) that are significant within the context of the local economy. We conclude that discounting benefits from direct flood-prone land use may misrepresent the socio-economic role of floodplains. Supporting benefits from floodplain use while targeting coping capacities may enhance resilience to seasonal flooding, livelihoods and ecosystem function linked to natural hydrologic processes.},

Abstract = {Mui Ca Mau at the southern tip of Vietnam supports a large area of mangroves and has a high value for biodiversity and scenic beauty. This area is affected by erosion along the East Sea and accretion along the Gulf of Thailand, leading to the loss of huge stretches of mangroves along the East Sea and, in some cases, loss of environmental and ecosystem services provided by mangroves. In this study, we used remotely sensed aerial (1953), Landsat (1979, 1988 and 2000) and SPOT (1992, 1995, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011) images and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to quantify the rate of mangrove shoreline change for a 58 yr period. There were 1129 transects sampled at 100 m intervals along the mangrove shoreline and two statistical methods, namely end point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR), were used to calculate the rate of change of mangrove shorelines and distance from 1953 to 2011. The study confirms that erosion and accretion, respectively, are significant at the East Sea and Gulf of Thailand sides of Mui Ca Mau. The East Sea side had a mean erosion LRR of 33.24 m yr(-1). The accretion trend at the Gulf of Thailand side had an average rate of 40.65 m yr(-1). The results are important in predicting changes of coastal ecosystem boundaries and enable advanced planning for specific sections of coastline, to minimize or neutralize losses, to inform provincial rehabilitation efforts and reduce threats to coastal development and human safety.},

Title = {Multi-Criteria Hydro-Economic Decision Tool for Rejuvenating Community Irrigation Tanks in Rural India},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rising water scarcity in agriculture has been a major concern worldwide. As resource managers seek to address this issue, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has become a widely accepted sustainability paradigm. The purpose of this study is to evaluate restoration alternatives of irrigation tanks by applying multi-criteria and probabilistic benefit-cost analysis for a rural watershed in India. We incorporate the principles of local-IWRM, namely, hydrological balance, efficiency, equity, stakeholders' involvement, and uncertainty. We use the mixed-method approach of data collection, including remotely sensed hydro-ecological data, walk-through field observations, focus groups, and household surveys. The study region produces a large percent of runoff water (i.e., about 67\% of the total precipitation) which can be partially captured to sustain irrigation tanks. The majority of the tanks in the study area do possess moderate to high irrigation potential yet remain in poor conditions. A proposed lift irrigation scheme with a 75\% or more increase in water availability could return from (sic) 1.23 to (sic) 1.73 on every Indian rupee ((sic)) invested, in addition to other socio-ecological benefits. The increase in water availability could lead to future crop area expansion, which comes with a high price tag. Therefore, using additional water on the existing crop area can be just as economically viable as water-induced crop expansion. A coordinated effort on the part of local agencies and water users is necessary for efficient and equitable use of incremental water that comes from any restoration efforts in the study area or elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Land cover change monitoring in rapidly urbanizing environments based on spaceborne remotely sensed data and measurable indicators is essential for quantifying and evaluating the spatial patterns of urban landscape change dynamics and for sustainable urban ecosystems management. The objectives of the study are to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of urbanization patterns of Kigali, Rwanda over the last three decades (from 1984 to 2016) using multi-temporal Landsat data and to assess the associated environmental impact using landscape metrics and ecosystem services. Visible and infrared bands of Landsat images were combined with derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) variance texture and digital elevation model (DEM) data for pixel-based classification using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Seven land cover classes were derived with an overall accuracy exceeding 87\% with Kappa coefficients around 0.8. As most prominent changes, cropland was reduced considerably in favour of built-up areas that increased from 2.13 km(2) to 100.17 km(2) between 1984 and 2016. During those 32 years, landscape fragmentation could be observed, especially for forest and cropland. The landscape configuration indices demonstrate that in general the land cover pattern remained stable for cropland, but that it was highly changed for built-up areas. Ecosystem services considered include regulating, provisioning and support services. Estimated changes in ecosystem services amount to a loss of 69 million US dollars (USD) as a result of cropland degradation in favour of urban areas and in a gain of 52.5 million USD within urban areas. Multi-temporal remote sensing is found as a cost-effective method for analysis and quantification of urbanization and its effects using landscape metrics and ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Sustainable development is by now generally accepted as the paramount objective of environmental policy. Environmental applications of Earth observation, on the other hand, have been successfully demonstrated over a wide range of monitoring activities, mostly with the aim of describing the spatial distribution and time course of geophysical parameters and land surface structures. With landuse structures being of major influence on the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems, and being also a highly suitable object of Earth observation, it is still an open question, however, in which way Earth observation data can be processed and integrated to provide an approximate indicator of sustainability. Based on an ecological sustainability model developed by Ripl and his co-workers at Berlin Technical University, this question was investigated in the framework of the joint project ``Development of a Land-Water-Management Concept to Decrease Matter Losses to Open Waters{''} (Stor project), which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology. Present results may be summarized as follows: 1. Apart from hydrological point measurements, there are several spatial parameters which are of indicative value as to sustainability, especially the spatio-temporal distribution of biomass, surface temperature, and precipitation. 2. To provide the spatial information basis for enhanced efficiency of immediate measures such as reforestation, agricultural extension etc., a global information system (GIS) concept was developed and demonstrated which is based on a landuse/vegetation classification derived from Landsat TM data, a digital evaluation mode (DEM) and a relief dependent water distribution model (WDM). Further implications such as the organisation of information systems which are to serve sustainability strategies are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assimilation of precipitation Estimates from the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG, early Run) in the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA)},

Abstract = {Study region: The study area covers the whole Canada at 10-km grid. Analysis was further done at the regional scale by dividing the study area into four climatic zones: Atlantic, Central, Prairie, and West Coast. Study focus: The Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) platform produces 6 h and 24 h precipitation accumulations on a 10-km grid over Canada by combining gauge observations with a background field provided by the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) numerical weather prediction model. In this study, precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission are included as an additional data source and are compared with CaPA benchmark estimates obtained without the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG Early Run, version 03 (V03)). The data used are for the summer of 2014 and we specifically considered the 6 h accumulations. The frequency bias indicator (FBI) and the equitable threat score (ETS) are used as performance criteria. Results were analyzed at four climatic regions. New hydrological insights for the region: Results show that IMERG improves the ETS and FBI for all regions, with the Central and Prairie regions showing the most improvements over the benchmark. In these two regions, statistically significant improvements in ETS are obtained for all precipitation thresholds considered. In order to assess the value of IMERG in more remote areas that are nonetheless important for water resources management in Canada, a fifth zone that has a lower gauge density was considered. In this region, ETS was significantly improved for precipitation thresholds up to 10-mm/6-h. We believe that combining satellite information with other remotely sensed product such as radar will provide a significant increase in skill, especially for mountainous regions where there can be beam blockages that can affect the quality of radar data.},

Title = {High spectral and spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery for quantifying Russian wheat aphid infestation in wheat using the constrained energy minimization classifier},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {The effects of insect infestation in agricultural crops are of major ecological and economic interest because of reduced yield, increased cost of pest control and increased risk of environmental contamination from insecticide application. The Russian wheat aphid (RWA, Diuraphis noxia) is an insect pest that causes damage to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We proposed that concentrated RWA feeding areas, referred to as ``hotspots,{''} could be identified and isolated from uninfested areas within a field for site specific aphid management using remotely sensed data. Our objectives were to ( 1) investigate the reflectance characteristics of infested and uninfested wheat by RWA and (2) evaluate utility of airborne hyperspectral imagery with 1-m spatial resolution for detecting, quantifying, and mapping RWA infested areas in commercial winter wheat fields using the constrained energy minimization classifier. Percent surface reflectance from uninfested wheat was lower in the visible and higher in the near infrared portions of the spectrum when compared with RWA-infested wheat. The overall classification accuracies of > 89\% for damage detection were achieved. These results indicate that hyperspectral imagery can be effectively used for accurate detection and quantification of RWA infestation in wheat for site-specific aphid management. (C) The Authors.

Title = {Spatiotemporal dynamic decoupling states of eco-environmental quality and land-use carbon emissions: A case study of Qingdao City, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Spatiotemporal dynamic association between eco-environmental quality and land-use carbon emissions (LCE) is an indispensable part of regional and city planning and land management and a necessary condition for main-taining sustainable development. With the increasing awareness of the importance of sustainable development, quantifying the relationship between eco-environmental quality and LCE needs to be improved. Based on raster datasets of carbon emissions from fossil fuels, remotely sensed environmental variables, and land-use and land -cover change, this study aimed to combine an improved model of LCE, remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), and decoupling theory along with the help of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and geographical information system platforms to explore the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of the eco-environmental quality and LCE over Qingdao City in the coastal economic belt of China for 2005-2019. There are three significant findings in this study. First, during 2005-2019, RSEI in the study area showed an overall upward trend (0.4365 in 2005 and 0.5378 in 2019), with a significant difference in the spatial distribution. Second, during 2005-2019, the total LCE value showed an increasing trend (4.028 million tonnes (Mt) in 2005 and 7.929 Mt. in 2019), with the study area acting as a carbon source. Third, the study area exhibited the four decoupling states of mainly weak decoupling (WD), expansive negative decoupling (END), strong decoupling (SD), and strong negative decoupling (SND). Finally, space management policies should be formulated based on different spatiotemporal character-istics and decoupling states to achieve carbon emission reductions and high-quality development.},

Title = {Vegetation burning for game management in the UK uplands is increasing and overlaps spatially with soil carbon and protected areas},

Abstract = {Burning for habitat management is globally widespread. Burning over carbon-rich soils is a global environmental concern due to the potential contribution to climate change. In the UK upland heath and blanket bog, so-called `moorland', often overlies carbon-rich soils, and has internationally important conservation value, but is burned as management for gamebird shooting and to a lesser extent for livestock grazing. There is little detailed information on the spatial extent or temporal trends in burning across the UK. This hinders formulation of policies for sustainable management, given that the practice is potentially detrimental for soil carbon storage, water quality and habitat condition. Using remotely sensed data, we mapped burning for gamebird management across c45 000 km(2) of the UK. Burning occurred across 8551 1-km squares, a third of the burned squares in Scotland and England were on peat >= 0.5 m in depth, and the proportion of moorland burned within squares peaked at peat depths of 1-2 m. Burning was detected within 55\% of Special Areas of Conservation and 63\% of Special Protection Areas that were assessed, and the proportion of moorland burned was significantly higher inside sites than on comparable squares outside protected areas. The annual numbers Of burns increased from 2001 to 2011 irrespective of peat depth. The spatial overlap of burning with peat and protected areas and the increasing number of burns require urgent attention, for the development of policies for sustainable management and reversal of damage to ecosystem services in the UK uplands.

Title = {Spatial prediction and mapping of soil pH across a tropical afro-montane landscape},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Soil pH is an indispensable part of the soil bionetwork, but so vulnerable to the dynamics of land-use change. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of soil pH is thus important for sustainable land use planning and management. In this study, we developed an approach based on geographically weighted regression-kriging (GWRK) to predict the continuous variation of soil pH up to 15 cm depth. The approach is compared to multiple linear regression-kriging (MLRK) using a total of 220 soil observations and 28 candidate auxiliary data, including climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed data. Results revealed that organic matter, sand, silt, temperature, and Landsat 8 operational land imager band 7 can explain the spatial variability of soil pH. GWR-based (local) models remarkably improved the prediction accuracy of soil pH compared to the MLR-based (global) models considering the root mean square error (i.e., 0.33 vs. 0.15; 0.37 vs. 0.17, respectively) and the coefficient of multiple determination (R-2) (i.e., 0.59 vs. 0.74; 0.43 vs. 0.55, respectively). In conclusion, the use of GWR-based models revealed that the correlations between soil pH and environmental covariates were not stationary in space. Forested areas tended to be very strongly to moderately acidic, while croplands were slightly acidic to neutral. The GWR-based models demonstrated their utility in improving predictive soil mapping. These findings will support spatially-targeted soil pH management for improved food security and ecosystem health.},

Abstract = {The 2014-2016 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) caused a prolonged marine heatwave that led to widespread coral bleaching and mortality across the Indo-pacific coral reefs. Prediction of coral bleaching and assessment of bleaching impact on corals is vital for reef ecosystem functioning, services and management. Wherein, advanced satellite remote sensing approach to determine and quantify the thermal stress on corals can assist as an alternative and convenient tool for reef monitoring programs. The present study examines the impact of consecutive coral bleaching episodes on shallow-water marginalized patch reef ecosystems on the Eastern Arabian Sea. Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch's (NOAA-CRW) platform, known as CoralTemp, were used to analyze the thermal stress on the coral reefs. Coral bleaching indices like Bleaching Threshold (BT), Positive Anomaly (PA), and Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) were calculated. Ground-truthing revealed that detected thermal stress from satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data over this region well corroborate with the mass coral bleaching events, and found reliable for detecting coral bleaching episodes in the marginalized turbid coral habitats. This study signifies the potential benefit of incorporating remote sensed SST data in coral bleaching monitoring program, which may guide to undertake targeted coral surveys and aid in decision-making and conservation of the vulnerable coral reef ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services (ESs) simply refer to those services conferred by Mother Nature for the survival of her offspring living within. But the provision of ESs is continuously affected by human activity and related changes like transformations in land use and land cover. The present study has been initiated to evaluate the pattern of landscape transformation and its impact on ecosystem service, along with estimating the per capita availability of ESs based on remotely sensed data in the Dhanbad district, Jharkhand, India. The result shows that the total ecosystem service value (ESV) loss of the district was \$2251959.76 during 1990-2020. The highest loss of ESV was recorded due to the conservation of agricultural land to built-up area (\$15884988.50) and vegetation cover on agricultural land (\$14451545.01), while the increased vegetation cover on other types of land helped the district to gain back some balance over the loss. But in a smaller scale study, 5 out of the 8 spatial units are facing negative change in ESV, and unfortunately, they are altogether inhabited by more than 85\% of the district's total population. That means the loss of ESV is greater where it needs to be more as per population. Moreover, the per capita ESs in the district decreased by 68.48\%, while among the spatial units in Dhanbad it decreased the most (89.60\%), which is a serious cause for worry in the future. Therefore, this study can contribute to the process of decision-making, proposing ecological conservation and sustainable development plans for the region.},

Abstract = {Farmers throughout the world are constantly searching for ways to maximize their returns. Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) may provide technologies needed for farmers to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of precision fanning. However, most farmers do not have the skills to utilize these technologies effectively. Through a learning community approach led by the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium (UMAC), information was shared among scientists, agricultural producers, and data providers. Farmers and ranchers received value-added information derived from AVHRR, MODIS, ETM+, IKONOS, Digit Inc's DALSA camera system and Positive Systems' ADAR 5500 digital aerial camera, over four growing seasons. Emphasis has been placed on reducing the time between data acquisition and delivery of value-added products to farmers, developing practical uses for the data and providing basic training so that the end users could understand how to interpret the information. Farmers and ranchers in rural areas were connected via wide-bandwidth satellite link to a central distribution center at the University of North Dakota. The farmers participated actively in evaluating the usefulness of inputs derived from remotely sensed data, sometimes even by conducting experiments on fertilizer and fungicide applications and assessing the economic benefits. Resulting applications included management zone delineation, verifying the effectiveness of variable-rate fertilizer applications, verifying the effectiveness of fungicide applications, quantifying the loss due to accidental spray drift damage, selecting acres within sugar beet fields under the Payment in Kind program, and monitoring physical damage due to insect, inundation, wind and bail. Several other in-field, early season management practices were also reviewed using high-resolution images. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The United States is embarking on the implementation of an Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), as part of a broader global environmental observation effort, in order to increase the understanding of the ocean environment to derive societal benefits. These benefits will be achieved by making timely, accurate observations of the environment leading to quality predictions and forecasts of the environment and the consequences on the public. To this end, IOOS will consist of an observing subsystem, a modeling and analysis subsystem, and a data management and communications subsystem that ties it all together. The observing subsystem will provide sustained in situ and remotely sensed measurements of the coastal and global ocean. Initially, IOOS will derive observations from existing operational and pre-operational programs and subsequently incorporate observations from novel programs as they attain operational status. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) program, and its follow-on, GOES-P, will play a key role in IOOS. The IOOS Development Plan calls for the GOES program to support the coastal and global components of the observing subsystem. Coordination of technology and applications across the various international geostationary satellite programs (GOES, MTSAT, METEOSAT, INSAT) will achieve a truly global observation system. In the near-term, GOES will be able to provide global and coastal zone sea surface temperature, sea ice, and heat flux observations that will impact some of the IOOS societal goals. As GOES-R comes online in the next decade, the planned sensor suite will permit the measurement of a variety of new core parameters including ocean color, optical properties, surface currents, and possibly bathymetry. Observing those new parameters in a frequency, spatial extent, and spatial resolution never before achieved will open up a new horizon of potential impacts on the societal benefits of IOOS.},

Abstract = {The growth of citizen science presents a valuable potential source of calibration and validation data for environmental remote sensing at greater spatial and temporal scales, and with greater cost efficiency than is achievable by professional in situ reference-data collection alone. However, the frequent mismatch between in situ data-quality requirements for remote-sensing-product development and current data quality assurance in citizen science presents a significant challenge if widespread use of these complementary data sources is to be achieved. To evaluate the scope of this challenge, we conducted a targeted literature review into the nature of data-quality issues faced by citizen-science projects for routine incorporation into terrestrial environmental-monitoring systems. From the literature, we identify the challenges and trade-offs to inform best-practice implementation of data quality assurance in citizen-science projects. To assist practitioners in implementing our findings, we grouped these themes by stage of citizen-science project: (1) program planning and design; (2) participant engagement; (3) data collection; and (4) data processing. As a final step, we used our findings as the basis to formulate guiding questions that can be used to inform decision making when choosing optimal data-quality-improvement and assurance strategies for use of citizen science in remote-sensing calibration and/or validation. Our aim is to enhance future development of citizen-science projects for use with remote sensing in environmental monitoring.},

Abstract = {As a typical rapid-development seaport area in coastal cities, such as Caofeidian, the study on the spatiotemporal changes of urban land use and its surrounding rural areas is valuable and significant in reference to the future urban planning and land policies in similar coastal areas of China or other countries. Based on satellite images, this research processes images in different years for summarizing the changes of vegetation, urban areas, and water areas in Caofeidian and the suburbs. This research aims to summarize the experience of the coastal city in the process of sustainable development by analyzing the dynamic trends and driving factors of land use spatial and temporal changes in the target area so that it provides a reference for the long-term development of the city. Meanwhile, it also hopes to give support for refining and improving the spatiotemporal analysis method for sustainable urban land use through the experiment. Due to the appearance of the results of the abnormal data, in the experiment process, this article adopts a comparative experiment to avoid the error of the analysis result and to find out the reason. The results show that the urban area for construction increased rapidly in the past twenty years, which is mainly affected by factors, such as economic development, policy guidance, environmental awareness, and environmental protection measures, especially guided by policies. Thus, coastal cities should stretch the planning of sustainable development from the three aspects combining with local characteristics. Besides, phenological phenomena and crops harvest time tremendously affect the images and calculation. The selection of remotely-sensed images should fully consider the characteristics of urban and rural locations, especially the impact of local phenological phenomena. The results of the analysis provide reference value and support for sustainable urban land management and development in the study area and other coastal cities.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ``land cover classification system{''}. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {Effects of Urbanization on Vegetation Degradation in the Yangtze River Delta of China: Assessment Based on SPOT-VGT NDVI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Rapid urbanization has generated great pressure on natural resources. This research paper illustrates the utility of linking socioeconomic and remotely sensed imagery in order to investigate the interaction between ecological and socioeconomic processes within the context of urban growth. The approach focuses on the vegetation degradation index (VDI) developed from time series SPOT-VGT NDVI, the nommlized difference vegetation index based on vegetation data provided by the vegetation sensor onboard the SPOT satellites. The VDI value of each square kilometer pixel has been calculated to depict spatial pattern of vegetation degradation, which are then aggregated into the city level. In terms of urbanization, 13 factors have been chosen and valued from statistics books and vector digital maps. With the sample set of 50 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region of China, spearman correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis have been adopted to investigate the causal relationships between urbanization and vegetation degradation. The findings are as follows: First, three hot-spot areas in vegetation degradation have been identified, which are spatially correlated with urban land expansion. The composite index of VDI has been manifested as an effective tool for assessing vegetation degradation. Second, economic and demographic variables, rather than the urban land expansion variables, have been verified to be the determinant factors for vegetation degradation. The rise of GDP growth rate, population growth or GDP per capita has significantly deepened regional vegetation degradation. Third and finally, the distinctively local findings that incomplete urbanization and idling cropland have probably increased vegetation degradation rates are worth noting. Although further studies are required for probing into detailed mechanisms and universality, the specific findings may provide a reference to similar studies, and should be quite useful for policy makers.

Abstract = {Short-term changes in red tide characteristics are very helpful in monitoring the larger change progress and associations with environmental factors. We conducted an experiment to collect data on short-term changes in noctilucent algae blooms in the Bohai Sea, on 14 June 2015. The performance of three classic indices (OC2, OC3G and YOC) for noctilucent algae surveying was compared based on the measured remote sensing reflectance (R-rs (lambda)) and Chl\_a (chlorophyll a). OC2 was finally selected here. We established two thresholds: alpha (R-rs (745)/ R-rs (865)) and epsilon (L (c)(745)/ L (c)(865)), based on the measured reflectance and the Geostationary Ocean Colour Imager (GOCI) images corrected by Rayleigh scattering, respectively. These two thresholds were subsequently used in Management Unit Mathematics Models (MUMM), which were embedded in the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), for atmospheric correction of the selected GOCI images. Based on the correlation between phytoplankton cell density and Chl\_a, we defined the threshold (6.5 mu g L-1) of Chl\_a concentration as a proxy of noctilucent algae blooms. Finally, we determined the temporal and spatial variations of the noctilucent algae bloom waters in the Bohai Sea, on 14 June 2015. The changing pattern demonstrated a general acknowledgement of phototropic vertical migration of the algae over the course of the day. Our results also demonstrated the utility of GOCI images, with MUMM atmospheric correction for short-time monitoring of noctilucent algae blooms.},

Abstract = {The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) in the Philippines is among the last forest frontiers in the country and is also home to 13 major watersheds in Northern Luzon that supply irrigation and hydroelectricity to other regions. However, it is faced with the deterioration of the quality of its watersheds due to forest loss driven mainly by agricultural expansion and illegal logging. Thus, this study was conducted to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of forest loss that could serve as a basis for policy decisions. Also, this paper determined the strength of relationships using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between forest loss and seven independent variables, which includes forest cover, agricultural areas, built-up, road network, and socio-economic data. This study utilized the Hansen Global Forest Change (HGFC), a Landsat-derived dataset from 2001 to 2019. Results revealed that 70,925 hectares (ha) of forest loss were detected with an annual deforestation rate of 3,744 ha/year across the region. Based on the validation, the accuracy of the HGFC data is 72\%, but great caution should be observed when using the data with less than 0.2 ha due to very low accuracy. On a region-wide analysis, only the forest cover had a strong association with the forest loss with a computed r-value of 0.78. Conversely, on a provincial level, the explanatory variables had a strong to moderately strong correlation with deforestation. Hence, immediate, science-based, and sustained regional and multi-stakeholder efforts are necessary to conserve and protect the remaining forest cover in the region.},

Abstract = {Aim Eleutherodactylus coqui (commonly known as the coqui) is a frog species native to Puerto Rico and non-native in Hawaii. Despite its ecological and economic impacts, its potential range in Hawaii is unknown, making control and management efforts difficult. Here, we predicted the distribution potential of the coqui on the island of Hawaii. Location Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Methods We predicted its potential distribution in Hawaii using five biophysical variables derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as predictors, presence/absence data collected from Puerto Rico and Hawaii and three classification methods Classification Trees (CT), Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Results Models developed separately using data from the native range and the invaded range predicted potential coqui habitats in Hawaii with high performance. Across the three classification methods, mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.75 for models trained using the native range data and 0.88 for models trained using the invaded range data. We achieved the highest AUC value of 0.90 using RF for models trained with invaded range data. Main conclusions Our results showed that the potential distribution of coquis on the island of Hawaii is much larger than its current distribution, with RF predicting up to 49\% of the island as suitable coqui habitat. Predictions also show that most areas with an elevation between 0 and 2000 m are suitable coqui habitats, whereas the cool and dry high elevation areas beyond 2000 m elevation are unsuitable. Results show that MODIS-derived biophysical variables are capable of characterizing coqui habitats in Hawaii.},

Abstract = {Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms) is an invasive aquatic macrophyte associated with major negative economic and ecological impacts to the Lake Victoria region since the plant's establishment in Uganda in the 1980s. Reliable estimates of water hyacinth distribution and extent are required to gauge the severity of the problem through time, relate water hyacinth abundance to environmental factors, identify areas requiring management action, and assess the efficacy of management actions. To provide such estimates and demonstrate the utility of remote sensing for this application, we processed and analyzed remotely sensed imagery to determine the distribution and extent of water hyacinth. Maps were produced and coverage was quantified using a hybrid unsupervised image classification approach with manual editing for each of the riparian countries of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, as well as for numerous gulfs and bays. A similar procedure was carried out for selected lakes in the Rwanda-Tanzania borderlands lakes region in the Kagera River basin. Results confirm the severity of the water hyacinth infestation, especially in the northern parts of the lake. A maximum lake-wide extent of at least 17,374 ha was attained in 1998. Following this, a combination of factors, including conditions associated with the 1997 to 1998 El Nino and biocontrol with water hyacinth weevils, appear to have contributed to a major decline in water hyacinth in the most affected parts of the lake. Some lakes in the Kagera basin, such as Lake Mihindi, Rwanda, were severely infested in the late 1990s, but the level of infestation in most of these decreased markedly by the early 2000s.},

Title = {Overlap between highly suitable habitats and longline gear management areas reveals vulnerable and protected regions for highly migratory sharks},

Abstract = {Highly migratory species (e.g. sharks, tunas, turtles, cetaceans) present unique conservation management challenges due to their wide-ranging movements. Consequently, the extent to which management areas protect habitats for highly migratory species is often unknown. Within the southeast region of the USA's exclusive economic zone, highly migratory sharks are target and/or bycatch species in pelagic and bottom longline fisheries. Here, we developed maximum entropy habitat suitability models for great hammerhead sharks Sphyrna mokarran, tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier, and bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas within the southeast region based on satellite tag (n = 96) and remotely sensed environmental data. Modeled highly suitable habitats were compared to longline gear management areas to determine what proportion of these habitats are protected from, and vulnerable to, longline fisheries. The percentages of highly suitable habitats overlapping with longline management areas varied by species and season (78\% warm, 36\% cool season for great hammerhead sharks; 48\% warm, 79\% cool for tiger sharks; and 2\% warm, 100\% cool for bull sharks). Highly suitable great hammerhead and tiger shark habitats were relatively well protected from pelagic longline fisheries yet vulnerable to bottom longline fisheries. Additionally, both species were vulnerable to pelagic and bottom longline fisheries off southwestern Florida; thus, extending gear restrictions to this area may benefit both species. Bull shark highly suitable habitats were only well protected from longline gear during the cool season. These results demonstrate how habitat suitability modeling can be used to help assess the efficacy of spatial management strategies and inform conservation plans for highly migratory species.},

Title = {Geomatics and epidemiology: Associating oxidative stress and greenness in urban areas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {197},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Green spaces may benefit human health mainly by mitigating noise and air pollution, promoting physical or social activities and improving mental health. Based on the influence that green space exposure seems to exert on Public Health and using a multidisciplinary approach, we investigated, the association between oxidative stress (OS) and green exposure in children. Overall, 207 subjects (10-13 yrs) living in Torino (NW- Italy) were involved in this study. Each participant provided a urinary sample, used to quantify a reliable OS biomarker (15-F2t-IsoP), and their residence addresses, used for geocoding. Green exposure was characterised by calculating i) the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) within fixed buffers around each participant's home, using remotely-sensed data; ii) Tree Map accounting for evergreen/broadleaf species; iii) The percentage of green cover (PGC). Significant negative correlation (Pearson's r = -0.758, p < 0.001) between PGC and 15-F2t-IsoP was found. Greater SAVI was associated with lower OS (Pearson's r = -0.717, p < 0.001). Noticeably, evergreens seemed to determine a significant OS reduction compared to broadleaves (slope = -0.12 and -0.02, respectively; Wartontest F = 12.48, p = 0.0011). Finally, a spatial distribution of 15-F2t-IsoP estimates map, overlying with 2011 Census Data on same-aged dwellers of Torino, was generated. Predictive models accounting for green spaces influence on OS can be useful tool derived from geomatic employ in the Public Health field. Future developments of such a multidisciplinary approach should be considered in urban planning and policy-makers decisions to better define priority zones to requalify in urban settings.},

Title = {The effect of habitat degradation on the long term survival of the Critically Endangered Madagascar spider tortoise (Pyxis arachnoides)},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {152-158},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pyxis arachnoides inhabits the dry, coastal forests of southwest Madagascar; a biologically unique ecoregion severely threatened by unsustainable small scale agricultural practices. Using remotely sensed data we established vegetation loss remains unabated within our study area at 1.2\% year(-1); consistent with ecoregion wide vegetation loss between 1990 and 2000. We monitored tortoise population density on four occasions over 8 years and developed a stage class projection matrix to model the finite growth rate, matrix sensitivities and elasticities of the population. Monitoring revealed an actual mean population decline of 10.8\% between 2003 and 2011. Our projection matrix model suggested the finite rate of growth to be lambda = 0.986, indicative of 1.4\% year(-1) decline for the duration of the existence of the population, with adult survival as the most sensitive parameter to overall survival of the population. Projection modeling suggests that the population would possibly become functionally non viable in approximately 170 years. As our study was heavily reliant on the use of surrogate data, more information is needed on pre-adult survival and wild reproductive rates. Our study site currently represents a population of exceptional density, therefore, other less dense populations, subjected to the further stresses of poaching will likely become functionally non viable much sooner. This study highlights the utility of population projection matrices in determining the vulnerability of chelonians; a globally threatened taxon. In the case of the spider tortoise, well coordinated development programs and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers forcing this species closer to extinction.

Title = {Population structure in a continuously distributed coastal marine species, the harbor porpoise, based on microhaplotypes derived from poor-quality samples},

Abstract = {Harbor porpoise in the North Pacific are found in coastal waters from southern California to Japan, but population structure is poorly known outside of a few local areas. We used multiplexed amplicon sequencing of 292 loci and genotyped clusters of single nucleotide polymoirphisms as microhaplotypes (N = 271 samples) in addition to mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence data (N = 413 samples) to examine the genetic structure from samples collected along the Pacific coast and inland waterways from California to southern British Columbia. We confirmed an overall pattern of strong isolation-by-distance, suggesting that individual dispersal is restricted. We also found evidence of regions where genetic differences are larger than expected based on geographical distance alone, implying current or historical barriers to gene flow. In particular, the southernmost population in California is genetically distinct (F-ST = 0.02 {[}microhaplotypes]; 0.31 {[}mtDNA]), with both reduced genetic variability and high frequency of an otherwise rare mtDNA haplotype. At the northern end of our study range, we found significant genetic differentiation of samples from the Strait of Georgia, previously identified as a potential biogeographical boundary or secondary contact zone between harbor porpoise populations. Association of microhaplotypes with remotely sensed environmental variables indicated potential local adaptation, especially at the southern end of the species' range. These results inform conservation and management for this nearshore species, illustrate the value of genomic methods for detecting patterns of genetic structure within a continuously distributed marine species, and highlight the power of microhaplotype genotyping for detecting genetic structure in harbor porpoises despite reliance on poor-quality samples.},

Abstract = {This study investigates land cover changes, magnitude and speed of urbanization and evaluates possible impacts on the environment by the concepts of landscape metrics and ecosystem services in China's three largest and most important urban agglomerations: Jing-Jin-Ji, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. Based on the classifications of six Landsat TM and HJ-1A/B remotely sensed space-borne optical satellite image mosaics with a superior random forest decision tree ensemble classifier, a total increase in urban land of about 28,000 km(2) could be detected alongside a simultaneous decrease in natural land cover classes and cropland. Two urbanization indices describing both speed and magnitude of urbanization were derived and ecosystem services were calculated with a valuation scheme adapted to the Chinese market based on the classification results from 1990 and 2010 for the predominant land cover classes affected by urbanization: forest, cropland, wetlands, water and aquaculture. The speed and relative urban growth in Jing-Jin-Ji was highest, followed by the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, resulting in a continuously fragmented landscape and substantial decreases in ecosystem service values of approximately 18.5 billion CNY with coastal wetlands and agriculture being the largest contributors. The results indicate both similarities and differences in urban-regional development trends implicating adverse effects on the natural and rural landscape, not only in the rural-urban fringe, but also in the cities' important hinterlands as a result of rapid urbanization in China.

Title = {Do Ecological Restoration Projects Undermine Economic Performance? A Spatially Explicit Empirical Study in Loess Plateau, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Exploring the complex relationship between ecological restoration and economic development is valuable for decision makers to formulate policy for sustainable development. The large-scale environmental restoration program-Grain for Green-was mainly implemented in the Loess Plateau of China to improve the soil retention service. However, whether this world-famous program affects local economic development has not been fully explored. In this study, using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and spatializing the gross domestic product (GDP) based on the remotely sensed nightlight data, we explored the tradeoff between environment (i.e., soil retention service) and economy (i.e., GDP) for the Loess Plateau in a spatially explicit way. We found that the soil retention service increased prominently over the past 40 years, especially after implementing the Grain for Green project. Meanwhile, the GDP increased about nine-fold over the past four decades from 4.52 to 40.29 x 10(7) USD. A win-win situation of soil retention and economic development was achieved in the Loess Plateau of China, particularly in the loess gully and loess hilly gully regions of the Loess Plateau. The win-win situation of soil retention and economic development was as a result of the Grain for Green program, the optimization of industrial structure, and the increase in non-agriculture employment. Compared with previous studies, more spatial information was available for the Loess Plateau in this study, which is more valuable to policymakers.},

Abstract = {Myanmar is one of the mangrove-richest countries in the world, providing valuable ecosystem services to people. However, due to deforestation driven primarily by agricultural expansion, Myanmar's mangrove forest cover has declined dramatically over the past few decades, while what remains is still under pressure. To support management planning, accurate quantification of mangrove forest cover changes on a national scale is needed. In this study, we quantified Myanmar's mangrove forest cover changes between 2000 and 2014 using remotely sensed data, examined the environmental impacts of such changes, and estimated the changes in the economic values of mangrove ecosystem services in the country. Results indicate that Myanmar had a net mangrove loss of 191,122 ha over the study period. Since 2000, Myanmar has been losing mangrove forest cover at an alarming rate of 14,619 ha/year (2.2\%/year). The loss was predominant in Rakhine and Ayeyarwady. The observed mangrove forest cover loss has resulted in decreased evapotranspiration, carbon stock, and tree cover percentage. Due to deforestation, Myanmar also suffered a net loss of 2,397 million US\$/year in its mangrove ecosystem service value (i.e. 28.7\% decrease from 2000), in which maintenance of fisheries nursery populations and habitat and coastal protection were among those services that were greatly affected. We suggest that intensive reforestation and mangrove protection programs be implemented immediately. Agroforestry and community forestry programs are encouraged in areas that are under immense pressure from paddy field expansion, fuelwood extraction, charcoal production, and fish and shrimp farming activities. Potential alternative sustainable solutions should include intensive government-led private forest plantations or community-owned forest plantations to be developed with care by local farmers, nongovernmental organizations, and business owners.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Environmental Controlling Factors of the Lake Tana Water Hyacinth in Ethiopia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The largest freshwater lake in Ethiopia, Lake Tana, has faced ecological disaster due to water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) infestation. The water hyacinth is a threat not only to the ecology but also to the socioeconomic development of the region and cultural value of the lake, which is registered as a UNESCO reserve. This study aims to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of the water hyacinth using high-resolution PlanetScope satellite images and assesses the major environmental variables that relate to the weed spatial coverage dynamics for the period August 2017 to July 2018. The plausible environmental factors studied affecting the weed dynamics include lake level, water and air temperature, and turbidity. Water temperature and turbidity were estimated from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite image and the water level was estimated using Jason-1 altimetry data while the air temperature was obtained from the nearby meteorological station at Bahir Dar station. The results indicated that water hyacinth coverage was increasing at a rate of 14 ha/day from August to November of 2017. On the other hand, the coverage reduced at a rate of 6 ha/day from December 2017 to June 2018. However, the length of shoreline infestation increased significantly from 4.3 km in August 2017 to 23.4 km in April 2018. Lake level and night-time water temperatures were strongly correlated with water hyacinth spatial coverage (p< 0.05). A drop in the lake water level resulted in a considerable reduction of the infested area, which is also related to decreasing nutrient levels in the water. The water hyacinth expansion dynamics could be altered by treating the nutrient-rich runoff with best management practices along the wetland and in the lake watershed landscape.},

Title = {Reliable estimation of evapotranspiration on agricultural fields predicted by the Priestley-Taylor model using soil moisture data from ground and remote sensing observations compared with the Common Land Model},

Abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial factor in understanding the hydrological cycle and is essential to many applications in hydrology, ecology and water resources management. However, reliable ET measurements and predictions for a range of temporal and spatial scales are difficult. This study focused on the comparison of ET estimates using a relatively simple model, the Priestley-Taylor (P-T) approach, and the physically based Common Land Model (CLM) using ground and remotely sensed soil moisture data as input. The results from both models were compared directly with hourly eddy covariance measurements at two agricultural field sites during the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) in the corn soybean production region in the Upper Midwest, USA. The P-T model showed a significant overestimation of the potential ET compared to the measurements, with a root mean square error (RMSE) between 115 and 130 W m(-2). Actual ET was better predicted by the CLM, with the RMSE ranging between 50 and 75 W m(-2). However, actual ET from the P-T model constrained with a soil moisture dependency parameterization showed improved results when compared to the measurements, with a significantly reduced bias and RMSE values between 60 and 65 W m(-2). This study suggests that even with a simple semi-empirical ET model, similar performance in estimating actual ET for agricultural crops compared to more complex land surface-atmosphere models (i.e. the CLM) can be achieved when constrained with the soil moisture function. This suggests that remote sensing soil moisture estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and others such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission may be effective alternatives under certain environmental conditions for estimating actual ET of agricultural crops using a fairly simple algorithm.},

Title = {Optimization of residential green space for environmental sustainability and property appreciation in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {763},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Cities in arid and semi-arid regions have been exploring urban sustainability policies, such as lowering the vegetation coverage to reduce residential outdoor water use. Meanwhile, urban residents express concerns that such policies could potentially impact home prices regardless of the reduced water costs because studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between vegetation coverage and home values. On the other hand, lower vegetation coverage in arid and semi-arid desert regions could increase surface temperatures, and consequently increases energy costs. The question is therefore where the point in which residential outdoor water use can be minimized without overly increasing surface temperatures and negatively impacting home values. This study examines the impacts of spatial composition of different vegetation types on land surface temperature (LST), outdoor water use (OWU), and property sales value (PSV) in 302 local residential communities in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona using remotely sensed data and regression analysis. In addition, the spatial composition of vegetation cover was optimized to achieve a relatively lower LST and OWU and maintain a relatively higher PSV at the same time. We found that drought-tolerant landscaping that is composed of mostly shrubs and trees adapted to the desert environment is the most water efficient way to reduce LST, but grass contributes to a higher PSV. Research findings suggest that different residential landscaping strategies may be better suited for different neighborhoods and goal sets can be used by urban planners and city managers to better design urban residential landscaping for more efficient water conservation and urban heat mitigation for desert cities.

Title = {Integrating Dynamic Subsurface Habitat Metrics Into Species Distribution Models},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) have become key tools for describing and predicting species habitats. In the marine domain, environmental data used in modeling species distributions are often remotely sensed, and as such have limited capacity for interpreting the vertical structure of the water column, or are sampled in situ, offering minimal spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in ocean models have improved our capacity to explore subsurface ocean features, yet there has been limited integration of such features in SDMs. Using output from a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we examine the effect of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDMs to describe the habitats of four pelagic predators in the California Current System (swordfish Xiphias gladius, blue sharks Prionace glauca, common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako sharks lsurus oxyrinchus). Species data were obtained from the California Drift Gillnet observer program (1997-2017). We used boosted regression trees to explore the incremental improvement enabled by dynamic subsurface variables that quantify the structure and stability of the water column: isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency. The inclusion of these dynamic subsurface variables significantly improved model explanatory power for most species. Model predictive performance also significantly improved, but only for species that had strong affiliations with dynamic variables (swordfish and shortfin mako sharks) rather than static variables (blue sharks and common thresher sharks). Geospatial predictions for all species showed the integration of isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency contributed value at the mesoscale level (< 100 km) and varied spatially throughout the study domain. These results highlight the utility of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDM development and support the continuing ecological use of biophysical output from ocean circulation models.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The quantity and nutritional quality of forage are key drivers for ungulate populations, including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), in the western U.S., but current vege-tation maps are too coarse spatially and temporally to effectively characterize fine-scale habitat. To address some of these gaps, we tested a novel approach using existing vegetation surveys, maps, and remotely sensed data to develop fine-scale forage species distribution models (SDMs) across Idaho, USA. We modelled 20 forage species that are suitable for mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk. Climatic, topographic, soil, vegetation, and disturbance variables were attributed to approximately 44.3 million habitat patches generated using multi-scale object -oriented image analysis. Lasso logistic regression was implemented to produce predictive SDMs. We evaluated if the inclusion of distal environmental variables (i.e., indirect effects) improved model performance beyond the inclusion of proximal variables (i.e., direct physiological effect) only. Our results showed that all models provided higher predictive accuracy than chance, with an average AUC across the 20 forage species of 0.84 for distal and proximal variables and 0.81 for proximal variables only. This indicated that the addition of distal variables improved model performance. We validated the models using two independent datasets from two regions of Idaho. We found that predicted forage species occurrence was on average within 10\% of observed occurrence at both sites. However, predicted occurrences had much less variability between habitat patches than the validation data, implying that the models did not fully capture fine-scale heterogeneity. We suggest that future efforts will benefit from additional fine resolution (i.e., less than 30 m) environmental predictor variables and greater accounting of environmental disturbances (i.e., wildfire, grazing) in the training data. Our approach was novel both in methodology and spatial scale (i.e., resolution and extent). Our models can inform ungulate nutrition by predicting the occurrence of forage species and aide habitat management strategies to improve nutritional quality.},

Title = {Identifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest ecotourism values with remotely sensed images and social media data: A perspective of public preferences},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {341},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Ecotourism, as a cultural ecosystem service, is an essential part of rural economic growth. Developing feasible methods and indicators for ecotourism values is vital to exploring the interactions between public preferences and ecosystems, thus providing information for sustainable ecosystem management. However, forest ecotourism value assessments at the regional scale still lack scientific frameworks covering the spatiotemporal dimension. Here, we proposed a framework to assess forest ecotourism values and explore the contributions of public preferences, selecting a typical and abundant forest area, Lin'an County, China. First, we applied a text mining approach on social comments to identify key variables related to public preferences. Then, we mapped these variables with remote sensing and GIS data and incorporated them with a Maxent model. This model revealed the spatiotemporal patterns of forest ecotourism value and its interaction with public preferences, over two periods, i.e., 2010-2014 and 2015-2019. Our results showed that albeit with a minor change magnitude in the entirety of ecotourism values (1-3\% overall decrease), about 34\% and 44\% of forests were observed as significant increases and decreases in ecotourism values, respectively. A large number of increases were concentrated in the village scenic areas, while decreases were observed in planted areas. Such notable changes were mainly attributable to changes in accessibility variables with 67\% of contributions in 2010-2014 and 72\% in 2015-2019. Variables related to human perception and vision (forest attribute and color diversity) also played a part. Our findings infer that local rural-building policies have an evident influence on the distribution and intensity of forest ecotourism. Our proposed framework provides references for evaluating the response and effectiveness of local policies and to make proactive efforts for forest protection, restoration and management.},

Abstract = {The power line network, interconnecting power generation facilities and their end-users, is a critical infrastructure on which most of our socio-economic activities rely. As society becomes increasingly reliant on electricity, the rapid and effective monitoring of power line safety is critical. In particular, accurately knowing the current geometric and thermal status of power lines and identifying possible encroachments is the most important task in the power line risk management process. To facilitate this task, the correct identification of key objects comprising a power line corridor scene from remotely sensed data is the first important step. In recent years, airborne lidar has been successfully adopted as a cost-effective and accurate data source for mapping the power line corridors. However, in today's practice, the classification of power line objects using lidar data still relies on labor-intensive data manipulation, and its automation is urgently required. To address this problem, this paper proposes a point-based supervised classification method, which enables the identification of five utility corridor objects (wires, pylons, vegetation, buildings, and low objects) using airborne lidar data. A total of 21 features were investigated to illustrate the horizontal and vertical properties of power line objects. A non-parametric discriminative classifier, Random Forests model, was trained with refined features to label raw laser point clouds. The proposed classifier showed 91.04 percent sample-weighted and 90.07 percent class-weighted classification accuracy, which indicates it could be highly valuable for large-scale, rapid compilations of corridor maps. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed classifier suggested that when compared, training with class-balanced samples improves classification performance over training with unbalanced samples, particularly with corridor objects such as wires and pylons.},

Abstract = {Wetlands have the most abundant biodiversity, the highest carbon sequestration capacity, and the highest values for ecological services per unit area, of all the world's ecosystems. Practice has shown that establishing reserves is the most effective way of protecting typical ecosystems and their biodiversity, and saving rare or endangered wildlife. The Chinese government's policy is to protect wetland systems by establishing reserves that encompass a massive network of wetlands, including wetland nature reserves, internationally important wetlands, and wetland parks. Many are already established. The effect of protecting wetland nature reserves at the national level has not yet been reported. We used the latest database evaluating the protection value of wetland reserves, and remotely sensed wetland maps (1978-2008), developed by the same mapping specialists and based on the same classification system, and related environmental data, to evaluate the effects of protecting China's national wetland reserves over the last 30 years. We conclude that (i) the total area of wetland in the national wetland reserves has decreased over the last 30 years to 8152.47 km(2), and just 8\% of China's net decrease in wetlands; (ii) about 79\% of the 91 national wetland reserves are in a poor condition. These are generally located around the Yangtze River, Eastern Coast, the Three Rivers Source, and Southwest China. Protection measures should be undertaken urgently in these areas. Only 15\% of national wetland reserves are under sound protection, and these are generally located in the upper reaches of the Songhua River; (iii) although 88\% of national wetland reserves are primitive (relatively natural), implying that the site selection has been scientific, a high percentage of national wetland reserves show early warning signs of decline and require urgent attention; (iv) based on our evaluation of protection effects and pressures on ecology, we have made a priority list of national wetland reserves, and propose several protection strategies.},

Abstract = {After many years of illegal hunting and commercialization, the populations of the Black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) have been recovering during the last four decades due to the enforcement of a legislation that inhibits their international commercialization. Protecting nesting sites, in which vulnerable life forms (as reproductive females, eggs, and neonates) spend considerable time, is one of the most appropriate conservation actions aimed at preserving caiman populations. Thus, identifying priority areas for this activity should be the primary concern of conservationists. As caiman nesting sites are often found across the areas with difficult access, collecting nest information requires extensive and costly fieldwork efforts. In this context, species distribution modeling can be a valuable tool for predicting the locations of caiman nests in the Amazon basin. In this work, the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) was applied to model the M. niger nest occurrence in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR) using remotely sensed data. By taking into account the M. niger nesting habitat, the following predictor variables were considered: conditional distance to open water, distance to bare soil, expanded contributing area from drainage, flood duration, and vegetation type. The threshold-independent prediction performance and binary prediction based on the threshold value of 0.9 were evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) and performing a binomial test, respectively. The obtained results (AUC = 0.967 +/- 0.006 and a highly significant binomial test P< 0.01) indicated excellent performance of the proposed model in predicting the M. niger nesting occurrence in the MSDR. The variables related to hydrological regimes (conditional distance to open water, expanded contributing area from drainage, and flood duration) most strongly affected the model performance. MaxEnt can be used for developing community-based sustainable management programs to provide socioeconomic benefits to local communities and promote species conservation in a much larger area within the Amazon basin.},

Abstract = {Eco-environment quality evaluation is an important research theme in environment management. In the present study, Fuzhou city in China was selected as a study area and a limited number of 222 sampling field sites were first investigated in situ with the help of a GPS device. Every sampling site was assessed by ecological experts and given an Eco-environment Background Value (EBV) based on a scoring and ranking system. The higher the EBV, the better the ecological environmental quality. Then, three types of eco-environmental attributes that are physically-based and easily-quantifiable at a grid level were extracted: (1) remote sensing derived attributes (vegetation index, wetness index, soil brightness index, surface land temperature index), (2) meteorological attributes (annual temperature and annual precipitation), and (3) terrain attribute (elevation). A Back Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was proposed for the EBV validation and prediction. A three-layer BP ANN model was designed to automatically learn the internal relationship using a training set of known EBV and eco-environmental attributes, followed by the application of the model for predicting EBV values across the whole study area. It was found that the performance of the BP ANN model was satisfactory and capable of an overall prediction accuracy of 82.4\%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.801 in the validation. The evaluation results showed that the eco-environmental quality of Fuzhou city is considered as satisfactory. Through analyzing the spatial correlation between the eco-environmental quality and land uses, it was found that the best eco-environmental areas were related to forest lands, whereas the urban area had the relatively worst eco-environmental quality. Human activities are still considered as a major impact on the eco-environmental quality in this area.},

Title = {Application of vegetation index time series to value fire effect on primary production in a Southern European rare wetland},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {134},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fire disturbance is an intrinsic component of the Mediterranean biome playing an important role in ecosystem dynamics and processes. However, frequent and severe anthropogenic wildfires can be detrimental to natural ecosystems, particularly in small natural protected areas, where they may hamper the flow of ecosystem services (ES). While post-fire dynamics of individual ES are heavily context-dependent, the primary productivity of the ecosystem can be regarded as a generic driver of several provisioning and regulating ES, as it represents the amount of energy available to plants for storage, growth, and reproduction, which drives future ecosystem structure and functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic wildfire on the primary productivity of a rare wetland ecosystem in the Natura 2000 site ``Torre Guaceto{''} in Southern Europe. Productivity was estimated by calculating a 15-year time series of vegetation indices (EVI and NDWI) from remotely sensed MODIS imagery. Our results in terms of PP trends may be relevant to assess the change in ecosystems services provided by wetlands. Interactions between wildfire, ecosystem productivity and climate were then analyzed. During the selected period, climate did not play a significant effect on primary productivity, which was mainly driven by post-fire vegetation recovery. Findings of the present study demonstrate that the wildfire affecting the Natural Protected Area of Torre Guaceto in summer 2007 had a major effect on primary productivity, inducing the regeneration of Phragmites australis and the replacement of old individuals by structurally and functionally better ones.},

Title = {Tropical forest monitoring, combining satellite and social data, to inform management and livelihood implications: Case studies from Indonesian West Timor},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {77-84},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Deforestation in the world's tropics is an urgent international issue. One response has been the development of satellite based monitoring initiatives largely focused on the carbon rich forests of western Indonesia. In contrast this study focuses on one eastern Indonesian district, Kabupaten Kupang, which has some of the largest and least studied tracts of remaining forest in West Timor. A combination of remote sensing, GIS and social science methods were used to describe the state of forests in Kabupaten Kupang, how and why they are changing. Using satellite imagery, case studies and on-ground interviews, this study explores the proposition that transdisciplinary local social, cultural and biophysical knowledge is important for effectively using remotely sensed data as a tool to inform local management policies. When compared to some other parts of Indonesia, the rate and extent of deforestation in West Timor was found to be relatively small and a satellite based assessment alone could conclude that it is not a critical issue. However this study showed that when on-ground social data are coupled with (such) satellite-based data a more complex picture emerges, related to key livelihood issues. The causes of forest cover change were found to be multivariate and location specific, requiring management approaches tailored to local social issues. This study suggests that integrative research can maximise the utility of satellite data for understanding causation and thus informing management strategies. In addition, the satellite based assessment found that at the time of the study less than 4\% of forested land was within national parks and nature reserves and less than a third of the protected catchment forest zone was forested. These data suggest considerable scope for upland re-forestation activities or the redrawing of protected forest boundaries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An index for tracking old-growth value in disturbance-prone forest landscapes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Forests in their later stages of development attain attributes that support biodiversity and provide a variety of ecological benefits (e.g. clean water and carbon storage). Despite their values, old-growth forests are declining worldwide in part due to anthropogenic pressures. A persistent challenge to managing and conserving old-growth forest has been establishing a reliable method for measuring old-growth values across large landscapes at an appropriately fine ecological and spatial scale. Using data from a community-managed forest in central British Columbia, Canada, an Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) based metric was developed, using a random forest modeling framework, to predict an old-growth index across the forest. Using this old-growth index, we estimated that forests with ``Very-high{''} old-growth values cover 14.7\% of the study area (18,183.2 ha), and that only 25\% (4,545.9 ha) of this ``very-high{''} old-growth value areas are current inside designated old-growth management areas (OGMAs). Additionally, the forests with ``very-high{''} old-growth values that are currently inside OGMAs are fragmented, as only 1 out of 40 OGMAs have more than 50\% of its area covered by forests with ``Very-high{''} old-growth value. This research provides a clear ecological indicator that uses fine-scale remotely sensed data to measure old-growth and assess its conservation status within reserves. While the index developed is specific to the study site, the framework, is generic enough to be adapted to other forest types and ecosystems. More importantly, the identification of the amount and location of old-growth forests over the landscape can aid in the management and conservation of this rare resource and its services.},

Title = {Integrated wildfire risk assessment of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems based on simulation modeling and remotely sensed data fusion},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Even though wildfires constitute a natural phenomenon, fires of high intensity may provoke profound ecological and socioeconomic implications. Primary aim of the paper constitutes the integrated wildfire risk assessment of a fire-prone region in Greece through the simulation modeling of burn probability (BP) and fire intensity to natural and anthropogenic resources (forests, birds' habitats, built-up areas, agricultural fields, energy networks etc.), as well as the identification of resources response to fires of differentiated intensity. So, fire modeling constitutes the primary input to wildfire effects determination through the contribution of fire and resources specialists. The predicted fire effects were quantified and mapped through a spatial index of Net Value Change which aggregates the total predicted change in terms of area gained (e. g. forest regeneration) or lost due to fire impacts. The greatest loss from the total area of each resource/asset was predicted to electricity and renewable energy sources networks (-0.48\%), followed by mixed forests (-0.47\%), residential buildings and assets (-0.43\%), coniferous forests (-0.43\%), shrubs (-0.4\%), broad-leaved forests (-0.27\%) and agricultural crops (-0.19\%). The mapping of this index demonstrated that the resources which are at high risk are located close to compact flammable material, following the pattern of increased fire intensity and BP. Hence, this framework can strategically and operationally be used to establish a hierarchical priority-based model for optimal allocation of fire resources. This two-stage of analysis allows for an objective quantification of fire effects to a spatial level (i.e. prefecture) where many biophysical attributes might heavily affect the fire modeling outcomes enhancing the credibility of results.},

Title = {Site-specific management of common olive: Remote sensing, geospatial, and advanced image processing applications},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {680-689},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Site-specific crop management (SSCM) is a part of precision agriculture which is helping increase production with minimal input. It has enhanced the cost-benefit scenario in crop production. The main goal of this paper was to use advanced geospatial techniques in data acquisition, remote sensing (RS), image processing, geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS) and statistical modeling to determine the correlation between image digital information and healthy olive trees growth and production management characteristics. It is to be noted that assumptions were based on the overall canopy greenness of the olive trees as healthy trees. This research was carried out during 2012-2014 in an irrigated olive orchards located in the Tarom region, Zanjan province of Iran. The following data were gathered: fruit set percent in shoot, canopy volume (CV), shoot length (SL), trunk diameter (TD), trunk height (TH), soil plant analysis development (SPAD), leaf area index (LAI), leaf dry matter percent (LDMP), leaf properties like nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) content in leaves, soil properties/characteristics like amount of Clay, Silt, Sand, Sodium adsorption rate (SAR), organic matter (OM), available phosphorous (P-av), available potassium (K-av), boron (B), total neutralizing value (TNV), electrical conductivity (EC), chloride (Cl), available iron (Fe-av). Advanced land observing satellite-Advanced visible and near infrared radiometer type 2 (ALOS-AVNIR-2) image was used in this experiment. A set of six clusters of olive trees existing in a compacted parcel of olive orchards were chosen. The image indices developed for this study were the normalized digital vegetation index (NDVI), newly developed vegetative vigor index (VVI) and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). Multivariate regression models were developed using remotely sensed image digital values in relation to the site specific crop growth parameters as mentioned above. As is stated above, individual band DN value statistics as input parameters and plant growth characteristics such as CV, SL, TD, TH, SPAD, LAI, and LDMP as output parameters were used in the multivariate regression models development. Multicollinearity analyses were completed on the input parameters to reduce redundancy of data usage. Multicollinearity analysis of the image related variables shows that VVI and b1 are highly correlated with other variables. It was also observed that NDVI - b3 and b2-b4 are highly correlated and hence omitted from the input parameter list. The multivariate regression models developed with NDVI and SAVI along with individual band (Green, Red and Infrared bands) as input parameters for olive crop growth parameters like TD, TH and SPAD provided excellent coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.98, 0.99 and 0.99, respectively. SAVI, Red-, Green-, and Blue-band image information together best estimated the olive tree canopy volume with R2 value of 0.84. Similarly, SAVI, Red-, Green-, and Blue band image information together also best estimated the olive tree SL and LA with R-2 value of 0.88 and 0.96, respectively. SAVI, NDVI, Red-, Green-, and Blue-band image information as input parameters estimated the olive tree trunk diameter with R2 value of 0.98. The same SAVI, NDVI, Red-, Green-, and Blue band image information together best predicted the olive tree trunk height with maximum correlation (R-2 = 0.99). Similarly SPAD and LDMP were estimated with excellent correlations (R-2 = 0. 99 and 0.79, respectively) using image related input parameters of SAVI, NDVI, Red-, Green-, and Blue-band. Algorithms developed with this study could be used by farmers or orhard managers for estimating the olive tree physical characteristics in similar environmental conditions that prevailed in our study area using remotely sensed imagery in a non-invasive, economic, and efficient manner.

Title = {Predicting the geographical distribution of Acropora muricata in two lesser-known reef systems of the Andaman Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are undergoing deterioration worldwide due to climate and anthropogenic stressors, notwithstanding the enormous support they provide to marine biodiversity and the essential services to humans. Knowledge about the extent of hard coral distribution is a key requirement for designing conservation strategies such as Marine Protected Areas(MPA). The transboundary island groups of the Andaman Sea-Andaman, Nicobar and Mergui Archipelagos-are largely underexplored and less managed due to their remoteness and various political constraints. In the present study, we developed a maximum entropy (Maxent) based distribution model for the stony coral Acropora muricata by using records of its occurrence and 14 remotely sensed environmental variables along with bathymetry and distance from the shore as predictors. Our model predicted this species' current distribution, with the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.908. The important predictor variables determining the distribution were bathymetry, distance from the shore, calcite, PAR, and ocean current. Many of the unexplored islands, seamounts and shallow patches of the Andaman Sea such as Cinque Island, Invisible Bank, Batti Malv Island, Tillanchong island, Narcondam, Barren island, Than, Dunkin, Cash Island, the southern tip of Zadetkyi, Bruer, Graham, Clara Island, Buda, Lord Loughborough Island, Quoin Island, Tachai, Koh Bon, Ko Payang and several other unnamed sites were predicted as potential areas of occurrence of A. muricata as per this study. The presence of this species, which is the most common hard coral in the Indo-Pacific, indicates the existence of coral reef ecosystems in these areas. Such habitats and the region's proximity towards the coral triangle imply better chances of connectivity and resilience. This study will contribute toward designing a transboundary conservation network and developing management plans to maintain sustainable fisheries.},

Abstract = {Soil texture is an important property that controls the mobility of the water and nutrients in soil. This study examined the capability of machine learning (ML) models in estimating soil texture fractions using different combinations of remotely sensed data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and terrain-derived covariates (TDC) across two contrasting agroecological regions in Southwest Germany, Kraichgau and the Swabian Alb. Importantly, we tested the predictive power of three different ML models: the random forest (RF), the support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) coupled with the remote sensing data covariates. As expected, ML model performance was not consistent regarding the input covariates, soil texture fractions, and study regions. For example, in the Swabian Alb, the SVM model performed the best for the sand content with S2 + TDC (RMSE = 3.63\%, R-2 = 0.42), and XGB best predicted the clay content with S1 + S2 + TDC (RMSE = 6.84\%, R-2 = 0.64). In Kraichgau, the best models for sand (RMSE = 7.54\%, R-2 = 0.79) and clay contents (RMSE = 6.14\%, R-2 = 0.48) were obtained using XGB and SVM, respectively. Moreover, the results indicated that TDC were critical in estimating soil texture fractions, especially in Kraichgau, which indicated that topography plays an important role in defining the spatial distribution of soil properties. In contrast, the contribution of remote sensing data better predicted the silt and clay content in the Swabian Alb. The transferability of a region-specific model to the other region was low as indicated by poor predictive performance. The resulting soil-texture-fraction maps could be a significant source of information for efficient land resource management and environmental monitoring. Nonetheless, further research to evaluate the added value of the Sentinel imagery and to better analyze the spatial transferability of machine learning models is highly recommended.},

Abstract = {The reclamation of coastal land for agricultural, industrial, and urban land use-a common worldwide practice-has occurred extensively in the coastal region of China. In recent decades, all coastal provinces and metropolises in China have experienced severe coastal reclamation related to land scarcity caused by rapid economic growth and urbanization. However, the value of coastal wetlands and ecosystems has not been well understood and appreciated until recent development of advantageous methods of restoring reclaimed land to coastal wetlands in many developed countries. The overall objective of this study is to provide detailed spatial and temporal distributions of coastal reclamation; analyze drivers such as coastal economy, population growth, and urbanization; and understand the relationships among the drivers and land reclamation. We used long-term Landsat image time series from 1985 to 2010 in 5-year intervals, in combination with remotely sensed image interpretation and spatial analysis, to map the reclamation status and changes across the coastal region of China. The Landsat images time-series analysis was also conducted to evaluate the effects of the economy, population, and urbanization drivers on coastal reclamation. The analysis results indicated that 754,697 ha of coastal wetlands have been reclaimed across all coastal provinces and metropolises from 1985 to 2010, and the trend increased sharply after 2005. High-intensity coastal reclamation was mainly driven by the booming economy, especially after 2000, associated with urbanization and industrial development in China's coastal region; this was closely correlated with the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The continuous large-scale coastal reclamation of its coastal region now means China is facing a great challenge, including the enormous loss of vegetated coastal wetlands, negative environmental effects, and potential disaster risks related to coastal flooding under future change climate conditions. Long-term ecosystem-based coastal protection and management are critical to support sustainable coastal ecosystems in China in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Relationships between Ecosystem Services and Urbanization in Jiangsu Province, Eastern China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services are comprehensive and quantitative indicators for describing ecosystem-human interactions. China has experienced rapid urbanization in the past 30 years, which has created a significant impact on regional ecosystem services. However, whether the impact is linear is not clear as yet. In this study, the Jiangsu province, a main body of the Chinese Yangtze River Delta city cluster, was chosen as a case study. Multi-source remotely-sensed geospatial data, including meteorological, land use, vegetation, and socio-economic data, were collected to estimate the total amount of ecosystem services (TESV) and urbanization levels. Subsequently, the relationships between TESV and urbanization indices (i.e., gross domestic product (GDP) per unit area, GPUA; population per unit area, PPUA; and built-up land proportion, BULP) were determined using the Pearson correlation analysis and piecewise linear regression. The primary findings of this study were as follows: (1) There was a distinct spatial pattern in TESV, which gradually increased from west to east with high-value areas located in eastern coastal areas of Jiangsu. Among different land use types, cropland and woodland contributed the most to TESV; (2) The three urbanization indices had spatial patterns, indicating higher urbanization in southern Jiangsu than in central or northern Jiangsu; and (3) Once GPUA and PPUA exceeded threshold values of 3719.55 x 10(4) yuan/km(2) and 744.37 person/km(2), respectively, TESV sharply decreased with an increase in these indices. However, the BULP showed a linear and significantly negative relationship with TESV at all values, which indicated that the impacts of economic and population growth on TESV lagged behind that of built-up land expansion. These findings provide a potentially significant reference for decision-makers to rationally enhance regional ecosystem services during rapid urbanization processes.},

Abstract = {Chlorophylls absorb photosynthetically active radiation and thus function as vital pigments for photosynthesis, which makes leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) useful for monitoring vegetation productivity and an important indicator of the overall plant physiological condition. This study investigates the utility of integrating remotely sensed estimates of C-ab into a thermal-based Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model that estimates land-surface CO2 and energy fluxes using an analytical, light-use-efficiency (LUE) approach to estimating bulk canopy resistance. The LUE model component computes canopy-scale carbon assimilation and transpiration fluxes, internally estimating fluctuations in effective LUE from a nominal (species-dependent) value (LUEn) in response to short-term variations in environmental conditions. LUEn, however, may vary on a daily timescale, responding to changes in plant phenology, physiological condition and nutrient status. Therefore, remote sensing methodologies for improving daily estimates of LUEn have been investigated. Day-to-day variations in LUEn were assessed for a heterogeneous corn crop field in Maryland, U.S.A. through model optimization with eddy covariance CO2 flux tower observations. The optimized daily LUEn values were then compared to gridded estimates of C-ab over the tower flux footprint, retrieved from a canopy reflectance model driven by green, red and near-infrared imagery acquired with an aircraft imaging system. The tower-calibrated LUEn data were generally well correlated with airborne retrievals of C-ab, and hourly water, energy and carbon flux estimation accuracies from TSEB were significantly improved when using C-ab for delineating spatio-temporal variations in LUEn. The study highlights the potential synergy between thermal infrared and shortwave reflective wavebands in producing valuable remote sensing data for estimating carbon, water and heat fluxes within a two-source energy balance framework.

Title = {Drought tolerant species dominate as rainfall and tree cover returns in the West African Sahel},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {After the severe droughts in the 1970s and 1980s, and subsequent debates about desertification, analyses of satellite images reveal that the West African Sahel has become greener again. In this paper we report a study on changes in tree cover and tree species composition in three village landscapes in northern Burkina Faso, based on a combination of methods: tree density change detection using aerial photos and satellite images, a tree species inventory including size class distribution analysis, and interviews with local farmers about woody vegetation changes. Our results show a decrease in tree cover in the 1970s followed by an increase since the mid-1980s, a pattern correlating with the temporal trends in rainfall as well as remotely sensed greening in the region. However, both the inventory and interview data shows that the species composition has changed substantially towards a higher dominance of drought-resistant and exotic species. This shift, occurring during a period of increasing annual precipitation, points to the complexity of current landscape changes and questions rain as the sole primary driver of the increase in tree cover. We propose that the observed changes in woody vegetation (densities, species composition and spatial distribution) are mediated by changes in land use, including intensification and promotion of drought tolerant and fast growing species. Our findings, which indicate a rather surprising trajectory of land cover change, highlight the importance of studies that integrate evidence of changes in tree density and species composition to complement our understanding of land use and vegetation change trajectories in the Sahel obtained from satellite images. We conclude that a better understanding of the social-ecological relations and emerging land use trajectories that produce new types of agroforestry parklands in the region is of crucial importance for designing suitable policies for climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation and the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services that benefit local livelihoods in one of the world's poorest regions.

Title = {A new approach to detect extreme events: a case study using remotely-sensed precipitation time-series data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Detecting and predicting extreme events are of major importance for socioeconomic, healthcare and ecological purposes. This study proposes an alternative model to detect extreme events based on analyses of probability distribution functionffns s (f((X))), called Optimum Probability Distribution Function Searcher Model (Opt.PDF-model). The Opt.PDFmodel involves the optimization of a fitness function between an histogram and a set of theoretical f((X)), and the subsequent evaluation of the Probability Point Function (PPF) of the fittest theoretical (f((X))) to assess threshold values for the classification of extreme events. Any occurrence in the dataset with a PPF value equal to or greater than 90\% was considered an extreme event candidate. A satellite-derived precipitation time-series (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) was used to calibrate and validate the proposed model, with data on accumulated precipitation from more than 30 years (Jan.1981 to Dec.2018) of the Brazilian Amazon region. The proposed method was pairwise cross-validated with two other extreme event models based on Gamma and Gaussian distributions, as applied by the European Drought Observatory of the European Environment Agency. Aditionally, all three extreme event classification models were cross-validated relative to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). By means of the Opt.PDF-model, it was possible to evidence two positive temporal trends for the area of study: one for more intense precipitation events, and another for less intense events. The pairwise cross-validation analysis returned specific Kappa's similarity indices, and the highest similarity was observed between the Gamma and the Opt.PDF models (48\% for PPF(97.7\%)). This analysis indicated that extreme event detection models are highly sensitive to distribution family priors and to threshold definitions. The proposed approach and the results obtained here are potentially useful for climate change warnings, and can be extended to other scientific areas that involve time-series analyses.},

Title = {Understanding vegetation variability and their ``hotspots{''} within Lake Victoria Basin (LVB: 2003-2018)},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {122},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Lake Victoria's surface area has recently been shown to have shrunk by 0.3\% compared to its 1984 value, a decline that has been associated with climatic as well as anthropogenic factors. Climatic factors include, e.g., reduced rainfall, which impacts not only on the lake's water level but also on the basin's vegetation that forms the lake's catchment. Understanding the locations of vegetation changes and the driving forces of such changes, therefore, is of most critical importance to major stakeholders regarding environmental management, policies and planning. For Lake Victoria Basin (LVB; Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi), human development and climatic variability/change have subjected the region to significant changes in its vegetation characteristics whose spatio-temporal patterns are, however, not well understood. To understand this variability in vegetation for the period 2003-2018, this study employs the use of remotely sensed MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with station data) precipitation data, Google Earth Pro imagery, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-based Mascon's total water storage (TWS) products and the statistical PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The study aims at determining (i) ``significant hotspots{''}, i.e. vegetation areas within the LVB largely impacted, and (ii), the extent of which anthropogenic and climatic variability have contributed to the ``hotspots{''} formation. The results indicate a total of 8 hotspots; 5 in Uganda and 1 each in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Google Earth Pro imagery of all the hotspots show the changes in anthropogenic processes as the primary driver for the long-term changes in vegetation characteristics. Conversely, the analysis of PCA and Mascon's TWS concluded that only the Tanzanian hotspot may have been driven somewhat by climate variability. Climate variability is understood to be the driver of short-term vegetation changes while the long-term effects are driven primarily by human influence.},

Title = {Remotely sensing harmful algal blooms in the Red Sea},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are of global concern, as their presence is often associated with socio-economic and environmental issues including impacts on public health, aqua-culture and fisheries. Therefore, monitoring the occurrence and succession of HABs is fundamental for managing coastal regions around the world. Yet, due to the lack of adequate in situ measurements, the detection of HABs in coastal marine ecosystems remains challenging. Sensors on-board satellite platforms have sampled the Earth synoptically for decades, offering an alternative, cost-effective approach to routinely detect and monitor phytoplankton. The Red Sea, a large marine ecosystem characterised by extensive coral reefs, high levels of biodiversity and endemism, and a growing aquaculture industry, is one such region where knowledge of HABs is limited. Here, using high-resolution satellite remote sensing observations (1km, MODIS-Aqua) and a second-order derivative approach, in conjunction with available in situ datasets, we investigate for the first time the capability of a remote sensing model to detect and monitor HABs in the Red Sea. The model is able to successfully detect and generate maps of HABs associated with different phytoplankton functional types, matching concurrent in situ data remarkably well. We also acknowledge the limitations of using a remote-sensing based approach and show that regardless of a HAB's spatial coverage, the model is only capable of detecting the presence of a HAB when the Chl-a concentrations exceed a minimum value of similar to 1 mg m(-3). Despite the difficulties in detecting HABs at lower concentrations, and identifying species toxicity levels (only possible through in situ measurements), the proposed method has the potential to map the reported spatial distribution of several HAB species over the last two decades. Such information is essential for the regional economy (i.e., aquaculture, fisheries \& tourism), and will support the management and sustainability of the Red Sea's coastal economic zone.},

Title = {Changes in coastal city ecosystem service values based on land use A case study of Yingkou, China},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {287-293},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The valuation of ecosystem services is intended to facilitate the rational and sustainable utilization of natural resources. However, calculating the values of natural resources is complex, and research is underway in this regard. The change of land use types can reflect the changes in the area of each ecosystem; therefore, in this study, land use changes in Yingkou (located in the south of Liaoning Province and an important port city) over a 10-year period (2004-2014) are assessed using a geographic information systems platform and the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Thematic Mapper remotely sensed images of the area. The Costanza calculation method and classification system are used to estimate changes in the total values of ecosystem services in the Yingkou area from 2004 to 2014 and to investigate the causes of these changes. The ``change tendency{''} of particular ecological communities is calculated using the Variable coefficient, the Gini coefficient, and the Theil index. The results reveal the following: (i) The total value of ecosystem services in the Yingkou area decreased drastically (i.e., from \$2567.60 million to \$2127.26 million, representing a 17.2\% decline) between 2004 and 2014. (ii) Aquatic ecosystem services are valued greater than terrestrial services. In Yingkou, a decline in the value of aquatic ecosystem services accounts for 88.6\% of the total decrease in ecosystem service value. (iii) Land reclamation in the Yingkou urban area emerges as the primary factor influencing ecosystem service values for the various ecological communities in the region. The ecosystem service value of each ecological community is different, and the differences between the contributions made by the various communities to the total ecosystem services value are increasing over time. (iv) The decline in ecosystem service values in Yingkou is linked to urban development. Following widespread land reclamation, an increase in land area intended for urban construction is associated with a decrease in water area.},

Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2016},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Early detection of invasive plant species is vital for the management of natural resources and protection of ecosystem processes. The use of satellite remote sensing for mapping the distribution of invasive plants is becoming more common, however conventional imaging software and classification methods have been shown to be unreliable. In this study, we test and evaluate the use of five species distribution model techniques fit with satellite remote sensing data to map invasive tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) along the Arkansas River in Southeastern Colorado. The models tested included boosted regression trees (BRT), Random Forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), generalized linear model (GLM), and Maxent. These analyses were conducted using a newly developed software package called the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM). All models were trained with 499 presence points, 10,000 pseudo-absence points, and predictor variables acquired from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor over an eight-month period to distinguish tamarisk from native riparian vegetation using detection of phenological differences. From the Landsat scenes, we used individual bands and calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and tasseled capped transformations. All five models identified current tamarisk distribution on the landscape successfully based on threshold independent and threshold dependent evaluation metrics with independent location data. To account for model specific differences, we produced an ensemble of all five models with map output highlighting areas of agreement and areas of uncertainty. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of species distribution models in analyzing remotely sensed data and the utility of ensemble mapping, and showcase the capability of SAHM in pre-processing and executing multiple complex models.},

Title = {Assessing the Accuracy and Potential for Improvement of the National Land Cover Database's Tree Canopy Cover Dataset in Urban Areas of the Conterminous United States},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provides time-series data characterizing the land surface for the United States, including land cover and tree canopy cover (NLCD-TC). NLCD-TC was first published for 2001, followed by versions for 2011 (released in 2016) and 2011 and 2016 (released in 2019). As the only nationwide tree canopy layer, there is value in assessing NLCD-TC accuracy, given the need for cross-city comparisons of urban forest characteristics. Accuracy assessments have only been conducted for the 2001 data and suggest substantial inaccuracies for that dataset in cities. For the most recent NLCD-TC version, we used various datasets that characterize the built environment, weather, and climate to assess their accuracy in different contexts within 27 cities. Overall, NLCD underestimates tree canopy in urban areas by 9.9\% when compared to estimates derived from those high-resolution datasets. Underestimation is greater in higher-density urban areas (13.9\%) than in suburban areas (11.0\%) and undeveloped areas (6.4\%). To evaluate how NLCD-TC error in cities could be reduced, we developed a decision tree model that uses various remotely sensed and built-environment datasets such as building footprints, urban morphology types, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and surface temperature as explanatory variables. This predictive model removes bias and improves the accuracy of NLCD-TC by about 3\%. Finally, we show the potential applications of improved urban tree cover data through the examples of ecosystem accounting in Seattle, WA, and Denver, CO. The outputs of rainfall interception and urban heat mitigation models were highly sensitive to the choice of tree cover input data. Corrected data brought results closer to those from high-resolution model runs in all cases, with some variation by city, model, and ecosystem type. This suggests paths forward for improving the quality of urban environmental models that require tree canopy data as a key model input.},

Title = {Sensitivity analysis of a decision tree classification to input data errors using a general Monte Carlo error sensitivity model},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1433-1452},
Abstract = {We analysed the sensitivity of a decision tree derived forest type mapping to simulated data errors in input digital elevation model (DEM), geology and remotely sensed (Landsat Thematic Mapper) variables. We used a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation model coupled with a one-at-a-time approach. The DEM error was assumed to be spatially autocorrelated with its magnitude being a percentage of the elevation value. The error of categorical geology data was assumed to be positional and limited to boundary areas. The Landsat data error was assumed to be spatially random following a Gaussian distribution. Each layer was perturbed using its error model with increasing levels of error, and the effect on the forest type mapping was assessed. The results of the three sensitivity analyses were markedly different, with the classification being most sensitive to the DEM error, than to the Landsat data errors, but with only a limited sensitivity to the geology data error used. A linear increase in error resulted in non-linear increases in effect for the DEM and Landsat errors, while it was linear for geology. As an example, a DEM error of as small as +/- 2\% reduced the overall test accuracy by more than 2\%. More importantly, the same uncertainty level has caused nearly 10\% of the study area to change its initial class assignment at each perturbation, on average. A spatial assessment of the sensitivities indicates that most of the pixel changes occurred within those forest classes expected to be more sensitive to data error. In addition to characterising the effect of errors on forest type mapping using decision trees, this study has demonstrated the generality of employing Monte Carlo analysis for the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of categorical outputs that have distinctive characteristics from that of numerical outputs.},

Title = {Quantitative remote sensing of forest ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa's urban landscapes: a review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {194},

Abstract = {A dearth of information on urban ecosystem services in the past decades has led to little consolidation of such information for informed planning, decision-making and policy development in sub-Saharan African cities. However, the increasing recognition of the value of urban ecological processes and services as well as their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation has recently become an area of great research interest. Specifically, the emerging geospatial analytical approaches like remote sensing have led to an increase in the number of studies that seek to quantify and map urban ecosystem services at varying scales. Hence, this study sought to review the current remote sensing trends, challenges and prospects in quantifying urban ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa cities. Literature shows that consistent modelling and understanding of urban ecosystem services using remotely sensed approaches began in the 1990s, with an average of five publications per year after around 2010. This is mainly attributed to the approach's ability to provide fast, accurate and repeated spatial information necessary for optimal and timely quantification and mapping of urban ecosystem services. Although commercially available high spatial resolution sensors (e.g. the Worldview series, Quickbird and RapidEye) with higher spatial and spectral properties have been valuable in providing highly accurate and reliable data for quantification of urban ecosystem services, their adoption has been limited by high image acquisition cost and small spatial coverage that limits regional assessment. Thus, the newly launched sensors that provide freely and readily available data (i.e. Landsat 8 and 9 OLI, Sentinel-2) are increasingly becoming popular. These sensors provide data with improved spatial and spectral properties, hence valuable for past, current and future urban ecosystem service assessment, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the study provides guidance for future studies to continuously assess urban ecosystem services in order to achieve the objectives of Kyoto Protocol and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) of promoting climate-resilient and sustainable cities, especially in developing world.},

Abstract = {Satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) have been widely used for water resources management in China. An accurate ET product with a high spatiotemporal resolution is required for research on drought stress and water resources management. However, such a product is currently lacking. Moreover, the performances of different ET estimation algorithms for China have not been clearly studied, especially under different environmental conditions. Therefore, the aims of this study were as follows: (1) to use multisource images to generate a long-time-series (2001-2018) daily ET product with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); (2) to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the SEBAL ET in China using flux observational data and hydrological observational data; and (3) to compare the performance of the SEBAL ET with the MOD16 ET product at the point scale and basin scale under different environmental conditions in China. At the point scale, both the models performed best in the conditions of forest cover, subtropical zones, hilly terrain, or summer, respectively, and SEBAL performed better in most conditions. In general, the accuracy of the SEBAL ET (rRMSE = 44.91 \%) was slightly higher than that of the MOD16 ET (rRMSE = 48.72 \%). In the basin-scale validation, both the models performed better than in the point-scale validation, with SEBAL obtaining results superior (rRMSE = 13.57 \%) to MOD16 (rRMSE D 32.84 \%). Additionally, both the models showed a negative bias, with the bias of the MOD16 ET being higher than that of the SEBAL ET. In the daily-scale validation, the SEBAL ET product showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.92 mmd(-1) and an r value of 0.79. In general, the SEBAL ET product can be used for the qualitative analysis and most quantitative analyses of regional ET. The SEBAL ET product is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4243988 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4896147 (Cheng, 2020a, b). The results of this study can provide a reference for the application of remotely sensed ET products and the improvement of satellite ET observation algorithms.},

Abstract = {Ecologists need to develop tools that allow characterization of vegetation condition over scales that are pertinent to species' persistence and appropriate for management actions. Our study shows that stand condition can be mapped accurately over the floodplain of a major river system (ca 100,000 ha of forest over 1600 km of river)-the Murray River in southeastern Australia. It demonstrates the value of using quantitative ground surveys in conjunction with remotely sensed data to model vegetation condition over very large spatial domains. A comparison of four modelling methods found that stand condition was best modelled using the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) method (R (2) = 0.85), although there was little difference among the methods (R (2) = 0.77-0.85). However, a subsequent validation survey of condition at new locations showed that use of artificial neural networks had substantially higher predictive power (R (2) = 0.78) than the MARS model (R (2) = 0.28). This discrepancy demonstrates the value of using several modelling approaches to determine relationships among vegetation responses and environmental variables, and stresses the importance of validating ecological models with predictive surveys conducted after model building. The artificial neural network was used to produce a stand condition map for the whole floodplain, which predicted that only 30\% of the area containing Eucalyptus camaldulensis stands is currently in good condition. There is a downstream decline in stand condition, which is related to more extreme declines in flooding, due to water harvesting, and drier climate found in the Lower Murray region. Rigorous surveying and modelling approaches, such as those used here, are necessary if vegetation health is to be effectively monitored and managed.},

Title = {Analysis of remotely-sensed ecological indexes' influence on urban thermal environment dynamic using an integrated ecological index: a case study of Xi'an, China},

Abstract = {The spatio-temporal pattern of surface ecological status affects urban thermal environment distribution significantly. Urban thermal pattern, however, is a complicated physical phenomenon involving a series of terrestrial environmental parameters. Thus, it is insufficient to employ only one ecological parameter for depicting the variation of land surface temperature (LST). This paper begins with the analysis of four ecological parameters' influence on LST using regression analysis, based on 24 Landsat images which cover Xi'an of China from 1992 to 2014. These four parameters include greenness degree (i.e. the soil adjusted vegetation index, SAVI), soil moisture degree (i.e. the normalized difference moisture index, NDMI), dryness degree (i.e. the normalized difference soil index, NDSI) and resident aggregation degree (i.e. the normalized difference build-up index, NDBI). Besides, contribution intensity index was introduced to investigate the contribution effect of four ecological parameters on LST, and a new ecological index, integrated ecological index (IEI), was founded using the principal component analysis technique to integratedly represent its spatial and mathematical correlations with LST. Results indicate that four ecological parameters all possessed pronounced performance in impacting LST pattern in all dates: SAVI and NDMI were found to be correlated negatively with LST, whereas NDBI and NDSI correlated positively with LST. Additionally, SAVI had a profound impact on LST distribution compared with the other three parameters, and there was the biggest heating contribution in the lowest SAVI category. Further finding suggests that IEI as a new ecological index can be used to integratedly estimate the spatio-temporal change of LST, manifesting a negative correlation with LST. Our study thinks that the comprehensive characterization of surface ecological status is conducive to benefit us to better understand the spatio-temporal mechanism of thermal environment and ecosystem and to help urban decision-makers to execute effective conservation policies for the ecosystem.},

Title = {Using drones to detect and quantify wild pig damage and yield loss in corn fields throughout plant growth stages},
Journal = {WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Presently, there are an estimated 6.9 million wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the U.S., which cause over US\$1 billion in damage to agriculture, environmental impacts, and control costs. However, estimates of damage have varied widely, creating a need for standardized monitoring and a method to accurately estimate the economic costs of direct wild pig damage to agriculture. The goal of our study was to integrate remotely sensed imagery from drones and crop harvest data to quantify wild pig damage in corn fields. We used drones with natural color (red, green, blue) cameras to monitor corn fields at different growth stages in an agricultural matrix in Delta County, Texas, USA, during 2019-2020. We flew 36 drone missions and classified wild pig damage in 18 orthomosaics by a combination of manually digitizing and deep-learning algorithms. We compared estimates of damage from drone imagery to those derived from ground-based transect surveys, to verify pig damage. Finally, we compared damaged areas of fields to maps of collected real-time yields at harvest to estimate yield loss. All classified drone orthomosaics of pig damage had >80\% overall accuracy for all growth stages. Ground transect surveys, which subsampled 2.6-4.1\% of the field, were found to miss damage compared to the complete field coverage provided by drone imagery. Most damage occurred in latter growth stages, when corn ears were maturing, seed was most nutritious, and producers had already invested in the majority of annual crop inputs. Wild pigs damaged up to 9.2\% of a single monitored field, which resulted in a mean loss of 3,416 kg of corn/ha and a direct cost to producers of US\$17.18-48.24 per ha of damage. Drone imagery, when combined with spatially- explicit, harvest yield data, provides an accurate assessment of crop damage and yield loss due to wild pigs in the currency required for the cost-benefit evaluation of management actions.},

Title = {Web tools concerning performance analysis and planning support for solar energy plants starting from remotely sensed optical images},

Abstract = {We present innovative web tools, developed also in the frame of the FP7 ENDORSE (ENergy DOwnstReam SErvices) project, for the performance analysis and the support in planning of solar energy plants (PV, CSP, CPV). These services are based on the combination between the detailed physical model of each part of the plants and the near real-time satellite remote sensing of incident solar irradiance. Starting from the solar Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data provided by the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (GMES-MACC) Core Service and based on the elaboration of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite optical imagery, the Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) or the Beam Normal Irradiance (BNI) incident on plant's solar PV panels (or solar receivers for CSP or CPV) is calculated. Combining these parameters with the model of the solar power plant using also air temperature values, we can assess in near-real-time the daily evolution of the alternate current (AC) power produced by the plant. We are therefore able to compare this satellite-based AC power yield with the actually measured one and, consequently, to readily detect any possible malfunctions and to evaluate the performances of the plant (so-called ``Controller{''} service). Besides, the same method can be applied to satellite-based averaged environmental data (solar irradiance and air temperature) in order to provide a Return on Investment analysis in support to the planning of new solar energy plants (so-called ``Planner{''} service). This method has been successfully applied to three test solar plants (in North, Centre and South Italy respectively) and it has been validated by comparing satellite-based and in-situ measured hourly AC power data for several months in 2013 and 2014. The results show a good accuracy: the overall Normalized Bias (NB) is -0.41\%, the overall Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) is 4.90\%, the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) is 7.66\% and the overall Correlation Coefficient (CC) is 0.9538. The maximum value of the Normalized Absolute Error (NAB) is about 30\% and occurs for time periods with highly variable meteorological conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The ocean is a dynamic environment inhabited by a diverse array of highly migratory species, many of which are under direct exploitation in targeted fisheries. The timescales of variability in the marine realm coupled with the extreme mobility of ocean-wandering species such as tuna and billfish complicates fisheries management. Developing eco-informatics solutions that allow for near real-time prediction of the distributions of highly mobile marine species is an important step towards the maturation of dynamic ocean management and ecological forecasting. Using 25 yr (1990-2014) of NOAA fisheries' observer data from the California drift gillnet fishery, we model relative probability of occurrence (presence-absence) and catchability (total catch per gillnet set) of broadbill swordfish Xiphias gladius in the California Current System. Using freely available environmental data sets and open source software, we explore the physical drivers of regional swordfish distribution. Comparing models built upon remotely sensed data sets with those built upon a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), we explore trade-offs in model construction, and address how physical data can affect predictive performance and operational capacity. Swordfish catchability was found to be highest in deeper waters (>1,500m) with surface temperatures in the 14-20 degrees C range, isothermal layer depth (ILD) of 20-40 m, positive sea surface height (SSH) anomalies, and during the new moon (<20\% lunar illumination). We observed a greater influence of mesoscale variability (SSH, wind speed, isothermal layer depth, eddy kinetic energy) in driving swordfish catchability (total catch) than was evident in predicting the relative probability of presence (presence-absence), confirming the utility of generating spatiotemporally dynamic predictions. Data-assimilative ROMS circumvent the limitations of satellite remote sensing in providing physical data fields for species distribution models (e.g., cloud cover, variable resolution, subsurface data), and facilitate broad-scale prediction of dynamic species distributions in near real time.},

Abstract = {Crop management modifies the structure and functioning of the ecosystems. C dynamics has been identified as a key intermediate or support ecosystem service that is profoundly altered by agricultural practices. The temperate grasslands of Argentina, the Pampas, are one of the main crop production regions of the world. Crop sequence, tillage and fertilization change inputs and outputs and, consequently the whole C dynamics. Our objectives in this article were (i) to provide a spatially explicit characterization, based on remotely sensed data, of crop sequences and tillage systems in the Rolling Pampas, (ii) to evaluate changes in C gains by computing the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) from NDVI data of different crop, (iii) to evaluate the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance of different management schemes (crop sequence, conventional tillage vs. no till and three levels of nitrogen fertilization) using the CENTURY model, and (iv) to estimate the changes in SOC at a regional level. The results showed that 54\% of the area was under continuous agriculture, with only two crop rotations occupying 61\% of the area, and the main tillage system was no-tillage (73\% of the area analyzed). Annual APAR was lower in crops than in rangelands, except for wheat-soybean double crop. Based on CENTURY simulations the crop management which had a most negative SOC balance (SOC reference value (100\%) = 79 t ha(-1)) was crop sequence ``maize/soybean{''} under conventional tillage and with no fertilizer application (37\% losses of SOC in 60 years). The management that presented the most positive SOC balance was ``soybean/wheat-soybean double crop (6 years) pasture (4 years){''} under no till and with high fertilization (10\% increase of SOC in 60 years). A positive and linear relationship was found between APAR estimates derived from satellite data and simulated SOC providing basis for a quantitative hypothesis on the importance of C inputs on SOC's dynamics. At regional scale, if crop sequences proportions remain constant, the lost of SOC would average a 15\% in 60 years. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of seasonal shifts in abundance of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in a tropical island environment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Background Non-native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) threaten sensitive flora and fauna, cost billions of dollars in economic damage, and pose a significant human-wildlife conflict risk. Despite growing interest in wild pig research, basic life history information is often lacking throughout their introduced range and particularly in tropical environments. Similar to other large terrestrial mammals, pigs possess the ability to shift their range based on local climatic conditions or resource availability, further complicating management decisions. The objectives of this study were to (i) model the distribution and abundance of wild pigs across two seasons within a single calendar year; (ii) determine the most important environmental variables driving changes in pig distribution and abundance; and (iii) highlight key differences between seasonal models and their potential management implications. These study objectives were achieved using zero-inflated models constructed from abundance data obtained from extensive field surveys and remotely sensed environmental variables. Results Our models demonstrate a considerable change in distribution and abundance of wild pigs throughout a single calendar year. Rainfall and vegetation height were among the most influential variables for pig distribution during the spring, and distance to adjacent forest and vegetation density were among the most significant for the fall. Further, our seasonal models show that areas of high conservation value may be more vulnerable to threats from wild pigs at certain times throughout the year, which was not captured by more traditional modeling approaches using aggregated data. Conclusions Our results suggest that (i) wild pigs can considerably shift their range throughout the calendar year, even in tropical environments; (ii) pigs prefer dense forested areas in the presence of either hunting pressure or an abundance of frugivorous plants, but may shift to adjacent areas in the absence of either of these conditions; and (iii) seasonal models provide valuable biological information that would otherwise be missed by common modeling approaches that use aggregated data over many years. These findings highlight the importance of considering biologically relevant time scales that provide key information to better inform management strategies, particularly for species whose ranges include both temperate and tropical environments and thrive in both large continental and small island ecosystems.},

Title = {How does dune morphology shape coastal EC habitats occurrence? A remote sensing approach using airborne LiDAR on the Mediterranean coast},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {618-626},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We examined the relationship between coastal habitats (sensu European Union Habitats Directive) and local dune morphology along a Mediterranean coastal dune system by integrating field collected vegetation data and remotely sensed imagery. Specifically, we described the morphological profile of each EC habitat based on the morphological variables that are most likely to affect their occurrence, including elevation, slope, curvature, northness, eastness and sea distance. In addition, we assessed the role and strength of each morphological variable in determining the occurrence of EC habitats. We used 394 random vegetation plots representative of six EC habitats (Habitat 1210: ``Annual vegetation of drift lines{''}; Habitat 2110: ``Embryonic shifting dunes{''}; Habitat 2120: ``Shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria{''}; Habitat 2210 and 2230: ``Crucianellion maritimae fixed beach dunes{''} and ``Malcolmietalia dune grasslands{''}; Habitat 2250: ``Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp.{''}; Habitat 2260: ``Cisto-Lavanduletalia dune sclerophyllous scrubs{''}) found along the Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy. We derived each morphological variable from a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) obtained from 2-m resolution LiDAR (Light Detection And Range) images. The mean value of each variable was calculated at different spatial scales using buffer areas of increasing radius (2 m, 4 m, 8 m) around each vegetation plot. Mean morphological values for each EC habitat were compared using Kruskal-Wallis rank test. The role and strength of the relationship between habitat type and the morphological variables were assessed using Generalized Linear Models. EC habitats occur differentially across dune morphology, and the role and strength of each morphological variable define habitat specificity. Dune elevation and sea distance were determined to be the key factors in shaping EC habitat occurrence along this section of the Mediterranean coast. Identification of the close relationship between habitat type and morphological variables deriving from airborne LiDAR imagery points to the high potential of such remote sensing tool for analyzing and monitoring the integrity of coastal dune ecosystems. As airborne LiDAR enables the rapid collection of extremely accurate topographic data over large areas, it also offers useful information for the management of these threatened and fragile ecosystems.

Title = {Urban Land Use and Land Cover Classification Using Multisource Remote Sensing Images and Social Media Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Land use and land cover (LULC) are diverse and complex in urban areas. Remotely sensed images are commonly used for land cover classification but hardly identifies urban land use and functional areas because of the semantic gap (i.e., different definitions of similar or identical buildings). Social media data, ``marks{''} left by people using mobile phones, have great potential to overcome this semantic gap. Multisource remote sensing data are also expected to be useful in distinguishing different LULC types. This study examined the capability of combined multisource remote sensing images and social media data in urban LULC classification. Multisource remote sensing images included a Chinese ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) high-resolution image, a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral image, and a Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. Social media data consisted of the hourly spatial distribution of WeChat users, which is a ubiquitous messaging and payment platform in China. LULC was classified into 10 types, namely, vegetation, bare land, road, water, urban village, greenhouses, residential, commercial, industrial, and educational buildings. A method that integrates object-based image analysis, decision trees, and random forests was used for LULC classification. The overall accuracy and kappa value attained by the combination of multisource remote sensing images and WeChat data were 87.55\% and 0.84, respectively. They further improved to 91.55\% and 0.89, respectively, by integrating the textural and spatial features extracted from the ZY-3 image. The ZY-3 high-resolution image was essential for urban LULC classification because it is necessary for the accurate delineation of land parcels. The addition of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-1A SAR, or WeChat data also made an irreplaceable contribution to the classification of different LULC types. The Landsat 8 OLI image helped distinguish between the urban village, residential buildings, commercial buildings, and roads, while the Sentinel-1A SAR data reduced the confusion between commercial buildings, greenhouses, and water. Rendering the spatial and temporal dynamics of population density, the WeChat data improved the classification accuracies of an urban village, greenhouses, and commercial buildings.},

Abstract = {Urban sprawl (US), propelled by rapid population growth leads to the shrinkage of productive agricultural lands and pristine forests in the suburban areas and, in turn, adversely affects the provision of ecosystem services. The quantification of US is thus crucial for effective urban planning and environmental management. Like many megacities in fast growing developing countries, Chennai, the capital of Tamilnadu and one of the business hubs in India, has experienced extensive US triggered by the doubling of total population over the past three decades. However, the extent and level of US has not yet been quantified and a prediction for future extent of US is lacking. We employed the Random Forest (RF) classification on Landsat imageries from 1991, 2003, and 2016, and computed six landscape metrics to delineate the extent of urban areas within a 10 km suburban buffer of Chennai. The level of US was then quantified using Renyi's entropy. A land change model was subsequently used to project land cover for 2027. A 70.35\% expansion in urban areas was observed mainly towards the suburban periphery of Chennai between 1991 and 2016. The Renyi's entropy value for year 2016 was 0.9, exhibiting a two-fold level of US when compared to 1991. The spatial metrics values indicate that the existing urban areas became denser and the suburban agricultural, forests and particularly barren lands were transformed into fragmented urban settlements. The forecasted land cover for 2027 indicates a conversion of 13,670.33 ha (16.57\% of the total landscape) of existing forests and agricultural lands into urban areas with an associated increase in the entropy value to 1.7, indicating a tremendous level of US. Our study provides useful metrics for urban planning authorities to address the social-ecological consequences of US and to protect ecosystem services.},

Title = {Monitoring vegetation change and dynamics on US Army training lands using satellite image time series analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Given the significant land holdings of the U.S. Department of Defense, and the importance of those lands to support a variety of inherently damaging activities, application of sound natural resource conservation principles and proactive monitoring practices are necessary to manage military training lands in a sustainable manner. This study explores a method for, and the utility of, analyzing vegetation condition and trends as sustainability indicators for use by military commanders and land managers, at both the national and local levels, in identifying when and where vegetation-related environmental impacts might exist. The BFAST time series decomposition method was applied to a ten-year MODIS NDVI time series dataset for the Fort Riley military installation and Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in northeastern Kansas. Imagery selected for time-series analysis were 16-day MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1 Collection 5) composites capable of characterizing vegetation change induced by human activities and climate variability. Three indicators related to gradual interannual or abrupt intraannual vegetation change for each pixel were calculated from the trend component resulting from the BFAST decomposition. Assessment of gradual interannual NDVI trends showed the majority of Fort Riley experienced browning between 2001 and 2010. This result is supported by validation using high spatial resolution imagery. The observed versus expected frequency of linear trends detected at Fort Riley and KPBS were significantly different and suggest a causal link between military training activities and/or land management practices. While both sites were similar with regards to overall disturbance frequency and the relative spatial extents of monotonic or interrupted trends, vegetation trajectories after disturbance were significantly different. This suggests that the type and magnitude of disturbances characteristic of each location result in distinct post-disturbance vegetation responses. Using a remotely-sensed vegetation index time series with BFAST and the indicators outlined here provides a consistent and relatively rapid assessment of military training lands with applicability outside of grassland biomes. Characterizing overall trends and disturbance responses of vegetation can promote sustainable use of military lands and assist land managers in targeting specific areas for various rehabilitation activities.

Title = {Analysis of support vector machine and maximum likelihood classifiers in land cover classification using Sentinel-2 images},

Abstract = {Remote sensing data has been widely applied to classify the land cover more frequently and on a near real-time basis for updating as it is more economic, less time consuming compared to ground based survey. Accurate classification of the land use/cover classes such as water body, cropland, built-up area, scrub land, fallow land, forest etc., is one of the biggest challenges in natural resource inventory, management and monitoring. As accuracy of remote sensing data classification is affected by many parameters which include type of data, presence of heterogeneous landscapes in study area, classification approaches etc., as satellite imagery is complex in nature. Many classifiers have been developed and tested on remotely sensed data for better classification. Classification of remote sensing data is mainly divided into two categories such as supervised and unsupervised. In supervised classification, the decision boundaries in feature space are determined by training the samples. Two supervised classifiers namely maximum likelihood (ML) classifier, which is a parametric classifier that assumes data to be normally distributed, and support vector machine classifier (SVM) which is a non-parametric classifier are used in classification. In the present study, the accuracy of these two classifiers is studied on five different data sets of Sentinel-2 satellite image of different years and sessions to accommodate intra and inter annual variations of the datasets. Sentinel-2 satellite images covering part of Nagpur, located in Maharashtra, India were used for the classification. Classifier accuracy has been calculated using overall accuracy and kappa statistics based on ground truth information. The result obtained were carefully examined by comparing classification accuracies and then by visual analysis. The result shows that SVM classifiers gives better overall accuracy and kappa coefficients and its average value for intra and inter annual classification outputs were 91.78\% and 0.89 in that order which is far better than ML classifier which gave 87.07\% and 0.83 respectively. The experimental results obtained from the present study, it is clear that SVM classifier produced better accuracy than ML classifier in classifying Sentinel-2 optical image and have significant potential in classifying various land cover classes in the heterogeneous land use/land cover conditions of the tropical regime.},

Title = {Sustainable Food Supply by Peri-Urban Diversified Farms of the Agri-Food Region of Central Cordoba, Argentina},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Peri-urban vegetable cropping areas, such as horticultural farms, provide several ecosystem services, such as the provision of fresh food. However, food supply must be estimated on the basis of the current and potential demand of future populations, taking into account the landscape carrying capacity towards sustainable agricultural planning. From this perspective, the study aimed at estimating the resilience of the ``Agri-food Region of Central Cordoba{''} (ARCC) and its role in supporting the provisioning of ecosystem services, such as proximal services, provided by the diversified agricultural landscape in the peri-urban area of Cordoba (Argentina). A direct field survey has been carried out to collect data on the main species and types of crops, the annual productivity, and the area covered by each species and type of horticultural crops. The data have been statistically elaborated to test the spatial and temporal variability of productivity as well as the spatial autocorrelation. In relation to crop diversification, a total of 30 vegetable species have been recorded in the diversified farms under study, with 15 species identified as the most frequent crops as on the basis of the area dedicated to each vegetable species sampled in the farms (in \%). The productivity of 30 species has been integrated into a single value of ``vegetable crop productivity mean{''} (kg/m(2)), proposed and measured in this study, which has been 3.46 kg/m(2). It can be a useful monitoring indicator in diversified production contexts. The estimated food supply (ton/year) of vegetable crops for the 170 farmlands has been 72,881 ton/year. An accurate measurement of the biomass harvested on a given surface area can be useful to assign productivity data to the pixel of each land use/cover class, providing accurate input data for remotely sensed-based models supporting decision-making on food provision in peri-urban systems. In this sense, the paper proposes a methodological framework that can be useful worldwide when up-to-date official productivity data are not available, but they are a necessary basis for planning, decision-making, and the implementation of public policies. Thus, diversity in farming systems can combine high ecological and socio-economic benefits, in terms of ecosystem service provision and sustainable food production.},

Abstract = {Application of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS)as a tool has assumed an immense significance in habitat suitability modelling for various wildlife species and now a days these are widely used in conservation biology and wildlife management. This paper evaluates habitat suitability for tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Chandoli National Park, India. This research provides information about potential areas that can be declared as Tiger Reserve, a federal designation of protection. Habitat evaluation was completed in the Chandoli National Park (17 degrees 04' 00 `' N to 17 degrees 19' 54 `' N and 73 degrees 40' 43 `' E to 73 degrees 53' 09 `' E) using habitat suitability index (HSI). Remotely sensed data of satellite IRS-P6, LISS-III of 25th February 2005 was procured from National Remote Sensing Agency, India. The satellite imagery data was digitally processed and collateral data were generated from topographic maps in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as landuse land cover, forest density, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created based on ground truthing. These layers, GPS location of animal's presence and ``binomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR){''} techniques were integrated in a GIS environment for the HSI modelling. Results indicate that approximately 160.48 km(2) (55\%) of the forest of Chandoli National Park is highly suitable for herbivores population, and 176.52 km(2) (50\%) of the Park is suitable for tigers. Therefore, this study concludes that forest areas within the Chandoli National Park are appropriate for consideration as Tiger Reserve. Furthermore, the identification and mapping of wildlife corridors and other forest patches lying in between neighboring protected area like Koyana sanctuary, suggests that these region of Sahyadri range of Western Chats should be included into the proposed Tiger Reserve. This will be a benefit for tigers, as tigers require larger and least disturbed forest habitats for establishing and maintaining their high-density population. Fortunately, in May 2008 the Government of India declared Chandoli NP as tiger reserve. Thus declaration of Chandoli National Park as a Tiger Reserve reflects that the habitat suitability model developed by us for tiger was not only statistically sound but also has potential to be considered while taking any decision regarding wildlife habitat management.

Title = {Linking random forest and auxiliary factors for extracting the major economic forests in the mountainous areas of southwestern Yunnan Province, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Forests are generally extracted from remotely sensed images based on the spectral features, ignoring other important auxiliary information, and the techniques of precise extraction need to be further improved. By using the Sentinel-2 image and auxiliary factors (AFs) including site conditions (SCs) and vegetation indices (VIs), the random forest model with AFs (RF-AFs) was adopted for the extraction of the economic forests in Lancang County, which is a mountainous area with rich biodiversity and is witnessing rapid development of economic forests in Yunnan province of China. The results obtained using the RF-AFs model were compared with those obtained using the random forest model without AFs (RF). The results were as follows: (1) The kappa coefficient for extracting the first-level land use obtained using the RF model was 0.9531. Lancang County is dominated by forests, accounting for 73.76\% of the total area. (2) After parameter optimization, the RF-AFs model yielded the highest accuracy in the extraction of the second-level forests, with a kappa coefficient value of 0.9493, which was 14.69\% higher than that of the RF model. Thus, the RF-AFs model is more suitable for the precise extraction of economic forests. (3) The evaluation results of the factors' importance of the RF-AFs model showed that the cumulative importance values of SCs such as temperature (TEM), elevation (EL), precipitation (PRE) and VIs such as plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI) was 76.09\%, indicating that they were the main factors for the extraction of economic forests. (4) Economic forests are dominated by Simao pines in Lancang County, which are mainly distributed in the central, southwestern and northern regions, accounting for 31.37\% of forests area. The proportion of tea plantations, eucalyptus, and rubber trees is 9.05\%, 6.71\%, and 3.05\% of forests area, respectively. The RF-AFs model is conducive for precisely extracting the economic forests and is thus of great significance in studying the ecological and environmental effects of economic forests, performing forestry management, and maintaining regional ecological security.},

Title = {Accuracy comparison of remotely sensed evapotranspiration products and their associated water stress footprints under different land cover types in Korean peninsula},

Abstract = {Robust spatial information of evapotranspiration from multiple land cover types is deemed critical for several applications in agriculture and water balance studies. Energy balance models, used in association with satellite observations, are beneficial to map spatial variability of evapotranspiration which is mainly governed by different vegetation practices and local environmental conditions. This study utilize the Surface Energy Balance System model to estimate actual evapotranspiration and water scarcity footprints under complex landscape of Korean peninsula using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data for a complete hydrological year of 2012. The modeled evapotranspiration was compared with flux tower measurements obtained from a subhumid cropland and temperate forest sites for the accuracy assessment. This accuracy comparison at daily scale had good agreement yielding reasonable coefficient of determination (0.72, 0.51), bias (0.41 mm day(-1), 1.01 mm day(-1)) and root mean squared error (0.92 mm day(-1), 1.53 mm day(-1)) at two observation (cropland, forest) sites, respectively. Furthermore, the monthly aggregated evapotranspiration from Surface Energy Balance System showed promising results than those of obtained from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer based readymade global evapotranspiration product, i.e., MOD16, when both products were compared with unclosed and closed flux tower measurements. However, the variations in monthly evapotranspiration obtained from both products were significantly controlled by several climate factors and vegetation characteristics. Water stress mapping at regional and monthly scale also revealed strong contrast between the products of two approaches. Highest mean water stress (0.74) was observed for land use areas associated with evergreen forest and under sparsely vegetation condition by using estimated evapotranspiration from Surface Energy Balance System while an extreme mean water stress value of 0.56 by using end product of MOD16 evapotranspiration was raised from cropland regions. Overall, this study revealed the performance and suitability of two distinctive remote sensing approaches for characterizing the footprints of water fluxes in the Korean peninsula and provides a baseline for the policy makers to setup the sustainable use of existing water resources in this and other similar regions.

Title = {Identifying and mapping individual plants in a highly diverse high-elevation ecosystem using UAV imagery and deep learning},

Abstract = {The identification and counting of plant individuals is essential for environmental monitoring. UAV based imagery offer ultra-fine spatial resolution and flexibility in data acquisition, and so provide a great opportunity to enhance current plant and in-situ field surveying. However, accurate mapping of individual plants from UAV imagery remains challenging, given the great variation in the sizes and geometries of individual plants and in their distribution. This is true even for deep learning based semantic segmentation and classification methods. In this research, a novel Scale Sequence Residual U-Net (SS Res U-Net) deep learning method was proposed, which integrates a set of Residual U-Nets with a sequence of input scales that can be derived automatically. The SS Res U-Net classifies individual plants by continuously increasing the patch scale, with features learned at small scales passing gradually to larger scales, thus, achieving multi-scale information fusion while retaining fine spatial details of interest. The SS Res U-Net was tested to identify and map frailejones (all plant species of the subtribe Espeletiinae), the dominant plants in one of the world's most biodiverse high-elevation ecosystems (i.e. the paramos) from UAV imagery. Results demonstrate that the SS Res U-Net has the ability to self-adapt to variation in objects, and consistently achieved the highest classification accuracy (91.67\% on average) compared with four state-of-the-art benchmark approaches. In addition, SS Res U-Net produced the best performances in terms of both robustness to training sample size reduction and computational efficiency compared with the benchmarks. Thus, SS Res U-Net shows great promise for solving remotely sensed semantic segmentation and classification tasks, and more general machine intelligence. The prospective implementation of this method to identify and map frailejones in the paramos will benefit immensely the monitoring of their populations for conservation assessments and management, among many other applications.},

Title = {Continuous and Synoptic Assessment of Indian Inland Waters for Harmful Algae Blooms},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs) are progressively becoming a major water quality, socioeconomic, and health hazard worldwide. In India, there are frequent episodes of severe CyanoHABs, which are left untreated due to a lack of awareness and monitoring infrastructure, affecting the economy of the country gravely. In this study, for the first time, we present a country-wide analysis of CyanoHABs in India by developing a novel interactive cloud-based dashboard called ``CyanoKhoj{''} in Google Earth Engine (GEE) which uses Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) remotely sensed datasets. The main goal of this study was to showcase the utility of CyanoKhoj for rapid monitoring and discuss the widespread CyanoHABs problems across India. We demonstrate the utility of Cyanokhoj by including select case studies of lakes and reservoirs geographically spread across five states: Bargi and Gandhisagar Dams in Madhya Pradesh, Hirakud Reservoir in Odisha, Ukai Dam in Gujarat, Linganamakki Reservoir in Karnataka, and Pulicat Lake in Tamil Nadu. These sites were studied from September to November 2018 using CyanoKhoj, which is capable of near-real-time monitoring and country-wide assessment of CyanoHABs. We used CyanoKhoj to prepare spatiotemporal maps of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content and Cyanobacterial Cell Density (CCD) to study the local spread of the CyanoHABs and their phenology in these waterbodies. A first-ever all-India CCD map is also presented for the year 2018, which highlights the spatial spread of CyanoHABs throughout the country (32 large waterbodies across India with severe bloom: CCD>2,500,000). Results indicate that CyanoHABs are most prevalent in nutrient-rich waterbodies prone to industrial and other nutrient-rich discharges. A clear temporal evolution of the blooms showed that they are dominant during the post-monsoon season (September-October) when the nutrient concentrations in the waterbodies are at their peak, and they begin to decline towards winter (NovemberDecember). CyanoKhoj is an open-source tool that can have a significant broader impact in mapping CyanoHABs not only throughout cyanobacteria data-scarce India, but on a global level using archived and future Sentinel3A/B OLCI data.},

Title = {Vegetative response to water availability on the San Carlos Apache Reservation},

Abstract = {On the San Carlos Apache Reservation in east-central Arizona, U.S.A., vegetation types such as ponderosa pine forests, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and grasslands have significant ecological, cultural, and economic value for the Tribe. This value extends beyond the tribal lands and across the Western United States. Vegetation across the Southwestern United States is susceptible to drought conditions and fluctuating water availability. Remotely sensed vegetation indices can be used to measure and monitor spatial and temporal vegetative response to fluctuating water availability conditions. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index II (MSAVI(2)) to measure the condition of three dominant vegetation types (ponderosa pine forest, woodland, and grassland) in response to two fluctuating environmental variables: precipitation and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The study period covered 2002 through 2014 and focused on a region within the San Carlos Apache Reservation. We determined that grassland and woodland had a similar moderate to strong, year-round, positive relationship with precipitation as well as with summer SPEI. This suggests that these vegetation types respond negatively to drought conditions and are more susceptible to initial precipitation deficits. Ponderosa pine forest had a comparatively weaker relationship with monthly precipitation and summer SPEI, indicating that it is more buffered against short-term drought conditions. This research highlights the response of multiple, dominant vegetation types to seasonal and inter-annual water availability. This research demonstrates that multi-temporal remote sensing imagery can be an effective tool for the large scale detection of vegetation response to adverse impacts from climate change and support potential management practices such as increased monitoring and management of drought affected areas. Different vegetation types displayed various responses to water availability, further highlighting the need for individual management plans for forest and woodland, especially considering the projected drier conditions in the Southwest U.S. and other arid or semi-arid regions around the world.

Journal = {PHYTOCOENOLOGIA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {48},

Pages = {23-50},
Abstract = {Aim: The social-ecological systems of south east Angola currently undergo rapid transformations and at the same time the region is highly understudied. We aim to provide a first comprehensive analysis of vegetation types, their environmental drivers and woody species diversity of the region. Study area: Cubango River Basin in south-east Angola and northern Namibia. Methods: We conducted a plot-based vegetation survey covering all major terrestrial vegetation types. 190 releves of 1000 m(2) were classified based on a numerical classification approach. We used NMDS ordination and data on soils from field sampling, topography, climate and remotely sensed land surface phenology to investigate vegetation-environment relationships. The number of woody species was estimated using four non-parametric species richness estimators and rarefaction curves. Results: We provided a detailed description of the resulting twelve woody plant communities, in terms of species composition, structure, and habitat characteristics. At the scale of the Cubango Basin, differences in the regional climate were the most important drivers of plant species composition. Topsoil properties did not vary much throughout the study area, but higher contents of silt and clay in the lower soil horizons appeared to drive species composition in the miombo woodlands. Furthermore, we demonstrated how the usage of land surface phenology metrics add value to the interpretation of ecological properties of plant communities in providing insights on the timing of the growing season and on different aspects of above-ground biomass. The number of woody species in the entire Cubango Basin was estimated to be 471 (SD=29) species, for the miombo woodlands 302 (SD=11) species, and for the Baikiaea woodlands 262 (SD=20) species. Conclusion: The presented classification scheme and the analysis of environmental drivers of vegetation types provide a solid basis for future investigations of the vegetation of southeast Angola, and will provide important baseline data for conservation planning and sustainable natural resource management.},

Abstract = {Selective logging is a forestry activity that includes harvesting a group of tree species in native forests, usually those of higher value or commercial interest. Selective logging can be carried out legally, in forest management areas and forest areas previously authorized for deforestation, or illegally, in any other unauthorized cases that occur in a predatory manner. In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamic of selectively logged forests in the state of Mato Grosso was assessed based on a time-series (from 1992 to 2016) of logged forests detected using remotely sensed data. Visual interpretation and semi-automatic classification of Landsat imagery were used to detect forests impacted by selective logging activities in the study area. Based on the results, it was estimated that 41,926 km(2) of native forests were selectively logged at least once between 1992 and 2016 in the state of Mato Grosso, an annual average of 1,747 km(2). Selectively logged forests detected showing persistent or recurrent forest disturbances were more frequently observed in the most recent years of this analysis. Most of the selectively logged forests in the study area and period have not been deforested by 2016. It indicates that selective logging is a dissociated phenomenon with deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso. It was also observed that an average of 18 km(2).year(-1) and 268.18 km(2).year(-1) of native forests was selectively logged within Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands between 1992 and 2016. A significant tendency to increase or decrease logging activities within those protected areas in the analyzed period was not observed. Selectively logged forests were persistently detected in the old timber centers located in the central-northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, showing, potentially, new cutting cycles in those previously logged forests. More recently, selective logging activities have reached the last native forest frontier in northwestern Mato Grosso. Finally, it was concluded that selective logging is annually disturbing a considerable extension of native forests in the state of Mato Grosso and, therefore, needs to be adequately considered and monitored by environmental agencies due to its potential forest impacts and to support the definition of public policies to ensure the future sustainability of forest production in that state.},

Abstract = {The mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa) is notably the most primitive North American rodent with a restricted distribution in the Pacific Northwest based on its physiological limits to heat stress and water needs. The Point Arena subspecies (A. r. nigra) is federally listed as endangered and is 1 of 2 subspecies that have extremely small and disjunct distributions, putting the taxon at risk from habitat loss and warming global temperatures. We sought to understand their range-wide distribution, to predict the environmental features that best describe their occurrence, and to establish a foundation for monitoring their distribution. We randomly sampled the occurrence of Point Arena mountain beavers (PAMB) from the portion of their geographic range that was accessible (public lands plus private lands where permission was granted). We surveyed 127, 25-ha sample units for their distinctive burrows and estimated the probability of detecting burrows, if they were present, at >90\% per visit. Using this information, we estimated occupancy across the accessible portion of the range to be 26.2\%. Range-wide estimates of occupancy, combined with strategically selected locations where abundance and survival can be estimated noninvasively, may comprise a realistic monitoring program for this taxon. We also used the detection and nondetection locations to develop a habitat suitability model by relating these locations to remotely sensed predictors. We evaluated 53 a priori candidate habitat suitability models and the best-fitting model included gentle slopes, low terrain roughness indices, and the high density of rivers and streams. Selecting the probability value that best separated the sample units into suitable and nonsuitable habitat, we estimated a total of 70.5 km(2) of suitable habit, or approximately 40.4\% of the original geographic range. New detections significantly expanded the known geographic range, moderating concerns about habitat loss, including that predicted by climate change. A substantial number of suitable areas were predicted to occur outside the current range. The identification of high suitability areas allows management agencies to prioritize areas for PAMB conservation planning, evaluate human impacts on habitat, and evaluate how a changing climate may affect distribution.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the need for geospatial information technologies in developing countries to support sustainable development. One of the major issues facing many developing countries is the need for better utilization and protection of their natural resources. In the world's industrialized nations remote sensing and GIS technologies are used in many applications that include, but not limited to, natural resources management and protection, environmental monitoring, agriculture, geology, hydrology and water resource management, disaster management, urban planning, monitoring spread of infectious diseases, and marine studies. These nations have made heavy investment in building and deploying space assets to monitor earth resources. However, very little has been done to promote the leveraging of this investment in technology by developing countries. There are far reaching benefits to these emerging economies through the exploitation of this technology. Not only could they be forewarned about natural disasters to minimize loss of life and property, but, they could use it to enhance their country's critical food supply and water resources and even develop an effective natural resource exploitation (e.g. oil and gas) capability. These capabilities will allow developing countries to become more self-reliant and less dependent on other countries and international aid agencies. Remote sensing and GIS technologies can be transferred to developing countries for implementation of large-scale and national GIS systems. Such systems will integrate advanced computing platforms, high-speed networks, high performance image processing and GIS products, sophisticated data capturing devices, state-of-the-art product generation equipment, and robust archival and dissemination elements. A variety of remotely sensed data (multi-temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution), geospatial, and in-situ data will be integrated to generate value-added products, extract thematic/spatial features, and derive information to support operational governmental applications and decision-making When fully implemented, a national GIs system will revolutionize public and private sector practices through modernization of records and computerization of services. This technological revolution will significantly contribute to the continual economic and technological advancement. Through such a system, government officials will be provided with reliable, accurate, current data and automated tools to make informed decisions, formulate sound polices, and implement sensible short-term and long-term plans to properly allocate and manage resources. As a result, citizens of developing countries will realize higher standards of living and a wide-range of socioeconomic benefits.},

Title = {Precision agriculture on grassland: Applications, perspectives and constraints},

Abstract = {Precision agriculture (PA) is an innovative, integrated and internationally standardized approach aiming to increase the efficiency of resource use and to reduce the uncertainty of decisions required to control variation on farms. Worldwide, investments in research and technology on PA have considerably increased during the past decades. Advances in agricultural research, combined with application of PA on grasslands, could provide major economic and environmental benefits. However, most of the available technology is currently being applied on arable land but not on grassland although the latter contributes substantially to agricultural land use as well as to capital and income. The authors hypothesise that heterogeneity of grassland among and within fields is a major constraint to PA application and that understanding such heterogeneity would enable to implement PA where competitive and cost efficient. In this paper, current developments and future perspectives of digital image processing, remote sensing, yield measurement, and site-specific management on grassland are discussed. At fine scales, on-board sensors can provide information on sward properties that application techniques could respond to. At larger scales, remotely sensed information can provide digital maps of type and status of vegetation that allow a precise management, although the mix of spatial coverage and spatial resolution is not yet ideal. The site-specific management on arable land, however, has not yet proven its applicability in different environments. On grassland, some of these technologies are either already implemented as prototypes into research projects or under development with a short-term perspective to be introduced into practice. Grassland scientists can significantly contribute to the current development and, in return, benefit from latest sensor technology and so enable rapid data acquisition and improvement of experimentation and knowledge. Also existing computer simulation models can contribute to make PA on grassland a success. Animal husbandry is strongly linked to grassland utilization and can also benefit from present PA technology through animal production and health control and animal guidance with appropriate electronic stimuli. Considerable interdisciplinary research is required to link existing knowledge on PA technology with grassland science and with animal science. This could mainly be accomplished by the interpretation of signal-object interaction that is needed to set up suitable configurations on grassland. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessment of land use and land cover changes and valuation of carbon stocks in the Sergipe semiarid region, Brazil: 1992-2030},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Abstract = {The semiarid region in the state of Sergipe, Brazil, approximately 11,000 km(2), has experienced high deforestation rates in the last decades, which ultimately contribute to global climatic changes. The valuation of ecosystem services of CO2 sequestration can support definition of environmental policies to decrease deforestation in that region. This study aimed to assess land use and land cover changes in the Sergipe semiarid region between 1992 and 2017 by applying remotely sensed data and technics; simulate the land use and land cover changes between 2017 and 2030 by applying a cellular automaton model, by assuming current land use trends (Business as Usual - BAU) as a reference scenario, and a more conservative scenario (Protected Forest - PF), in which was assumed an effective enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Code established in 2012; simulate the carbon stocks by 2017 assuming the BAU and PF scenarios by 2030, and estimate the Carbon balance between the 2030 and 2017 scenarios; and estimate the economic valuation of carbon emission and sequestration by using the InVEST software. The results showed that agriculture (cropped lands) was main driver of the landscape changes in the study area, which increased 14\% by 2017, a net increase of 1494.45 km(2). The results showed that the total Carbon emissions would reach 736,900 Mg CO2-eq by assuming the BAU scenario, which would increase the cost of opportunity up to US\$ 17.7 million and a social carbon cost varying between US\$ 10.3 and US\$ 30.2 million. The restoration of the permanent preservation areas could contribute to increase Carbon sequestration up to 481,900 Mg CO2-eq by 2030, which is equivalent cost of US\$ 11.6 million. The natural landscape in the Sergipe semiarid region was strongly affected by deforestation activities occurred between 1992 and 2017. It requires, therefore, effective actions to support and promote restoration of degraded areas. The forested areas within the Sergipe semiarid region were the most affected type of vegetation because of expansion of agricultural fields soil exposures (Exposed Land). Environmental assessments based on scenarios and economic valuations can provide crucial information to support policy and decision makers to improve strategies for environmental management and conservation.},

Title = {Predicting the Chlorophyll Content of Maize over Phenotyping as a Proxy for Crop Health in Smallholder Farming Systems},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Smallholder farmers depend on healthy and productive crop yields to sustain their socio-economic status and ensure livelihood security. Advances in South African precision agriculture in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide spatially explicit near-real-time information that can be used to assess crop dynamics and inform smallholder farmers. The use of UAVs with remote-sensing techniques allows for the acquisition of high spatial resolution data at various spatio-temporal planes, which is particularly useful at the scale of fields and farms. Specifically, crop chlorophyll content is assessed as it is one of the best known and reliable indicators of crop health, due to its biophysical pigment and biochemical processes that indicate plant productivity. In this regard, the study evaluated the utility of multispectral UAV imagery using the random forest machine learning algorithm to estimate the chlorophyll content of maize through the various growth stages. The results showed that the near-infrared and red-edge wavelength bands and vegetation indices derived from these wavelengths were essential for estimating chlorophyll content during the phenotyping of maize. Furthermore, the random forest model optimally estimated the chlorophyll content of maize over the various phenological stages. Particularly, maize chlorophyll was best predicted during the early reproductive, late vegetative, and early vegetative growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 40.4 mu mol/m(-2), 39 mu mol/m(-2), and 61.6 mu mol/m(-2), respectively. The least accurate chlorophyll content results were predicted during the mid-reproductive and late reproductive growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 66.6 mu mol/m(-2) and 69.6 mu mol/m(-2), respectively, as a consequence of a hailstorm. A resultant chlorophyll variation map of the maize growth stages captured the spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll within the maize field. Therefore, the study's findings demonstrate that the use of remotely sensed UAV imagery with a robust machine algorithm is a critical tool to support the decision-making and management in smallholder farms.},

Title = {Comparative Evaluation of Land Surface Temperature Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Satellite Observation for Agricultural Areas Using In Situ Data},

Abstract = {Remotely-sensed data are a source of rich information and are valuable for precision agricultural tasks such as soil quality, plant disease analysis, crop stress assessment, and allowing for better management. It is necessary to validate the accuracy of land surface temperature (LST) that is acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite-based remote sensing and verify these data by a comparison with in situ LST. Comprehensive studies at the field scale are still needed to understand the suitability of UAV imagery and resolution, for which ground measurement is used as a reference. In this study, we examined the accuracy of surface temperature data that were obtained from a thermal infrared (TIR) sensor placed on a UAV. Accordingly, we evaluated the LST from the Landsat 8 satellite for the same specific periods. We used contact thermometers to measure LSTs in situ for comparison and evaluation. Between 18 August and 2 September 2020, UAV imagery and in situ measurements were carried out. The effectiveness of high-resolution UAVs imagery and of Landsat 8 imagery was evaluated by considering a regression and correlation coefficient analysis. The data from the satellite photography was compared to the UAV imagery using statistical metrics after it had been pre-processed. Ground control points (GCPs) were collected to create a rigorous geo-referenced dataset of UAV imagery that could be compared to the geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. The UAV TIR LST showed higher accuracy (R-2 0.89, 0.90, root-mean-square error (RMSE) 1.07, 0.70 degrees C) than the Landsat LST accuracy (R-2 0.70, 0.73, (RMSE) 0.78 degrees C). The relationship between LST and the available soil water content (SWC) was also observed. The results suggested that the UAV-SMC correlation was negative (-0.85) for the image of DOY 230, while this value remains approximately constant (-0.86) for the DOY 245. Our results showed that satellite imagery that was coherent and correlated with UAV images could be useful to assess the general conditions of the field while the UAV favors localized circumscribed areas that the lowest resolution of satellites missed. Accordingly, our results could help with urban area and environmental planning decisions that take into account the thermal environment.},

Title = {An integrated assessment approach for estimating the economic impacts of climate change on River systems: An application to hydropower and fisheries in a Himalayan River, Trishuli},

Abstract = {Changes in snow and glacier melt and precipitation patterns are expected to alter the water flow of rivers at various spatial and temporal scales. Hydropower generation and fisheries are likely to be impacted annually and over the century by seasonal, as well as long-term changes, in hydrological conditions. In order to quantify the effect of climate changes on hydropower and fisheries, we developed an integrated assessment framework that links biophysical models (positive degree-day model, hydrologic model, run-of-river power system model, and fishery suitability index) and economic models. This framework was used to demonstrate the framework's utility for gaining insights into the impacts of changed river flow on hydropower and fisheries of the Trishuli River in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) Region (from the Hindu Kush and Tien Shan mountain ranges in the west to the Eastern Himalaya). Remotely sensed and in situ data were used to quantify changes in snow and glacier melt in Langtang glacier and resultant change in hydrologic flow in the Trishuli River upstream of the Trishuli hydropower plant. Future discharges were projected using climate data derived from the Cubic Conformal Atmospheric model with 50-km resolution in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and RCP 4.5 climate scenarios. Results suggest that, in the future, the Trishuli River will experience modest increases in the economic value of the hydropower resource and fisheries as a result of higher snow and glacial melt. Increased flow in the months of March and April attributed to increased glacier melt translated to an increase in electricity generation. However increased flow in June and July when the snow and glacial melt peak is coupled with monsoon precipitation could not be fully utilized due to hydropower plant capacity constraints. Fishery suitability in the Trishuli River would be greater than 70\% of optimal under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Power economic results do not vary significantly for the next thirty years because flow increases under RCP 8.5 and resultant energy production are more pronounced in the later part of the century. The framework utilized in this study can be expanded in the future to analyze hydropower infrastructure as well as fisheries conservation in the upstream HMA basins from Afghanistan through Bhutan.},

Abstract = {The balancing of sustainable agricultural production with environmental, social, cultural and community objectives has become an increasing priority worldwide. Political focus has been on the prevention of environmental degradation and improving biodiversity values under the uncertainty of the impacts of climate change on rural livelihoods. In Australia, dry land salinisation is a major cause of environmental degradation in grain growing regions: at a farm scale the adoptions of key environmental strategies, such as revegetation, need to be considered. This study proposes that the identification and quantification of the spatial variability of wheat grain yield within the cropping landscape may help guide this revegetation. We used precision agriculture technology to collect data at the sub-field scale in conjunction with satellite imagery at the regional scale to create a high resolution regional indicator of wheat yield. This indicator is used to identify the economic value of land at sub-field scale which then allows identification of areas of marginal cropping value. This information provides an indication of how much land can be devoted to revegetation and quantifies the economic trade-off needed for this substitution to take place. Results of this study demonstrate that 90\% of the income generated within the area of interest was produced by 55-74\% of the wheat growing area depending on the choice of cost price scenarios. Between 27\% and 44\% of the study area made a financial loss or marginal monetary return indicating that trade-offs providing increased environmental benefits may be possible with minimal income loss from a substantial magnitude of cropping area. Although further analysis at larger regions with longer time series is necessary, results presented here show that overall economic returns may be improved by the reassignment of land use in selected cropping areas. The study also suggests that feasibility analyses of land use change at farm and regional scales should be conducted with a spatial resolution that is fine enough to reflect the spatial variability observed from yield mapping. While this information will not be available on every farm, this study shows that it may be possible to predict yield variability from remotely sensed imagery, thus providing a means to circumvent this problem and to produce high resolution indicators at a regional extent.

Title = {No pixel left behind: Toward integrating Earth Observations for agriculture into the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals framework},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {235},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Remotely sensed Earth observations (EO) have their history firmly rooted in agricultural monitoring, and more recently with applications in food production, food security, and sustainable agriculture. Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth's land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework. This inventory will be complemented by a discussion of the intersection of other policy mandates with the SDGs in the agriculture and food security contexts, and will conclude with a discussion of approaches to improving awareness of EO value and bridging the gap between policy and EO communities, to the societal benefit of all with no one left behind.},

Title = {Estimating impervious surfaces from medium spatial resolution imagery: a comparison between fuzzy classification and LSMA},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {20},
Pages = {5645-5663},
Abstract = {Impervious surfaces are important environmental indicators and are related to many environmental issues, such as water quality, stream health and the urban heat island effect. Therefore, detailed impervious surface information is crucial for urban planning and environment management. To extract impervious surfaces from remote sensing imagery, many algorithms and techniques have been developed. However, there are still debates over the strengths and limitations of linear versus nonlinear algorithms in handling mixed pixels in the urban landscapes. In the meantime, although many previous studies have compared various techniques, few comparisons were made between linear and nonlinear techniques. The objective of this study is to compare the performance between nonlinear and linear methods for impervious surface extraction from medium spatial resolution imagery. A linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) and a fuzzy classifier were applied to three Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images acquired on 5 April 2004, 16 June 2001 and 3 October 2000, which covered Marion County, Indiana, United States. An aerial photo of Marion County with a spatial resolution of 0.14 m was used for validation of estimation results. Six impervious surface maps were yielded, and an accuracy assessment was performed. The root mean square error (RMSE), the mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R(2)) were calculated to indicate the accuracy of impervious surface maps. The results show that the fuzzy classification outperformed LSMA in impervious surface estimation in all seasons. For the June image, LSMA yielded a result with an RMSE of 13.2\%, while the fuzzy classifier yielded an RMSE of 12.4\%. For the April image, LSMA yielded an accuracy of 21.1\% and the fuzzy classifier yielded 17.0\%. For the October image, LSMA yielded a result with an RMSE of 19.8\%, but the fuzzy classifier yielded an RMSE of 17.5\%. Moreover, a subset image of the commercial, high-density and low-density residential areas was selected in order to compare the effectiveness of the developed algorithms for estimating impervious surfaces of different land use types. The result shows that the fuzzy classification was more effective than LSMA in both high-density and low-density residential areas. These areas prevailed with mixed pixels in the medium resolution imagery, such as ASTER. The results from the tested commercial area had a very high RMSE value due to the prevalence of shade in the area. It is suggested that the fuzzy classifier based on the nonlinear assumption can handle mixed pixels more effectively than LSMA.},

Abstract = {The increasing availability of satellite data at higher spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions is enabling new applications in agriculture and economic development, including agricultural insurance. Yet, effectively using satellite data in this context requires blending technical knowledge about their capabilities and limitations with an understanding of their influence on the value of risk-reduction programmes. In this Review, we discuss how approaches to estimate agricultural losses for index insurance have evolved from costly field-sampling-based campaigns towards lower-cost techniques using weather and satellite data. We identify advances in remote sensing and crop modelling for assessing agricultural conditions, but reliably and cheaply assessing production losses remains challenging in complex landscapes. We illustrate how an economic framework can be used to gauge and enhance the value of insurance based on earth-observation data, emphasizing that even as yield-estimation techniques improve, the value of an index insurance contract for the insured depends largely on how well it captures the losses when people suffer most. Strategically improving the collection and accessibility of reliable ground-reference data on crop types and production would facilitate this task. Audits to account for inevitable misestimation complement efforts to detect and protect against large losses. Improvements in earth observation are enabling new approaches to assess agricultural losses, such as those resulting from adverse weather. This Review examines advances in the application of remotely sensed data and crop modelling in index-based insurance as well as opportunities to enhance the quality of index insurance programmes. Key pointsIn many developing regions, adverse weather can lead to food insecurity, reduced investments or distressed asset sales that ensnare people in a cycle of poverty.Tools to manage risk - such as well-designed insurance - can help people avoid the most severe possible consequences of bad weather and build confidence to invest in additional income-generating opportunities.In recent decades, governments and researchers across the globe have trialled approaches to inexpensively assess agricultural losses. Index-based insurance offers promise, but detecting losses cheaply and accurately remains challenging.Recent advances in crop modelling and remote sensing can improve index-based approaches by strengthening the link between indices and actual losses, as well as reducing programme costs.We provide an economic framework to evaluate indices, suggesting how the remote sensing and modelling communities can contribute to enhancing index insurance quality through better detection of adverse conditions.Promising opportunities to enhance index insurance programmes include inexpensively addressing heterogeneous conditions on the ground, such as employing audits, optimizing insurance zones, using new sensors or increasing contract flexibility.},

Title = {Dynamic Characteristics of Vegetation Change Based on Reconstructed Heterogenous NDVI in Seismic Regions},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The need to protect forests and enhance the capacity of mountain ecosystems is highlighted in the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15. The worst-hit areas of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in southwest China were mountainous regions with high biodiversity and the impacted area is typical of other montane regions, with the need for detecting vegetation changes following the impacts of catastrophes. While the widely used remotely sensed vegetation indicator NDVI is available from various satellite data sources, these satellites are available for different monitoring periods and durations. Combining these datasets proved challenging to make a continuous characterization of vegetation change over an extended time period. In this study, compared with linear regression, multiple linear regression, and random forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) performed best with an average R-2 of 0.819 (leave-one-out cross-validation). Thus, the CNNs model was selected to establish the map of the overlapping periods of two remote-sensing products: SPOT-VGT NDVI and PROBA-V NDVI, to reconstruct a SPOT-VGT NDVI for the period from June 2014 to December 2018 in the worst-hit areas of the Wenchuan earthquake. We analyzed the original and reconstructed SPOT-VGT NDVI in the hard-hit areas of the Wenchuan earthquake from 1999 to 2018, and we concluded that NDVI showed an overall upward trend throughout the study period, but experienced a sharp decline in 2008 and reached its lowest value a year later (2009). Vegetation recovery was rapid from 2009 until 2011 after which, it returned to a pattern of slower natural growth (2012-2018). The Longmenshan fault zone experienced the greatest vegetation damage and initiation of recovery there has caused the overall regional average recovery to lag by 1-2 years. In areas where the land was denuded of vegetation (i.e., effectively all vegetation was stripped from the surface) after the earthquake, the damage exceeded what was experienced anywhere else in the entire study area, and by 2018 it remained unrestored. In the 15 years since the earthquake, the areas that were denuded were expected to recover to the level of restoration equivalent with the NDVI of 2007, as was the case in other earthquake-damaged regions. In addition to the earthquake and the immediate loss of vegetation, the Chinese government's Grain for Green Policy, the elevation ranges within the region, the forest's phenological conditions, and human activities all had an impact on vegetation recovery and restoration. The reconstructed NDVI provides a long-term continuous record, which contributes to the identifying changes that are improving predictive forest recovery models and to better vegetation management following catastrophic disturbances, such as earthquakes.},

Abstract = {Land cover identification and monitoring agricultural resources using remote sensing imagery are of great significance for agricultural management and subsidies. Particularly, permanent crops are important in terms of economy (mainly rural development) and environmental protection. Permanent crops (including nut orchards) are extracted with very high resolution remote sensing imagery using visual interpretation or automated systems based on mainly textural features which reflect the regular plantation pattern of their orchards, since the spectral values of the nut orchards are usually close to the spectral values of other woody vegetation due to various reasons such as spectral mixing, slope, and shade. However, when the nut orchards are planted irregularly and densely at fields with high slope, textural delineation of these orchards from other woody vegetation becomes less relevant, posing a challenge for accurate automatic detection of these orchards. This study aims to overcome this challenge using a classification system based on multi-scale textural features together with spectral values. For this purpose, Black Sea region of Turkey, the region with the biggest hazelnut production in the world and the region which suffers most from this issue, is selected and two Quickbird archive images (June 2005 and September 2008) of the region are acquired. To differentiate hazel orchards from other woodlands, in addition to the pansharpened multispectral (4-band) bands of 2005 and 2008 imagery, multi-scale Gabor features are calculated from the panchromatic band of 2008 imagery at four scales and six orientations. One supervised classification method (maximum likelihood classifier, MLC) and one unsupervised method (self-organizing map, SOM) are used for classification based on spectral values, Gabor features and their combination. Both MLC and SOM achieve the highest performance (overall classification accuracies of 95\% and 92\%, and Kappa values of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively) when multi temporal spectral values and Gabor features are merged. High F-beta values (a combined measure of producer and user accuracy) for detection of hazel orchards (0.97 for MLC and 0.94 for SOM) indicate the high quality of the classification results. When the classification is based on multi spectral values of 2008 imagery and Gabor features, similar F-beta values (0.95 for MLC and 0.93 for SOM) are obtained, favoring the use of one imagery for cost/benefit efficiency. One main outcome is that despite its unsupervised nature, SOM achieves a classification performance very close to the performance of MLC, for detection of hazel orchards.

Title = {Satellite-based water use dynamics using historical Landsat data (1984-2014) in the southwestern United States},

Volume = {202},

Abstract = {Remote sensing-based field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) maps are useful for characterizing water use patterns and assessing crop performance. The relative impact of climate variability and water management decisions are better studied and quantified using historical data that are derived using a set of consistent datasets and methodology. Historical (1984-2014) Landsat-based ET maps were generated for major irrigation districts in California, i.e., Palo Verde and eight other sub-basins in parts of the middle and lower Central Valley. A total of 3396 Landsat images were processed using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model that integrates weather and remotely sensed images to estimate monthly and annual ET within the study sites over the 31 years. Model output evaluation and validation using gridded-flux data and water balance ET approaches indicated relatively good correspondence (R-2 up to 0.88, root mean square error as low as 14 mm/month) between SSEBop ET and validation datasets. In a pairwise comparison, annual variability of agro-hydrologic parameters of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), land surface temperature (T-s), and runoff (Q) were found to be more variable than their corresponding climatic counterparts of atmospheric water demand (ETo), air temperature (T-a), and precipitation (P), revealing process differences between regional climatic drivers and localized agro-hydrologic responses. However, only To showed a consistent increase (up to 1.2 K) over study sites during the 31 years, whereas other climate variables such as ET, and P showed a generally neutral trend. This study demonstrates a useful application of ``Big Data{''} science where large volumes of historical Landsat and weather datasets were used to quantify and understand the relative importance of water management and climate variability in crop water use dynamics in regards to the linkages among water management decisions, hydrologic processes and economic transactions. Irrigation district-wide ET estimates were used to compute historical crop water use volumes and monetary equivalents of water savings for the Palo Verde Irrigation District (PVID). During the peak crop fallowing year in PVID, the water saved reached a maximum of similar to 107,200 acre-feet in 2011 with an estimated monetary payout value of \$20.5 million. A significant decreasing trend in actual ET despite an increasing atmospheric demand in PVID highlights the role of management decisions in affecting local hydrologic processes. This study has importance for planning water resource allocation, managing water rights, sustaining agricultural production, and quantifying impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on water resources. With increased computational efficiency, similar studies can be conducted in other parts of the world to help policy and decision makers understand and quantify various aspects of water resources management.

Abstract = {Geographic Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) is increasingly used to process high-spatial resolution imagery, with applications ranging from single species detection to habitat and land cover mapping. Image segmentation plays a key role in GEOBIA workflows, allowing to partition images into homogenous and mutually exclusive regions. Nonetheless, segmentation techniques require a robust parameterization to achieve the best results. Frequently, inappropriate parameterization leads to sub-optimal results and difficulties in comparing distinct methods. Here, we present an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize image segmentation parameters by using the performance scores from object-based classification, thus allowing to assess the adequacy of a segmented image in relation to the classification problem. This approach was implemented in a new R package called SegOptim, in which several segmentation algorithms are interfaced, mostly from open-source software (GRASS GIS, Orfeo Toolbox, RSGISLib, SAGA GIS, TerraLib), but also from proprietary software (ESRI ArcGIS). SegOptim also provides access to several machine-learning classification algorithms currently available in R, including Gradient Boosted Modelling, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest. We tested our approach using very-high to high spatial resolution images collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (0.03-0.10 m), WorldView-2 (2 m), RapidEye (5 m) and Sentinel-2 (10-20 m) in six different test sites located in northern Portugal with varying environmental conditions and for different purposes, including invasive species detection and land cover mapping. The results highlight the added value of our novel comparison of image segmentation and classification algorithms. Overall classification performances (assessed through cross-validation with the Kappa index) ranged from 0.85 to 1.00. Pilot-tests show that our GA-based approach is capable of providing sound results for optimizing the parameters of different segmentation algorithms, with benefits for classification accuracy and for comparison across techniques. We also verified that no particular combination of an image segmentation and a classification algorithm is suited for all the tasks/objectives. Consequently, it is crucial to compare and optimize available methods to understand which one is more suited for a certain objective. Our approach allows a closer integration between the segmentation and classification stages, which is of high importance for GEOBIA workflows. The results from our tests confirm that this integration has benefits for comparing and optimizing both processes. We discuss some limitations of the SegOptim approach (and potential solutions) as well as a future roadmap to expand its current functionalities.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Coppice forests have a particular socio-economic and ecological role in forestry and environmental management. Their production sustainability and spatial stability become imperative for forestry sector as well as for local and global communities. Recently, integrated forest inventory and remotely sensed data analysed with non-parametrical statistical methods have enabled more detailed insight into forest structural characteristics. The aim of this research was to estimate forest attributes of beech coppice forest stands in the Sarajevo Canton through the integration of inventory and Sentinel S2A satellite data using machine learning methods. Materials and Methods: Basal area, mean stand diameter, growing stock and total volume data were determined from the forest inventory designed for represented stands of coppice forests. Spectral data were collected from bands of Sentinel S2A satellite image, vegetation indices (difference, normalized difference and ratio vegetation index) and biophysical variables (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, leaf area index, fraction of vegetation cover, chlorophyll content in the leaf and canopy water content). Machine learning rule-based M5 model tree (M5P) and random forest (RF) methods were used for forest attribute estimation. Predictor subset selection was based on wrapping assuming M5P and RF learning schemes. Models were developed on training data subsets (402 sample plots) and evaluations were performed on validation data subsets (207 sample plots). Performance of the models was evaluated by the percentage of the root mean squared error over the mean value (rRMSE) and the square of the correlation coefficient between the observed and estimated stand variables. Results and Conclusions: Predictor subset selection resulted in a varied number of predictors for forest attributes and methods with their larger contribution in RI (between 8 and 11). Spectral biophysical variables dominated in subsets. The RI resulted in smaller errors for training sets for all attributes than M5P, while both methods delivered very high errors for validation sets (rRMSE above 50\%). The lowest rRMSE of 50\% was obtained for stand basal area. The observed variability explained by the M5P and RF models in training subsets was about 30\% and 95\% respectively, but those values were lower in test subsets (below 12\%) but still significant. Differences of the sample and modelled forest attribute means were not significant, while modelled variability for all forest attributes was significantly lower (p<0.01). It seems that additional information is needed to increase prediction accuracy, so stand information (management classes, site class, soil type, canopy closure and others), new sampling strategy and new spectral products could be integrated and examined in further more complex modelling of forest attributes.},

Title = {Multi-sensor modelling of a forest productivity index for radiata pine plantations},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background: An understanding of how plantation productivity varies spatially is important for forest planning, management and projection of future plantation yields and returns. The 300 Index is a volume productivity index developed for Pinus radiata D. Don that has been widely used within New Zealand to assess site productivity. Although the 300 Index is routinely characterised at the stand level, little research has investigated if remotely sensed data sources can be used in combination with environmental layers to precisely predict this metric at fine spatial resolution. Methods: This study uses an extensive dataset obtained from P. radiata plantations in the central North Island, New Zealand. Using this dataset, the objective of this research was to compare the precision of parametric and non-parametric models of the 300 Index that included explanatory variables extracted from aerially acquired light detection and ranging (LiDAR), satellite imagery (RapidEye) at 5-m resolution or environmental layers and combinations of these three data sources. Models were constructed both with and without stand age as an explanatory variable as managers may not always have access to stand age. A total of 28 models (14 data sources x two model methods) were constructed using data from 433 plots. Precision and bias of these models was determined using an independent dataset of 60 plots. Results: Of the non-parametric methods tested (k-most similar neighbour (k-MSN), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN)), k-NN using an optimised value of k-most precisely predicted the 300 Index for 11 of the 14 constructed models. The use of k-NN was found to be more precise than parametric models when age was not available but of overall similar precision to parametric models when stand age was available as a predictor. For models including stand age, the inclusion of LiDAR resulted in the most precise model (mean R-2 = 0.789; root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.48 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) while for models without stand age, metrics extracted from both satellite imagery and environmental layers produced the most precise model of the 300 Index (R-2 = 0.65; RMSE = 3.21 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)). Conclusions: Results clearly show that models constructed from LiDAR provide the most precise means of estimating the 300 Index. However, in many situations, LiDAR is too expensive to acquire or stand age, which is used as a reference for linking LiDAR to 300 Index, is not available as an independent variable. Under these circumstances, results show that precise models can be constructed from variables derived from the combination of satellite imagery and environmental surfaces.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal assessment of urban growth of medium-size and nodal towns for sustainable management: using GIS},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-106},
Abstract = {Purpose - Urban growth has increasingly drawn much attention of erudite scholars due to its central role in achieving a sustainable urbanization. Despite this awareness, studies on urban growth have continued to dwell on the traditional method of presenting geographical Information, which has proved to be slow and inadequate. The purpose of this paper is to adopt a Geographical Information System (GIS) in assessing the spatial pattern and the physical planning problems associated with the expansion of Ore township between 1964 and 2002. Moreover, the study tends to serve as baseline study for subsequent studies on medium-sized and nodal towns. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilized data from secondary sources such as Landsat-TM, February, 1986, Landsat ETM+, December, 2002; Topographical map of Ore 1964 and population census data of Ore 1991. The study employed ILWIS Academic 3.2 GISsoftware to process the imageries. Coordinates extracted from the topographical map in UTM were used to georeference the enhanced and filtered images upon which supervised classification was performed, followed by error matrix operation and ground truthing to ensure high level accuracy. This results in six domains, namely, built-up, forest reserve, farmland, secondary forest roads and water bodies, which were analyzed on temporal basis. Predictive model was used. Findings - The study found that Ore township occupied an area of 1.2 km(2) in 1964, expanded to 11.3 km(2) in 1986 and 13.2 km(2) in 2002 respectively. The prediction showed a possible expansion of 55.33 km(2) by 2027. The results further revealed physical planning problems generated by these expansions - housing, inadequate waste disposal system, encroachment into agricultural lands, inadequate health facilities and poor drainage system. From field survey, 62 percent of 125 residential housing units sampled disposed refuse themselves, while 20 percent have no organized refuse collection and 18 percent dispose through other means. This suggests the vulnerability of inhabitants to health risks and environment problems. Practical implications - Urban growth data are useful in evaluating environmental impacts, delineating growth boundaries, developing land use zoning plans and estimating the expansion rate of a town to advise the government towards proper planning and distribution of utilities. These can be achieved through the adoption of GIS approaches to information gathering and analysis for regular monitoring and evaluation of development plans. Although it is capital intensive, it is worthwhile. Originality/value - The use of GIS and remotely-sensed data integrated with population census data and topographical map data has demonstrated the capability inherent in the new tools, GIS and remote sensing, to generate to some extent base line data for the town planners, in order to proactively channel the urban development in an appropriate direction, particularly the medium-sized and nodal towns that are somewhat neglected.},

Title = {Historical and future carbon stocks in forests of northern Ontario, Canada},
Journal = {CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Background Forests in the Far North of Ontario (FNO), Canada, are likely the least studied in North America, and quantifying their current and future carbon (C) stocks is the first step in assessing their potential role in climate change mitigation. Although the FNO forests are unmanaged, the latter task is made more important by growing interest in developing the region's natural resources, primarily for timber harvesting. In this study, we used a combination of field and remotely sensed observations with a land surface model to estimate forest C stocks in the FNO forests and to project their future dynamics. The specific objective was to simulate historical C stocks for 1901-2014 and future C stocks for 2015-2100 for five shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios selected as high priority scenarios for the 6th Assessment Report on Climate Change. Results Carbon stocks in live vegetation in the FNO forests remained relatively stable between 1901 and 2014 while soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks steadily declined, losing about 16\% of their initial value. At the end of the historical simulation (in 2014), the stocks were estimated at 19.8, 46.4, and 66.2 tCha(-1) in live vegetation, SOC, and total ecosystem pools, respectively. Projections for 2015-2100 indicated effectively no substantial change in SOC stocks, while live vegetation C stocks increased, accelerating their growth in the second half of the twenty-first century. These results were consistent among all simulated SSP scenarios. Consequently, increase in total forest ecosystem C stocks by 2100 ranged from 16.7 to 20.7\% of their value in 2015. Simulations with and without wildfires showed the strong effect of fire on forest C stock dynamics during 2015-2100: inclusion of wildfires reduced the live vegetation increase by half while increasing the SOC pool due to higher turnover of vegetation C to SOC. Conclusions Forest ecosystem C stock estimates at the end of historical simulation period were at the lower end but within the range of values reported in the literature for northern boreal forests. These estimates may be treated as conservatively low since the area included in the estimates is poorly studied and some of the forests may be on peat deposits rather than mineral soils. Future C stocks were projected to increase in all simulated SSP scenarios, especially in the second half of the twenty-first century. Thus, during the projected period forest ecosystems of the FNO are likely to act as a C sink. In light of growing interest in developing natural resources in the FNO, collecting more data on the status and dynamics of its forests is needed to verify the above-presented estimates and design management activities that would maintain their projected C sink status.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing provides a unique perspective on our dynamic planet, tracking changes and revealing the course of complex interactions. Long term monitoring and targeted observation combine with modeling and mapping to provide increased awareness of hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Disasters often follow hazards and the goal of NASA's Disasters Program is to look at the earth as a highly coupled system to reduce risk and enable resilience. Remote sensing and geospatial science are used as tools to help answer critical questions that inform decisions. Data is not the same as information, nor does understanding of processes necessarily translate into decision support for disaster preparedness, response and recovery. Accordingly, NASA is engaging the scientific and decision-support communities to apply remote sensing, modeling, and related applications in Communities and Areas at Intensive Risk (CAIR). In 2017, NASA's Applied Sciences Disasters Program hosted a regional workshop to explore these issues with particular focus on coastal Virginia and North Carolina. The workshop brought together partners in academia, emergency management, and scientists from NASA and partnering federal agencies to explore capabilities among the team that could improve understanding of the physical processes related to these hazards, their potential impact to changing communities, and to identify methodologies for supporting emergency response and risk mitigation. The resulting initiative, the mid-Atlantic CAIR project, demonstrates the ability to integrate satellite derived earth observations and physical models into actionable, trusted knowledge. Severe storms and associated storm surge, sea level rise, and land subsidence coupled with increasing populations and densely populated, aging critical infrastructure often leave coastal regions and their communities extremely vulnerable. The integration of observations and models allow for a comprehensive understanding of the compounding risk experienced in coastal regions and enables individuals in all positions make risk-informed decisions. This initiative uses a representative storm surge case as a baseline to produce flood inundation maps. These maps predict building level impacts at current day and for sea level rise (SLR) and subsidence scenarios of the future in order to inform critical decisions at both the tactical and strategic levels. To accomplish this analysis, the mid-Atlantic CAIR project brings together Federal research activities with academia to examine coastal hazards in multiple ways: 1) reanalysis of impacts from 2011 Hurricane Irene, using numerical weather modeling in combination with coastal surge and hydrodynamic, urban inundation modeling to evaluate combined impact scenarios considering SIR and subsidence, 2) remote sensing of flood extent from available optical imagery, 3) adding value to remotely sensed flood maps through depth predictions, and 4) examining coastal subsidence as measured through time-series analysis of synthetic aperture radar observations. Efforts and results are published via ArcGIS story maps to communicate neighborhoods and infrastructure most vulnerable to changing conditions. Story map features enable time-aware flood mapping using hydrodynamic models, photographic comparison of flooding following Hurricane Irene, as well as visualization of heightened risk in the future due to SIR and land subsidence.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The rapidly expanding urban areas of the world constitute an environmental challenge for the 21st century that requires both new analytic approaches and new sources of data and information in micro and macro level. Management of land use sprawl in urban area especially in developing countries using GIS and Remote sensing tools still in vague although these tool may provide the benefit on fundamental observations of urban encroachment and environmental monitoring that are not available from other sources (Batty and Howes, 2001). Therefore, this paper attempts to analyze the capability and reviewing the research and works done recently on GIS and remote sensing in managing urban land use sprawl in developing countries in order to increase the resilience of cities with diverse dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - Increasing availability of GIS and remotely sensed application on urban planning purposes can be seen on capabilities of broad spatial coverage, capacity of routine and unobtrusive updating and the ability to provide self-consistent measurement will be consider as a main indicator in the process of analyzing and reviewing for works have been done. The quantitative and qualitative data analyzed using statistical approach were used in identifying the main success and failures of each study, and the main underlying reasons with comparing the result obtained for the different places in developing countries. An integrated various subsystem allows the analysis of GIS and remote sensing on urban land use sprawl to generate the result of how they manage the urban land use sprawl in further provide number of solid contribution to the wider theoretical debate on this study contexts. Originality/value - This paper represents an attempt to compare and evaluate and determine a degree of synthesize the work that has been done to develop and embed creativity and innovation of space technologies in the urban planning development. The methodology puts in evidence the strength and ability of knowledge on information system for intellectual capital and management especially for urban planning development (Mohd Noor and Hashim, 2009a and 2009b). It relates to recent development of GIS and remote sensing in urban planning which prove that the tool has a value of incorporating the complexity and dynamic of urban area into virtual with consider the relevant mechanism which highly have potential value in real world in terms of micro and macro level. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application entail mostly the theoretical and practical implication on urban development which should take the effect of land use sprawl and try to manage the phenomena with controlling the encroachment and limit the sprawl with using GIS and Remote Sensing in urban area which further can facilitate the organisation and cities in managing the land use sprawl phenomena recently hit the city in developing countries (Wu, 2006).},

Included participants were aged 39 years and older, white, had available spirometry data, and had complete data for phenotypes and exposures. COPD was defined by spirometry with the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria. Environmental exposures were PM2.5 derived from monitoring data and interpolated using land-use regression at the participants' geocoded residential addresses. Built environment metrics of residential greenness were modelled in terms of normalised difference vegetation index from remotely sensed colour infrared data within a 500 m residential catchment, and an urbanicity index derived from spatial analyses and measured with a 1 km buffer around each participant's residential address. Logistic regression models examined the associations between environmental exposures and COPD prevalence adjusting for a range of confounders. Subgroup analyses by urbanicity and effect modification by white blood cell count as an inflammatory marker were also done. Findings We assessed 96 779 participants recruited between April 4, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010, of which 5391 participants had COPD with a prevalence of 5.6\%. Each 10 mu g/m(3) increment in ambient PM2.5 exposure at a participant's residential location was associated with higher odds of COPD (odds ratio 1.55, 95\% CI 1.14-2.10). Among the built environment metrics, urbanicity was associated with higher odds of COPD (1.05, 1.01-1.08 per interquartile increment), whereas residential greenness was protective, being associated with lower odds of COPD (0.89, 0.84-0.93 for each interquartile increment in greenness). The results remained consistent in models of COPD defined as per lower limit of normal criteria. The highest quartile of white blood cell count was associated with lower lung function and higher COPD risk with a significant interaction between PM2.5 and white blood cell count only in the model of lung function (p=0.0003). Interpretation In this study of the built environment and COPD, to our knowledge the largest done in the UK, we found that exposure to ambient PM2.5 and urbanicity were associated with a higher risk of COPD. Residing in greener areas, as measured by normalised difference vegetation index, was associated with lower odds of COPD, suggesting the potential value of urban planning and design in minimising or offsetting environmental risks for the prevention and management of COPD.

Abstract = {The motivation for quantitative assessment of land degradation at a global scale is its recognition as an environmental issue of global societal implications. Yet, due to the non-robust definition of ``land degradation{''} and to the paucity of field data, the five global assessments carried out and presented between 1977 and 2003 differ in the selection of measurable attributes of land degradation, in the quality of the data sets, and in their spatial coverage. This resulted in a plethora of degradation estimates ranging 15\% to 63\% of global degradation and 4\% to 74\% of dryland degradation. Of these, the figure of 70\% degradation (for the drylands only, comprising 41\% of global land) has been cited more than the others. Though likely to be overly exaggerated (because it stands for a combination of degradation degree of a land unit and its spatial extent within the mapping unit of which it is a part), this high estimate has apparently served well the globality notion of the dryland degradation syndrome, essential to rallying support for international development assistance under the UNCCD. This thirst for development assistance aimed at ``combating desertification{''} attracted to the UNCCD some 70 non-dryland developing countries (compared to 93 developing dryland country Parties) which experience land degradation that is not included in global assessments of desertification, since only dryland degradation qualifies as ``desertification{''}. The texts of the various assessments, including that of GLASOD as well as the UNCCD definition often trade off ``desertification{''} with ``susceptibility{''} to or ``threat{''} of desertification. This suggests that an assessment of vulnerability to desertification rather than its actual occurrence are of higher credibility and utility for policy- and decision-making. Though soil degradation featured highly in the currently available global degradation assessments, remotely-sensed vegetation attributes not only assess the most valued but threatened ecosystem service, but are also amenable for assessment at the global scale. However, caution is required when using this tool especially in drylands where productivity is tightly linked to rainfall variations. The monitoring required to meet the persistence criterion for qualifying desertification can be also used to detect current desertification trends, which are of relevance for policy-making even more than defining current desertification status. To discern changes of productivity due to state of the land from those due to rainfall features, the ratio of NPP to rainfall (RUE) could be useful were it not negatively correlated with rainfall itself. An alternative method for detecting degradation trends, the Residual NPP Trends (RESTREND) is currently under development. It is based on an analysis of the residuals of the productivity-rainfall relationship throughout a time period for each pixel in the explored region. A statistically significant negative regression of the residuals on time identifies a degradation trend, and the slope stands for its magnitude. To be reliable on a global scale such a remote-sensing approach would serve for guiding field observations required for its own verification.},

Title = {The functional value of Caribbean coral reef, seagrass and mangrove habitats to ecosystem processes},

Abstract = {Caribbean coral reef habitats, seagrass beds and mangroves provide important goods and services both individually and through functional linkages. A range of anthropogenic factors are threatening the ecological and economic importance of these habitats and it is vital to understand how ecosystem processes vary across seascapes. A greater understanding of processes will facilitate further insight into the effects of disturbances and assist with assessing management options. Despite the need to study processes across whole seascapes, few spatially explicit ecosystem-scale assessments exist. We review the empirical literature to examine the role of different habitat types for a range of processes. The importance of each of 10 generic habitats to each process is defined as its ``functional value{''} (none, low, medium or high), quantitatively derived from published data wherever possible and summarised in a single figure. This summary represents the first time the importance of habitats across an entire Caribbean seascape has been assessed for a range of processes. Furthermore, we review the susceptibility of each habitat to disturbances to investigate spatial patterns that might affect functional values. Habitat types are considered at the scale discriminated by remotely-sensed imagery and we envisage that functional values can be combined with habitat maps to provide spatially explicit information on processes across ecosystems. We provide examples of mapping the functional values of habitats for populations of three commercially important species. The resulting data layers were then used to generate seascape-scale assessments of ``hot spots{''} of functional value that might be considered priorities for conservation. We also provide an example of how the literature reviewed here can be used to parameterise a habitat-specific model investigating reef resilience under different scenarios of herbivory. Finally, we use multidimensional scaling to provide a basic analysis of the overall functional roles of different habitats. The resulting ordination suggests that each habitat has a unique suite of functional values and, potentially, a distinct role within the ecosystem. This review shows that further data are required for many habitat types and processes, particularly forereef and escarpment habitats on reefs and for seagrass beds and mangroves. Furthermore, many data were collected prior to the regional mass mortality of Diadema and Acropora, and subsequent changes to benthic communities have, in many cases, altered a habitat's functional value, hindering the use of these data for parameterising maps and models. Similarly, few data exist on how functional values change when environmental parameters, such as water clarity, are altered by natural or anthropogenic influences or the effects of a habitat's spatial context within the seascape. Despite these limitations, sufficient data are available to construct maps and models to better understand tropical marine ecosystem processes and assist more effective mitigation of threats that alter habitats and their functional values.},

Title = {Prediction of High Incidence of Dengue in the Philippines},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background Accurate prediction of dengue incidence levels weeks in advance of an outbreak may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this neglected disease. Therefore, models were developed to predict high and low dengue incidence in order to provide timely forewarnings in the Philippines. Methods Model inputs were chosen based on studies indicating variables that may impact dengue incidence. The method first uses Fuzzy Association Rule Mining techniques to extract association rules from these historical epidemiological, environmental, and socio-economic data, as well as climate data indicating future weather patterns. Selection criteria were used to choose a subset of these rules for a classifier, thereby generating a Prediction Model. The models predicted high or low incidence of dengue in a Philippines province four weeks in advance. The threshold between high and low was determined relative to historical incidence data. Principal Findings Model accuracy is described by Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Sensitivity, and Specificity computed on test data not previously used to develop the model. Selecting a model using the F-0.5 measure, which gives PPV more importance than Sensitivity, gave these results: PPV = 0.780, NPV = 0.938, Sensitivity = 0.547, Specificity = 0.978. Using the F-3 measure, which gives Sensitivity more importance than PPV, the selected model had PPV = 0.778, NPV = 0.948, Sensitivity = 0.627, Specificity = 0.974. The decision as to which model has greater utility depends on how the predictions will be used in a particular situation. Conclusions This method builds prediction models for future dengue incidence in the Philippines and is capable of being modified for use in different situations; for diseases other than dengue; and for regions beyond the Philippines. The Philippines dengue prediction models predicted high or low incidence of dengue four weeks in advance of an outbreak with high accuracy, as measured by PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, and Specificity. Author Summary A largely automated methodology is described for creating models that use past and recent data to predict dengue incidence levels several weeks in advance for a specific time period and a geographic region that can be sub-national. The input data include historical and recent dengue incidence, socioeconomic factors, and remotely sensed variables related to weather, climate, and the environment. Among the climate variables are those known to indicate future weather patterns that may or may not be seasonal. The final prediction models adhere to these principles: 1) the data used must be available at the time the prediction is made (avoiding pitfalls made by studies that use recent data that, in actual practice, would not be available until after the date the prediction was made); and 2) the models are tested on data not used in their development (thereby avoiding overly optimistic measures of accuracy of the prediction). Local public health preferences for low numbers of false positives and negatives are taken into account. These models appear to be robust even when applied to nearby geographic regions that were not used in model development. The method may be applied to other vector borne and environmentally affected diseases.},

Title = {Inventory of Forest Attributes to Support the Integration of Non-provisioning Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity into Forest Planning-from Collecting Data to Providing Information},
Journal = {CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-58},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Purpose of Review Our review provides an overview of forest attributes measurable by forest inventory that may support the integration of non-provisioning ecosystem services (ES) and biodiversity into forest planning. The review identifies appropriate forest attributes to quantify the opportunity for recreation, biodiversity promotion and carbon storage, and describes new criteria that future forest inventories may include. As a source of information, we analyse recent papers on forest inventory and ES to show if and how they address these criteria. We further discuss how mapping ES could benefit from such new criteria and conclude with three case studies illustrating the importance of selected criteria delivered by forest inventory. Recent Findings Recent studies on forest inventory focus mainly on carbon storage and biodiversity promotion, while very few studies address the opportunity of recreation. Field sampling still dominates the data collection, despite the fact that airborne laser scanning (ALS) has much improved the precision of large-scale estimates of the level of forest ES provision. However, recent inventory studies have hardly addressed criteria such as visible distance in stands, presence of open water bodies and soil damages (important for the opportunity of recreation) and naturalness (here understood as the similarity of the forest to its natural state) and habitat trees and natural clearings (important for biodiversity promotion). The problem of quantifying carbon stock changes with appropriate precision has not been addressed. In addition, the reviewed studies have hardly explored the potential of inventory information to support mapping of the demand for ES. We identify challenges with estimating a number of criteria associated with rare events, relevant for both the opportunity of recreation and biodiversity promotion. These include deadwood, rare species and habitat trees. Such rare events require innovative inventory technology, such as point-transect sampling or ALS. The ALS technology needs relatively open canopies, to achieve reliable estimates for deadwood or understorey vegetation. For the opportunity of recreation, the diversity among forest stands (possibly quantified by geoinformatics) and information on the presence of open water bodies (provided by RADAR, ALS data or use of existing maps) may be important. Naturalness is a crucial criterion for native biodiversity promotion but hard to quantify and assess until now. Tree species identification would be crucial for this criterion, which is still a challenge for remote sensing techniques. Estimating carbon storage may build on biomass estimates from terrestrial samples or on remotely sensed data, but major problems exist with the precision of estimates for carbon stock changes. Recent approaches for mapping the supply side of forest ES are promising, while providing so far uncommon structural information by revised inventory concepts could be helpful also for mapping the demand for ES. We conclude that future studies must find holistic inventory management systems to couple various inventory technologies in support of the integration of non-provisioning ES and biodiversity into forest planning.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS},

Number = {423},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands have been heavily exploited in the world. Valuation of ecosystem services help to provide the necessary improvements in coastal policy and management to monitor the driving forces of ecological changes in wetland ecosystems. In this study, the monetary values of wetland ecosystem services (WES) in the northeastern part of Vietnam were evaluated based on the integration of different quantitative methods, including interview, remote sensing, ecological modeling, statistic, and cost-benefit analyses. Particularly, seven wetland ecosystems and eleven services obtained from them were identified. As a result, the annual net WES value is evaluated at more than 390 million USD. The intensive and industrial aquaculture ecosystems in the northeastern part represent the highest economic value with more than 2100 USD/ha/year. A ``planning{''} scenario was formulated to predict WES for the next ten years based on policy changes published by local managers. The framework developed here can serve as a decision support tool for environmental and economic managers in wetlands planning.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a first application of contingent valuation method to measure the value of information generated by earth science data from an environmental geostationary satellite payload called Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Satellite. The purpose of the space project is to improve the accuracy of air pollution information by enhancing air pollution monitoring and forecasting system coupled with conventional ground level monitoring stations located throughout South Korea. Estimation results based on a survey data of 1000 households show that most explanatory variables including bid amounts and household income significantly influenced dichotomous choice contingent valuation responses with expected signs. When applied to the whole sample, mean willingness to pay reflecting both use and non-use values was stable at around \$3.70 per year for the improvement of air quality information. Present values of total benefits over the lifetime period of the space satellite exceed the cost born by tax payers with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.77. The result of this study clearly suggests that contingent valuation method can be used as an alternative approach in measuring the value of information from a space-derived earth science project.

Title = {Evaluating the Public Value of Improving Early Detection Accuracy of Cumulonimbus Using a Geostationary Satellite in South Korea},
Journal = {SPACE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Cheollian Satellite 2A called Geo-Kompsat-2A is a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by Korea Meteorological Administration for weather and space-weather observation purposes. This article seeks to evaluate the public value arising from improving the accuracy of early detection of cumulo-nimbus using Geo-Kompsat-2A. To this end, an economic technique called contingent valuation (CV) is adopted taking a three step approach. In step 1, a CV questionnaire was prepared for deriving the willingness to pay (WTP) for the improvement. In step 2, a nationwide survey of 1000 households was conducted using the CV questionnaire and employing person-to-person interviews with household visits. In step 3, the average WTP was estimated. The yearly household average WTP was KRW 2143 (USD 1.91), securing statistical significance. Adjusting this value to suit the entire population of South Korea produces a yearly public value of KRW 44.1 billion (USD 39.3 million). Although it is not easy to accu-rately evaluate the costs involved in the improvement, the results of conducting a pilot cost-benefit analysis suggest that the improvement secures social desirability.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to estimate the benefits of ecosystem services for prioritization of land use conservation and to highlight the importance of ecosystem services by comparison between ecosystem service value and green GDP accounting. Based on land use pattern and benefit transfer method, this research estimated value of ecosystem services in Taiwan. Scientific information of land use and land cover change is accessed through multi-year satellite imagery moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and geographic information system (GIS) technology. Combined with benefit transfer method, this research estimated the ecosystem service valuation of forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, water, and urban for the period of 2000 to 2015 in Taiwan. It is found that forest made the greatest contribution and the significant increasing area of wetland has huge potential benefit for environmental conservation in Taiwan. We recommend placing maintaining wetland ecosystem in Taiwan with higher priority. This research also compared ecosystem service value with natural capital consumption which would essentially facilitate policy makers to understand the relationship between benefits gained from natural capital and the loss from human-made capital.},

Abstract = {Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS has become the ``space arm{''} for the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) vision. It is directly supporting the space-based, near-term tasks articulated in the GEO three-year work plan. This paper describes a coordinated program of demonstration projects conducted by CEOS member agencies and partners to utilize Earth observations to enhance energy management end-user decision support systems. We discuss the importance of engagement with stakeholders and understanding their decision support needs in successfully increasing the uptake of Earth observation products for societal benefit. Several case studies are presented, demonstrating the importance of providing data sets in formats and units familiar and immediately usable by decision makers. These projects show the utility of Earth observations to enhance renewable energy resource assessment in the developing world, forecast space weather impacts on the power grid, and improve energy efficiency in the built environment.

Abstract = {Despite the enormous capital required to fund remote sensing initiatives, governments worldwide are increasingly adopting earth observation technologies to optimise operational efficiency and societal benefit. However, the value of information derived from earth observation will increase substantially if augmented by socio-economic data within contextualised focus areas of direct societal relevance. Within the framework of the key strategic development priorities designed by the South African government, the objective of this paper was to review existing and emerging remote sensing applications and their relevance to South Africa's development priorities. Whereas there is potential for adoption of remote sensing techniques in other prioritised areas, this paper identifies health, crime analysis, rural planning and agriculture, natural resource management and physical planning as areas with considerable potential. However, to realise the set strategic priorities and outcomes, decision support systems that incorporate information derived from remote sensing should be maximised. To achieve this, it will be necessary to link patterns and processes from expert knowledge to emerging and existing societal challenges identified and to develop requisite policies of governance. The paper concludes that remote sensing technology has considerable potential to support sustainable socio-economic strategic priorities set by the South African government.},

Abstract = {In the last decade a significant number of projects and programmes in different domains of Earth Observation and environmental monitoring have generated a substantial amount of data and knowledge on different aspects related to environmental quality and sustainability. Big data generated by in-situ or satellite platforms are being collected and archived with a plethora of systems and instruments making difficult the sharing of data and transfer of knowledge to stakeholders and policy makers to support key economic and societal sectors. The overarching goal of ERAPLANET is to strengthen the European Research Area in the domain of Earth Observation in coherence with the European participation in the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and Copernicus. The expected impact is to strengthen European leadership within the forthcoming GEO 2015-2025 Work Plan. ERA-PLANET is designed to reinforce the interface with user communities, whose needs the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) intends to address. It will provide more accurate, comprehensive and authoritative information to policy and decision-makers in key societal benefit areas, such as Smart Cities and Resilient Societies; Resource efficiency and Environmental management; Global changes and Environmental treaties; Polar areas and Natural resources. ERA-PLANET will provide advanced decision-support tools and technologies aimed to better monitor our global environment and share the information and knowledge available in the different domains of Earth Observation.},

Abstract = {World Heritage is of outstanding universal value and has irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration to humanity. It is important to evaluate the effectiveness of World Heritage site management. As a part of the South China Karst World Natural Heritage, Yunnan Shilin Karst was included in the World Heritage list on 27 June 2007. To quantify the effects of the Yunnan Shilin Karst site conservation, the changes in ecosystem service value of the Yunnan Shilin Karst area and the nearby buffer zone were analyzed by utilizing remote-sensing images, geographic information system and an ecosystem service value model. The results indicate that significant conservation effects of the Yunnan Shilin Karst have been made since 1992, and of the buffer zone since 2004.},

Abstract = {Substantial investment from both the private and public sectors will be needed to achieve the ambitious Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2), which focuses on ending poverty and achieving zero hunger. To harness the private sector, high quality, transparent metrics are needed to ensure that every dollar spent reaches the most marginalized segments of a community while still helping institutions achieve their goals. Satellite-derived Earth observations will be instrumental in accelerating these investments and targeting them to the regions with the greatest need. This article proposes two quantitative metrics that could be used to evaluate the impact of private sector activities on SDG2: measuring increases in yield over baseline and ensuring input availability and affordability in all markets.},

Abstract = {A wide range of satellite sensors that provide potentially useful imagery for digital documentation, mapping and monitoring of archaeological sites and cultural landscapes. Although some satellites have stopped acquiring new data, their archived satellite imagery can still be accessed, downloaded and exploited for monitoring of changes and therefore useful for research domain of archaeology and cultural landscapes. The aim of this paper is 1) to make an overview of past and current satellite earth observation optical sensors useful for land monitoring, with focus on cultural landscapes and 2) to illustrate a policy framework that goes beyond recommendations, suggesting the need of valuable information possibly provided by the in satellite imagery. Paper will put focus on Copernicus programme as the most recent mission that provides imagery on the global scale and free of charge. Paper, furthermore, highlights the need for a more structured consideration of the contribution that space technologies services and products can offer to the non-space sectors. The actions for implementation of strategies regarding the currently renewed attention towards cultural heritage protection and management, could soon benefit from the technological achievements of satellite technologies in terms of dedicated operational services and applications, tailored to the needs of end-users such as archaeologists, landscape professionals, public administration, researchers and students.},

Title = {Earth Observation and Economic Studies: A Cross-fertilization Perspective},
Journal = {SPACE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, an increasing number of satellite images and other earth observation (EO) data have become available to a wide range of final users, including economists and other social scientists, boosting the amount of information they can obtain to study, analyze, and manage different research topics in their fields. In turn, economists are promoting advancement in the quantification of the benefits related to the increasing use of EO services and applications by governments, firms, and citizens. Drawing from recent literature, and our own research, we explore, on one side, how social scientists, and particularly economists, can significantly benefit from EO data, and conversely, how socio-economic impact studies of EO can take advantage from a specific set of economic methods. This article suggests that cross-fertilization and interplay between economics, social sciences, and remote sensing science are needed to advance understanding of our societies and to more rigorously evaluate the socioeconomic impact of EO services and applications. The article suggests possible new research avenues. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {How remote sensing supports mangrove ecosystem service valuation: A case study in Ca Mau province, Vietnam},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {67-75},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper highlights the importance of using household survey and remote sensing data for the assessment of mangrove ecosystem services (fisheries and timber related products, carbon sequestration, storm protection) in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam. The results indicate that remote sensing plays an important role in ecosystem service valuation in the large areas where mangroves and aquaculture are mixed. We estimated the value of mangrove ecosystem services using market price and replacement cost approaches to determine an initial assessment of the overall contribution of mangroves to human well-being. The total estimated value was US\$ 600 million/year for 187,533 ha (approximately US\$ 3000/ ha/year), which is slightly smaller than the gross domestic product (GDP) of the province (US\$ 0.69 billion in 2010). However, this is only a partial estimate that does not consider other services (tourism, biocliversity, cultural and social values), clue to the absence of primary data The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to combine the approaches of remote sensing and household survey for the quantification of mangrove ecosystem services in the mangrove-shrimp integrated system. Our findings indicate that the continued expansion of acivaculture has reduced the benefits to local communities provided by the mangrove ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,},

Title = {Implementing a Modern E-Learning Strategy in an Interdisciplinary Environment-Empowering UNESCO Stakeholders to Use Earth Observation},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Copernicus Program and the fleet of available Earth observation satellites provide valuable services in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, urban monitoring, and heritage management. However, drawbacks such as knowledge gaps by the user, limited technical and financial facilities or the lack of ready-to-use data, result in insufficient exploitation of these opportunities by heritage site managers and other relevant stakeholders. Based on an initial assessment of current threats, existing limitations and potential applications, we developed the e-learning module Space2Place. Through the use of the learning module, stakeholders get a substantial introduction into Earth observation and knowledge barriers that may exist are removed. For this purpose, we refined an existing e-learning platform, which was developed in close relation to an online remote sensing application and adapted to the needs of UNESCO site stakeholders. One of the main features is the personalization of the learning modules content depending on the abilities or interests of the user. The platform offers information with different levels of difficulty and adaptable learning paths. A graduation certificate and practical exercises in an online remote sensing application increase the specific added value for UNESCO site manager. By using the associated remote sensing application and its link to Space2Place, heritage site managers also improve their knowledge on image processing by working with original satellite imagery. Additional advantages of using the platform will be enhanced through the introduction of new learning modules, translation into other languages and accompanying scientific research.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2017},
Number = {2645},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Recent developments in satellite remote sensing and the availability of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) products have created an opportunity for the use of SAR-based monitoring for pavement and infrastructure management. No previous studies have performed a detailed cost-benefit analysis to analyze the economic feasibility of pavement monitoring through the use of SAR-based satellite remote sensing. The aim of this study was to fill this knowledge gap by proposing a comprehensive methodology to estimate the most important benefits and expenses associated with the use of data obtained from satellites by SAR and interferometric SAR for advanced monitoring of the infrastructure and to gain a better understanding of the strategies used to identify their effects. A general cost-benefit analysis framework that could serve as a pavement management tool for assessment of pavement deformations and deformation velocities with millimeter accuracy was developed. The results of a case study performed in the state of Delaware to demonstrate how the proposed approaches can be used to assess the impacts of SAR-based monitoring projects are also presented.},

Abstract = {The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-of-Systems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Specifically, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and specifically, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the benefits of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal benefit areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a ``benefit chain{''} concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the benefits, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and benefit curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.},

Abstract = {The impacts of disaster events such as earthquakes on economic and human lives are increasing every year, in particular due to the growing urbanization. Until recently, stakeholders involved in disaster risk management focused their efforts mainly on the response phase, immediately after the crisis. Following the recommendations of several recent studies and in order to minimize the increasing impacts of natural disasters, decision-makers and major stakeholders have showed an increasing interest in mitigation activities. Earth Observation (EO) data from space could bring a significant added value to the various phases of the seismic risk management cycle from the mitigation and preparedness phases. Space agencies need to better contribute to the management of geohazards in response to the growing request from the community of users (e. g. seismologists, insurance companies, urban planners). To foster the use of EO remote sensing data, satellite data providers have to take the appropriate measures to remove the policy and technical barriers related to the data access. They have also to increase the awareness of the community of users on the potential benefits that could be gained from the use of EO satellite data. This paper will provide examples of areas where EO remote sensing data from space could bring an added value to the current management of risks and crisis related to earthquakes. Then, the paper will describe the strategic measures undertaken by the European Space Agency in an international framework, to foster the use of satellite data by the various relevant stakeholders.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a conceptual framework to estimate the socio-economic benefits of new knowledge generated within research infrastructures from the scientific community's perspective. We use Earth Observation (EO) satellites as a case study. Constructing, operating, and exploiting cutting-edge EO infrastructures is generating a vast amount of knowledge ultimately embodied in scientific publications. Using bibliometric and machine learning techniques, we analyse 1,235 publications in 1998-2018 related to Cosmo Skymed, the EO satellites constellation of the Italian Space Agency. Thanks to these satellites, 2,377 authors from 160 institutions and 68 countries worldwide have contributed to various subjects in several scientific fields. By using the marginal social value method in a cost-benefit analysis perspective, we conservatively estimate the value of such publications, including their marginal cost and value of citations. This original and straightforward approach can be used to estimate the socio-economic value of scientific publications produced within any research infrastructure, including universities, in any field of study.},

Title = {Multifactorial Evaluation of Spatial Suitability and Economic Viability of Light Green Bridges Using Remote Sensing Data and Spatial Urban Planning Criteria},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Multi-faceted stresses of social, environmental, and economic nature are increasingly challenging the existence and sustainability of our societies. Cities in particular are disproportionately threatened by global issues such as climate change, urbanization, population growth, air pollution, etc. In addition, urban space is often too limited to effectively develop sustainable, nature-based solutions while accommodating growing populations. This research aims to provide new methodologies by proposing lightweight green bridges in inner-city areas as an effective land value capture mechanism. Geometry analysis was performed using geospatial and remote sensing data to provide geometrically feasible locations of green bridges. A multi-criteria decision analysis was applied to identify suitable locations for green bridges investigating Central European urban centers with a focus on German cities as representative examples. A cost-benefit analysis was performed to assess the economic feasibility using a case study. The results of the geometry analysis identified 3249 locations that were geometrically feasible to implement a green bridge in German cities. The sample locations from the geometry analysis were proved to be validated for their implementation potential. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used to select 287 sites that fall under the highest suitable class based on several criteria. The cost-benefit analysis of the case study showed that the market value of the property alone can easily outweigh the capital and maintenance costs of a green bridge, while the indirect (monetary) benefits of the green space continue to increase the overall value of the green bridge property including its neighborhood over time. Hence, we strongly recommend light green bridges as financially sustainable and nature-based solutions in cities worldwide.},

Abstract = {Satellite imagery is increasingly employed for land-use analysis and planning. In this article, we examine the economic value of high-resolution (HR) satellite images as perceived by direct users. Drawing on a French spatial-data infrastructure (SDI), the direct users of which are mostly from public bodies, we used a contingent-valuation method to evaluate their willingness to pay (WTP) for satellite imagery. A clear understanding of the value of these images is critical for justifying the large investments made in this sector and supporting policies that aim to develop and sustain these resources. We analyzed the differences in the stated values according to the various types of users. A survey of the registered users on the Geo Information for Sustainable Development (GEOSUD) platform found a mean value of \& euro;1,696 for a 60 \& times; 60-km(2) HR image. Charging this amount leads to an acceptance rate of 43\%, with 57\% of users no longer acquiring the imagery. Furthermore, we noticed significant differences in values for images among the sectors. The results show that users are more willing to pay a fixed yearly amount to join an HR-image pooling system than to be charged per image. Hence, we recorded a mean membership value of \& euro;3,022, with 12\% of users willing to pay up to \& euro;15,000 to join such a service. For the 7,500 HR images available on the platform, the total user benefits amount to \& euro;12.7 million.},

Abstract = {Global change has a significant impact on the lives of humankind. Earth observation can help to better understand our earth and cope with global change. With the availability of more reliable environmental data sets, digital earth is becoming a popular way to monitor the Earth and provide information to researchers and decision makers on environment protection, disaster mitigation, and social benefits. Therefore, accessing data with lowering costs is essential for digital earth. Nevertheless, there are big challenges in ensuring the feasibility of access to Chinese remote sensing data. This paper outlines some of the main challenges in realizing data sharing, provides an analysis of the core reasons leading to these challenges, and proposes recommendations to overcome the challenges. Amongst the main challenges are differences in data policy to gain access to satellite data, diverse data formats, and delivery mechanisms. The major challenge for the decision makers is to define a more open policy and for the scientist the challenge is to implement these polices for the benefit of all. This paper proposes that governments should adopt policies encouraging more open distribution and access to their data, in order to generate an improved digital earth with increased benefits to human society.},

Abstract = {The ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment (ECoE) will provide cutting-edge Earth Observation (EO) research in Cyprus, the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa (EMMENA) region, Europe and Internationally for the benefit of the environment and society. One of the main focus areas of the newly established ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence (ECoE) is using remote sensing and space-based techniques for effective, efficient and timely cultural heritage monitoring. Such monitoring can offer tremendous benefits to Cyprus governmental institutions and policy implementation bodies, towards the protection of cultural heritage sites, including cost- and time-effective control of cultural heritage sites/monuments, raising awareness on the preservation and protection of cultural heritage from anthropogenic and environmental pressures, early warning systems and systematic monitoring of cultural heritage. Satellite Earth Observation technologies provide the ideal resource of information to undertake a wide range of effective, cost-efficient and non-invasive activities, which cannot be so easily acquired with other tools. As a result of the Copernicus Program, Sentinel 1 and 2 missions provide free satellite imagery that is accessible, provides global coverage, a high temporal resolution enabling image time series analysis and temporal characteristics, allowing for the consistent and timely monitoring of cultural heritage monuments and landscapes. The efficient exploitation of high resolution dense time-series of multi-spectral and radar imagery for large scale applications introduces new important considerations including cost-effective and systematic monitoring service of cultural landscape sites with archaeological remains, monitoring significant risks that cultural landscapes face, as well as aiding archaeological mapping and interpretation. Further-on exploiting high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e. from other satellites beyond Copernicus) improves modelling and data assimilation solutions and integration of space based remote sensing techniques with advanced ground and aerial based ones. Both data allows to develop more efficient and effective tools of investigation and monitoring, able to ensure mapping and monitoring of buried and exposed archaeological structures. This paper was developed under the auspices of the activities of the `ERATOSTHENES: Excellence Research Centre for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment'- `EXCELSIOR' project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 857510 and from the Government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate General for the European Programmes, Coordination and Development. From 1st of October 2019, the ERC group (Department of Civil Engineering and Geomatics) at the Cyprus University of Technology is on the way to be upgraded to ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence (ECoE) through `EXCELSIOR' H 2020 Widespread Teaming project (www.excelsior2020.eu).},

Abstract = {India's public funded earth observation (EO) program over the decades had evolved into a multidimensional program aiming to fulfill widely diverse application objectives. Remote Sensing Data Policy was first adopted by the Government of India in the year 2000 and subsequently revised in 2011. These policies placed strong emphasis on government funding of space infrastructure and also several downstream development activities relating to applications. In recent decade, however, commercial EO systems made rapid strides in providing access to high-quality data as well as information to users all over the globe. Through active role of private sector, several New Space initiatives have also been undertaken in different parts of the globe. In view of some unique opportunities arising in the Indian market due to the transforming economic, demographic, and social structure, the opportunities and challenges for commercial space had been studied. In the context of growing middle-income markets, the Indian private sector had also been showing increasing interest to invest into global initiatives and also explore new segments of value chain in the Indian market. This has already begun to happen in the field of satellite communications and it would also extend into other areas such as EOs and applications, which are now driven by national initiatives such as Digital India announced by the Indian Prime Minister recently and a nationalgeographic information system (GIS). The major drivers that would create burgeoning demands for space-based products and services are the decision support needs arising from diverse requirements of large-scale infrastructure developments and trends such as urban shift of the population, land use change, huge needs ofinformation and communication technologies (ICT)-based services addressing the demands of education, health, mobility, and environment sectors, robust demands for disaster warning and mitigation, national security, and natural resources management. An attempt has been made to analyze different policy paradigms. The article will also discuss the perspectives of private industry in India on policy issues and the perceptions of market opportunities in such a rapidly transforming environment and presents a portfolio of models to derive greater economic benefits. Since government policies had invariably played a major role in triggering investment and participation by private sector in this field, an avant-garde policy and regulatory changes to attract greater private sector participation are presented in conclusion.},

Abstract = {Earth observations can help reduce the loss of life and property from natural and human induced disasters through increasing our understanding of complex environmental systems. In this context, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is being built through the coordination of efforts within the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO), comprised of 80 Member States, the European Commission and 58 Participating Organizations, established in February 2005. The 10-Year Implementation Plan defines a vision statement for GEOSS, its purpose and scope, expected benefits for nine ``Societal Benefit Areas{''} (SBAs) (disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity), technical and capacity building priorities, and the GEO governance structure. The full value of GEOSS lies in its ability to integrate information across disciplines. Thus, GEOSS is concerned with: interlinking weather forecasting systems with other Earth observation systems; supporting efforts to advance sustainable energy; and devising end-to-end information services and sustained observing systems essential for addressing climate variability and change. The international collaborative framework of GEO allows: water experts to define the data and systems needed for improved water-cycle forecasting; international teams to monitor ecosystems and generate maps and other decision support tools; development of an Agricultural Monitoring System of Systems that will integrate in-situ and space data from multiple fields; and comprehensive monitoring critical to the conservation and sustainable use of the world's biological diversity. In particular, in the field of water, unique regional cooperative approaches are now on-going and under planning for making maximum use of, and contributing to, GEOSS. The current GEO Work Plan furnishes the blueprint for activities to implement GEOSS, and provides concrete examples of how decision makers can use the data and services available through GEOSS to address major global opportunities and challenges. This is why GEO strives to develop a GEOSS that would serve the needs of all SBAs through interconnecting existing and future Earth observation systems, interlinking observation systems, and promotion of open data sharing.},

Title = {Assessment of Ecosystem Service Quality and Its Correlation with Landscape Patterns in Haidian District, Beijing},

Abstract = {Landscape architecture with urban green space as the main research object is an evidence-based science. It is an important issue to optimize green space systems from the point of view of ecosystem services. In this paper, high-resolution (1.5 m resolution) remote sensing images are combined with data-processing software, such as ENVI, ArcGIS, and Fragstats, to evaluate ecosystem service quality and compute the landscape pattern in the Haidian District (Beijing, China), so that the relationship between the ecosystem service quality and landscape pattern can be quantitatively studied and a strategy can be provided for green space optimization in cities. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) for the evaluated quality of 14 ecosystem services in Haidian District (refer to Section Analysis of the Association of the Percentage of Patches (PLAND) Index of Forest Land and Quality of Ecosystem Service in Haidian District). Forest land is the main provider of the ecosystem service in Haidian District, while construction land only provides cultural services; (2) on the whole, the spatial distribution of the ecosystem services in Haidian District gradually decreases from the west to the east, which basically matches with the spatial distribution of the forest land. The regulating service and supporting service are matched with the distribution of the urban green space. The cultural service is closely associated with history resource points; and (3) the analysis results of the association between landscape pattern and ecosystem service quality show that the percentage of patches (PLAND) index for forest land has a significant logarithmic relationship with the regulating service and supporting service. The critical value of the PLAND index is 30. Besides the Xishan area with the most coverage of forest land, the landscape shape index (LSI) of the brushwood has a logarithmic relationship with the ecosystem service quality. The critical value of the LSI value is 50. Finally, this paper proposes an area optimization strategy of green space in Haidian District from the view of the ecosystem system service. The Xishan area is classified into the ecosystem red line to control city expansion. The regulating and supporting services can be enhanced in the north flat area by improving the patch shape index. The ecosystem service capabilities can be improved by adding the forest land in the existing green space for the southeast urban areas.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the potential of using satellite remote sensing as a tool for assisting environmental impact (EIA) and risk assessment (RA) studies. Environmental impact and risk assessment is now an integral part and pre-requisite part of most of the environmental studies. The large-scale spatial, spectral satellite remote sensing data provide a tool for environmental impact and risk assessment and monitoring of several environmental widespread activities. Satellite remote sensing data enables the identification, delineating and monitoring of pollution sources, distribution of affected areas including derelict land and surface land use, detection of pollution sources due to landfill and mine activities etc. The lack of environmental legal requirements and environmental management programme relating to environmental impact and risk assessment in the past years, explores the need for using cost-effective tools for applying such techniques. Satellites through their continuous coverage of the globe provide essential information that can lead to rapid and effective detection and interpretation of many hazard and impacts. Medium and high-resolution satellite remote sensing data can improve hazard detection and analysis. They can be used to observe, map, assess and monitor features and phenomena on the earth's surface. EIA and RA in conjunction with the use of satellite remote sensing data can be used to predict the environmental consequences of any development project; ensure that the potential problems are foreseen and addressed at an early stage in project planning and design; and finally enables us in carrying out Environmental Cost-Benefit Analysis of projects at an initial stage. Indeed, this paper describes several studies in which satellite remote sensing has been used to assist the implementation of EIA and RI in several geographical regions such as Cyprus and Greece. Such studies includes: public health problems due to laying of high transmission lines nearby residential areas, rapid land development and fire occurrences.},

Abstract = {The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has been untouched by human interference for the last half century, has become a sanctuary for rare species of animals and plants. Conflicts concerning development between communities and environmentalists are arising. Estimates of the preservation value of the DMZ are necessary for society to properly address these issues. Such estimates will help policy-makers address issues of conservation management, sustainable development, and public financial support. Given this situation, the objectives are two-fold. The primary objective of this study is to obtain estimates of the preservation value of the Korean DMZ and Civilian Control Zone (CCZ). A secondary objective is to examine the potential for hypothetic bias in respondents' answers in a contingent valuation method framework. Findings suggest hypothetical bias is present in the survey. including a real payment vehicle may reduce hypothetical bias in eliciting willingness-to-pay (WTP). Best estimates are the mean WTP is US \$ 16.74 per capita. Aggregate preservation value lies between US \$264 and \$602 million. These findings indicate that conservation of the DMZ and CCZ is not only important for moral and ecological reasons, but the DMZ and CCZ are of considerable economic value to South Koreans. Any development unfriendly to the environment will degrade the quality of the ecosystem of the DMZ, as well as, decrease its economic value. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {It is well-known that Earth observation (EO) data plays a critical role in scientific understanding about the global environment. There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts. Both the role of Big Data and associated technologies are discussed as they relate to the ultimate use of Landsat-derived information products to guide decision-making, and key data ecosystem characteristics that shape the likelihood of these products' use are highlighted.},

Abstract = {The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reef protection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5-10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.

Title = {Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite application for NO(2 )and CO studies aiming at environmental valuation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {The European Space Agency (ESA) provides opportunities for researchers on a global scale to identify gaseous pollutants using the most modern techniques of analysis by satellite images from the Sentinel-5P satellite, in the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), for the formation of current scenarios, applied to valuation environment aimed at possible improvements attributed to air quality and human health. The general objective of this manuscript is to analyze the amounts of NO2 and CO gases with Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite images, collected during the year 2019, and apply the environmental valuation focused on air quality pollution, in the northern region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the host city, Passo Fundo (southern Brazil) from 2020 to early 2021. The air quality valuation study applied the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). The results showed that NO2 had the highest concentration with a value of 7.88e +15 Column mol/cm2. CO presented a value of 9.43e +33 Column mol/cm2. The creation of scenarios aimed at valuation for the application of improvements in atmospheric air quality the understanding of the Willingness to Pay (WTP) of the interviewees. 514 residents of the City of Passo Fundo were queried as to their WTP for clean air quality in the city. The resulting WTP values, when applied to all households in the city as a whole, yielded an average WTP value of R\$1,517,478.24 and the median WTP is R\$599,390.00. It is suggested that pubic policies be written to enable these, or similar, amounts to be collected annually in order to mitigate harmful pollutants, such as NO2 and CO, currently found in the air of the City of Passo Fundo.},

Abstract = {While the U.S. government does not charge for downloading Landsat images, the images have value to users. This paper demonstrates a method that can value Landsat and other imagery to users. A survey of downloaders of Landsat images found: (a) established US users have a mean value of \$912 USD per scene; (b) new US users and users returning when imagery became free have a mean value of \$367 USD per scene. Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is \$1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery. Charging a price of \$100 USD a scene would result in an efficiency loss of \$37.5 million a year. This economic information should be useful to policy-makers who must decide about the future of this and similar remote sensing programs.},

Title = {Measuring the economic benefits of advanced technology use for river flood forecasting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As part of the Hudson Bay drainage system in North America, the Red River of the North Basin (RRB) has been subject to Spring River flooding in the past century. Previously, forecast errors had led to inadequate flood preparations that resulted in tremendous losses and overspending of taxpayer's dollars in flood response. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's satellite microwave remote sensing technology offers improved snow water equivalent measurement information needed for spring flood forecasting in this region. This study evaluates the economic benefits of the technology use to the farm sector in the RRB. We found that farm support for the technology use for river flood forecast is overwhelming, and higher farm support yields higher willingness to pay for the product use. However, respondents who are content with the existing spring flood forecasts tend to have a lower valuation of the new product. Tellingly, landowners who lease to farm operators have noticeably zero perceived economic valuation of the product even though river flooding on their land could depress future land value.},

Abstract = {The Group on Earth Observations, GEO, has identified the need to improve disaster risk management by providing timely information relevant to the full disaster management cycle of mitigation, preparedness/warning, response and recovery. The Committee on Earth Observing Satellites, CEOS, as the satellite arm of GEO, has recognized the important role that remote sensing contributes to all phases of the disaster management cycle. Activities to address the satellite information needs and gap analysis for disaster management systems are ongoing. This paper reports on results from two such activities, the southern Africa Flood and Health Pilot addressing annual floods in Namibia, and the GEOSS Architecture for Disasters analysis to enhance the use of satellite data. Direct interaction with Namibian hydrologists to experiment with satellite and in situ data products has helped inform the disasters architecture, providing lessons learned and best practices for the GEO societal benefit areas.},

Title = {Revisiting Ecosystem Services: Assessment and Valuation as Starting Points for Environmental Politics},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The paradigm of ecosystem services (ES) and the methods of monetary valuation have become boundary objects, spanning disciplines and earning particular purchase in policy circles. However, the notion of ES and ES valuation have also been subjected to multiple critiques, ranging from their varying precision to the potential for neoliberalization of nature. This paper does not attempt to refute such critiques but rather revisits the potentials of the ES paradigm and the specific method of benefit transfer valuation for their utility as a form of environmental politics and sustainability practice. We find they have particular relevance in contexts where ``data{''} are not readily available or are not legible to policy makers as well as where the imperative of ``development{''} remains ideological. We argue for ES assessment and, specifically, rapid ES valuation as a first-pass tactic to inform evaluation of potentially environmentally degrading projects or environmental management. We demonstrate this using a simple benefit transfer analysis to offer an initial evaluation of (wet) landscape ES in a lightly touched estuary in Karnataka, India, where a state-backed proposal to develop an industrial shipping port is gathering steam. While we recognize and do not categorically reject critiques of the ES paradigm, we nonetheless argue for valuation as a starting point for politics that highlight and make visible ES benefits and users implicated by ``development{''} and other kinds of environmental change.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem Services (ESs) refer to the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being and subsistence. Ecosystem valuation is an approach to assign monetary values to an ecosystem and its key ecosystem goods and services, generally referred to as Ecosystem Service Value (ESV). We have measured spatiotemporal ESV of 17 key ESs of Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in India using temporal remote sensing (RS) data (for years 1973, 1988, 2003, 2013, and 2018). These mangrove ecosystems are crucial for providing valuable supporting, regulatory, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. We have adopted supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying the region into different ecosystem units. Among the used machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms performed the most accurate and produced the best classification estimates with maximum kappa and an overall accuracy value. The maximum ESV (derived from both adjusted and non-adjusted units, million US\$ year(-1)) is produced by mangrove forest, followed by the coastal estuary, cropland, inland wetland, mixed vegetation, and finally urban land. Out of all the ESs, the waste treatment (WT) service is the dominant ecosystem service of SBR. Additionally, the mangrove ecosystem was found to be the most sensitive to land use and land cover changes. The synergy and trade-offs between the ESs are closely associated with the spatial extent. Therefore, accurate estimates of ES valuation and mapping can be a robust tool for assessing the effects of poor decision making and over exploitation of natural resources on ESs.},

Abstract = {Riparian zones play a significant role in ecological and biological sciences, as well as in environmental management and engineering perspectives because of their multiple functions in coupled natural and human systems. Quantitative evaluation of ecosystem service value (ESV) is essential to maintain the ecological functions that riparian areas provide. This manuscript addressed the overlap and connections among anthropogenic impacts (land use) with evaluations of societal benefits through ESV to an environmentally sensitive riparian zone in Northeast China using remote sensing observations and socio-economic data. The reported study evaluated the trend of ESV change in the riparian zone from 1986 to 2012. The procedures included (1) assignment of equivalent weight factors per unit hectare of terrestrial ecosystem services in the riparian zone; (2) calculation of ESV coefficients per unit area; (3) estimation of the total ESV in the riparian zone and exploration of the trend of the riparian ESVs from 1986 to 2012. The results were that the total ESV in the study area increased from \$42.30 million (USD) in 1986 to \$119.17 million (USD) in 2012. An average ESV of individual basic evaluation units increased from \$0.08 million (USD) in 1986 to \$03 million (USD) in 2012. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Remote Sensing is now being used as an alternative technology for the inventory, survey, planning and management of natural resources and monitoring of environmental change.  In the present paper, an attempt is made to identify the cost components and benefits of using remote sensing.  It was observed that cost-benefit analysis is more difficult than cost-effectiveness analysis.  Case studies, demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of using remote sensing along with conventional techniques, have been described.  A set of guidelines is provided to determine the most remunerative alternative for implementing a remote sensing project for solving natural resources management problems.  The emphasis here is to help the user in making suitable judgements to ensure returns from investments and enable him to utilise the limited financial resources for deriving the maximum benefits.},

Abstract = {The largest inhabited island, Zhoushan Island, is the center of economy, culture, shipping, and fishing in the Zhoushan Archipelago New Area. Its coastal wetland and tidal flats offer significant ecological services including floodwater storage, wildlife habitat, and buffers against tidal surges. Yet, large-scale land reclamation and new land development may dramatically change ecosystem services. In this research, we assess changes in ecosystem service values in Zhoushan Island during 1990-2000-2011. Three LANDSAT TM and/or ETM data sets were used to determine the spatial pattern of land use, and previously published value coefficients were used to calculate the ecosystem service values delivered by each land category. The results show that total value of ecosystem services in Zhoushan Island declined by 11\% from 2920.07 billion Yuan to 2609.77 billion Yuan per year between 1990 and 2011. This decrease is largely attributable to the 51\% loss of tidal flats. The combined ecosystem service values of woodland, paddy land and tidal flats were over 90\% of the total values. The result indicates that future land- use policy should pay attention to the conservation of these ecosystems over uncontrolled reclamation and coastal industrial development, and that further coastal reclamation should be on rigorous environmental impact analyses.},

Title = {Persistence and remote sensing of agri-food wastes in the environment: Current state and perspectives},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {317},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Food demand is expected to increase globally by 60-110\% from 2005 to 2050 due to diet shifts and population growth. This growth in food demand leads to the generation of enormous agri-food wastes (AFWs), which could be classified into pre-consumption and post-consumption. The AFW represents economic losses for all stakeholders along food supply chains, including consumers. It is reported that the direct financial, social, and environmental costs of food waste are 1, 0.9, and 0.7 trillion USD/year, respectively. Diverse conventional AFW management approaches are employed at the different life cycle levels (entre supply chain). The review indicates that inadequate transportation, erroneous packaging, improper storage, losses during processing, contamination, issues with handling, and expiry dates are the main reason for the generation of AFWs in the supply chain. Further, various variables such as cultural, societal, personal, and behavioral factors contribute to the AFW generation. The selection of a specific valorization technology is based on multiple physicochemical and biological parameters. Furthermore, other factors like heterogeneity of the AFWs, preferable energy carriers, byproducts management, cost, end-usage applications, and environmental legislative and disposal processes also play a crucial role in adopting suitable technology. Valorization of AFW could significantly impact both economy and the environment. AFWs have been widely investigated for the development of engineered added-value biomaterials and renewable energy production. Considering this, this study has been carried out to highlight the significance of AFW cost, aggregation, quantification, and membrane-based strategies for its management. The study also explored the satellite remote sensing data for Spatio-temporal monitoring, mapping, optimization, and management of AFW management. Along with this, the study also explained the most recent strategies for AFW valorization and outlined the detailed policy recommendation along with opportunities and challenges. The review suggested that AFW should be managed using a triple-bottom-line strategy (economic, social, and environmental sustainability).},

Abstract = {A strong remote sensing regime is a necessary component of any contemporary national or international energy policy. Energy is essential to the functioning of modern industrial society, and as such it is the responsibility of governments to produce sound national energy policies in order to ensure stable economic growth, ecologically responsible use of energy resources and the health and safety of citizens. Comprehensive, accurate and timely remote sensing data can aid decision making on energy matters in several areas. This paper looks at the benefits that can be realized in resource exploration, weather forecasting and environmental monitoring. Improvements in the technology of remote sensing platforms would be of great value to buyers of energy, sellers of energy and the environment. Furthermore, the utility of such information could be enhanced by efforts of government agencies to communicate it more effectively to the end-user. National energy policies should thus include investments not only in satellite system hardware to collect data, but also in the services required to interpret and distribute the data.

Abstract = {Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 14 pertains to the preservation of sustainable marine ecosystems by establishing marine protected areas (MPAs). However, studies have reported massive damage to Indonesian marine ecosystems due to shipping pollution, anchors, and fishing nets. Thus, this study estimated the potential loss of ecosystem service value due to vessel activity expansion in the MPAs of Indonesia. This study was divided into three stages. The first stage is vessel activity expansion zone modeling based on kernel density. The second stage is marine ecosystem service value modeling through semantic harmonization, reclassification, and spatial harmonization. The last stage is the overlay of the vessel expansion zone model, marine ecosystem service value model, and the MPA of Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the marine neritic zone of Indonesia has an ecosystem service value of USD 814.23 billion, of which USD 159.87 billion (19.63\%) are in the MPA. However, the increase in vessel activity that occurred in 2013-2018 could potentially lead to the loss of the ecosystem service value of USD 27.63 billion in 14 protected areas. These results can assist policymakers in determining priority conservation areas based on the threat of vessel activity and value of ecosystem services.},

Title = {Carrying capacity as tool for beach economic value assessment (case studies of Italian beaches)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {189},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This study developed a new integrated assessment method for sandy beaches, using three recreational Italian beaches as case study, with the purpose of obtaining their economic value. The method was based on a geomorphological assessment of the beaches and a carrying capacity evaluation; an economic analysis through the elicitation of the willingness to pay (WTP); a social assessment of beachgoers' attitude and opinion. For the selected beaches, which differed for typology, location, shape, level of urbanization and tourism, we identified the available surfaces for recreational uses trough the observation of satellite images. WTP results indicate that respondents would be willing to pay a contribution from 9 to 15(sic) per season. WTP is principally positive correlated with some variables like beach frequentation, residence in the localities, available services on the beach. The value of the selected beaches was calculated multiplying the sustainable carrying capacity of each site with their related maximum WTP. It was found that the values of the beaches varied from more than 50M(sic)/season at a popular urban beach to 1M(sic)/season at a remote natural beach. The comparison of beach valuation and investments made by managers of the beaches show a gap. Therefore, the huge non-market value of these beaches might need decision-makers to guarantee continuous beach restoration measures.},

Title = {The Challenge of Implementing the Marine Ecosystem Service Concept},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services has gained traction as a means of linking societal benefits to the underlying ecology and functioning of ecosystems, and is now frequently included in decision-making and legislation. Moving the ecosystem service concept from theory into practice is now crucial. However, advancements in this area of research differ by ecosystem type, and marine systems lag significantly behind terrestrial counterparts in terms of understanding, implementation, and number of studies. In this paper we explore several reasons why ecosystem service research has been limited in marine systems and we outline the challenges that hinder progress. Marine systems suffer from a scarcity of spatial data relative to terrestrial counterparts. In terrestrial systems the spatial patterns of land-use/land-cover (LULC) are relatively straightforward to access via satellite and have been used as proxy indicators of service provisions. In contrast, remote sensing tools used to study the surface of the Earth are much less effective at capturing images of the seabed, and by extension marine habitats. Marine waters and their constituents are also frequently driven great distances by winds, tides, and currents. This creates a challenge for management as the identification and protection of areas where ecosystem services are exploited is not necessarily sufficient to ensure sustained service delivery. Further complications arise from the three-dimensional uses of marine systems, incorporating activities that use the sea surface, the water column and the benthic habitats below. Progress is being made as technological advancements are resulting in the acquisition of spatial data at faster rates and higher resolutions than previously possible. There is a growing capacity to map, model and value an increasing number of services with initiatives such as InVEST or principle-based modeling. We suggest that awareness is needed around the limited progress in marine systems as this could affect the way we value the biosphere and the relative proportion between biomes.},

Abstract = {The African continent hosts some of the largest freshwater systems worldwide, characterized by a large distribution and variability of surface waters that play a key role in the water, energy and carbon cycles and are of major importance to the global climate and water resources. Freshwater availability in Africa has now become of major concern under the combined effect of climate change, environmental alterations and anthropogenic pressure. However, the hydrology of the African river basins remains one of the least studied worldwide and a better monitoring and understanding of the hydrological processes across the continent become fundamental. Earth Observation, that offers a cost-effective means for monitoring the terrestrial water cycle, plays a major role in supporting surface hydrology investigations. Remote sensing advances are therefore a game changer to develop comprehensive observing systems to monitor Africa's land water and manage its water resources. Here, we review the achievements of more than three decades of advances using remote sensing to study surface waters in Africa, highlighting the current benefits and difficulties. We show how the availability of a large number of sensors and observations, coupled with models, offers new possibilities to monitor a continent with scarce gauged stations. In the context of upcoming satellite missions dedicated to surface hydrology, such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), we discuss future opportunities and how the use of remote sensing could benefit scientific and societal applications, such as water resource management, flood risk prevention and environment monitoring under current global change.},

Abstract = {The integration of IKONOS satellite data, airborne color infrared remote sensing, visualization, and decision support tools is discussed, within the contexts of management techniques for minimizing nonpoint source pollution in inland waterways, such as riparian buffer restoration, and of strategies for food crop production sustainability, in an array of ecosystems. Case studies include the Little Miami River Watershed, Ohio; the Barataria Basin and Bayou Sauvage, Louisiana; and Sudan's Gezira. The investigation's objectives are to ascertain the utility of environmental decision support, informed by archival satellite data visualization and alternative future scenarios generation, and to explore site-specific sensitivity of such technologies, in support of inter-generationally prudent management of watersheds and sustainable regional food security. Follow-on collaborative research with European counterparts (e.g. Foundation for Research \& Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Crete, Greece) is planned to include enhancement, hardening, environmental technology verification, and field deployment of the prototype Temporal Analysis, Reconnaissance and Decision Integration System (TARDIS).},

Abstract = {Ecosystem service value is crucial to people's intuitive understanding of ecological protection and the decision making with regard to ecological protection and economic green development. This study improved the benefit transfer method to evaluate ESV in Hainan Province, proposed the coupling analysis method of economic and environmental coordination, and explored the relationship between ESV and economic development based on the medium-resolution remote sensing land use data and socio-economic data from 2000 to 2020. The results show that Hainan Province's ESV decreased by 33.305 billion CNY from 2000 to 2020. The highest ESV per unit area was found in the water system and forest ecosystem, mainly distributed in the central mountainous area. The overall condition of EEC decreased from a basic coordination state to a moderate disorder state. Areas with high economic development had better EEC, such as Haikou and Sanya. Meanwhile, we analyzed the driving force of ESV and EEC by Geodetector. The results show that land use intensity was the most important driving factor affecting ESV, with a contribution rate of 0.712. Total real estate investment was the most important driving factor affecting EEC, with a contribution rate of 0.679. These results provide important guidance for the coordinated development of regional economy and ecosystem protection.},

Abstract = {Due to urban expansion, economic development, and rapid population growth, land use/land cover (LULC) is changing in major cities around the globe. Quantitative analysis of LULC change is important for studying the corresponding impact on the ecosystem service value (ESV) that helps in decision-making and ecosystem conservation. Based on LULC data retrieved from remote-sensing interpretation, we computed the changes of ESV associated with the LULC dynamics using the benefits transfer method and geographic information system (GIS) technologies during the period of 1992-2018 following self-modified coefficients which were corrected by net primary productivity (NPP). This improved approach aimed to establish a regional value coefficients table for facilitating the reliable evaluation of ESV. The main objective of this research was to clarify the trend and spatial patterns of LULC changes and their influence on ecosystem service values and functions. Our results show a continuous reduction in total ESV from United States (US) \$1476.25 million in 1992, to US \$1410.17, \$1335.10, and \$1190.56 million in 2001, 2009, and 2018, respectively; such changes are attributed to a notable loss of farmland and forest land from 1992-2018. The elasticity of ESV in response to changes in LULC shows that 1\% of land transition may have caused average changes of 0.28\%, 0.34\%, and 0.50\% during the periods of 1992-2001, 2001-2009, and 2009-2018, respectively. This study provides important information useful for land resource management and for developing strategies to address the reduction of ESV.},

Abstract = {The cultural heritage of a country includes, among other things, places, ``buildings{''} and other monuments with historical value. It forms the identity of the country and is undoubtedly a national asset. For this reason, recording - documentation, protection, monitoring and management of cultural heritage is necessary. Different scientific and technological disciplines are involved in the study of cultural heritage. Photogrammetry and remote sensing, with their continuous scientific and technological advances, contribute substantially in this study. This paper refers to the above and includes a relevant example of Dodoni archaeological site, using VHR satellite data.},

Abstract = {Wetlands play an important ecological role and provide many functions for people, yet wetlands are currently decreasing and deteriorating. The ability to calculate an economic value for the loss of wetlands is becoming increasingly important for policy makers. In this study, remote sensing, field investigations, department visits, and other methods were used to survey wetland types, assess wetland area changes, and calculate wetland economic value. Market value loss and ecological function value loss, caused by reduction of wetland area and environmental pollution were calculated using commonly accepted methods of market valuation, ecological valuation, environmental protection investment cost analysis, and outcome parameters. According to market value loss and ecological function value loss, preliminarily fund allocation for wetland and ecological compensation was calculated. This will provide an important reference for future Yellow River Delta eco-compensation studies.},

Abstract = {Earth observation is an effective technique that plays an important role in earthquake damage reduction and reconstruction. This paper introduces the results of dynamic analysis on monitoring and assessing heavily impacted areas affected by the Wenchuan Earthquake using remote sensing data acquired in the past 3 years from 2008 to 2010. Immediately after the disaster on 12 May 2008, the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a project entitled `Wenchuan Earthquake Disasters Monitoring and Assessment Using Remote Sensing Technology.' More than 400 images from 17 satellites and 20.2TB airborne remote sensing data were acquired to facilitate quick monitoring and evaluation of severely damaged areas in 14 counties. Results of the image analyses were forwarded on a timely basis to assist with consultative service and decision-making support. In subsequent years, in order to monitor the process of environmental restoration and reconstruction, airborne optical remote sensing images covering most of the severely damaged areas were again acquired in May 2009 and April 2010. These images were analyzed and compared along with images from 2008. Results were useful in support of further work on environmental protection and reconstruction in earthquake-damaged areas. Three typical areas were selected for illustrative purposes including Tangjiashan Barrier Lake, Beichuan County, and counties of Yingxiu and the new Beichuan. These results well demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the utility of earth observation for disaster mitigation and reconstruction.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper we consider the evolution of quantitative accounting of social indicators for measuring societal progress and sustainable development, with particular reference to economic analysis and social indicators. We examine the use of the System of National Accounts and introduce the concept of using input-output analysis for the development of social indicators. The use of satellite accounts for input-output analysis of environmental impacts and the development of environmental footprints has been well documented. The novelty of this paper is the use of a methodology frequently used to develop environmental indicators to quantify social impacts and to further the development of social footprints. We provide a case study of the use of social satellite accounts for labour, using multi-regional input-output analysis to develop a global inequality footprint for labour embodied in trade, and argue the case for the development of a system of social economic accounts, similar to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 2012. This work contributes to the development of social valuation metrics as a means for measuring societal progress and developing sustainability indicators for use in management and decision-making.},

Abstract = {This study aims to quantify the impacts of land use changes on ecosystem service value during large scale land development, and to provide key information for both economic development and policy makers for eco-environmental protection. The study area locates in Manas river watershed which is a typical land development region in northwest China. Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ images in 1976, 1989, 1999 and 2008 were applied to estimate ecosystem service value based on land use, and subsequently ecosystem service value dynamics were analyzed in response to land use changes. It is found that the built-up area and cultivated land increased significantly from 1976 to 2008. The decreasing ecosystem service value (from 17362.2 million Yuan in 1976 to 16975.0 million Yuan in 2008) is mainly caused by the reduced grassland. The combined ecosystem service value of water body and grassland is over 60\% of the total value. Functions of water supply, waste treatment, soil formation and retention and biodiversity protection contributed to over 70\% of the total service value. The results suggest that a reasonable land use plan should emphasize protection of water body, woodland and grassland as they have the highest ecosystem service value.},

Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {6},
Pages = {182-205},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Successful climate change mitigation will involve not only technological innovation, but also innovation in how we understand the societal and individual behaviors that shape the demand for energy services. Traditionally, individual energy behaviors have been described as a function of utility optimization and behavioral economics, with price restructuring as the dominant policy lever. Previous research at the macro-level has identified economic activity, power generation and technology, and economic role as significant factors that shape energy use. However, most demand models lack basic contextual information on how dominant social phenomenon, the changing demographics of cities, and the sociocultural setting within which people operate, affect energy decisions and use patterns. Here we use high-quality Suomi-NPP VIIRS nighttime environmental products to: (1) observe aggregate human behavior through variations in energy service demand patterns during the Christmas and New Year's season and the Holy Month of Ramadan and (2) demonstrate that patterns in energy behaviors closely track sociocultural boundaries at the country, city, and district level. These findings indicate that energy decision making and demand is a sociocultural process as well as an economic process, often involving a combination of individual price-based incentives and societal-level factors. While nighttime satellite imagery has been used to map regional energy infrastructure distribution, tracking daily dynamic lighting demand at three major scales of urbanization is novel. This methodology can enrich research on the relative importance of drivers of energy demand and conservation behaviors at fine scales. Our initial results demonstrate the importance of seating energy demand frameworks in a social context.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Technological advances in remote sensing capabilities, wider participation of commercial firms and the possibilities of `processing' spatial data to create value-added information have given rise to a range of policy and legal issues in the geographic information (GI) field. How far satellite images can still be considered a `public good', conflicts between commercial and national interests is becoming a major issue, especially where security is concerned, sovereignty and the rights of sensed states, shutter control vs transparency is debated, data access, IPR and infringement of privacy becoming more relevant are all discussed. At the same time, the societal and public good of GI is well accepted with innumerable national and international examples. It is clear that societies would greatly benefit from the proper use of GI. A multilateral debate to formulate a GI policy that will take account of these while ensuring that the full benefits of remote sensing are available to society is called for. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This paper discusses the response of ecosystem service values to land use/land cover (LULC) changes and examines spatial contributions of individual transformations to the ecosystem service functions in the Barasat Sadar subdivision (West Bengal, India) over the period from 1977 to 2016 on the basis of a modified coefficient. Spatiotemporal LULC patterns were identified on the basis of Landsat series satellite images taken at intervals of 10 years. To identify the LULC parameters, a supervised classification was performed on the basis of the maximum likelihood (MXL) classifier. Ecosystem service values have been computed per ha of the terrestrial ecosystem based on coefficients determined for each land cover parameter in earlier studies. In 2016, the highest ecosystem service value was attributed to surface waters (\$477.06 million); while the lowest value corresponded to fallow lands (\$0.98 million). The results obtained using the assumed coefficient indicate a continuous loss of the total ecosystem service value of \$238.92 million over 1977-2016 due to the deterioration of agricultural fallow lands, areas occupied by dense vegetation, and shrubby lands, as well as rapid expansion of arable lands and development of an artificial infrastructure for surface-water bodies. The results of this study can be used as a reference and basis for decision making in the field of wise land resource management. In addition, the obtained data can be used to strike a compromise between urban growth and the decline of ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Although the military has found significant value in remote sensing, it is not clear whether the business case for commercial applications is equally strong. An in-depth understanding of the economic value that commercial remote-sensing imagery provides to targeted markets is necessary for determining whether investment into new remote-sensing systems is justified. Due to the importance of agriculture to the U.S. economy and the inclusion of agricultural applications in most commercial remote-sensing satellite business plans, this paper analyzes the economic value of using satellite imagery for crop production as well as the willingness and ability of farmers to take advantage of this technology.},

Title = {Satellite data-driven multi-objective simulation-optimization modeling for water-environment-agriculture nexus in an arid endorheic lake basin},

Abstract = {In the arid endorheic lake basin with highly developed agriculture, water scarcity drives the nexus of water -environment-agriculture (WEA) while potential evapotranspiration (ETp) is a critical element linking basin -scale irrigation water demand and agro-economic development. The study proposes a satellite remote sensing data-driven multi-objective simulation-optimization (S-O) framework to implement the basin-scale WEA nexus management. The hydrological model (MODFLOW-NWT) combined with the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) based ET(p )estimation with a 500-m spatial resolution simulates the monthly surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) irrigation practices. Then, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (epsilon-MOMA) is applied to solve management model which includes maximization of agro-economic benefit and environmental flow and minimization of environmental risk of total nitrogen loading subject to irrigation water demand, land availability and food supply. The S-O framework is validated in an arid endorheic lake basin with intensive agricultural irrigation in northwestern China. The four-dimensional Pareto-optimal solutions are achieved to optimize crop planting structure and irrigation water allocation in order to avoid cognitive myopia triggered by low-dimensional or single objective optimization. The results highlight the trade-off among the high value crop planting, SW-GW irrigation and environmental flows, and indicating that lowering nitrogen loading is more sensitive to agro-economic benefit. Historical maximum and minimum ETp scenarios are tailored to quantify the impact of ETp change on WEA nexus management. Results show the increasing ET(p )has a great negative effect on the environmental flow objectives. Therefore, how multi-sectoral interests change depending on the basin-wide development goals may be difficult to regulate due to complex WEA nexus and associated deep uncertainty in the future.},

Abstract = {Area-based conservation is essential to safeguard nature's diversity. In view of expanding human land use, increasing climate change and unmet conservation targets, area-based conservation requires efficiency and effectiveness more than ever. In this review, I identify and relate pressing challenges to promising opportunities for effective and efficient protected area governance and management, to enhance research, decision-making and capacity building in area-based conservation under uncertain future developments. I reveal that protected area management is particularly challenged by human land use, climate change, invasive species, and social, political and economic limitations. Protected area management often lacks the continuous availability of data on current states and trends of nature and threats. Biocultural conservation, climate-smart management and biosecurity approaches help to overcome challenges induced by human needs, climate change and invasive species, respectively. Economic valuation and shifts in funding priorities can boost protected area effectiveness and efficiency. In-situ monitoring techniques, remote sensing and open data infrastructures can fill data and information gaps for protected area planning and management. Moreover, adaptive management is an auspicious concept in the framework of systematic conservation planning to ensure the enduring effectiveness of protected areas despite unpredictable future developments. Post-2020 international biodiversity and sustainable development goals could be met earlier if protected areas were more effective. I consequently conclude with the need for a global information system that is to support area-based conservation by synthesizing challenges and opportunities for protected area management effectiveness and efficiency at the local to global level.},

Title = {Grid-scale agricultural land and water management: A remote-sensing-based multiobjective approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {265},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {This paper developed a remote-sensing-based multiobjective (RSM) approach to formulate sustainable agricultural land and water resources management strategies at a grid scale. To meet the spatial resolution and accuracy need of agricultural management, downscaled precipitation data sets were obtained with the help of global precipitation measurement (GPM) data and other spatial information. Spatial crop water requirement information were obtained via the combination use of the Penman-Monteith method, remote sensing information (MOD16/PET) and virtual water theory. Through integrating these spatial data and considering the impact of different spatial environments on crop growth, a grid-based integer multiobjective programming (GIMP) model was developed to determine best suitable crop planting types at all grids. GIMP can simultaneously consider several conflicting objectives: crop growth suitability, crop spatial water requirements, and ecosystem service value. Further, GIMP results were inputted into a grid-based nonlinear fractional multiobjective programming (GNFMP) model with three objectives: maximize economic benefits, maximize water productivity, and minimize blue water utilization, to optimize irrigation-water allocation. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, a realworld application in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China was conducted. Results show that the proposed method can improve the ecosystem service value by 0.36 x 10(8) CNY, the economic benefit by 21.85\%, the irrigation-water productivity by 25.92\%, and reduce blue water utilization rate by 24.32\% comparing with status quo.

Title = {An Information System for Comprehensive Evaluation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem Services Value: Design and Case Application},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The study of natural resources and ecosystem service value assessments is crucial for understanding the direct economic benefits and potential ecological, environmental, and social benefits of these resources. Existing research lacks a comprehensive information management framework design and application exploration for the practice process, and a unified and standardized technical framework has not been established, which makes it difficult to expand the functions in the future. This study uses data from various aspects such as statistical yearbooks, remote sensing satellites, and field studies, and adopts the market value method and alternative cost method to construct a natural resources and ecosystem service value indicator system and a comprehensive evaluation information system, taking Shaanxi Province as an example. The total value of natural resources and ecosystem services in Shaanxi Province is CNY 107.67 trillion, of which the value of natural resources is CNY 105.11 trillion and the value of ecosystem services is CNY 2.56 trillion. This study makes up for the deficiencies in the realization path of the existing natural resources and ecosystem service value accounting studies, solves the problems of a large number of data collection sources, integration of accession criteria, integrated assessment methods, and synchronized assessment updates in natural resources management in Shaanxi Province, and realizes the visualization and information management of natural resources and ecosystem service value accounting.},

Abstract = {The mangrove ecosystem is extremely important for providing essential ecosystem services, which are crucial for subsistence and human well-being. Using time-series satellite data products and different unit values, the spatially explicit Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) of six eco-regions of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India, has been calculated for four reference years, viz. 1973, 1988, 2002 and 2013. The maximum ESV (million US\$ year(1)) is provided by the mangrove forest (2292-44468), followed by water surface (65-4244), cropland (26-3938), and sparse vegetation cover (0-326). The total ESV (million US\$ year(1)) of Sundarbans is estimated to be 16629.5, 20175.7, 19733.4, and 16761.3 for 1973, 1988, 2002, and 2013 respectively. The regulation of gas and climate, raw material production, and cultural ecosystem services are entirely dependent on the mangrove ecosystem, while the waste treatment, cultural, and water regulation services are found to be highly sensitive to the changes in water bodies. The food production and biodiversity services exhibiting higher sensitivity to the changes in cropland, water regulation and soil formation and retention services show higher sensitivity to the changes in mixed vegetation cover. The current study has thoroughly evaluated the sensitivity and response behavior of six ecoregions of Sundarbans. The outcome of this study will enable the decision-makers, planners, as well as researchers to adopt necessary action plans for strengthening and protecting the natural resources of this biosphere reserve.},

Abstract = {The space and energy sector have similar sustainable ambitions and face similar technological difficulties, providing numerous occasions for learning, collaborating and creating economic and societal value. Adopting space technology and applications within the energy sector offers many high-potential opportunities worth exploring. Space can serve as an enabler for revolutionizing the energy sector by providing information on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency to facilitate the energy transition and support decision and policy-makers in developing, implementing, and monitoring various energy policy areas such as energy resource management and energy transport. Political interest in this topic is rising, and multiple high-level discussions took place in Europe in 2018 to gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and enablers for space as a tool to support European energy policy. This article draws on the insights from two dedicated events to highlight the most prominent opportunities and enablers. The outcomes of these events provide a source of inspiration for policy development, investment decisions, and R\&D proposals to further stimulate space as an enabler for sustainable economic growth in the energy sector.

Abstract = {This study utilized satellite data and the published coefficients about the world and China's ecosystem to analyze the effects of oasis land-use change on ecosystem services in Keriya Oasis where both economic development and arid, fragile ecosystems have strongly affected land use. A sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values. Results indicated that: (1) the total values of ecosystem service in Keriya Oasis were about \$232.2 million, \$212.8 million, and \$207.2 million in 1991, 2002, and 2008, respectively, and the net decline in ecosystem service value was about \$25.0 million within 1991-2008; (2) the aggregated ecosystem service value of medium-cover grassland, wetland, low-cover grassland, cropland, and water body was about 90\% of the total value; (3) waste treatment and soil formation were the top two ecological functions with high service value, and contributing about 41\% of the total services value; and (4) ecosystem services values estimated in this study were inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. Therefore, the estimation was robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. A reasonable land-use plan should be based on rigorous environmental impact analyses for maintaining stability and sustainable development of Keriya Oasis.},

Abstract = {Soil and water conservation ecological compensation can be simply defined as a monetary payment to offset the environmental loss. An illustration is given in this study describing the payment compensation to water resource conservation and soil losses in Erlongshan reservoir catchment, China. A semi-distributed hydrological SWAT model was applied to establish compensation standard considering six scenarios of land use changes by combined application of remote sensing and geographic information systems. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) method is applied to evaluate the function of soil and water conservation, of which marginal opportunity cost and market value methods have been explored calculate the cost and benefit of water and soil conservation ecological function from provider and beneficiaries. Finally the ecological compensation of soil and water conservation for different land-use scenarios is calculated incorporating benefit apportion coefficient. The results provide an economically evaluated and market-oriented standard for the study of eco-compensation of environmental services and will be of great benefit to the implementation of soil and water conservation at a mesoscale catchment scale.},

Title = {Applying the natural capital approach to decision making for the marine environment},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The aspirations for natural capital and ecosystem service approaches to support environmental decision-making have not been fully realised in terms of their actual application in policy and management contexts. Application of the natural capital approach requires a range of methods, which as yet have not been fully tested in the context of decision making for the marine environment. It is unlikely that existing methodologies, which were developed for terrestrial systems and are based on land cover assessment approaches, will ever be feasible in the marine context at the national scale. Land cover approaches are also fundamentally insufficient for the marine environment because they do not take account of the water column, the significant interconnections between spatially disparate components, or the highly dynamic nature of the marine ecosystem, for example the high spatial mobility of many species. Data gaps have been a significant impediment to progress, so alternative methods that use proxies for quality information as well as the opportunities for remote sensing should be explored further. Greater effort to develop methodologies specifically for the marine environment is required, which should be interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral, coherent across policy areas, and applicable across a range of contexts.},

Title = {Integrating Participatory Methods and Remote Sensing to Enhance Understanding of Ecosystem Service Dynamics Across Scales},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The value of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) for informing resource management has long been recognized; however, its incorporation into ecosystem services (ES) assessments remains uncommon. Often ``top-down{''} approaches are utilized, depending on ``expert knowledge{''}, that are not relevant to local resource users. Here we propose an approach for combining participatory methods with remote sensing to provide a more holistic understanding of ES change. Participatory mapping in focus group discussions identified TEK regarding what ES were present, where, and their value to communities. TEK was then integrated with satellite imagery to extrapolate to the landscape-scale. We demonstrate our method for Nyangatom communities in the Lower Omo Valley, Ethiopia, showing for the first time the ES impacts of regional environmental change, including the Gibe III dam, for communities in the Omo River basin. Results confirmed the collapse of flood-retreat cultivation associated with the loss of the annual Omo flood. Communities reported declines in many other provisioning ES, and these results were supported by satellite mapping, which showed substantial reductions in land covers with high ES value (shrubland and wetland), leading to consequent ES declines. Our mixed-methods approach has potential to be applied in other regions to generate locally relevant information for evaluating ES dynamics and improving management of natural resources.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {179-187},
Abstract = {Ecosystems are valuable as well as aesthetic. The natural functions of ecosystems can have profound effects on the economy, and human and wildlife health. The aggregate value of these ``ecosystem services{''} may far exceed the economic value derived from resource extraction or industrial development, especially when considering the costs of restoring ecosystems. There is increasing interest, therefore, in monitoring and protecting ecosystems, and accounting for the biodiversity and services they provide. In 2010, Canada undertook a review of ecosystem status and trends that identified the regions and ecosystems where management is most urgently needed. The authors concluded that more large-scale, long-term, standardized, and spatially complete information is needed for effective monitoring and management. Satellite-based earth observation (EO) tools were seen as ameans of addressing this information need. In a separate exercise, a list of priority questions for conservation policy and management at a national level was produced: the resolution of three-quarters of those questions appears to depend on EO tools to a significant or critical extent. Canada has a long and successful history in all aspects of earth observation, placing it amongst the leaders in the international remote sensing community. Whereas the need for measuring ecosystem services to humans and wildlife is increasingly important, the challenges for doing so are increasingly significant and the technology required is increasingly complex. Overcoming these challenges is necessary to address emerging conservation priorities including measurement of ecosystem attributes to support habitat conservation for Species at Risk, measuring functional capacity of ecosystems to mitigate effects of climate change, monitoring and mitigating effects of resource extraction, and supporting industrial development in Canada's north. Addressing emerging priorities requires dialogue among ecologists and decision makers, coordinated at regional and national scales, and requires drawing on the best EO technologies and infrastructure available. This review highlights the urgency of a coordinated approach for innovative applications of EO tools toward conservation and discusses some of the key elements that might be included and opportunities and challenges that might be encountered, by such an approach.},

Abstract = {The trend of land cover (LC) and land cover change (LCC), both in time and space, was investigated at the Simen Mountains National Park (SMNP), a World Heritage Site located in northern Ethiopia, between 1984 and 2003 using Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). The objective of the study was to generate spatially and temporally quantified information on land cover dynamics, providing the basis for policy/decision makers and resource managers to facilitate biodiversity conservation, including wild animals. Two satellite images (Landsat TM of 1984 and Landsat ETM+ of 2003) were acquired and supervised classification was used to categorize LC types. Ground Control Points were obtained in field condition for georeferencing and accuracy assessment. The results showed an increase in the areas of pure forest (Erica species dominated) and shrubland but a decrease in the area of agricultural land over the 20 years. The overall accuracy and the Kappa value of classification results were 88 and 85\%, respectively. The spatial setting of the LC classes was heterogeneous and resulted from the biophysical nature of SMNP and anthropogenic activities. Further studies are suggested to evaluate the existing LC and LCC in connection with wildlife habitat, conservation and management of SMNP.},

Abstract = {In an effort to better understand the influence of climate change and human activities on ecosystem services, we evaluated change in ecosystem service value (organic matter generation, nutrient accumulation, CO2 fixation, release of O-2, water volume adjustment, water purification, soil fertility protection, and soil fixation) of the Xilin Gol League grassland of Inner Mongolia from 1989 to 2011 using remote sensing and GIS technology. We analyzed the correlation between ecosystem service value and air temperature, and precipitation and then quantitatively differentiated the influence of climate change and human activities on ecosystem service value. The ecosystem service value of 33\% of the study area was reduced by climate change over the study period. Pixel analysis of climate change and human activities revealed that the ecosystem service value of 2\% of the area with increased ecosystem service value was jointly increased by climate change and human activities. In 9\% of the study area, the increasing trend of ecosystem service value caused by climate change prevailed over the declining trend of ecosystem service value caused by human activities. In 2\% of the whole area, the declining trend of ecosystem service value caused by climate change was weaker than the increasing trend of ecosystem service value caused by human activities. Thus, the ecosystem service value of 26\% of the studied area was jointly reduced by climate change and human activities. This research provided evidence of the different influences that climate change and human activities have on ecosystem service value. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Quantitative assessment of urbanization and impacts in the complex of Hue Monuments, Vietnam},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {112},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rapid and extensive urban changes in recent decades have inflicted a multitude of challenges in land-use planning and conservation management, especially for the heritage protection of historic areas. This paper describes the results of an integrated approach to analyzing the potential environmental impacts of urbanization that has profoundly transformed land cover and land-use in Vietnam. A combination of remote-sensing techniques and ancillary indices enables a quantitative evaluation of urbanization impacts on 12 sites in the Complex of Hue Monuments, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, from 1968 to 2016. This approach includes classifying satellite images, analyzing urbanization characteristics with land-cover and land-use change and urbanization indices, and quantifying environmental impacts by ecosystem service values. Object-based classification results indicate that the support vector machine algorithm achieves an optimum overall accuracy of 84.78-86.5\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.82-0.84. Quantitative results of the total absolute loss value reveal the largest negative effect at Hue Citadel and the most positive at Tu' Du'c Tomb, with the overall consequence of urbanization being predominantly negative for the whole complex. The adverse impacts are found primarily from the degradation of agriculture and green space. The negative total loss value also serves as a quantification of impacts from increased urbanization on human well-being. This integrated methodology can be a potentially effective tool to plan for sustainable development in the continual trend toward further urbanization in Vietnam.},

Title = {Dynamic evaluation on ecosystem service values of urban rivers and lakes: A case study of Nanchang City, China},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-170},
Abstract = {Urban rivers and lakes play a significant role in providing ecosystem services, such as water supply, purification, nutrient retention, recreation, aesthetics, and more. However, there is no widely-accepted methodology for how to dynamically evaluate the ecosystem service values of urban rivers and lakes. Using data from survey and remote sensing of Nanchang City, China, this article constructs a conceptual framework based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment to propose an integrated approach to evaluate the ecosystem service values of urban rivers and lakes. Furthermore, the article employs a GIS-based Markov chain model to predict the future probable distribution pattern of land use in Nanchang City, while it uses an artificial neural network model to simulate the potential changing of ecosystem service values. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment-based dynamic evaluation shows that in the first period of 1989-1999, provisioning services are dominant, followed by regulating services, supporting services and cultural services, while during the second period of 1999-2008, regulating services rank firstly in the total change of ecosystem service values, followed by supporting services, cultural services and provisioning services. The artificial neural network-based simulation indicates that the total will slightly increase in line with a small undulation in regulating service values, whilst the most changes brought by the provisioning services will be stable. This study is intended to serve as a tool to be used in decision making for proper and informed urban aquatic ecosystem management.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) are individually and collaboratively strengthening worldwide ability for agencies to manage the disasters lifecycle. The Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) of GEO has, through an agile development process, deployed and tested advanced information systems for Earth Observations based on interoperability arrangements. In particular, AIP has focused on several disaster management scenarios resulting in an architecture that has improved the ready viability and usability of data for disasters. CEOS is constructing a reference architecture, intended to streamline access to satellite data and services for disaster management and risk assessment. The CEOS approach aims to support disaster management activities with satellite information in a holistic fashion, taking account of their overlaps and interdependencies. Jointly GEO and CEOS are now working to align the approaches for disaster management to describe enterprise components and improve understanding of contributed systems and their roles. The coordination has lead to refinements of the Disaster Management Scenario via further implementation in AIP-5. By collaborating via the CEOS working groups and the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) communities of practice, these efforts are intended to engage the international community focused on disaster management and risk assessment to fully utilize remote sensing resources for societal benefit.},

Abstract = {The Earth Observation (EO) satellite data provided within the Copernicus Programme supports the monitoring and sustainable management of agriculture. For example, satellite data are useful for agriculture mapping, crop health monitoring, land planning, disease mitigation, crop yields estimation, precise agriculture, and sustainable irrigation water management. The identification of non-authorised water abstractions for irrigation is of high importance since the drought phenomenon is increasingly in the past decades due to climate change. This aspect is addressed by DIANA - ``Detection and Integrated Assessment of Non-authorised water Abstractions using EO{''}, a project funded by the European Commission in the frame of H2020 (European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation). The project will integrate data acquired by the Sentinel missions (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3) and as well Landsat and MODIS. Other types of data (meteorological, land use/land cover, digital elevation models, soil, etc.) will support the satellite data processing and the generation of value-added products. In addition, the project aims at significantly improve the monitoring and assessment of the water management policies and practices. As the project is in its initial phase, the results presented in this article are preliminary. The project will demonstrate the relevance of EO data for sustainable agriculture management and will bring societal and environmental benefits to the end users.},

Abstract = {In order to effectively manage natural resources at national scales national decision makers require data on the natural capital which supports the delivery of Ecosystem Services (ES). Key data sources used for the provision of national natural capital metrics include Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS), which provides information on land cover at an increasing range of resolutions, and field survey, which can provide very high resolution data on ecosystem components, but is constrained in its potential coverage by resource requirements. Here we combine spatially representative field data from a historic national survey of Great Britain (Countryside Survey (CS)) with concurrent low resolution SRS data land cover map within modelling frameworks to produce national natural capital metrics. We present three examples of natural capital metrics; top soil carbon, headwater stream quality and nectar species plant richness which show how highly resolved, but spatially representative field data can be used to significantly enhance the potential of low resolution SRS land cover data for providing national spatial data on natural capital metrics which have been linked to Ecosystem Services (ES). We discuss the role of such metrics in evaluations of ecosystem service provision and areas of further development to improve their utility for stakeholders. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Revealing preferences for urban biodiversity as an environmental good},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {212},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Biodiversity is essential for human well-being, but little is known about urban dwellers' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban biodiversity. Since a large share of the global population concentrates in cities, urban areas are a critical space where humans and nature interact and biodiversity-related preferences are formed. This study investigates urban dwellers' WTP for biodiversity using a revealed-preference approach on a real estate dataset of approximately 140,000 unique entries of rental and sales transactions of apartments. Three biodiversity indicators were used to investigate heterogeneous preferences for biodiversity as an environmental good. The findings indicate that WTP for biodiversity is positive and economically significant. This implies that urban biodiversity conservation and enhancement can result in co-benefits for the local urban population. Moreover, this study identifies a satellite-based biodiversity indicator as a potential alternative to conventional species richness indicators. This finding is significant for benefit transfer studies and primary biodiversity valuation in regions with limited data availability. The results can inform biodiversity conservation and management decisions by highlighting the importance of incorporating urban biodiversity in biodiversity policies.},

Abstract = {Since 1972, the UNESCO ``World Heritage Convention{''} offers an international canvas for conservation and management that targets areas of high cultural and environmental significance. To support the designation of areas within the 36.000 km(2) of New Caledonia coral reefs and lagoons as a World Heritage Site, the natural value and diversity of the proposed zones needed to be demonstrated. To exhaustively identify each configuration of shallow habitats, high resolution remote sensing images were used to select the sampling sites. This optimal scheme resulted in the selection of nearly 1300 sampling sites, and was then simplified to render its application realistic. In the final sampling plan, only the most common or the most remarkable coral zones were selected. Following this selection, in situ habitat and fish surveys were conducted in 2006-2008 in five large areas spanning a 600 km-long latitudinal gradient. Habitats were described using line-intercept transects in parallel with underwater visual census of indicator and commercial coral reef fish species. We report here on the results achieved in terms of: (i) the actual diversity of coral habitats captured by the remote sensing based sampling strategy, (ii) the different reef fish communities captured from the different sites, and (iii) how well they represent New Caledonia diversity. We discuss the possible generalization of this scheme to other sites, in the context of World Heritage Site selection and for other large-scale conservation planning activities.

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},

Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {ERA-PLANET is a wide European network comprised of 118 researchers from 35 partner institutions located in 18 countries, aiming to strengthen the European Research Area in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) in coherence with the European participation to the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and the program for the establishment of a European capacity for Earth Observation, COPERNICUS. It will provide more accurate, comprehensive, and authoritative information to policy and decision-makers in key societal benefit areas (SBAs), under the umbrellas of dedicated projects in the topics of: smart cities and resilient societies; resource efficiency and environmental management; global changes and environmental treaties; polar areas and natural resources. ERA-PLANET will provide advanced decision support tools and technologies aimed to better monitor our global environment and share the information and knowledge in different domains of EO by launching joint transnational calls along the above four strands. The concept of the project that tackles with strand 1, as well as an example of a specific application fitting in, are described, aspiring to promote and coordinate the ``smart-city{''} approach into a European network of cities and non-European follower cities, serving the need for a common approach to enhance environmental and societal resilience to air pollution, urban growth, and urban heat islands, as well as other natural/manmade stresses and relevant impacts. This is achieved through the synergy among technology, government, and society, while at the same time creating bridges between local/national initiatives with GEO/GEOSS, COPERNICUS, and other smart cities and GEO relevant projects. The project addresses initiatives in European cities but also specific issues dealing with air quality management in other parts of the world. Finally, it places major emphasis on fully exploiting key-enabling technologies and firmly addressing interoperability issues, in the context of big ``smart city{''} data, and open science.},

Title = {Do users benefit from additional information in support of operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin?},

Pages = {5901-5917},

Abstract = {We follow a user-based approach to examine how information supports operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin and how these can benefit from additional information such as from remote sensing data. First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information. Risk-averse farmers were found to benefit least from the additional information, while less risk-averse farmers stand to benefit most as the additional information helps them take better informed decisions when weighing their options.},

Abstract = {Every year, an average of eight new civilian remote sensing satellite missions are launched. Cumulatively, over 250 such missions, each with a cost equivalent in current value to between \$US 100 million to \$US 1000 million, have been sponsored by space agencies in perhaps two dozen countries. These missions produce data and information products which are vital for informed decision making all over the world, on matters relating to natural resource exploitation, health and safety, sustainable national development, infrastructure planning, and a host of other applications. By contributing to better scientific understanding of global changes in the atmosphere, land surface, oceans and ice caps, these silently orbiting sentinels in the sky make it possible for governments and industries to make wiser environmental policy decisions and support the economic development needs of humanity. The international Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) is the premier world body for co-ordinating and planning civilian satellite missions for Earth observation. Through its technical working groups and special task teams, it endeavours to: maximise the international benefits from Earth observation satellites; and harmonise practice in calibration, validation, data managment and information systems for Earth observation. CEOS encompasses not only space agencies (data providers), but also the great international scientific and operational programs which rely on Earth science data from space. The user organisations affiliated with CEOS, together with the mission operators, attempt to reconcile user needs with the complex set of considerations - including national interests, cost, schedule which affect the undertaking of space missions. Without such an internationally co-ordinated consensual approach, there is a much greater risk of waste through duplication, and of missed opportunity, or through the absence of measurements of some vital physical or biological parameter by space borne sensors. Mechanisms used by CEOS to carry out these tasks are built upon consensus and understanding, as well as on technology transfer between countries. An area of recent heightened endeavour in CEOS has been to determine and address the special needs of developing countries in respect of Earth observation data. In the next several years, a new wave of Earth observation will break, as the private sector, revitalised with decommissioned military technology, brings exciting new capabilities to international remote sensing. With rapidly burgeoning markets in spatial information or geomatics, as well as the continuing thirst of science programs for spatial information, there is a challenge upon the international space community to reassess continually, the most expedient and socially constructive means of making available in a fair and open way, geographically-reference information obtained with space observation systems.

Abstract = {With the rapid advancement of urbanization and industrialization, the contradiction between the social economy and resources and the environment has become increasingly prominent. On the basis of limited land resources, the way to promote multi-objective comprehensive development such as economic, social development and ecological and environmental protection through structure and layout regulation, so as to maximize regional comprehensive benefits, is an important task of current land spatial planning. Our aim is to obtain land-use-change data in the study area using remote-sensing data inversion and multiple-model simulation. Based on land suitability evaluation, we predict and optimize the land use structure of the study area in 2030 and evaluate and compare ecosystem services. Based on remote-sensing images and eco-environmental data from 1985 to 2014 in the study area, land use/land cover change (LUCC) and future simulation data were obtained by using supervised classification, landscape metrics and the CA-Markov model. The ecosystem services were evaluated by the InVEST model. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to evaluate the land suitability for LUCC. Finally, the LUCC in 2030 under two different scenarios, Scenario\_1 (prediction) and Scenario\_2 (optimization), were evaluated, and the ecosystem service functions were compared. In the last 30 years, the landscape in the study area has gradually fragmented, and the built-up land has expanded rapidly, increased by one-third, mainly at the cost of cropland, orchards and wasteland. According to the suitability evaluation, giving priority to the land use types with higher environmental requirements will ensure the study area has a higher ecosystem service value. The rapid development of urbanization has a far-reaching impact on regional LUCC. Intensive land resources need reasonable and scientific land use planning, and land use planning should be based on the suitability evaluation of land resources, which can improve the regional ecosystem service function.},

Abstract = {Climate change and human activities in high-altitude, cold pasture areas with fragile environments can cause land use changes that significantly affect ecosystem services and functions. Our study investigated changes in ecosystem services in response to land use changes caused mainly by climate change and human activities on the Zoige Plateau, a region in the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau with large areas of grassland and wetland. The aim was to provide guidance for sustainable management of high, cold pasture areas. We used remote sensing to evaluate land use changes, and then applied a fast method for evaluating ecological service values in 1975, 1990, and 2005. The value of ecosystem services dropped from 61.46 x 10(9) yuan in 1975 to 58.61 x 10(9) yuan in 2005, exhibiting an accelerating rate of decrease, mainly due to the degradation of wetlands and, to a lesser extent, high-cover grassland. Waste treatment and water supply were the two largest service functions, contributing about 42\% of the total service value. The results suggest that future land use planning should emphasize the protection of wetlands, high-cover grassland, and woodland, which have the highest ecosystem service values and showed the greatest degradation during the study period.

Title = {Potential of Virtual Earth Observation Constellations in Archaeological Research},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Earth observation sensors continually provide datasets with different spectral and spatial characteristics, while a series of pre- and postprocessing techniques are needed for calibration purposes. Nowadays, a variety of satellite images have become accessible to researchers, while big data cloud platforms allow them to deal with an extensive number of datasets. However, there is still difficulty related to these sensors meeting specific needs and challenges such as those of cultural heritage and supporting archaeological research world-wide. The harmonization and synergistic use of different sensors can be used in order to maximize the impact of earth observation sensors and enhance their benefit to the scientific community. In this direction, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has proposed the concept of virtual constellations, which is defined as ``a coordinated set of space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners that focuses on observing a particular parameter or set of parameters of the Earth system{''}. This paper provides an overview of existing and future earth observation sensors, the various levels of interoperability as proposed by Wulder et al., and presents some preliminary results from the Thessalian plain in Greece using integrated optical and radar Sentinel images. The potential for archaeolandscape studies using virtual constellations is discussed here.},

Abstract = {Natural resources dependence of mountain communities, rapid social and developmental changes, disaster proneness and climate change are conceived as the critical factors regulating sustainable Himalayan mountain development. The Himalayan region posed by typical geographic settings, diverse physical and cultural diversity present a formidable challenge to collect and manage data, information and understands varied socio-ecological settings. Recent advances in earth observation, near real-time data, in-situ measurements and in combination of information and communication technology have transformed the way we collect, process, and generate information and how we use such information for societal benefits. Glacier dynamics, land cover changes, disaster risk reduction systems, food security and ecosystem conservation are a few thematic areas where geospatial information and knowledge have significantly contributed to informed decision making systems over the region. The emergence and adoption of near-real time systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), board-scale citizen science (crowd-sourcing), mobile services and mapping, and cloud computing have paved the way towards developing automated environmental monitoring systems, enhanced scientific understanding of geophysical and biophysical processes, coupled management of socio-ecological systems and community based adaptation models tailored to mountain specific environment. There are differentiated capacities among the ICIMOD regional member countries with regard to utilization of earth observation and geospatial technologies. The region can greatly benefit from a coordinated and collaborative approach to capture the opportunities offered by earth observation and geospatial technologies. The regional level data sharing, knowledge exchange, and Himalayan GEO supporting geospatial platforms, spatial data infrastructure, unique region specific satellite systems to address trans-boundary challenges would go a long way in evolving sustainable Himalayan livelihoods.},

Abstract = {Protected areas, or parks, remain a major focus for biodiversity conservation globally. The goal of this special issue is to bring together a broad-based set of papers that examine the human dimensions of forest conservation in protected areas across the world. Park landscapes are often characterized by biological and socio-political dilemmas due to conflicts between biodiversity goals and local livelihood strategies. To best inform policy. research should seek to document the livelihoods of people in the landscapes around parks and investigate the impacts that parks and biodiversity outside the parks have on their livelihoods and activities in turn. Given the current debate on the effectiveness of protected area management, there is an urgent need for careful, quantitative evaluations that analyze the impact of exclusionary policies of protected area management on forest cover over time. Each of the four papers in this issue deals with a distinct case study. using different methods and questions. This research illustrates the utility of remote sensing. spatial statistics. fragmentation analyses and modeling for the study of parks. and for evaluation of the potential effectiveness of different management strategies in protected areas. These studies also underline the need for satellite image analysis to be supplemented by detailed field research to provide insights into the social and institutional processes that impact land cover change and forest conservation.},

Title = {Research on Service Value and Adaptability Zoning of Grassland Ecosystem in Ethiopia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The evaluation of the ecosystem service value (ESV) and its regionalization toward coordinating ecological protection and socioeconomic development is of great significance. In this study, we developed a classification method based on the Random Forest algorithm and a feature optimization method to identify grassland types. Then, we proposed an approach to quantitatively evaluate the ESV of the grassland ecosystem in Ethiopia, in which net primary production derived from remote sensing was used to evaluate organic matter production value (ESV1), promoting nutrient circulation value (ESV2), and gas regulation value (ESV3), the RUSLE model was used to evaluate soil conservation value (ESV4), and cumulative rainfall was used to calculate water conservation value (ESV5). By integrating the mean ESV under various influencing factors, the zoning map of grassland ecosystem service value was obtained. Our study found that more fine grassland types can be well classified with the overall accuracy of 86.52\%. And the classification results are the basis of the ESV analysis. The total ESV of grassland ecosystems was found to be USD 105,221.72 million, of which ESV4 was the highest, accounting for 44.09\% of the total ESV. The spatial analysis of ESV showed that the differences were due to the impacts of grassland types, elevation, slope, and rainfall. It was found that the grassland is suitable to grow in the elevation zone between approximately 1000 and 2000 m, and the larger the slope and rainfall are, the greater the mean ESV is. The zoning map was used to conclude that the areas from approximately the fourth to sixth level (only 34.78\% of the total grassland area, but 65.94\% of the total ESV) have better growth status and development potential. The results provide references and bases to support the local coordination and planning of various grassland resources and form reasonable resource utilization and protection measures.},

Title = {Variations of Ecosystem Service Value in Response to Land-Use Change in the Kashgar Region, Northwest China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Increasing anthropogenic activities have significantly altered ecosystems in arid oasis regions. Estimating the impact on a wide range of ecosystem services is important for decision making and the sustainable development of these regions. This study analyzed time-series Landsat data to determine the influences of oasis land-use changes on the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region in Northwest China. The following results were found. The total value of the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region were approximately \$10,845.3, \$11,218.6, \$10,291.7, and \$10,127.3 million in 1986, 1996, 2005, and 2015, respectively. The water supply, waste treatment, biodiversity protection, and recreation and cultural services were the four ecosystem services with the highest service value, contributing 77.05\% of the total ecosystem services. The combined contribution rate of food production and raw material value was only about 4.02\%, relatively small. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated total ecosystem service value (ESV) for this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. The findings of this study will be crucial for maintaining the stability and sustainable development of the oasis region, where socio-economic development and the integrity of the natural ecosystem complement each other. Furthermore, the results provide a scientific basis for decision makers in land use management, and provide a reference for researchers in the Northwest China.},

Abstract = {Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a very challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always the key features for classifying mixed pixels. This paper proposes an approach for pixel classification using a hybrid approach of rough set theory and particle swarm optimization methods. Rough set theory deals with incompleteness and vagueness among data, which property may be utilized for detecting arbitrarily shaped and sized clusters in satellite images. To enable fast automatic clustering of multispectral remote sensing imagery, in this article, we propose a rough set-based heuristical decision rule generation algorithm. For rough-set-theoretic decision rule generation, each cluster is classified using heuristically searched optimal reducts to overcome overlapping cluster problem. This proposed unsupervised algorithm is able to identify clusters utilizing particle swarm optimization based on rough set generated membership values. This approach addresses the overlapping regions in remote sensing images by uncertainties using rough set generated membership values. Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, inspired from the social behavior of bird flock. Therefore, to predict pixel classification of remote sensing imagery, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based membership correction approach over rough set-based initial decision rule generation. We demonstrate our algorithm for segmenting a LANDSAT image of the catchment area of Ajoy River. The newly developed algorithm is compared with fuzzy C-means and K-means algorithms. The new algorithm generated clustered regions are verified with the available ground truth knowledge. The validity analysis is performed to demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms with K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms.},

Abstract = {Thuringia in the German midmountain range is facing several environmental problems like river straightening resulting in frequent floods, the degradation of wetlands, the pollution of drinking water reservoirs by non point source entering of solute nutrients as well as the decrease of biodiversity which need actual and area covering earth observation data for management decisions. Data from various sensors of the visible, infrared and the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum are evaluated for the derivation of thematic maps. The Remote Sensing Lab of the Department of Geoinformatics of the FSU Jena is cooperating with the departments of nature preservation, regional and water resources management of the Thuringian Environmental Agency (TLU) or the Thuringian Reservoir Administration (TTV), providing them with information derived from remote sensing data for their benefit in practical applications. The remote sensing evaluations ser:ie as input data for geographical information systems or hydrological models in general and concentrate on water balance and water quality. The parameters derived cover the following topics: soil moisture, albedo, start of transpiration, surface temperature, LAI - NDVI - fractional vegetation cover, land cover, catchment topography, water quality and are applied in the various studies. Objectives, methods and validated results will be presented for all the example studies. As conclusion and outlook the paper will present the possibilities of the use and operationalisation of remote sensing data for environmental applications in governmental agencies.},

Abstract = {Urban sprawl and a policy of converting farmland to woodland and grassland in the fragile ecological environments of the Loess Plateau of China can cause complex land use changes that significantly affect ecosystem services and functions. This study investigated changes in ecosystem services in response to land use changes caused primarily by human activities in Taiyuan City, the capital of Shanxi Province. Our aim was to provide guidance for sustainable urban development in fragile ecological environments undergoing rapid urbanization. We used remote sensing to evaluate land use changes, and applied a fast method for evaluating ecological service values at two points in time: 1990 and 2005. The ecosystem services value dropped from 743.53 x 10(6) yuan (1990) to 723.45 x 10(6) yuan (2005), mostly because farmland and grassland decreased. Over 95\% of the total service value was attributable to woodland and farmland. Soil formation and protection, and water supply were the two largest service functions, contributing about 32\% of the total service value. The results suggest that future land use planning should control the encroachment of urban areas on farmland, grassland, and woodland, and continue the policy of converting poor farmland to woodland and grassland.

Title = {Targeting the Influences of Under-Lake Coal Mining Based on the Value of Wetland Ecosystem Services: What and How?},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Under the growing restrictions of the Chinese eco-environmental policies, the impact of under-lake coal mining on wetlands is receiving increasing attention from both coal mining enterprises and local governments. This paper focuses on the impact of under-lake coal mining on the Nansi Lake wetland from 1991 to 2021. Field measurements, resident surveys, and remote sensing inversion were comprehensively employed to quantitatively assess the impact. The calculation of the assessment indicators refers to the elastic coefficient, the information for which comes from four major categories of ecosystem service values (ESVs) and eight sub-ESVs. According to the results of the remote sensing interpretation and inversion, by 2021 the range had enlarged by 32.3 km(2), and the water depth had increased by 1.9 m in the mining-disturbed area relative to 1991. The ESV fluctuations in the Nansi Lake wetland also exhibited a generally increasing trend over time. Our results show that the under-lake mining disturbs the ESVs, but the disturbance is not sufficient to result in significant consequences. Based on the data analysis, we suggest several well-directed, appropriate restoration strategies to achieve the desired objectives and target the response of the ESV changes. Such measures will help to relieve some of the anxiety and concern about the wetland changes caused by the under-lake mining.},

Title = {Study on Meteorological Disaster Monitoring of Field Fruit Industry by Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Meteorological disasters have brought a great negative impact on people's lives. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the detection technology of meteorological disasters has been continuously improved. At present, satellite remote sensing detection technology has made gratifying achievements, and it has a good application in meteorological disaster prediction. In this paper, the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the process of meteorological disaster monitoring is discussed in depth. In traditional work, the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring is the key and difficult point of meteorological disaster prevention. Using satellite telemetry to monitor meteorological disasters can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring, provide reasonable solutions and decision-making basis for meteorological disaster prevention, and achieve the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. This paper introduces the basic principle, technical system, and important role of satellite remote sensing technology, expounds on the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the monitoring of agricultural meteorological disasters such as water, drought, freezing, and hail, and provides a scientific reference for farmers, agricultural sustainability, and agricultural decision-making. The continuous development of our country's modern social economy has put forward higher requirements for agricultural production. Traditional monitoring technology can no longer meet the needs of agricultural meteorological disaster monitoring. The scientific application of remote sensing monitoring technology has important value, which can effectively improve the detection level and make it have higher accuracy and real-time performance, thereby promoting modern agricultural production in China. Based on the analysis of the application value of remote sensing monitoring technology, this paper comprehensively discusses the specific conditions of different disasters monitored by remote sensing monitoring technology in agricultural production.},

Title = {Solutions for the commercialization challenges of Horizon Europe and earth observation consortia: co-creation, innovation, decision-making, tech-transfer, and sustainability actions},
Journal = {ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 6},
Abstract = {European Community (EC) Horizon-funded projects and Earth Observation-based Consortia aim to create sustainable value for Space, Land, and Oceans. They typically focus on addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many of these projects (e.g. Commercialization and Innovation Actions) have an ambitious challenge to ensure that partners share core competencies to simultaneously achieve technological and commercial success and sustainability after the end of the EC funds. To achieve this ambitious challenge, Horizon projects must have a proper governance model and a systematized process that can manage the existing paradoxical tensions involving numerous European partners and their respective agendas and stakeholders. This article presents the VCW-Value Creation Wheel (Lages in J Bus Res 69: 4849-4855, 2016), as a framework that has its roots back in 1995 and has been used since 2015 in the context of numerous Space Business, Earth Observation, and European Community (EC) projects, to address complex problems and paradoxical tensions. In this article, we discuss six of these paradoxical tensions that large Horizon Consortia face in commercialization, namely when managing innovation ecosystems, co-creating, taking digitalization, decision-making, tech-transfer, and sustainability actions. We discuss and evaluate how alliance partners could find the optimal balance between (1) cooperation, competition, and coopetition perspectives; (2) financial, environmental, and social value creation; (3) tech-push and market-pull orientations; (4) global and local market solutions; (5) functionality driven and human-centered design (UX/UI); (6) centralized and decentralized online store approaches. We discuss these challenges within the case of the EC H2020 NextLand project answering the call for greening the economy in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We analyze NextLand Online Store, and its Business and Innovation Ecosystem while considering the input of its different stakeholders, such as NextLand's commercial team, service providers, users, advisors, EC referees, and internal and external stakeholders. Preliminary insights from a twin project in the field of Blue Economy (EC H2020 NextOcean), are also used to support our arguments. Partners, referees, and EC officers should address the tensions mentioned in this article during the referee and approval processes in the pre-grant and post-grant agreement stages. Moreover, we propose using the Value Creation Wheel (VCW) method and the VCW meta-framework as a systematized process that allows us to co-create and manage the innovation ecosystem while engaging all the stakeholders and presenting solutions to address these tensions. The article concludes with theoretical implications and limitations, managerial and public policy implications, and lessons for Horizon Europe, earth observation, remote sensing, and space business projects.},

Number = {7},

Abstract = {The results of direct and indirect economic valuation in 2005 of the ``El Robledal{''} Forest Reserve are presented. This reserve is an Andean dry forest, located in the Guacheta and Raquira counties, in the Departments of Cundinamarca and Boyaca, respectively, Colombia, within the jurisdiction of the CAR, the regional environmental protection agency. The reserve is between 2,700 and 3,200 MASL and an area of 400.2 ha. Based on a 1994 LANDSAT TM satellite image, we estimated the forest cover of the reserve in just 173 ha. The forest was characterized in structure and composition with 12 randomly established plots of 2 x 50 m. The dominant woody species is Oak (Quercus humboldtii Bonpl.). Finally, we proceeded to find the direct economic values of productivity and subsistence, as well as indirect values rendered from environmental services: the value of timber, the value derived from the collection of firewood and the production of charcoal by the population living around the reserve and the value rendered by carbon sequestration. For the above purposes, economic valuation methods, such as market prices, contingent valuation, avoided or induced costs, based on transfer of benefits were used. It is concluded that the highest price is associated with the value of timber. The subsistence value, associated with illegal firewood collection and charcoal production is insignificant but also a subject of concern. A policy recommendation would be to transfer the subsistence value to the protection of the reserve. In light of sustainable development and ecological time, this resource should be considered non-renewable as it is a very old reserve.},

Title = {Assessing forest recreational potential from social media data and remote sensing technologies data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Conventionally, forest management plans have focused on ensuring a continuous provision of wood. In recent years, political agendas worldwide have recognized the importance of forests' cultural ecosystem services, such as recreation. However, the inclusion of such values in management plans is challenging, and forest managers require novel methodologies and indicators to characterize forest recreation demand and provision. To this end, in this study, we combine remote sensing technologies and crowdsourced social media data to map and value the forest recreational potential of BC's provincial parks system. We trained and deployed convolutional neural networks to automatically classify the content of over 60,000 Flickr images, we then created a random forest model to identify the variables that influence the visitors' choice of recreational activity. These models allowed us to map the most likely recreational activities to occur in BC's provincial parks and perform a spatially explicit assessment of the consumer surplus that these activities generate with a benefit transfer approach. Our findings suggest that the most influential variables in determining the choice of forest recreational activities are topo-graphic, while anthropogenic impacts and forest biometrics variables have less effect. Furthermore, the outcomes of our study support the proposition that the integration of social media and remote sensing technologies allow, in the future, park managers to tailor the management of recreational services to forest visitors' needs.},

Abstract = {In many attempts, remote sensing has been utilized to assist agriculture in the best management practice to improve production and minimize its impact on the environment. In palm oil agriculture in Indonesia, conversion of high conservation value forest into palm oil plantation area is a continuous major environmental concern. Many efforts have been done using remote sensing technology such as Landsat 8 and Landsat 4-5 TM imagery to obtain information. However, the degree in which the information has been used effectively to assist policy and other decision, limited research has been done. To add to the knowledge, this paper aims to present a review of recent studies on remote sensing and exemplify some of the main challenges to optimally support the attempt to minimize deforestation, at the same time improve palm oil production in Indonesia.},

Title = {On How Crowdsourced Data and Landscape Organisation Metrics Can Facilitate the Mapping of Cultural Ecosystem Services: An Estonian Case Study},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Social media continues to grow, permanently capturing our digital footprint in the form of texts, photographs, and videos, thereby reflecting our daily lives. Therefore, recent studies are increasingly recognising passively crowdsourced geotagged photographs retrieved from location-based social media as suitable data for quantitative mapping and assessment of cultural ecosystem service (CES) flow. In this study, we attempt to improve CES mapping from geotagged photographs by combining natural language processing, i.e., topic modelling and automated machine learning classification. Our study focuses on three main groups of CESs that are abundant in outdoor social media data: landscape watching, active outdoor recreation, and wildlife watching. Moreover, by means of a comparative viewshed analysis, we compare the geographic information system- and remote sensing-based landscape organisation metrics related to landscape coherence and colour harmony. We observed the spatial distribution of CESs in Estonia and confirmed that colour harmony indices are more strongly associated with landscape watching and outdoor recreation, while landscape coherence is more associated with wildlife watching. Both CES use and values of landscape organisation indices are land cover-specific. The suggested methodology can significantly improve the state-of-the-art with regard to CES mapping from geotagged photographs, and it is therefore particularly relevant for monitoring landscape sustainability.},

Title = {The economic impact analysis of satellite development and its application in Korea},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {177},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many countries began satellite development from the beginning of the space era and especially after the Apollo era. Korea started satellite development in 1992 by launching small satellite KITSAT-1 more than 20 years after the Apollo 11 lunar landing. Since then, Korea has developed 15 satellites including eight small satellites, five low earth orbit (LEO) Korean Multi-Purpose Satellites (KOMPSAT), and two geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites. Korea is currently developing KOMPSAT 6 and 7 with advanced optical and radar observation capability, GEO-KOMPSAT 2B, middle-sized Compact Advanced Satellites (CAS), and next generation small satellite (NEXTSat). These efforts will raise Korea's satellite technology to the next level. To prepare strategies for efficient and effective development of satellites, it is essential to elaborately assess the economic impacts of previous satellite development projects and their application. In this paper, we examine the economic impacts of Korea's investment into the research and development of national satellites, and their application in the perspective of satellite value chain. To this end, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis on the development of representative satellites. As non-economic impacts, we examined the change of technology independence and technology level, network building effect, and aerospace ecosystem activation effects.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Variation of Karst Ecosystem Service Values and Its Correlation with Environmental Factors in Northwest Guangxi, China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {48},

Abstract = {In this investigation we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of ecosystem service values (ESVs) and its correlation with numerous environmental factors (EFs) for the karst region of Northwest Guangxi, China, from 1985 to 2005 using remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical techniques. The results indicate that historically ESVs for this karst region decreased from 1985 (109.652 billion Yuan) to 1990 (88.789 billion Yuan) and then increased at the turn of the twenty-first century. However, the ESVs in both 2000 (103.384 billion Yuan) and 2005 (106.257 billion Yuan) never achieved the level recorded in 1985. The total of nutrient cycling, organic production and gas regulation combined were 72.69, 64.57, 70.18 and 72.10\% of ESVs in 1985, 1990, 2000 and 2005, respectively. In contrast, the ESVs of water conservation, soil reservation, recreation and culture were determined to be relatively low contributing only 17.44, 23.82, 19.26 and 24.76\% of total ESVs, respectively, during these four years. With regards to the spatial distribution of ESVs, larger values were recorded in the west and smaller ones recorded in the east. The most significant factors that were deemed to influence ESVs are annual rainfall, per capita cropland, slope and vegetation coverage. Annual rainfall and slope exert a negative force, whereas per capita cropland and vegetation coverage exert a positive force on ESVs. The results of the study would suggest that ecosystem conditions of this important karst region have been improved as the result of the implementation of rocky desertification control policies.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing technology offers an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of site-specific information about field characteristics such as pest populations. Coupled with variable rate application technologies, this added information has the potential to provide environmental benefits through reduced pesticide applications. However, producers face a complicated adoption decision because output prices and crop yields are uncertain. A model is developed to examine the potential value of remote sensing information to pesticide applications in an option-value framework under uncertainty. Simulations suggest that remote sensing information could decrease pesticide use, but uncertainty and irreversibility are likely to limit technological adoption by farmers. Potential cost-share subsidies are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Taking HaDaQi industrial corridor, Heilongjiang Province, China as a case study area, this paper examined the trend of land use changes during 1990-2005 used three LANDSAT TM and/or ETM data sets, and quantified their influences on natural ecosystem service values. During the whole period of study, Land Use/Cover Type changed immensely in the study area, the development of land is increasing continuously. The total value of ecosystem services in HaDaQi Industrial Corridor declined by 18.23 billion yuan. We also found that the contribution of construction, reclamation and water shortage increased during the 15-year time period. We conclude that future land-use policy formulation should give precedence to the conservation of these ecosystems over uncontrolled construction, reclamation, and water consumption and that further land development should be based on rigorous environmental impact analyses.},

Title = {The balance between economic development and ecosystem service value in the process of land urbanization: A case study of China's land urbanization from 2000 to 2015},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Beginning in the 21st century, the world entered a stage of the rapid development of land urbanization. In general, land urbanization sacrifices ecosystem service value for economic value. Optimizing the spatial pattern of land urbanization is the best means of balancing economic development and ecosystem service value. Taking China as an example, through remote sensing and GIS methods, this paper studies the basic situation of regional land urbanization and the distribution of other types of ecosystems from 2000 to 2015, assessing the relationship between the characteristics of regional land urbanization and economic growth and the value cost of ecosystem services. The results show that the spatial differences of land urbanization practices in China is significant and that the extensive development of land urbanization is a serious issue; the urbanization speed of provinces and cities with a larger scale of land urbanization is faster; the intensive, economical and centralized utilization of land urbanization is an effective way to improve GDP per unit area; and the ecosystem service value cost of land urbanization varies significantly among different ecosystem types and regions. For example, the loss of the ecosystem service value of wetland ecosystems due to land urbanization is the greatest, and the cost of the ecosystem service value of Inner Mongolia per 100 million yuan of new GDP is 13.1-fold that of Shanghai. Therefore, to improve the GDP output per unit area and reduce the value cost of ecosystem services, this study draws a series of conclusions and puts forward corresponding policy suggestions that clarify the development mode and priority development area of land urbanization.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Dabie Mountain area is a typical poverty-stricken area in China. It is of great significance to evaluate the ecosystem service value and its impact mechanism toward optimizing the ecological structure and coordinating ecological protection and economic development. This study determined the ecosystem service value coefficient and calculated the ecosystem service value (ESV) according to the regional economic development in the past ten years, and the ESV was spatialized based on NPP, which is closely related to ecological function. The temporal and spatial variation of ESV was then analyzed, and an RDE index was proposed to describe its response to land cover change. Further, the relationship between ESV and several parameters that reflect socioeconomic development was researched and analyzed. The results show that the total ESV in the study area first decreased and then increased, with an overall increase of CNY 3.895 billion. Among the land cover types, forest land had the greatest impact, contributing more than 70\%. In the ecosystem service functions, the contribution of regulation function exceeded 50\%. ESV was found to be sensitive to land cover change. On average, every 1 km(2) change leads to an ESV change of about CNY 1 million. Socioeconomic-related parameters were negatively correlated with ESV, among which the correlation with per capita disposable income was the weakest, indicating that there was no obvious contradiction between human well-being and ESV. Therefore, a path for harmonious symbiotic development can be found between man and nature.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Different management modes can influence land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC), resulting in changes in ecosystem service values (ESV). However, few studies compared the differences in ESV under different management modes. The objective was to analyze the impact of different management modes on ESV. Multisource remote sensing images were used to obtain the LULCC data for Fujin City over four periods (1986, 1995, 2005, and 2015). We modified the equivalent value factors method by crop yield to estimate the ESV in different years. Statistics show that paddy increased from 59.2 to 1341.8 km(2) in the agricultural region, whereas it increased from 60.1 to 2236.3 km(2) in the reclamation region during 1986 to 2015. The total ESV decreased by 49.0\% and 43.4\%, respectively, in the agricultural region and reclamation region. The agricultural products function exhibited a larger increase and the freshwater supply function exhibited a greater decrease in the reclamation region than in the agricultural region. Two regions can learn from each other and carry out innovations in land management approaches to promote common developmental goals.

Title = {Impact of Global Earth Observation - Systemic View across GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURES RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {216-243},
Abstract = {The work of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is perceived as instrumental to attain sustainable development goals and to be a major driver of how the society-technology-environment system is managed. However, appropriate scientific methodologies to assess the benefits of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and validate investments in Earth observation infrastructure have been missing. This paper presents a systems approach to measure and analyze the impact of Global Earth Observation across the nine Societal Benefit Areas defined by GEO. The methodological framework presented here was developed and applied to be complete across space, time and sectors through integration and aggregation. Apart from the general assessment framework, we present some specifics of the numerical tool, which is based on System Dynamics modeling and simulation technique. Our results indicate that though the total system benefits are strongly policy dependent, improvements of GEOSS per se and data availability and interoperability, the accrued benefits are large and have a great potential shaping mankind's course to sustainability.},

Title = {Effects of urbanisation on ecosystem service values: A case study of Nha Trang, Vietnam.},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {128},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have significantly reshaped the environmental landscape and altered land composition, thereby negatively affecting the structures and functions of ecosystem. Paradoxically, complex conditions and procedures of ecosystem operations generate a range of goods and services on which humans rely upon to thrive. This study examines the land-use transition and ecosystem service value changes in Nha Trang, Vietnam in order to understand and quantify the impacts of urbanisation patterns on ecosystems. Changes in the value of ecosystem services were acquired based on modified value coefficients from previous studies and land-use/land-cover information derived from Landsat satellite imagery in the years 1990, 2000, 2011, and 2020. The results show a significant decrease in ecosystem service value associated with the expansion and densification of urban areas over the past 30 years. Total annual value increased from 148.7 million USD in 1990-172.2 million USD in 2000 due to the success of forest rehabilitation efforts, followed by a decline to 149.3 million USD in 2020 because of the rapid development of urban agglomeration at the expense of cultivated land. Drawing from the outcomes, we suggest that the priority of regional land-use planning should be given to ecosystem-based ap-proaches rather than inadequate urban expansion. Hence, guidelines to incorporate the ecosystem service concept into urban planning are proposed to promote climate-resilient city management and sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Analysis of historic and contemporary high-resolution imagery can help to fill knowledge gaps in land cover and management history in locations where documentation is non-existent or records are difficult to access. Historic imagery dating back to the 1960s can be used to structure quantitative investigation and mapping of land use and land cover change across space and time to enhance earth science, policy, and social science research. Imagery can further inform municipal planning and implementation in areas of natural resource allocation, infrastructure, and hazard mitigation. For management and public education, historic imagery can help people to understand environmental processes and the impacts of human activity in the local environment. Here we emphasize the value of high-resolution historic satellite imagery from the Corona and Keyhole satellite programs to inform environmental research, public education, and environmental management. Within the Region of Arequipa in southern Peru we highlight examples of urban development, agricultural expansion, river channelization, and glacial retreat via comparison of historic and modern satellite imagery. By incorporating these types of historic imagery data in formats accessible to non-professionals, public engagement as well as research into human-environmental investigations will be greatly enhanced.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion is a crucial environmental problem in the Manjunto watershed, Bengkulu Province, Indonesia. It has economic implications and environmental consequences. Assessment of potential soil erosion rate is useful in designing soil conservation strategies within the framework of integrated watershed management. Information obtained from Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) framework supports decision makers in preparing more accurate spatial maps in less time and cost. The aim of this research is to assess the average annual rate of potential soil erosion in Manjunto watershed for each soil mapping unit using remote sensing data, namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Slope. The NDVI value obtained from satellite imagery processing while slope value obtained from Digital Elevation Model-Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (DEM-SRTM) processing. The results showed that the eroded catchment area increased significantly. The average annual rate of potential soil erosion in Manjunto watershed in the year 2000 amounted to 3.00 tons ha(-1)year(-1), while in the year 2009 there was a significant increase to 27.03 ton ha(-1)year(-1). The levels of erosion hazard in soil mapping unit numbers 41, 42 and 47 are classified in the very heavy category. Soil mapping unit numbers 41, 42 and 47 should be a first priority in soil and water conservation activities.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion by water is a major environmental problem in the developing countries in particular. It has economic, social and environmental implication due to both on-site and off-site effects. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of soil erosion by water on-site and off-site on agriculture productivity at farm level using a combination between environmental and economic approaches and applied in a watershed in Tunisia. The environmental method is a combination between the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Furthermore, multi-temporal satellite images and Transformed Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI) are used to estimate the accurate the Crop management factor (C factor) with taking into account the phenology of the crops. Moreover, the economic model which is built using mathematic programming is used to assess the economic value of soil erosion by water. The comparison between baseline scenario (without erosion) and alternative scenarios where the soil erosion risk is incorporated shows that the total income of the watershed reduced with the effect of soil erosion. The approach proposed in this study is helpful for the decision makers to plan suitable strategies and measures to preserve water and soil resources. Indeed, the environmental method is useful to identify vulnerable areas with mapping soil erosion risk. In addition, the economic value of soil erosion can be used by the decision maker to prioritize areas of soil conservation.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is highly affected by environmental conditions and the assessment of the agroclimatic potential is necessary for sustainability and productivity. The climate is among the most important factors that determine the agricultural potentialities of a region and the suitability of a region for a specific crop, whereas the yield is determined by weather conditions. In this chapter the first objective is to identify sustainable production zones in Thessaly by conducting contemporary agroclimatic classification based on remote sensing and GIS. The agroclimatic conditions of agricultural areas have to be assessed in order to achieve sustainable and efficient use of natural resources in combination with production optimization. Thus, a quantitative understanding of the climate of a region is essential for developing improved farming systems. The second objective derives from the first; it develops a decision support system (DSS) by using multi-criteria analysis combining different criteria to a utility function under a set of constraints concerning different categories of agroclimatic, social, cultural and economic conditions and so we can achieve an optimum agricultural production plan. In order to support the realization of the proposed production zoning and DSS in real-time, a Sensor Web service platform is proposed to be implemented based on the Sensor Web technologies, which extracts Real-time environmental and agronomic data.},

Abstract = {Synergy is a pilot demonstration project funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to evaluate the utility of Earth Observation System (EOS) data for activities other than global environmental change research. Under a contract initiated in February 2000, Synergy partnered with a number of universities and State and Local government agencies in the United States to develop a variety of remote sensing applications. Phase I of Synergy focused on exploring the potential use of satellite imagery for disaster management, urban planning, water resource management, precision agriculture, and natural resources management and protection. The objectives were to demonstrate the practical use of EOS data in real world applications. For State and Local Government applications, the intent was to enhance the ability of end users at different governmental levels to make viable managerial decisions and formulate sound planning policies. The program focused on making data, extracted information, derived products, and prototype applications more readily accessible for end users through web-based ``Infomarts{''}. These Infomarts would provide data browsing and downloading capabilities as well as interactive mapping tools. The Infomarts were geared primarily toward governmental organizations that have the potential to utilize remote sensing data and integrate extracted information and derived products in geographic information systems (GIS). Key to the success of Synergy was the early and continued involvement of end users throughout the development and implementation cycle. Analysis of the requirements defined by end users facilitated identification of value-added products and aided in developing promising prototype applications.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease (HFMD) has brought a serious threat to people's health. There is no research considering both the natural and social environment to study the outbreak and propagation of HFMD quantitatively by now. In this study, we acquired environmental impact factors of HFMD using remote sensing and GIS. Then we analyzed the relationship between density of HFMD cases and environmental impact factors for year 2009 in Shenzhen. It was found that density of HFMD cases was significantly associated with population density, hospital density, road density, annual average of aerosol optical depth, and annual average of normalized difference vegetation index. A linear regression model was constructed with the R-2 value of 0.677 using environmental impact factors, and both hospital density and annual average of aerosol optical depth were included in the model.},

Abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) share a common vision and mission to serve society through Earth observation systems. Beginning in the early 1960s, research and development programs conducted by NASA included Earth observation spacecraft focused on improving the capacity to monitor the weather; weather is now one of the societal benefit areas identified by the GEO. From the 1980s through 2004, NASA developed and deployed the Earth Observing System to conduct global research using measurements from the Terra, Aqua, and Aura spacecraft. The research results from these and other NASA space-based observatories are pathfinders for next-generation operational systems and are information sources for evolving computer models used to improve predictions of weather, climate, and natural hazards. Improved understanding of climate change and the prediction and preparedness associated with disasters are two additional societal benefit areas of the GEO. One of NASA's goals is to extend benefits of space research to improve scientific understanding of the Earth system and to demonstrate new technologies with the potential to improve future operational systems. NASA focuses on applications of national priority to transition these benefits systematically, enabling and improving integrated system solutions that inform decisions to serve society. Management of energy, coastal and biological ecosystems, agriculture, water, and human health are applications served by integrating NASA research results into solutions that are consistent with GEO societal benefit areas. NASA and the GEO share a common framework architecture to systematically apply Earth observations and predictions to enable decision support for specific applications areas. Over the next 10 years, NASA plans to continue collaborations with its U.S. and international partners to develop and deploy innovative research spacecraft and instruments. These Systems can demonstrate the capacity for space systems to address targets identified in The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) 10-Year Implementation Plan.},

Abstract = {This paper is aimed at examining the role of African Global Earth Observation System of Systems (AfriGEOSS) in Earth Observation (EO) mission cooperation on the continent of Africa. It discusses the importance of earth observation programs for developing countries as well as the benefits of international cooperative efforts. The paper further examined some collaborative projects on Earth Observation in Africa and their associated problems. It specifically looked at the EO data coordination initiatives such as the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), GEOSS, Africa Discovery Broker, etc. It then situates AfriGEOSS in the context of African Space Agenda (ASA) with recommendations especially to the Africa Union Commission for the realization of ASA set goals. The paper reiterated that regardless of whether developed or developing, Earth observation information provides substantial benefit supporting economic development, decision making and policy implementation of all countries of the world. This is as a result of its multifarious benefits to humans in areas like agriculture, forestry, risk management, disaster monitoring, maritime, defence and security and natural resources management. Consequently, the paper argued that the numerous benefits from space assets have driven countries within the continent of Africa to either acquire or develop capabilities in space systems which is devoted to improving quality of life in general. The paper concluded that while space systems are expensive, there is need for continuity and sustainability as a result of its numerous advantages to the human's society.},

Title = {Studying the Eco-Environmental Quality Variations of Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration and Its Driving Factors in Different Ecosystem Service Regions From 2001 To 2015},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Exploring the regional eco-environmental quality (EEQ) and its driving factors is of great significance for regional management. Although existing studies have paid much attention to evaluate EEQ, few studies have been performed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of EEQ and its driving factors in different ecosystem service regions (ESR) at an urban agglomeration scale. In this study, we selected Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration (JJJ) as the study area to evaluate its EEQ, analyze its spatiotemporal variations, and investigate potential driving factors explanatory power based on the geographical detector methods in different ESR during 2001 similar to 2015. The main conclusions were as follows: (1) The EEQ of JJJ had improved from 2001 to 2015, with the average RSEI increased from 0.43 to 0.46; among them, Bashang Plateau and Western Hebei Ecosystem Service Region (BWHE) had the highest RSEI change rate (C26.19\%) and the highest NTEDI value (0.13), while Central Hebei Plain Ecosystem Service Region (CHPE) had the lowest RSEI change rate (5.41\%) and the lowest NTEDI value (0.02). (2) The EEQ of JJJ had strong spatial agglomeration effects, with the global Moran's I increased from 0.82 to 0.88. Spatially, the LL regions mainly changed into the HH regions in the northwestern part, while in the central and eastern areas, some isolated LL regions displayed an aggregated trend. (3) In terms of the driving factors, soil type and elevation were primary factors in explaining the variations of EEQ. Specifically, natural factors explained the highest variations in BWHE. The interaction of topographical and socio-economic factors had high explanatory power in Yanshan and Taihang Mountain Ecosystem Service Region (YTME) and CHPE; To Bohai and Coastal Ring Ecosystem Service Region (BCRE), the interaction of meteorological and socio-economic factors accounted for the high variations of EEQ. All these findings could provide more valuable advice for relevant policy-makers.},

Abstract = {Since the advent of NASA's Earth Observing System, knowledge of the practical benefits of Earth science data has grown considerably. The community using NASA Earth science observations in applications has grown significantly, with increasing sophistication to serve national interests. Data latency, or how quickly communities receive science observations after acquisition, can have a direct impact on the applications and usability of the information. This study was conducted to determine how users are incorporating NASA data into applications and operational processes to benefit society beyond scientific research, as well as to determine the need for data latency of less than 12 h. The results of the analysis clearly show the significant benefit to society of serving the needs of the agricultural, emergency response, environmental monitoring and weather communities who use rapidly delivered, accurate Earth science data. The study also showed the potential of expanding the communities who use low latency NASA science data products to provide new ways of transforming data into information. These benefits can be achieved with a clear and consistent NASA policy on product latency. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests provide a large number of important ecological, economic, and social benefits. This study proposes a pixel-based method for estimating the spatial variability of mangrove ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and heavy metal retention) in the Jiulong River Estuary using a combination of high-resolution satellite data with market price and replacement cost approaches. The results indicated that there was a considerable variability in the ecosystem service values caused by the distance of mangroves to the coast and the different growth phases of mangrove forests. The total estimated value of the four selected ecosystem services was US\$ 287,993/year for 174.58 ha (approximately US\$ 1650/ha/year). Coastal protection was estimated to provide the highest value (US\$ 239,683/year), amounting to 83.23\% of the total value of the ecosystem services, followed by nutrient retention (US\$ 25,283/year), contributing 8.78\% of the total value of the ecosystem services and accounting for up to 52.33\% of the total value of regulating services. Heavy metals retention (US\$ 10,289/year) and carbon sequestration (US\$ 12,738 in 2015/year) had relatively low values in comparison to those of coastal protection and nutrient retention. However, there was an underestimation of mangrove ecosystem services because we did not consider other services, such as fisheries, biodiversity, recreation, education and tourism, mainly due to the lack of primary data. Nevertheless, the estimated economic value of mangrove ecosystem services in this area is meaningful to raise awareness of the benefits provided by mangroves to local communities and policy makers.},

Title = {Evaluating the eco-environment benefit of land reclamation in the dump of an opencast coal mine},
Journal = {CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {7},
Pages = {607-624},
Abstract = {Land reclamation significantly affects the ecological and environmental conditions of mining areas. However, quantifying the exact effects is difficult because of the lack of reliable data. The estimation of eco-environment benefit contributes to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by land reclamation and to provide useful information for policy-makers concerned with sustainable development. The aim of this study is to investigate variations in eco-environment benefit in response to land use changes during land reclamation. The West dump, one of the earliest regions to implement ecological restoration in Liaoning Province, is selected as the study area. The widely used methods for eco-environment benefits based on the land use change were proposed and applied to the West dump in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The total eco-environment benefits in study areas were 0.98 million dollars in 2004, 1.39 million dollars in 2009, and 1.43 million dollars in 2014, with an increase of 0.41 million dollars from 2004 to 2009 mainly because of the increasing areas of artificial woodland and reclaimed cropland. The combined eco-environment benefits of artificial woodland, improved grassland, and reclaimed cropland were over 90\% of the total benefits. Soil formation and protection, biodiversity protection, and gas regulation were the top three functions with high eco-environment benefits, contributing about half of the total eco-environment benefits. The results suggest that future studies estimating eco-environment benefits should pay more attention to ecosystems in fragile ecological regions where various human interferences happen frequently. All of the abovementioned results made the techniques of estimation of the eco-environment benefit of land reclamation are more meaningful in guiding the future exploitation and reclamation of mining areas.},

Title = {Do Ecosystem Service Value Increase and Environmental Quality Improve due to Large-Scale Ecological Water Conveyance in an Arid Region of China?},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of the economy and the intensification of human activities, ecological systems have been degraded, especially in arid areas. The lower reaches of the Tarim River represent a typical arid area in China. Since 2000, the Chinese government has been heavily investing in the protection and restoration of the natural ecological environment of the lower reaches of the Tarim River. In this study, we aimed to resolve two key scientific issues: (1) reveal the changing characteristics of land-use in the region and identify the changes in ecosystem service value caused by these land-use changes and (2) evaluate whether the environmental quality has improved or worsened. The objective of this study is to verify whether the ecological water conveyance project promotes an increase in the ecosystem service value, with an improvement in the ecological environment, to thereby provide references for the evaluated effects of ecological water conveyance for the management of water resources. In this way, economic development can support environmental protection. Thus, the economy can be sustainably developed. Hence, based on the remote sensing data of land-use in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2016, with the value coefficients proposed by Constanza in 1997 and changing characteristics in the land-use, the ecological service value, and environmental conditions from 1990 to 2016 were analysed. According to our results, from 1990 to 2016, the ecosystem service value has increased substantially, indicating that the benefits of ecological water conveyance were significant. The environmental condition index increased by 21.14\%, showing that the ecological environment has improved. However, the environmental quality remained low. In the future, we should formulate plans for reasonable land-use that control the replacement of woodlands and grasslands with farmlands and construction. The results of this study provide a scientific basis and practical guide for restoring inland river ecosystems in arid regions.},

Title = {Impact of Land Cover Change on Ecosystem Services in a Tropical Forested Landscape},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Ecosystems provide a wide range of goods, services or ecosystem services (ES) to society. Estimating the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on ES values (ESV) is an important tool to support decision making. This study used remote sensing and GIS tools to analyze LULC change and transitions from 2001 to 2016 and assess its impact on ESV in a tropical forested landscape in the southern plains of Nepal. The total ESV of the landscape for the year 2016 is estimated at USD 1264 million year(-1). As forests are the dominant land cover class and have high ES value per hectare, they have the highest contribution in total ESV. However, as a result of LULC change (loss of forests, water bodies, and agricultural land), the total ESV of the landscape has declined by USD 11 million year(-1). Major reductions come from the loss in values of climate regulation, water supply, provision of raw materials and food production. To halt the ongoing loss of ES and maintain the supply and balance of different ES in the landscape, it is important to properly monitor, manage and utilize ecosystems. We believe this study will inform policymakers, environmental managers, and the general public on the ongoing changes and contribute to developing effective land use policy in the region.},

Abstract = {Frequent adjustment of the drinking water treatment process as a simultaneous response to climate variations, and the impact those variations have on water quality, has been a grand challenge in water resource management in recent years. An early warning system with the aid of satellite remote sensing and local sensor networks, which provides timely and quantitative knowledge to monitor the quality of water, may be a soluition to this challenge. The development of such an early warning system is addressed to discover and evaluate the severity in a discrete event mode in this paper. The early warning system in the current study is able to empower the urban water ifrastructure systems with the integration of advanced data science, environmental monitoring, computational intelligence, and satellite remote sensing data. By developing a graphical user interface, end-users who do not have knowledge or skill in the field of integrated sensing, monitoring, networking, modeling can take advantage of the user-friendly early warning system. Practical implementation of the proposed early warning system was assessed at the largest resrvoir, Lake Mead, in Las Vegas in the United States. It uniquely demonstrates how such a system can benefit the drinking water treatment plant throughout decision support actions via multi-sensor acquisition, data fusion, criteria mining and alarm trigerring.},

Abstract = {The Advanced Systems Performance Evaluation tool for NOAA (ASPEN) is developed to help support designing and evaluating existing and planned observing systems in terms of comparative assessment, trade-offs analysis, and design optimization studies. ASPEN is a dynamic tool that rapidly assesses the benefit and cost effectiveness of environmental data obtained from any set of observing systems, whether ground-based or space-based, whether an individual sensor or a collection of sensors. The ASPEN assessed cost effectiveness accounts for the level of ability to measure the environment, the cost(s) associated with acquiring these measurements, and the degree of usefulness of these measurements to users and applications. It computes both the use benefit, measured as a requirements-satisfaction metric, and the cost effectiveness (equal to the benefit-to-cost ratio). ASPEN provides a uniform interface to compare the performance of different observing systems and to capture the requirements and priorities of applications. This interface describes the environment in terms of geophysical observables and their attributes. A prototype implementation of ASPEN is described and demonstrated in this study to assess the benefits of several observing systems for a range of applications. ASPEN could be extended to other types of studies, such as assessing the cost effectiveness of commercial data to applications in all the NOAA mission service areas, and ultimately to societal application areas, and thereby become a valuable addition to the observing systems assessment toolbox.},

Abstract = {The introduction of nutrients to lakes causing eutrophic conditions is a major problem around the world. Proper monitoring and modeling are important to effectively manage eutrophication in lake waters. The goal is to develop remote sensing models for nutrients, total phosphorus and total nitrogen, in Lake Champlain. The remote sensing models were created using multivariate linear regression with the unique band combinations of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery based on the empirical relationship with the field observations. The resulting models successfully showed nutrient distributions in the most eutrophic part of Lake Champlain, Missisquoi Bay, with reasonable adjusted coefficient of determination values (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.75 for total phosphorus and total nitrogen, respectively). The results show the feasibility and the utility of satellite imagery to detect spatial distributions of lake water quality constituents, which can be used to better understand nutrient distributions in Lake Champlain. This approach can be applicable to other lakes experiencing eutrophication assisting decision making when implementing Best Management Practices and other mitigation techniques to lakes.

Abstract = {Background: Investment in emerging technologies may contribute to a reduction in the suppression costs of wildfires, and is thus worth careful consideration and trialling by researchers and managers. This investigation looked at the potential incorporation of a newly emerging remote sensing technology, remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared investigated using a cost-benefit analysis approach. Methods: An online survey-based approach targeting subject matter experts in wildland fire management and unmanned aircraft was used to evaluate the percentage change in the effectiveness of five different management scenarios using remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared. The most commonly accepted economic model in wildland fire management was adapted to determine the net value change between the five scenarios. Results: The benefits of incorporated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared were measured as the reduction in cost-opportunity of helicopter use, and were estimated as an average of \$548 per fire (where the average cost of fires was \$1767) or a 31 \% cost saving on total suppression costs. The return on investment of such technology was estimated at 24 fires, whereas the return of investment of the existing thermal camera/helicopter use occurred after 160 fires. Conclusions: The incorporation of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared if implemented and managed appropriately, could well improve the cost effectiveness of the current forest, rural and wildland fire fighting efforts. The inherent uncertainty on such unevaluated technology (the combination of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared) was addressed by adding stochastic variability and a triangular probability distribution approximation. Key management issues and recommendations are identified such as; greater use of current thermal camera equipment where possible, taking a project management based approach for further testing of remotely piloted aircraft and other emerging technologies, and the improved financial recording and reporting of fire management efforts.},

Abstract = {Uplands represent unique landscapes that provide a range of vital benefits to society, but are under increasing pressure from the management needs of a diverse number of stakeholders (e.g. farmers, conservationists, foresters, government agencies and recreational users). Mapping the spatial distribution of upland vegetation could benefit management and conservation programmes and allow for the impacts of environmental change (natural and anthropogenic) in these areas to be reliably estimated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of medium spatial resolution optical and radar satellite data, together with ancillary soil and topographic data, for identifying and mapping upland vegetation using the Random Forests (RF) algorithm. Intensive field survey data collected at three study sites in Ireland as part of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) funded survey of upland habitats was used in the calibration and validation of different RF models. Eight different datasets were analysed for each site to compare the change in classification accuracy depending on the input variables. The overall accuracy values varied from 59.8\% to 94.3\% across the three study locations and the inclusion of ancillary datasets containing information on the soil and elevation further improved the classification accuracies (between 5 and 27\%, depending on the input classification dataset). The classification results were consistent across the three different study areas, confirming the applicability of the approach under different environmental contexts.},

Abstract = {Earth observations can provide a wealth of information for making informed societal decisions. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) integrates a variety of organizations interested in environmental data and/or decision-making to create a sound technical platform for information-sharing and collaboration. The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) facilitates the use of Earth observations in decisions by making decision-support tools and information publically available. The main principle of GEOSS is to benefit society. The Health Societal Benefit Area (SBA) spans the science-to-decision-making continuum through three tasks: Information Systems for Health, Monitoring and Prediction Systems for Health, and End-to-End Projects for Health. Projects within each overarching task focus on building connections between basic research, tools, and tangible decisions. Current foci within the Health SBA include: aerosol impacts on health, air quality forecasting, global monitoring of persistent organic pollutants and mercury, meningitis in Africa, developing malaria early warning systems, and decision support tools for ecosystems, biodiversity and health.},

Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {124},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A violent outbreak of civil unrest (Jul 7-19, 2021) triggered immediately after the incarceration of the former South African president claimed 337 lives and brought disruptive damages to societal movements, environment, and COVID-19 containment measures. The present work aimed to analyze the hotspots of fire sites, its significances on societal activities, air quality and COVID-19 pandemic using ground based and geospatial data. The results revealed steady rise in air pollution levels all through the region due to increase in fire activities. Positive influence on the regional air quality was observed to be high than the limits set forth by WHO. The daily mean values of PM2.5 (62.37-104.34 mu g/m(3)) and PM10 (108.86-156.78 mu g/m(3)) presented potential short and long-term risks to public health. Similarly, COVID-19 cases also increased during the social unrest period even when the community mobility was less than the normal conditions. This type of cost benefit analysis proves to provide evidence of deteriorating air quality and aids to examine the adverse impacts on human health during the global pandemic.},

Title = {The use of spectral techniques to monitor the vegetation status in a protected area in the Iasi county},
Journal = {PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {107-125},
Abstract = {Remote sensing technology offers the possibility to monitor biophysical attributes and changes in plant biomass and productivity during the growing season, which can enable sustainable management. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing technology have produced innovative sensors for monitoring the Earth's surface, with increasing spatial and temporal resolution of available satellite images, such as those provided by the Sentinel-2, creating new opportunities for environmental monitoring and the generation of accurate datasets. This study aimed to assess vegetation condition during the spring, summer and autumn seasons in a protected area near Iasi, ROSCI0058, using biophysical indices derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The study area was chosen due to the existence of signals indicating the possibility of changes in the type and health status of vegetation within the site of Community importance. The analysis was based on a series of vegetation-specific spectral indices such as: normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), canopy water content (CWC), fraction of photosynthetically active absorbed radiation (FAPAR) and fraction of canopy cover (FCOVER), derived from Sentinel-2 high-resolution images. The time series of satellite images used covers the phenophase periods specific to the spontaneous flora in the period 2020-2022. With SNAP software the Sentinel-2 images were pre-processed to convert the reflectance of the ToA images to BoA, vegetation indices were calculated, after which final distribution maps were created with ArcGIS. The results indicate that the highest values for NDVI, LAI, FAPAR, FCOVER, CAB and CW did not follow a pattern, they occurred at different times of the year, as follows: in the spring season, the highest value was on April 10, 2020; in the summer season, highlighting the values of July 9, 2021 while for the fall, the year 2022 recorded the highest values on September 7, the results being directly proportional to the variation of climatic parameters. The analysis also considered the type of land use, with non-irrigated arable land having the highest values for various indices. The results highlight the potential of Sentinel -2 images for these types of studies, as they can be used to observe and assess the health of the vegetation cover.},

Title = {Using historical spy satellite photographs and recent remote sensing data to identify high-conservation-value forests},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {High-conservation-value forests (HCVFs) are critically important for biodiversity and ecosystem service provisioning, but they face many threats. Where systematic HCVF inventories are missing, such as in parts of Eastern Europe, these forests remain largely unacknowledged and therefore often unprotected. We devised a novel, transferable approach for detecting HCVFs based on integrating historical spy satellite images, contemporary remote sensing data (Landsat), and information on current potential anthropogenic pressures (e.g., road infrastructure, population density, demand for fire wood, terrain). We applied the method to the Romanian Carpathians, for which we mapped forest continuity (1955-2019), canopy structural complexity, and anthropogenic pressures. We identified 738,000 ha of HCVF. More than half of this area was identified as susceptible to current anthropogenic pressures and lacked formal protection. By providing a framework for broad-scale HCVF monitoring, our approach facilitates integration of HCVF into forest conservation and management. This is urgently needed to achieve the goals of the European Union's Biodiversity Strategy to maintain valuable forest ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Earth Observation (EO) data play an important role in our society today, but there is still tremendous opportunity to improve how these data are used to affect change. In this paper, we provide guidance to help data providers and intermediaries within the EO value chain (from data to applications) increase the societal value of the EO data, information, and data products that they work with. We first describe the EO value chain as a conceptual framework for how data are translated and applied for societal benefit. We then introduce three approaches that are often used to assess and improve the EO value chain. Finally, we present ``10 rules{''} that can be implemented to increase the societal benefits of Earth science information. The 10 rules emphasize meeting user needs, problem-solving within interdisciplinary teams, and long-term sustainable solutions. Some rules focus on a specific segment of the value chain or phase in the problem-solving process, while others are relevant to the value chain or process as a whole. Each rule includes at least one case study example to illustrate the key points. The rules are loosely organized according to project management principles with the initial rules focusing on defining problems, planning for data use, creating effective teams, and examining a diverse selection of solutions. The next set of rules are best applied throughout a project, and include such concepts as evaluation, interoperability, trust, adoption, and documentation. Finally, the last rule addresses the challenge of determining when to close a project.},

Title = {Optimization of management by analyzing ecosystem service value variations in different watersheds in the Three-River Headwaters Basin},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {321},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Variation analysis of ecosystem services (ESs) is an important means of regional watershed management, especially for the ecologically fragile Three-River Headwaters Basin (TRHB), which is an important part of the national ecological security barrier. In this study, meteorological data, remote sensing images and land use data from 2000 to 2020 in the TRHB were collected. Based on the estimation of ecosystem service values (ESVs), the spatial-temporal variations of ESVs in the three watersheds were analyzed via spatial autocorrelation analysis, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and correspondence analysis. The study indicates that for the 20-year changes in the TRHB, the provisioning service (PS) and regulating service (RS) increased in most areas except for a small decrease in the northwest, while the supporting service (SS) value in most areas in the southwest showed a decreasing trend. Through the difference results of different watersheds, it can be seen that the dif-ferences in the PS and RS values among the three watersheds became increasingly more significant with the passage of time. Moreover, a significant correspondence was identified between each watershed and each ESV level, whereby the highest ESV levels (SS-VI, RS-VI, and PS-VI) mainly corresponded to the Yellow River watershed, the high values (SS-V, RS-V, PS-V, SS-IV, RS-IV, and PS-IV) mainly corresponded to the Lancang River watershed, and the low values (SS-I, RS-I, and PS-I) corresponded to the Yangtze River watershed. Our analysis shows the variation characteristics of ESVs to provide a guiding basis for ensuring the precise implementation of the management and protection of watersheds in the TRHB or similar areas.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Abstract = {Drought is a complex natural hazard with social and environmental implications. Satellite information is increasingly used to support decision-makers in preventing or coping with the negative impacts of drought. The integration of local and scientific knowledge to support drought monitoring is still far from being the main procedure in the development of drought monitoring and early warning systems. This study aimed at assessing the degree of convergence between satellite information on the effect of droughts on rangeland vegetation, from time series analysis, and farmers' perception of drought in North-West Patagonia, Argentina. We characterised the scientific evidence of drought in terms of duration, spatial distribution, most severe years and recovery for the period 2000-2018 by identifying inter-annual NDVI changes. Farmers' perceptions and experiences of drought were studied with open-ending interviews, with respect to occurrence, duration and recovery for that period. Satellite information matched farmers' perception of drought at a regional scale, emphasising the value of remote sensing tools in supporting regional policy decision-making. However, farmers' perceptions and recall of past drought impacts were more diverse than satellite information at a local level, highlighting the need for knowledge integration at finer scales.},

Abstract = {Improving the well-being of dryland peoples in vulnerable countries will require that future decisions take into account. the true value of nature-the value of ecological resources and ecosystem services on which dryland peoples depend for their livelihoods. A pilot project is described that aims to build capacity of five West African Sahelian countries in diagnosis of ecosystem degradation, environmental valuation and analysis of policy alternatives for sustainable ecosystem management. The project is developing and promoting tools for assessing land degradation and valuing ``free{''} environmental services as a basis for evaluating policies for improved dryland management. Land degradation trends are being assessed from regional to local levels using remote sensing on multiple scales combined with ground sampling. Land degradation and natural resource depletion, as well as policy options including income-generating agroforestry, are being assessed within the context of the whole environment-economy system on national to local scales using environmental accounting. It is hoped that better valuation of dryland ecosystem services will enhance the ability of governments and the international community to (i) identify key emerging environmental issues related to human use of dryland ecosystems, (ii) proactively target technical and capacity-building support to areas most in need of assistance, and (iii) catalyze coordinated responses at national and international levels. At the same time, the work seeks to increase public awareness of the degree of dependence of dryland country economies on their environmental resource base and the impact of current national and international policies on depletion trends in environmental resource stocks and human well-being.},

Abstract = {Earth observation (EO) from space has become one of the most powerful environmental management tools. Today's preoccupations such as the effects of climate change, the prevention of natural hazards and the degradation of land resources impose new challenges to the Earth observation community. Terrestrial ecosystems respond to changes caused by climate or by human action in a progressive manner, but also sometimes by quantum leaps. Therefore, long series of calibrated and validated EO are essential in order to monitor and understand these changes, But the information extracted from EO data is only an indicator which has to be integrated into more complete decision support systems, easily accessible to end users. On the other hand, the number and variety of available EO systems is increasing, with a wide range of spatial and spectral resolutions and more and more temporal coverage and flexibility. Micro-satellites, experimental platforms, commercial systems and free systems coexist in space. Ground based sensor webs, innovative linkages and convergence of technologies are appearing and allow ``intelligent{''} monitoring. But some developing countries, which depend strongly on their natural resources, still lack the basic information on the status of their environment. The technology gap appears to widen between rich and poor regions, and this is also a gap in the accession to knowledge, which in turn is a key to development. Earth observation can be an extraordinary tool for a more sustainable planet, but only if it is used wisely and for the benefit of the majority.},

Title = {Can Remote Sensing Fill the United States' Monitoring Gap for Watershed Management?},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Remote sensing has been heralded as the silver bullet in water quality modeling and watershed management, and yet a quantitative mapping of where its applicability is likely and most useful has not been undertaken so far. Here, we combine geospatial models of cloud cover as a proxy for the likelihood of acquiring remote scenes and the shortest time of travel to population centers as a proxy for accessibility to ground-truth remote sensing data for water quality monitoring and produce maps of the potential of remote sensing in watershed management in the United States. We generate several maps with different cost-payoff relationships to help stakeholders plan and incentivize remote sensing-based monitoring campaigns. Additionally, we combine these remote sensing potential maps with spatial indices of population, water demand, ecosystem services, pollution risk, and monitoring coverage deficits to identify where remote sensing likely has the greatest role to play. We find that the Southwestern United States and the Central plains regions are generally suitable for remote sensing for watershed management even under the most stringent costing projections, but that the potential for using remote sensing can extend further North and East as constraints are relaxed. We also find large areas in the Southern United States and sporadic watersheds in the Northeast and Northwest seaboards and the Midwest would likely benefit most from using remote sensing for watershed monitoring. Although developed herein for watershed decision support in the United States, our approach is readily generalizable to other environmental domains and across the world.},

Abstract = {The discussion of environmental issues and sustainable development of society has been growing worldwide in the past decades. The application of remote sensing - the technology of observing, collecting and analyzing the data of planet Earth and its immediate environment from air and space altitudes - has enriched human knowledge of our globe and enhanced our survival therein. Remote sensing continues to be gainfully employed as major tool of international cooperation. Most Remote Sensing education programs worldwide have pointed toward interdisciplinarity, providing a balanced experience for students spanning the domains of engineering, theory, data analysis, applications, and policy. Established in 1984, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) coordinates civil space-borne observations of the Earth, where the participating agencies strive to enhance international coordination and data exchange and to optimize societal benefit. Within CEOS, the Working Group on Capacity Building and Data Democracy (WGCapD) aims at building upon the CEOS Data Democracy Initiative in an effort to increase the capacity of institutions in less developed countries for effective use of Earth Observation data for the benefit of society and to achieve sustainable development. CEOS Agencies have joined efforts to put forward an e-learning course named International e-learning course on Introduction to Remote Sensing Technology. The objective of this paper is to present the results and lessons learned from this first initiative for Anglophone countries in Africa. With a multicultural perception, the article discusses the online education experience and gives some perspectives on further developments to be implemented in a possible second version of the course. The course was free of charge and targeted at University Lecturers who can enhance the multiplier effect and help preparing the practitioners to use remote sensing in Earth sciences. The students came from various backgrounds and application interest areas. The main goal was to create collaborative learning opportunities, providing the learners with an appreciation of current remote sensing issues, the geologic and human processes that impact remotely-gathered data, and how those processes can be measured using remote sensing. The 19 voluntary instructors came from seven space agencies in different countries including Argentina, Brazil, Austria, France, India, South Africa and the US. Over 70 people signed up, 30 participated (South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania) throughout the 16 weeks that the course ran, and 16 undertook all assessments and received the certificate. Course materials included well-organized tutorials, selected datasets and internet links. Two live classroom sessions per week were held, recorded and made available afterwards for downloading. Students were exposed to a variety of resources, software tools and datasets, all of open and free access. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to students and instructors seeking at information that would enable assessment of the contribution of the course as well as suggestions for improvement. Overall, this has been a successful multicultural experience for accessing education in Remote Sensing in developing countries. Despite some limitations, the delivery methodology has proved to be efficient and the outcomes of this online course have been encouraging to pursue other courses in the future.},

Abstract = {Ecological conservation red line (ECRL) is gaining increasing academic attention as delimiting the minimum space scope of ecological protection and the bottom line of ecological security. Taking Nanjing as a case study, we divided the territory into ecological and non-ecological redline areas (ERAs and NERAs, respectively). This paper highlights two key research issues based on the 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 annual remote sensing data: (i) quantitative analysis of the Ecological Redline Policy (ERP) validity by conducting a horizontal comparison of the ERAs and NERAs; and (ii) exploration of the land-use transitions and spatial pattern changes affecting ecosystem service value (ESV). Results showed that delineating ECRL could effectively slow down the decline rate of ESV. The trend of eco-quality deterioration was greater than eco-quality improvement in Nanjing, presenting an ESV that declined slightly in the whole. According to our findings, we suggest that reasonably increasing eco-lands (woodland and water area) and decreasing construction land will enhance the regional ESV. Meanwhile, promoting the transition from production space to ecological space and depressing the encroachment of living space on other space types, will be instrumental in mitigating the ESV decline. The results of this study are expected to provide valuable implications for spatial planning and sustainable development in Nanjing.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The analysis of land use and land cover data provides invaluable support to a variety of land management and conservation activities. However, historically its application has been limited by high costs associated with data acquisition, analysis, and classification. In recent years, freely available satellite imagery and geospatial data sets and rapid advancement in data analysis capabilities provide immense opportunities to understand and solve the real-world environmental problems. Open-source platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide a planetary-scale environmental science data and analyses capability at much greater efficiency and accuracy than the traditional workflows. We evaluated the GEE Python API utility for classifying the freely available NAIP aerial imagery of 2017 to derive the land use land cover (LULC) information of a Panhandle area of Florida, USA. We identified eight major LULC classes with an overall accuracy of 86\% and Kappa value of 79\%. We completed all remote sensing data analyses procedures including data retrieval, classification, and report preparation in the Jupyter notebook, an open-source web application. Computation time for the procedure was less than 15 min. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for conducting land use and land cover analysis using much less time, money, and human resources. The open-source nature of GEE Python API and its library of remote sensing data could benefit remote sensing projects throughout the world, especially where access to commercial image processing software packages and remote sensing data are limited.},

Title = {Space as an Enabler in the Maritime Sector},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {197-206},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Space can be used as a tool for business decision and policy makers. The maritime sector is rapidly evolving as far as business and industrial activities are concerned. Space can assist in transforming this sector through satellite navigation and positioning, telecommunications and integrated applications as well as earth observation. Additionally, space can be used as a tool in developing, implementing maritime affairs. This paper focuses on the role of space in maritime policy. Space technologies have been serving the maritime community for over fourty years. Satellite technology is becoming increasingly important for a wide range of maritime activities through enhanced navigation accuracy, marine environmental monitoring and maritime surveillance. For this reason, agreements between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), have been signed in 2007 and 2010, strengthening the framework for cooperation between the two agencies for the use of space-based systems in support of maritime activities. The first part of the paper summarizes European maritime related policy areas where space assets can contribute to achieve their objectives. The second part of the paper addresses how ESA's initiatives and programs could contribute and support the maritime sector in Europe. The main purpose of this paper is to come up with conclusions on whether and how the use of space assets, technology and applications, can contribute in achieving the maritime policy objectives for the benefit of Europe.},

Abstract = {Today, the field of cultural heritage faces many challenges: cultural heritage is always at risk, the large amount of heritage information is often fragmented, climate change impacts cultural heritage and heritage recording can be time-consuming and often results in low accuracy. Four objectives, related to the challenges, were defined during this research work. It proposes a relevant value-led risk management method for cultural heritage, it identifies climate change impact on cultural heritage, it suggests a database lay-out for cultural heritage and demonstrates the potential of remote sensing tools for cultural heritage. The Via Julia Augusta, a former Roman road in Albenga, was used as case study.},

Title = {The emerging role of satellite rainfall data in improving the hydro-political situation of flood monitoring in the under-developed regions of the world},

Abstract = {The systematic decline of in situ networks for hydrologic measurements has been recognized as a crucial limitation to advancing hydrologic monitoring in medium to large basins, especially those that are already sparsely instrumented. As a collective response, sections of the hydrologic community have recently forged partnerships for the development of space-borne missions for cost-effective, yet global, hydrologic measurements by building upon the technological advancements since the last two decades. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art on flood monitoring in medium and large ungauged basins where satellite remote sensing can facilitate development of a cost-effective mechanism. We present our review in the context of the current hydro-political situation of flood monitoring in flood-prone developing nations situated in international river basins (IRBs). Given the large number of such basins and the difficulty in acquisition of multi-faceted geophysical data, we argue that the conventional data-intensive implementation of physically based hydrologic models that are complex and distributed is time-consuming for global assessment of the utility of proposed global satellite hydrologic missions. A more parsimonious approach is justified at the tolerable expense of accuracy before such missions begin operation. Such a parsimonious approach can subsequently motivate the identified international basins to invest greater effort in conventional and detailed hydrologic studies to design a prototype flood forecasting system in an effort to overcome the hydro-political hurdles to flood monitoring. Through a modeling exercise involving an open-book watershed concept, we demonstrate the value of a parsimonious approach in understanding the utility of NASA-derived satellite rainfall products. It is critical now that real-world operational flood forecasting agencies in the under-developed world come forward to collaborate with the research community in order to leverage satellite rainfall data for greater societal benefit for inhabitants in IRBs.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},

Pages = {51-60},
Abstract = {The standing crop of seagrass is highly sensitive to environmental disturbance. We evaluate 3 optical remote sensing methods for measuring standing crop in the tropical Western Atlantic. Extensive field measurements of standing crop were used to define empirical relationships with imagery from satellite sensors {[}Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT (Systeme Probatoire de l'Observation de la Terre) XS (multispectral)], and the digital airborne imager CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). Predictions of standing crop from processed imagery had high coefficients of determination: 0.74, 0.79 and 0.81 respectively. Using a bootstrap method to measure standard error, the 95\% confidence interval of predictions was found to have a similar order of magnitude to quadrat sampling in situ at a precision (standard error/mean) of 10\%. Explicit cost-benefit and monitoring considerations are discussed.},

Title = {Characterization of field-scale soil variation using a stepwise multi-sensor fusion approach and a cost-benefit analysis},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {201},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The potential of a stepwise fusion of proximally sensed portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectra and electromagnetic induction (EMI) with remote Sentinel-2 bands and a digital elevation model (DEM) was investigated for predicting soil physicochemical properties in pedons and across a heterogeneous 80-ha crop field in Wisconsin, USA. We found that pXRF spectra with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models can predict sand, total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), silt contents, and clay with validation R-2 of 0.81, 0.74, 0.73, 0.68, and 0.64 at the pedon scale but performed less well for soil pH (R-2 = 0.51). A combination of EMI, Sentinel-2, and DEM data showed promise in mapping sand, silt contents, and TN at two depths and Ap horizon thickness and soil depth across the field. A clustering analysis using combinations of mapped soil properties or proximal and remote sensing data suggested that data fusion improved the characterization of field-scale variability of soil properties. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the most accurate management zones (MZs) for topsoil can be generated only using estimated soil property maps while it was the most costly as compared to other data sources. For an intermediate-high (for topsoil) and high (subsoil) accuracy and a moderate economic budget, the combination of sensors (proximal + remote sensing + DEM) might be a better approach for effective MZs generation than collecting soil samples for laboratory analysis while the latter produced the most accurate maps for topsoil. It can be concluded that pXRF spectra can be useful for predicting key soil properties (e.g., sand, TN, OC, silt, clay) at different soil depths, and a combination of proximal and remote sensing provides an effective way to delineate soil MZs that are useful for decision-making.},

Title = {Sustainability assessment and causality nexus through ecosystem service accounting: The case of water purification in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {223},
Pages = {964-974},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The paper builds on the Supply and Use Tables module within the System of integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts - Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA EEA) developed by the UN. We explore the evolution of Supply and Use Tables from the System of National Accounts (SNA) to the System of integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts - Central Framework (SEEA CF) and then to the SEEA EEA, and we propose a further extension: we propose that ecosystem types should be treated as accounting units able to produce, consume and exhibit changes in regeneration and absorption rates. The implications are first explained in the methodological section and then shown in the application where the water purification service is tested against two major policy issues: sustainability assessment (we show how to assess whether the ecosystem service is used sustainably by comparing the quantification of potential and actual flow) and causality nexus (we quantify the connection between the value of agricultural production and that of the ecosystem service used). The paper highlights how the overall outcomes change when considering different scales. A contrast emerges, for example, between the positive balance at the continental scale, where water purification services appear to be used sustainably (thanks to the high potential flow of Northern European countries) and the negative balance of almost all European countries when considered at a national scale. Taking advantage of the experimental opportunities offered by operating with external satellite accounts, we are able to show how the proposed complementary tables could support policy action.},

Abstract = {Data from Earth observation systems are used extensively in managing and monitoring natural resources, natural hazards, and the impacts of climate change, but the value of such data can be difficult to estimate, particularly when it is available at no cost. Assessing the socioeconomic and scientific value of these data provides a better understanding of the existing and emerging research, science, and applications related to this information and contributes to the decision-making process regarding current and future Earth observation systems. Recent USGS research on Landsat data has advanced the literature in this area by using a variety of methods to estimate value. The results of a 2012 survey of Landsat users, a 2013 requirements assessment, and a 2013 case studies of applications of Landsat imagery are discussed.},

Title = {Dynamic optimization of intersatellite link assignment based on reinforcement learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Intersatellite links can reduce the dependence of satellite communication systems on ground networks, reduce the number of ground gateways, and reduce the complexity and investment of ground networks, which are important future trends in satellite development. Intersatellite links are dynamic over time, and different intersatellite topologies have a great impact on satellite network performance. To improve the overall performance of satellite networks, a satellite link assignment optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning is proposed in this article. Different from the swarm intelligence method in principle, this algorithm models the combinatorial optimization problem of links as the optimal sequence decision problem of a series of link selection actions. Realistic constraints such as intersatellite visibility, network connectivity, and number of antenna beams are regarded as fully observable environmental factors. The agent selects the link according to the decision, and the selection action utility affects the next selection decision. After a finite number of iterations, the optimal link assignment scheme with minimum link delay is achieved. The simulation results show that in 8 or 12 satellite network systems, compared with the original topology, the topology calculated by this method has better network delay and smaller delay variance.},

Abstract = {Contemporary land administration (LA) systems incorporate the concepts of cadastre and land registration. Conceptually, LA is part of a global land management paradigm incorporating LA functions such as land value, land tenure, land development, and land use. The implementation of land-related policies integrated with well-maintained spatial information reflects the aim set by the United Nations to deliver tenure security for all (Sustainable Development Goal target 1.4, amongst many others). Innovative methods for data acquisition, processing, and maintaining spatial information are needed in response to the global challenges of urbanization and complex urban infrastructure. Current technological developments in remote sensing and geo-spatial information science provide enormous opportunities in this respect. Over the past decade, the increasing usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite and airborne-based acquisitions, as well as active remote sensing sensors such as LiDAR, resulted in high spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution data. Moreover, significant progress has also been achieved in automatic image orientation, surface reconstruction, scene analysis, change detection, classification, and automatic feature extraction with the help of artificial intelligence, spatial statistics, and machine learning. These technology developments, applied to LA, are now being actively demonstrated, piloted, and scaled. This Special Issue hosts papers focusing on the usage and integration of emerging remote sensing techniques and their potential contribution to the LA domain.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the extent to which ecosystem services maps can improve land-use planning decisions by strengthening the consideration of environmental issues. The methodology used is based on an experimental workshop simulating a participatory decision-making process for planning choices by a panel of territorial actors. The protocol of the workshop consists in comparing the choices of location of new areas to be urbanized based firstly on a fine land cover map and secondly, by using a sample of ecosystem services maps. The results show the participants' interest in having ecosystem service maps for planning decision making. According to them, they bring an added value in terms of discovery, coherence, efficiency and acceptability of multifunctional space management practices. However, the operational actors of territorial engineering still make very little use of these maps derived from remote sensing and participatory workshops.},

Abstract = {Efficient water management is essential for water and food security leading to socio-economic development. In order to build resilience and achieve water security, planning and management of water resources projects needs to be based on realistic assessment of related aspects. This requires comprehensive, reliable and easily accessible information on demand, availability and utilisation of water resources. Observational capabilities from ground monitoring systems and supplementary/complementary data from satellite remote sensing provide unique opportunities for data integration and value addition supporting water management decisions. While LANDSAT-1 initiated various remote sensing based activities with respect to management of hydrology and water resources across the globe, the launch of Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-1A in 1988, along with its follow-up satellites, provided fillip to these activities mainly in India. The launch of IRS-1C in December 1995, with unique combination of sensors, has greatly improved extensive utilisation of satellite remote sensing for various facets of water management. This article presents a review of various applications carried out using IRS-1C data while highlighting the capabilities and advantage of IRS-1C sensors achieving significant improvement in mapping water bodies, inventory and monitoring of irrigated crops, irrigation system performance evaluation, assessment of reservoir sedimentation, mapping and monitoring of snow cover, snowmelt runoff forecasting, watershed developmental planning and management, etc.},

Abstract = {The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is composed of diverse component systems contributed by members and participating organizations of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). To enable these diverse components to interoperate, the GEOSS Architecture embodies principles given in the GEOSS 10-Year Implementation Plan and Reference Document. A basic principle is adoption of international standards and common interoperability arrangements, as seen in the contributed facility known as GEOSS Clearinghouse. GEOSS Clearinghouse acts as a cross-cutting discovery tool, encompassing all registered GEOSS components and external catalogs as well. Together, the GEOSS Architecture and GEOSS Clearinghouse enable GEO members and participating organizations to cooperate in realizing GEOSS. The resulting system of systems is simplifying access to resources for any and all users, including decision makers across the GEO Societal Benefit Areas. This paper explains key GEOSS Architecture principles and how GEOSS Clearinghouse applies international standards and interoperability arrangements.},

Abstract = {With an overarching goal to improve environmental management and resilience to climate change, SERVIR-Himalaya is established as a collaborative initiative of USAID, NASA and ICIMOD. The SERVIR-Himalaya has been the key instrument to provide integrated and innovative geospatial solutions for generation and dissemination of information and knowledge resources on mountain environments. The SERVIR applications, products and services are viewed as essential cross-cutting elements to achieve the greater impacts on addressing Himalayan livelihood challenges. The broad thematic areas which are also subset of the societal benefit areas of Global Earth Observation (GEO), namely - agriculture and food security, ecosystems and sustainable landscapes, and disaster risk management are addressed. On the cross-cutting theme, SERVIR Himalaya is also focusing on developing regional level applications providing key information systems and services on multiple themes of regional significance. The regional level science applications include use of MODIS satellite information products and services for environmental and natural resources monitoring in the Himalayan region. Regional and national training and workshops, on-the-job training, internships and exchange programs and technical backstopping are key capacity building components to enhance the capacity of partners from national institutions in the regional member countries. These efforts are also seen as receiving feedback on the science applications, identify additional needs, and increase synergy by exploring opportunities for collaboration.},

Abstract = {Information about forest cover is needed by all of the nine societal benefit areas identified by the Group of Earth Observation (GEO). In particular, the biodiversity and ecosystem areas need information on landscape composition, structure of forests, species richness, as well as their changes. Field sample plots from National Forest Inventories (NFI) are, in combination with satellite data, a tremendous resource for fulfilling these information needs. NFIs have a history of almost 100 years and have developed in parallel in several countries. For example, the NFIs in Finland and Sweden measure annually more than 10,000 field plots with approximately 200 variables per plot. The inventories are designed for five-year rotations. In Finland nationwide forest cover maps have been produced operationally since 1990 by using the k-NN algorithm to combine satellite data, field sample plot information, and other georeferenced digital data. A similar k-NN database has also been created for Sweden. The potentials of NFIs to fulfil diverse information needs are currently analyzed also in the COST Action E43 project of the European Union. In this article, we provide a review of how NFI field plot information has been used for parameterization of image data in Sweden and Finland, including pre-processing steps like haze correction, slope correction, and the optimization of the estimation variables. Furthermore, we review how the produced small-area statistics and forest cover data have been used in forestry, including forest biodiversity monitoring and habitat modelling. We also show how remote sensing data can be used for post-stratification to derive the sample plot based estimates, which cannot be directly estimated from the spectral data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Technologically mediated practices in sustainability transitions: Environmental monitoring and the ocean data buoy},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {182},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The discourses of sustainability are inextricably linked to the influence of technology in shaping the future. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in particular plays a crucial role in our understanding of the environment and human impacts as well as our search for future solutions to mitigate climate change. However advances in technology need to be accompanied by social innovation in order to meaningfully address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainability transitions research extends the well-established field of socio-technical systems analysis by paying closer attention to environmental, economical, social, political and technical factors that can stimulate change. Yet in order to offer guidance towards future socio-technical solu-tions, a deeper understanding of the relations between humanity and technology is necessary. To fulfill this requirement we explore the the concept of technological mediation and identify four ICT mediated practices in sustainability transitions: information gathering, communicating, decision-making, and self-reflection. These practices are described in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 14 Life Below Water, then elaborated through a specific example: the development and use of remote sensing ocean data buoys. In discussion we demonstrate the utility of technological mediation perspective to shed light on the interdependence of society, technology and the environment, and open critical discourses on sustainability transitions that can help shape equitable future alternatives.},

Abstract = {Freshwater, aquaculture, fisheries, biodiversity, forests, and agricultural land have high economic and social value throughout the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region; but they can also be over-exploited, with damaging consequences for local economies, long term stability and for the Earth system as a whole - especially the climate system. The ACP's fast growing population puts growing pressure on the environment to provide food, water and fibre, on the regions' urban centres and transport networks, and on energy sources. Information on the location, condition and evolution of resources is an important step towards sustainability, but unfortunately such information can be hard to get. Earth observing satellite technology combined with geographical information management can help fill the information gap. In this objective, and because of its unique position to support the implementation of advanced interoperable geospatial technologies, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) is setting-up of an ``Observatory for sustainable development{''} as single portal to support decision-making for development in the fields of natural resource and food security. The African Union and European Union recognise the importance of this service and are beginning to develop this capacity as part of the AU EU joint strategic partnership. This paper describes the needs, and presents the first steps taken by the JRC and by the joint partnership in harnessing space technologies to help meet Millennium Development Goals, in particular eradication of poverty, and environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems play an important role in maintaining the stability of the biosphere and improving the ecological environment. The valuation of forest ecosystem services provides data to support the implementation of forest ecosystem conservation and the development of ecological-compensation standards. We used multiple sources of data, such as remote-sensing and ground data, and we employed the methods of substitute market, shadow project, and contingent valuation. We valued the forest ecosystem services of Pudacuo National Park in Shangri-La, China, which consisted of six functions: soil conservation, forest nutrient retention, water conservation, carbon fixation and oxygen released, forest health care, and atmospheric environmental purification. The results showed that: the value of forest ecological services in Pudacuo National Park was 4.49 x 10(9) yuan center dot a(-1), with higher values of carbon fixation and oxygen released, water conservation, and forest health care, in the following order: carbon fixation and oxygen released (3.85 x 10(9) yuan center dot a(-1)), water conservation (3.40 x 10(8) yuan center dot a(-1)), forest health care (1.44 x 10(8) yuan center dot a(-1)), soil conservation (1.15 x 10(8) yuan center dot a(-1)), forest nutrient retention (3.29 x 10(7) yuan center dot a(-1)), and atmosphere environmental purification (1.17 x 10(7) yuan center dot a(-1)). In addition, the value of services per stand and unit area is discussed, and the results of the study will inform the government's ecological-compensation criteria in high-quality environmental areas.},

Abstract = {Land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) dynamics is one of the main drivers of global environmental change. In the last years, aerial and satellite imagery have been increasingly used to monitor the spatial extent of changes in LU/LC, deriving relevant biophysical parameters (i.e. primary productivity, climate and habitat structure) that have clear implications in determining spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity, landscape composition and ecosystem services. An innovative hierarchical modelling framework was developed in order to address the influence of nested attributes of LU/LC on community-based ecological indicators. Founded in the principles of the spatially explicit stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM), the proposed methodological advances are supported by the added value of integrating bottom-up interactions between multi-scaled drivers. The dynamics of biophysical multi-attributes of fine-scale subsystem properties are incorporated to inform dynamic patterns at upper hierarchical levels. Since the most relevant trends associated with LU/LC changes are explicitly modelled within the StDM framework, the ecological indicators' response can be predicted under different social-economic scenarios and site-specific management actions. A demonstrative application is described to illustrate the framework methodological steps, supporting the theoretic principles previously presented. We outline the proposed multi-model framework as a promising tool to integrate relevant biophysical information to support ecosystem management and decision-making.},

Abstract = {Mangroves are known for their global environmental and socioeconomic value. Despite their importance, mangrove like other ecosystems is now being threatened by natural and human-induced processes that damage them at alarming rates, thereby diminishing the limited number of existing mangrove vegetation. The development of a spatial vulnerability assessment model that takes into consideration environmental and socioeconomic criteria, in spatial and non-spatial formats has been attempted in this study. According to the model, 11 different input parameters are required in modelling mangrove vulnerability. These parameters and their effects on mangrove vulnerability were selected and weighted by experts in the related fields. Criteria identification and selection were mainly based on effects of environmental and socioeconomic changes associated with mangrove survival. The results obtained revealed the dominance of socioeconomic criteria such as population pressure and deforestation, with high vulnerability index of 0.75. The environmental criteria was broadly dispersed in the study area and represents vulnerability indices ranging from 0.00-0.75. This category reflects the greater influence of pollutant input from oil wells and pipelines and minimal contribution from climatic factors. This project has integrated spatial management framework for mangrove vulnerability assessment that utilises information technology in conjunction with expert knowledge and multi-criteria analysis to aid planners and policy/ decision makers in the protection of this very fragile ecosystem.},

Title = {NASA's Early Adopter Program Links Satellite Data to Decision Making},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {As the cost of satellite missions grow, government agencies are working to increase the relevance and usefulness of the Earth science data that they produce. The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) early adopter program seeks to formalize partnerships with users of data early within the satellite planning process to ensure the greatest value of the mission. Scientists who are designing the satellite observing system, those who are developing mission data products, and the community who will use them need to work together to determine how satellite data can better inform decision making. NASA is working to initiate engagement with data users much earlier in the satellite program life so that the user needs can be prioritized, continue to engage with users throughout the development cycle, and then include analysis on societal impact after nominal mission life. The Early Adopter Program allows for broad and early engagement with decision makers by encouraging individuals and institutions with clear uses of data to engage with the mission. Early adopters facilitate feedback on mission products during pre-launch and accelerate the utilization of these products post-launch. This paper provides background and detail on how NASA is working to engage with early adopters, describes the partnership between early adopters and NASA missions, and connects the program to improved societal impacts of its satellite missions.},

Abstract = {Watershed management may have widespread potential to cost-effectively deliver hydrologic services. Mobilizing the needed investments requires credible assessments of how watershed conservation compares to conventional solutions on cost and effectiveness, utilizing an integrated analytical framework that links the bio-, litho-, hydro- and economic spheres and uses counterfactuals. We apply such a framework to a payment for watershed services (PWS) program in Camboriti, Santa Catarina State, Brazil, Using 1 m resolution satellite imagery, we assess recent land use and land cover (LULC) change and apply the Land Change Modeler tool to predict future LULC without the PWS program. We use current and predicted counterfactual LULC, site costs and a Soil and Water Assessment Tool model calibrated to the watershed to both target watershed interventions for sediment reduction and predict program impact on total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations at the municipal water intake the principal program objective. Using local water treatment and PWS program costs, we estimate the return on investment (ROI; benefit costs) of the program. Program ROl exceeds 1 for the municipal water utility in year 44, well within common drinking water infrastructure planning horizons. Because some program costs are borne by third parties, over that same period, for overall (social) program ROI to exceed I requires delivery of very modest flood and supply risk reduction and biodiversity co-benefits, making co-benefits crucial for social program justification. Transaction costs account for half of total program costs, a result of large investments in efficient targeting and program sustainability. Co-benefits justify increased cost sharing with other beneficiaries, which would increase ROl for the utility, demonstrating the sensitivity of the business case for watershed conservation to its broader social-economic case and the ability to forge institutional arrangements to internalize third-party benefits.

Abstract = {Donax trunculus is a much-appreciated commercial clam whose natural populations have been overexploited in southern-western Spain during the last decades. In order to control the decrease of natural beds, local governments establish annual closed seasons based on socioeconomic reasons, such as economic necessity or tourism interest. The objective of this study was to develop an efficient tool for predicting gonadal stages based on environmental condition data. This tool will allow for an improvement in fishery management since in this manner the closed season can be based on the reproductive cycle. The natural population's reproductive cycle was studied for more than 2 years. The obtained gonadal and condition indexes (GI and CI) values were statistically related to environmental conditions, specifically surface seawater temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chlo-a) levels with these data being provided from satellite remote sensing observations (SRS). The best statistical relationship was obtained between GI and the SST registered 60 days before bivalve sampling (SST-60). The regression equation allows for an estimate of GI value based on the SST-60 and, as each value is related with one gonadal stage (resting, maturation, ripe), for prediction of the reproductive cycle. Therefore, the closed season can be established when most of the population is in the ripe stage and can be adjusted taking into account the possible temperature variations across the years. For ease of use, GI values estimated with this tool have also been converted using different colours onto a map of wedge clam reproductive stages in its natural beds.},

Abstract = {Telecommunications (TLC), Navigation (NAV) and Earth Observation (EO) represent the space sectors with the strongest growth, outstanding to the important spread of applications and services associated to them. Space borne data generate information with unique added value in the context of Earth's surveillance, geohazards mapping and infrastructure monitoring. Furthermore, the integrated implementation of satellite based services with other multi-source and multi-resolution technologies, including ground-based, aerial and non-destructive sensors, appears to become a crucial step for public and managing bodies in developing tools to assess actual state of civil engineering structures. Therefore, the Italian Space Agency has recently planned specific investments aimed at guaranteeing and improving real-time services, contributing to economic, scientific, technological and sustainable growth of our country. In this context, this work summarizes first outcomes of an ASI's initiative focused on opportunities for the community operating in the sector of national infrastructures, offered by current supply chain of space systems, services and applications. Scope of this work is to present the main outputs and analyze them, to identify several potential R\&D topics related to EO/NAV/TLC applications able to trigger a significant advance to support plan, design, construct and manage civil infrastructures at the network-scale level. In the framework of ASI's initiative, administrative authorities and national managers of transport infrastructures were called to present needs and requirements, as well as several on-going research activities and business existing services were considered. Status-of-the-art and gaps are useful to identify requirements of future space infrastructures and services, aimed to effectively support critical infrastructure assets management.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem service values (ESVs) of bays and their response to sea reclamation are of great practical importance for forming bay eco-compensation policy and extension of blue economic space. Based on land use information of bays collected during the period of 1990-2015, the spatiotemporal evolution of ESVs of 12 main bays in East China Sea and their response to sea reclamation activities over the past 25 years were quantitatively analyzed. The analysis results indicate that ESVs of bays in East China Sea showed a continuous downward trend and the whole ecosystem was continuously degraded, in which the degradation degree of ESV in the southern bays was higher than that in the northern bays. Spatial zoning of ESVs of bays in East China Sea was remarkable, showing a continuous downward trend from low-value to high-value zone. Spatial variation of ESVs of each bay was also significant, expanding from a city and from inland to the coast, which suggests that human activities, mainly reclamation, have become main agents for ESV evolution of bays in East China Sea. ESVs of bays have a significant response to sea reclamation, manifested as a significant negative correlation between ESV and reclamation intensity. The correlation in the southern bays was stronger than that in the northern bays, which was caused by different effects of sea reclamation modes on ESV evolution of muddy and bedrock bays. A negative effect of sea reclamation activities on bay ecosystem was hysteretic. Therefore, an attention should be paid to dynamic monitoring and early warning of development status in offshore areas, ecosystem-level reclamation control policy, and coastal wetland reserves planning. Moreover, the spatial coupling mechanism study between bay ecosystem service demand and its service supply capacity should be strengthened to realize systematic regulation of bay ecological security pattern.},

Title = {Assessing the value of information for water quality management in the North Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {90},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1280-1288},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global Earth Observation (GEO) is one of the most important sources of information for environmental resource management and disaster prevention. With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder-oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from `in situ' measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.

Title = {How can Big Data and machine learning benefit environment and water management: a survey of methods, applications, and future directions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Big Data and machine learning (ML) technologies have the potential to impact many facets of environment and water management (EWM). Big Data are information assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Fast advances in high-resolution remote sensing techniques, smart information and communication technologies, and social media have contributed to the proliferation of Big Data in many EWM fields, such as weather forecasting, disaster management, smart water and energy management systems, and remote sensing. Big Data brings about new opportunities for data-driven discovery in EWM, but it also requires new forms of information processing, storage, retrieval, as well as analytics. ML, a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI), refers broadly to computer algorithms that can automatically learn from data. ML may help unlock the power of Big Data if properly integrated with data analytics. Recent breakthroughs in AI and computing infrastructure have led to the fast development of powerful deep learning (DL) algorithms that can extract hierarchical features from data, with better predictive performance and less human intervention. Collectively Big Data and ML techniques have shown great potential for data-driven decision making, scientific discovery, and process optimization. These technological advances may greatly benefit EWM, especially because (1) many EWM applications (e.g. early flood warning) require the capability to extract useful information from a large amount of data in autonomous manner and in real time, (2) EWM researches have become highly multidisciplinary, and handling the ever increasing data volume/types using the traditional workflow is simply not an option, and last but not least, (3) the current theoretical knowledge about many EWM processes is still incomplete, but which may now be complemented through data-driven discovery. A large number of applications on Big Data and ML have already appeared in the EWM literature in recent years. The purposes of this survey are to (1) examine the potential and benefits of data-driven research in EWM,(2) give a synopsis of key concepts and approaches in Big Data and ML, (3) provide a systematic review of current applications, and finally (4) discuss major issues and challenges, and recommend future research directions. EWM includes a broad range of research topics. Instead of attempting to survey each individual area, this review focuses on areas of nexus in EWM, with an emphasis on elucidating the potential benefits of increased data availability and predictive analytics to improving the EWM research.},

Abstract = {Lack of knowledge on the conservation value of different reef types can stymie decision making, and result in less optimal management solutions. Addressing the information gap of coral reef resilience, we produce a map-based Remote Sensed Resilience Index (RSRI) from data describing the spatial distribution of stressors, and properties of reef habitats on the Farasan Banks, Saudi Arabia. We contrast the distribution of this index among fourteen reef types, categorized on a scale of maturity that includes juvenile (poorly aggraded), mature (partially aggraded), and senile (fully aggraded) reefs. Sites with high reef resilience can be found in most detached reef types; however they are most common in mature reefs. We aim to stimulate debate on the coupling that exists between geomorphology and conservation biology, and consider how such information can be used to inform management decisions.

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of ecosystem service value (ESV) and the driving mechanisms of spatial differentiation are fundamental to exploring the sustainable development of regional ecosystems. This article selected a coastal region in southeastern China with rapid economic development as the study object. Based on the five land-use remote sensing data sets from 2000 to 2019, the benefit transfer method was used to evaluate the ESV in the coastal zone of Jiangsu Province, revealing the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of ESV more accurately. Meanwhile, using the panel data regression model delved into the driving mechanisms of ESV spatial heterogeneity. The results showed the following: (1) There was a marked change in land use types from 2000 to 2019, with significant reductions in cropland and water areas and continued urban land expansion. The overall ESV in the study area exhibited a downward trend (8.41\%), with regulation and support services being its core functions. (2) The ESV distribution had a distinct spatial differentiation, with hotspots mainly located near the coastal zone and cold spots in towns and surrounding areas. (3) There were considerable differences in the degree of impact of each influencing factor on different types of ESVs. On the whole, land use intensity had the most significant impact and was the first driver, followed by climate change and socioeconomic factors. The findings indicate that future ecosystem management decision-making should involve the conservation and intensive use of land resources and guide human livelihood and production activities toward ESV preservation and appreciation.},

Abstract = {Urban sustainable development (SD) is a key concern of policy and decision-makers. As a result, numerous sustainability studies have been commissioned by government agencies that have led to the recommendation of suites of indicators to assess a host of related socio-economic and environmental issues. Many of these indicators have been described in concept only and a major challenge for science remains in translating verbal indicator descriptions into quantifiable measures. A Landsat-based Canadian national urban land database is being generated at the Canada Centre of Remote Sensing along with a set of urban sustainability indicators as value-added information to support informed transportation energy policy decision-making. This paper addresses indicator quantification, using the remote-sensing derived urban land use data, in the context of urban transportation-related energy consumption resulting from urban sprawl. Our work on quantification of sustainability indicators involves extraction of information about the characteristics of urban form (density, compactness and land use mix) and analysis of its impacts on land use efficiency, transportation and the environment. A generalized methodology for the categorization of indicators is presented based the level of information input and sophistication Of Computation needed for their quantification. Four indicators are discussed (population density, compactness, travel mode index and probability of travel distance) that span the category spectrum. Each indicator presents unique challenges in achieving its quantification in the form of information integration, analytic formulation or modeling. Example results for the cities of Ottawa-Gatineau and Calgary provide a preliminary insight into the difficulties in utilizing indicators for inter-city sustainability comparisons.

Abstract = {Urban landscapes are now the most inhabited places by the majority of global population. The rapid and large-scale land use land cover (LULC) changes induced by urbanization are declining the ecosystem services (ESs) provisioning capacity of natural and semi-natural ecosystems of urban landscapes. The main aim of the study was to assess the ecological changes caused by LULC change in the urbanized capital of the Central India, Bhopal. This study relied on satellite images (from 1988 to 2018) for generation of spatio-temporal LULC database and direct benefit transfer ecosystem service valuation scheme for quantifying the ecosystem service value (ESV). The results showed decline in total ESs by US \$ 2.00 million. Though water body covers least area out of 5 LULC types of the city, it remains the top contributor to total ESV in each reference year. The ecosystem service function analysis aided in identifying, regulating and provisioning services as the key contributors. In addition, assessment of ESs under two alternate future urban growth scenarios highlights the importance of conservation of natural ecosystems within the urban area. The results of this study can provide insights to the urban planners in effective decision making about how the ecosystems and their ecosystem service functions can be sustainably managed and strategically developed for the overall well-being of the growing urban population.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the combinatorial optimization problem of managing earth observation satellites (EOSs) such as the French SPOTS, which is concerned with selecting on each day a subset of a set of candidate photographs. The problem has a significant economic importance due to its high initial investment cost that exists in these instruments and its solution difficulty resulting from the large solution space, making it an attractive research area. This article proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the SPOTS selection problem using a new genome representation for maximizing not only a single objective as profit but a multi-criteria objective that includes the number of acquired photographs. Test results of our proposed GA show that it finds optimal solutions effectively for moderate size problems and obtains better results for two large benchmark instances coded 1403 and 1504 in the literature. Also, we verify the result that the best known value in the literature for problem coded 1401 is an optimal value. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660ha) in the agreste of Paraiba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46\% of the study area in 1989 and 5\% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2\% decline in the total ESV (from US\$ 13.7 million to US\$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89\% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified.},

Title = {Costs and benefits of satellite-based tools for irrigation management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a collaborative work with farmers and a cost-benefit analysis of geospatial technologies applied to irrigation water management in a semi-arid agricultural area in Lower Austria. We use Earth observation (Eo) data to estimate crop evapotranspiration (Et) and webGlS technologies to deliver maps and irrigation advice to farmers. The study reports the technical and qualitative evaluation performed during a demonstration phase in 2013 and provides an outlook to future developments. The calculation of the benefits is based on a comparison of the irrigation volumes estimated from satellite vs. the irrigation supplied by the farmers. In most cases, the amount of water supplied was equal to the maximum amount of water required by crops. At the same time high variability was observed for the different irrigation units and crop types. Our data clearly indicates that economic benefits could be achieved by reducing irrigation volumes, especially for water-intensive crops. Regarding the qualitative evaluation, most of the farmers expressed a very positive interest in the provided information. In particular, information related to crop ET was appreciated as this helps to make better informed decisions on irrigation. The majority of farmers (54\%) also expressed a general willingness to pay, either directly or via cost sharing, for such a service. Based on different cost scenarios, we calculated the cost of the service. Considering 20,000 ha regularly irrigated land, the advisory service would cost between 2.5 and 4.3 (sic)/ha per year depending on the type of satellite data used. For comparison, irrigation costs range between 400 and 1000 /ha per year for a typical irrigation volume of 2000 cubic meters per ha. With a correct irrigation application, more than 10\% of the water and energy could be saved in water-intensive crops, which is equivalent to an economic benefit of 40-100 (sic)/ha per year.},

Abstract = {Pingbian Miao Autonomous County is one of the poorest rural areas in China. Land-use changes, mainly driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation, may significantly impact ecosystem services and functions, but such effects are difficult to quantify. In the present study, Landsat image data were combined with the published coefficients about the world and China ecosystem to quantify land-use and ecosystem service changes in the mountainous area. A sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values. Our results show that during the past decades (from 1973 to 2004) forests and grasslands were converted into shrubland and cropland, respectively, resulting in a continuous decrease in ecosystem service (from 124.5 US\$ x 10(6) in 1973 to 100.4 US\$ x 10(6) in 2004). We found that the decrease of mixed forest in the study area was the largest contributor (i.e., 25.4 US\$ x 10(6)) to the decline of the ecosystem service. Therefore we propose that future land-use policy should pay more attention to the crucial ecosystem functions of these forests (including tropical forest), and that it is necessary to balance the relationship between the livelihood of local farmers and environmental protection in order to maintain a healthy and stable ecosystem.},

Abstract = {In recent years the cultural landscape has become an important issue for cultural heritages throughout the world. It represents the ``combined works of nature and of man{''} designated in Article 1 of the World Heritage Convention. When a landscape has a cultural heritage value, important features should be marked and mapped through the delimitation of a conservation area, which may be essential for further conservation work. However, a cultural landscape's spatial area is usually wider than the ordinary architectural type of cultural heritage, since various elements and impact factors, forming the cultural landscape's character, lie within a wide geographic area. It is argued that the conservation of a cultural landscape may be influenced by the delimitation of the conservation area, the corresponding land management measures, the limits and encouragements. The Jianan Irrigation System, an historical cultural landscape in southern Taiwan, was registered as a living cultural heritage site in 2009. However, the system's conservation should not be limited to just only the reservoir or canals, but expanded to irrigated areas where farmland may be the most relevant. Through the analysis process, only approximately 42,000 hectares was defined as a conservation area, but closely related to agricultural plantations and irrigated by the system. This is only half of the 1977 irrigated area due to urban sprawl and continuous industrial expansion.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest-growing animal food production sector worldwide and is becoming the main source of aquatic animal food in human consumption. Depletion of wild fishery stocks, rising global populations, continuing demand for food fish, and international trade has driven aquaculture's tremendous expansion during the last decades - in terms of production volume and value. Farmed aquatic products are among the most widely traded commodities in the world food economy. Aquaculture has mainly been developed in valuable fertile coastal environments and caused large-scale land use changes, destruction and loss of coastal wetlands and pollution of waters and soils. This article presents an overview of the relevance, current status and distribution of aquaculture in global and regional scales and depicts its key environmental impacts. Quantitative assessment of the spatial extent, distribution, and dynamics of aquaculture is of utmost importance for a sustainable management of our planet's land and water resources ensuring human and environmental health. The article points to the potential of remote sensing to detect, map and monitor large-scale aquaculture areas and gives a complementary review of satellite remote sensing studies addressing the observation of aquaculture including site selection, site detection and monitoring of related impacts on the environment.

Abstract = {Large amounts of Earth observation (EO) data have been collected to date, to increase even more rapidly with the upcoming Sentinel data. All this data contains unprecedented information, yet it is hard to retrieve, especially for non-remote sensing specialists. As we live in an urban era, with more than 50\% of the world population living in cities, urban studies can especially benefit from the EO data. Information is needed for sustainable development of cities, for the understanding of urban growth patterns or for studying the threats of natural hazards or climate change. Bridging this gap between the technology-driven EO sector and the information needs of environmental science, planning, and policy is the driver behind the TEP-Urban project. Modern information technology functionalities and services are tested and implemented in the Urban Thematic Exploitation Platform (U-TEP). The platform enables interested users to easily exploit and generate thematic information on the status and development of the environment based on EO data and technologies. The beta version of the web platform contains value added basic earth observation data, global thematic data sets, and tools to derive user specific indicators and metrics. The code is open source and the architecture of the platform allows adding of new data sets and tools. These functionalities and concepts support the four basic use scenarios of the U-TEP platform: explore existing thematic content; task individual on-demand analyses; develop, deploy and offer your own content or application; and, learn more about innovative data sets and methods.},

Abstract = {With the development of economics and society, the degradation of natural resources and environment is aggravated globally. The values of ecological environment and ecosystem service have been paid more and more attention popularly. However, the spatial-temporal changes in ecosystem service value (ESV) and their hotspots in China are not well understood. Chinese government has integrated the construction of ecological civilization into all aspects and processes of economic construction, political construction, culture construction and social construction, and clearly puts forward that we should establish the concept of natural value and natural capital, also natural ecosystem is valuable. During 2012 to 2021, an important project of China's First National Geographic Conditions Census and Continuously Monitoring had been completed by Chinese government. In this project, high resolution land cover product all over the country had been generated, and would be updated continuously every year. This achievement had received more and more attention, which brought the possibility of big data computing. A calculating method of land's ecosystem service value was proposed by using this achievement. The characters of data type, data time phase, and data structure for all the remote sensing information was analyzed. Based on this, a revised ecosystem service value assessment model was used for calculating. Combining the standard of terrestrial ecosystem in China and the equivalent value factor per unit ecosystem area, the specific calculating algorithm based on the big data was designed. Wuhan city, Hubei province, China was selected as the study area for validating the calculating method. The results showed that the total ecosystem service value in Wuhan city in 2015 was 9.42x10(10) CNY, and the per capita ecosystem service value was 1.15x10(4) CNY. Specially, water supplied the most ecosystem service value which accounted for 79.95\%, followed by forest, grassland, farmland, and desert. The research shows that high-precision quantification and spatialization ecosystem service value can be calculated and obtained by using the high resolution land cover product obtained in the project of China's First National Geographic Conditions Census and Continuously Monitoring; the independent research and development software has solved the problem of software requirements, and the operational efficiency and performance can meet the calculating needs; the big data calculating algorithm has solved the problems of design and computation of structured and unstructured big data computing models; The results of this study will help to maintain the sustainable development of an area, and supporting more effective decision-making around the implementation of ecological conservation policies.},

Title = {Coupling Relationship between Ecosystem Service Value and Socioeconomic Development in the Qinba Mountains, China},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {The degree of coordination between ecosystem services and the level of socioeconomic development has essential implications for regional sustainability. The coordinated development of ecology and economy is a major theoretical and practical problem for the Qinba Mountains, which is once one of the 14 contiguous destitute areas in China. Based on the land use and cover change (LUCC) data interpreted by medium-resolution remote sensing images, this study adopted the modified equivalent factor method to calculate ecosystem service value (ESV) and its temporal and spatial variation in the Qinba Mountains. A comprehensive index system was constructed to measure the socioeconomic development level and to reveal the coupling relationship between the ESV and socioeconomic development. The results show that: (1) for 2000-2015, the ESV in these areas was increasing, the proportion of forest ESV was the largest, and it increased significantly. (2) The level of socioeconomic development was constantly improving, and the differences within the region were gradually emerging. (3) Except for the Hantai District, which has been in a highly uncoordinated state, the degree of coordination between ESV and socioeconomic development has improved year by year, and most counties were in a state of medium coordination, or above. The results contribute to a scientific basis for decision making regarding ecological environmental protection and green economic development in the Qinba Mountains, and have positive significance for promoting the construction of ecological civilization and sustainable development in the study area.},

Title = {Using Satellite Image Fusion to Evaluate the Impact of Land Use Changes on Ecosystem Services and Their Economic Values},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Accelerated land use change is a current challenge for environmental management worldwide. Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004-2019) from fused imageries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34\%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local authorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales.},

Abstract = {Longxi County in Gansu province is a representative region of eco-frangibility in loess plateau. It is of significance to study the effect of land use change on ecosystem service values. This paper aimed to provide decision support for sustainable use of resources and protection of eco-environment by assessing land use change and its consequent changes in ecosystem service values of Longxi County. We obtained land use data by interpreting remote sensing images. Based on dynamic data of land use in Longxi County, this paper analyzed changes in land use and ecosystem service values using the ecosystem service value coefficients put forward by Costanza et al. In addition, coefficients of sensitivity were introduced to test the rationality of ecological value coefficients. Results show that from 1980 to 200(), area of forestland, grassland and construction land decreased and area of hilly dry land and plain dry land increase. In generally, value-to-service of ecosystem in Longxi County reduced from 1980 to 2000. The total slip in the past 20 years is 0.237\% and the annual slip is 0.012\% Value-to-service of ecosystem in Longxi County form 1980 to 19955 increases, but the increasing extent is not prominent.},

Title = {Changes of ecosystem service values in response to land use/land cover dynamics in Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the Ethiopian highlands},

Abstract = {Land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics alter ecosystem services values (ESVs), yet quantitative evaluations of changes in ESVs are seldom attempted. Using Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the Ethiopian highlands as an example, we showed estimate of changes in ESVs in response to LULC dynamics over the past four decades (1973-2012). Estimation and change analyses of ESVs were conducted, mainly, by employing GIS using LULC datasets of the year 1973, 1986, 2000 and 2012 with their corresponding global value coefficients developed earlier and our own modified conservative value coefficients for the studied landscape. The results between periods revealed a decrease of total ESVs from US\$ 130.5 million in 1973, to US\$ 118.5, 114.8 and 111.1 million in 1986, 2000 and 2012, respectively. While using global value coefficients, the total ESVs declined from US\$ 164.6 million in 1973, to US\$ 135.8, 127.2 and 118.7 million in 1986, 2000 and 2012, respectively. The results from the analyses of changes in the four decades revealed a total loss of ESVs ranging from US\$ 19.3 million when using our own modified value coefficients to US\$ 45.9 million when employing global value coefficients. Changes have also occurred in values of individual ecosystem service functions, such as erosion control, nutrient cycling, climate regulation andwater treatment, which were among the highest contributors of the total ESVs. However, the value of food production service function consistently increased during the study periods although not drastically. All in all, it must be considered a minimum estimate of ESV changes due to uncertainties in the value coefficients used in this study. We conclude that the decline of ESVs reflected the effects of ecological degradation in the studied landscape and suggest further studies to explore future options and formulate intervention strategies.

Abstract = {In this study, local air quality impacts of a proposed conventional coal-fired power plant in the Ice1 region has been investigated using numerical dispersion modeling studies coupled with a GIS application. Within the impact area of the facility, Industrial Source Complex Short Term (ISCST2) dispersion model has been used to estimate ground-level concentrations of air pollutants originating from the power plant. For the same impact area, GIS applications have been utilised to determine the agricultural yield distribution. For this purpose, relevant satellite images were digitised, classified and statistically analyzed. Based on the predicted ground-level pollutant concentrations and sensitivity of the agricultural crops to the pollutants, agricultural yield loss was estimated for the impact area. The results have been quantified and valuated in monetary terms for the purpose of performing an environmental cost benefit analysis. Comparison of the conventional cost benefit analysis with the environmental cost benefit analysis showed the significance of the external cost of the proposed facility, resulting from the environmental damages.},

Abstract = {There is a significant and detailed range of sustainability indicators for Irish agri-food production, but there remain areas where further indicator development or new indicators could prove valuable. This review provides an outline of potential developments in Irish assessment of agricultural sustainability following the latest research and in order to meet policy demands. Recent research findings have suggested means of improved quantitative modelling of greenhouse gas emissions, but additional dietary and soil data may be important for this, especially for the potential inclusion of any soil sequestration. This information could also benefit more detailed modelling of nutrient losses to water. Specific concerns over pesticide and antibiotic use may require additional survey work on the particular locations or types of farms of interest. Biodiversity monitoring could be improved by expanding the range of results-oriented agri-environment schemes or employing remote-sensing habitat monitoring, likely supplemented with targeted field surveys for specific objectives. Farm-level economic sustainability is largely well-covered, but additional data collection may be of benefit to address specific issues such as labour costs. Recent additional surveys on farm-level social sustainability have addressed important social indicators of isolation and access to local services, and could be rolled out on a larger number of farms in the future. Wider societal concerns such as animal welfare, genetically modified materials in foodstuffs and antibiotic resistance have limited indicators currently available, and could also benefit from additional surveys. The breadth and detail required in agri-food sustainability indicators present a significant challenge to survey design and implementation, but many developments can be achieved without additional surveys through the use of remote sensing and geospatial technologies and integration of existing datasets. Despite the important benefits of further developments in Irish sustainability indicators, consideration must also be given to farmer confidentiality and survey fatigue.},

Abstract = {Providing goods and services, while maintaining ecosystem service functions and biodiversity that built up their sustainable supply to support human welfare, is one of the great challenges of our time. This study examined the dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) changes, temporal variation of ecosystem service value (ESV), the threatened ecosystem services function in Su-Xi-Chang region, and explore the consequences of unsustainable use of land resources on ESV provision. Remote sensing applications were used to evaluate changes in LULC, and an evaluation method for ESV based on land cover change was applied in 2000, 2005 and 2010. Our study investigated that change in ESV was caused mainly due to the expansion of construction land, which was increased by 88\% during the study period. Meanwhile, ESV dropped from 57.1775 x 10(9) CNY in 2000 to 53.7585 x 10(9) CNY in 2010. Ecosystem service function for food provision was the most critically affected followed by climate and gas regulation functions respectively. Waste treatment and water supply were the two largest services functions provided by ecosystems of the area. The expansion of construction land, which have due impact on LULC change, is likely responsible for the overall decline in 3.4190 billion CNY ESV of the region. As they have showed the highest ESV and greatest degradation during the study period, protection of farmland and water bodies should be paid due attention by regional land use planning and policy making offices. As a result, sustainable use of land resources and mitigation of the declining ESV of the region will be realized.},

Abstract = {Precision technologies and data have had relatively modest impacts in grass-based livestock ruminant production systems compared with other agricultural sectors such as arable. Precision technologies promise increased efficiency, reduced environmental impact, improved animal health, welfare and product quality. The benefits of precision technologies have, however, been relatively slow to be realised on pasture based farms. Though there is significant overlap with indoor systems, implementing technology in grass-based dairying brings unique opportunities and challenges. The large areas animals roam and graze in pasture based systems and the associated connectivity challenges may, in part at least, explain the comparatively lower adoption of such technologies in pasture based systems. With the exception of sensor and Bluetooth-enabled plate metres, there are thus few technologies designed specifically to increase pasture utilisation. Terrestrial and satellite-based spectral analysis of pasture biomass and quality is still in the development phase. One of the key drivers of efficiency in pasture based systems has thus only been marginally impacted by precision technologies. In contrast, technological development in the area of fertility and heat detection has been significant and offers significant potential value to dairy farmers, including those in pasture based systems. A past review of sensors in health management for dairy farms concluded that although the collection of accurate data was generally achieved, the processing, integration and presentation of the resulting information and decision-support applications were inadequate. These technologies' value to farming systems is thus unclear. As a result, it is not certain that farm management is being sufficiently improved to justify widespread adoption of precision technologies currently. We argue for a user need-driven development of technologies and for a focus on how outputs arising from precision technologies and associated decision support applications are delivered to users to maximise their value. Further cost/benefit analysis is required to determine the efficacy of investing in specific precision technologies, potentially taking account of several yet to ascertained farm specific variables.},

Title = {The Utilization of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to Map Habitat Quality in Turin (Italy)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The integration of ecosystem service mapping in decision-making is crucial to place effective urban design and sustainable planning solutions. Nonetheless, often ecosystem service maps are the product of different data inputs that influences the final modeling output thus affecting final decisions, especially when a finer and site-specific assessment is required to design practical and effective solutions. In this work, the city of Turin (Northwest Italy) was selected as a test site for an empirical experiment of ecosystem service mapping using the software Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST): two habitat quality models of the city were compared in a Geographic Information System environment, the first using the ``traditional{''} sensitivity employed during the LIFE SAM4CP European research while the second using the natural difference vegetation index to re-assign the sensitivity scores. Results demonstrate that the integration of site-specific information in the habitat quality input model generates a different result, which is capable of differentiating all those dense built-up areas of the dense settlement system that provide ecosystem supporting functions at the city-level. These differences were analyzed to define new green hotspots in the compact city while furnishing a new perspective for sustainable city planning.},

Title = {Ecosystem Service Loss in Response to Agricultural Expansion in the Small Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China: Process, Driver and Management},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Converting natural ecosystems to cultivated land, driven by human activities, has been considered a significant driver of limiting the delivery of ecosystem services (ES). The ES loss in the past was mainly caused by agricultural activities that have been taken to meet people's needs in Northeast China. Quantifying historical declining ecosystem service values is essential to facilitate sustainable development. In this study, remote sensing images were used to investigate the history of cultivated land expansion over the last five decades. Additionally, ES variations caused by agricultural expansion since 1965 were quantified in the Small Sanjiang Plain (SSP), Northeast China. From the results, cultivated land expanded from 3.97\% of the total SSP area to 66.40\% from 1965 to 2015 (approximately 898.23 million ha), of which paddy field expanded drastically from 0\% to 55.93\%. Variations in cultivated land resulted in a loss of ecosystem service values by 11,893.85 million dollars, of which 62.98 million dollars were caused by the internal conversion between cultivation during 1965-2015. Agricultural expansion accelerated the export of agricultural products function, while it decreased almost all other functions, especially hydrological regulation and freshwater supply function. For future sustainability of the SSP, some suggestions, such as restoring natural ecosystems, planting trees between cultivated land, coculture systems, and winter-flooding of paddy rice were provided in our study.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The comprehensive application of ecosystem service value (ESV) and ecological risk index (ERI) assessment can provide better decision support for regional ecological environment protection. Based on the remote sensing image data of Wuhu city of 1995, 2005 and 2016, the paper analyzed the spatial-temporal evolution of ESV and ERI inWuhu city and its associated characteristics using an ESV, ERI assessments and a bivariate spatial autocorrelation method. The results showed that (1) the total ESV of Wuhu city continued to decline from 1995 to 2016, with a decrease of US\$ 363.664 million. The total ESV per unit area of the sampling plot decreased, and the high-value was mainly distributed in areas within 5-10 km along the Yangtze River floodplain. (2) Wuhu city was mainly dominated by a relatively low ERI and medium ERI from 1995 to 2016. The high-value areas were mainly distributed in the mainstream of the Yangtze River, and the overall ERI improved. (3) There was a positive spatial correlation between the total ESV per unit area and ERI inWuhu city, and these areas were mainly distributed in the Yangtze River mainstream region. According to this research, it is necessary to pay attention to the protection of wetland and forest landscapes, strengthen wetland ecological protection based on the Yangtze River and protect and restore natural mountain forests, all of which play important roles in improving the ecosystem service function of Wuhu city and protecting the ecological environment of the Yangtze River. We should act on that knowledge, and produce effective environmental regulations and habitat restoration efforts that improve the ESV and reduce the ERI. The findings of the study can serve as a reference for the management and protection of ecological environments in river-crossing cities.},

Abstract = {Land use and land cover is a fundamental variable that affects many parts of social and physical environmental aspects. Land use and land cover changes (LUCC) has been known as one of the key drivers of affecting in ecosystem services. The trans-boundary Gandaki River Basin (GRB) is the part of Central Himalayas, a tributary of Ganges mega-river basin plays a crucial role on LUCC and ecosystem services. Due to the large topographic variances, the basin has existed various land cover types including cropland, forest cover, built-up area, river/lake, wetland, snow/glacier, grassland, barren land and bush/shrub. This study used Landsat 5-TM (1990), Landsat 8-OLI (2015) satellite image and existing national land cover database of Nepal of the year 1990 to analyze LUCC and impact on ecosystem service values between 1990 and 2015. Supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to obtain the various land cover types. To estimate the ecosystem services values, this study used coefficients values of ecosystem services delivered by each land cover class. The combined use of GIS and remote sensing analysis has revealed that grassland and snow cover decreased from 10.62\% to 7.62\% and 9.55\% to 7.27\%, respectively compared to other land cover types during the 25 years study period. Conversely, cropland, forest and built-up area have increased from 31.78\% to 32.67\%, 32.47-33.22\% and 0.19-0.59\%, respectively in the same period. The total ecosystem service values (ESV) was increased from 50.16 x 10(8) USD y(-1) to 51.84 x 10(8) USD y(-1) during the 25 years in the GRB. In terms of ESV of each of land cover types, the ESV of cropland, forest, water bodies, barren land were increased, whereas, the ESV of snow/glacier and grassland were decreased. The total ESV of grassland and snow/glacier cover were decreased from 3.12 x 10(8) USD y(-1) to 1.93 x 10(8) USD y(-1) and 0.26 x 10(8) USD y(-1) to 0.19 x 10(8) USD y(-1), respectively between 1990 and 2015. The findings of the study could be a scientific reference for the watershed management and policy formulation to the trans-boundary watershed.},

Abstract = {Copernicus is the European Union's Earth Observation and Monitoring programme, delivering free access to operational and historical environmental data to support applications in a wide range of societal benefit areas. To allow meaningful long-term environmental monitoring and robust decision-making, it is essential to ensure that satellite-retrieved products are of high quality and consistency. This paper describes the outputs of an international workshop on the radiometric calibration validation of the Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B Multi-Spectral Instrument. A wide range of vicarious methodologies have been applied independently and then compared per type of target. All methods agree on the good radiometric performance of both Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B with respect to the mission requirements as well as on evidence of a slight bias between the two instruments. Comparisons of all these results are discussed to highlight the benefits and advantages of the methods as well as to propose potential improvements either for the methods themselves and/or for the comparison exercise.},

Title = {The role of satellite image-processing for national-scale estimates of gene flow from genetically modified crops: rapeseed in the UK as a model},

Abstract = {1. There is concern over the possibility of unwanted environmental change following transgene movement from genetically modified (GM) rapeseed Brassica napus to its wild and weedy relatives. 2. The aim of this research was to develop a remote sensing-assisted methodology to help quantify gene flow from crops to their wild relatives over wide areas. Emphasis was placed on locating sites of sympatry, where the frequency of gene flow is likely to be highest, and on measuring the size of rapeseed fields to allow spatially explicit modelling of wind-mediated pollen-dispersal patterns. 3. Remote sensing was used as a tool to locate rapeseed fields, and a variety of image-processing techniques was adopted to facilitate the compilation of a spatially explicit profile of sympatry between the crop and Brassica rapa. 4. Classified satellite images containing rapeseed fields were first used to infer the spatial relationship between donor rapeseed fields and recipient riverside B. rapa populations. Such images also have utility for improving the efficiency of ground surveys by identifying probable sites of sympatry. The same data were then also used for the calculation of mean field size. 5. This paper forms a companion paper to Wilkinson et al. (2003), in which these elements were combined to produce a spatially explicit profile of hybrid formation over the UK. The current paper demonstrates the value of remote sensing and image processing for large-scale studies of gene flow, and describes a generic method that could be applied to a variety of crops in many countries. 6.Synthesis and applications. The decision to approve or prevent the release of a GM cultivar is made at a national rather than regional level. It is highly desirable that data relating to the decision-making process are collected at the same scale, rather than relying on extrapolation from smaller experiments designed at the plot, field or even regional scale. It would be extremely difficult and labour intensive to attempt to carry out such large-scale investigations without the use of remote-sensing technology. This study used rapeseed in the UK as a model to demonstrate the value of remote sensing in assembling empirical information at a national level.},

Title = {Localizing SDG 11.6.2 via Earth Observation, Modelling Applications, and Harmonised City Definitions: Policy Implications on Addressing Air Pollution},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While Earth observation (EO) increasingly provides a multitude of solutions to address environmental issues and sustainability from the city to global scale, their operational integration into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework is still falling behind. Within this framework, SDG Indicator 11.6.2 asks countries to report the ``annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in cities (population-weighted){''}. The official United Nations (UN) methodology entails aggregation into a single, national level value derived from regulatory air quality monitoring networks, which are non-existent or sparse in many countries. EO, including, but not limited to remote sensing, brings forth novel monitoring methods to estimate SDG Indicator 11.6.2 alongside more traditional ones, and allows for comparability and scalability in the face of varying city definitions and monitoring capacities which impact the validity and usefulness of such an indicator. Pursuing a more harmonised global approach, the H2020 SMURBS/ERA-PLANET project provides two EO-driven approaches to deliver the indicator on a more granular level across Europe. The first approach provides both city and national values for SDG Indicator 11.6.2 through exploiting the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service reanalysis data (0.1 degrees resolution and incorporating in situ and remote sensing data) for PM2.5 values. The SDG Indicator 11.6.2 values are calculated using two objective city definitions-{''}functional urban area{''} and ``urban centre{''}-that follow the UN sanctioned Degree of Urbanization concept, and then compared with official indicator values. In the second approach, a high-resolution city-scale chemical transport model ingests satellite-derived data and calculates SDG Indicator 11.6.2 at intra-urban scales. Both novel approaches to calculating SDG Indicator 11.6.2 using EO enable exploration of air pollution hotspots that drive the indicator as well as actual population exposure within cities, which can influence funding allocation and intervention implementation. The approaches are introduced, and their results frame a discussion around interesting policy implications, all with the aim to help move the dial beyond solely reporting on SDGs to designing the pathways to achieve the overarching targets.},

Abstract = {The Usumacinta floodplain is an exceptional area for biodiversity with important ecosystem services for local people. The main objective of this paper was to estimate reference values and define local perceptions of ecosystem services provided by wetlands and overlapping them with spatially explicit socioeconomic and biodiversity indicators. We used the Usumacinta floodplain as an example of a territory where high dependence of rural people on ecosystem services is confronted with development projects that threat the flow of ecosystem services, thus affecting rural people well-being. With a combination of data from remote sensing, global databases of ecosystem service values, local perception of ecosystem services and socioeconomic and biodiversity richness indicators in a spatially explicit framework, we develop a policy-oriented approach for rapid assessment to manage wetlands and maintain people's livelihoods. Regulating and provisioning services are identified as the most relevant ecosystem services in terms of their monetary value and local perceived importance. In a spatially explicit manner, this approach highlights the most valuable wetlands and identifies rural societies that are highly dependent on ecosystem services. Our approach can be replicated elsewhere and could provide valuable information for policymakers to design policies that can contribute to conserve wetland ecosystems where under threat of development.},

Abstract = {Land quality assessment is of great important for decisions on sustainable land uses and the conservation of ecosystems of high biodiversity value. The main objective of this study was to determine properties of land quality of specially protected area of the Salt Lake using CORINE land quality assessment methodology and to propose a revision for this model. In addition to field study and laboratory analysis, digital soil map, digital elevation model, satellite image and climatic data were used and analyzed with remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques to generate actual land quality map and to form database for study area. Results show that 42.1\% of the study area has high quality, 28.7\% was classified as moderate quality and 4.0\% was determined as low quality. On the other hand, some places classified as moderate quality, were not accurately classified. These places should be low land quality due to content of high salt concentration. Therefore, to resolve this insufficient situation, some soil parameters such as chemical properties should be collaborated with this model. In this case, moderate land quality level of the study area decreased from 28.7 to 12.3\%, whereas 4.0\% of low quality land of the study area increased to 20.8\%. In addition, this research was also carried out to provide guidance for planner or decision makers about specially protected area of the Salt Lake.},

Abstract = {Being located in the northwest of Beijing,Guanting Reservoirhas beenan important sourceto supply water for life, production and landscape;however, with the increasing urbanization and population agglomeration in the upstream since 1980s, the resource and environment of Guanting Reservoir Basin was also undertaken an increasingly pressure accordingly with water quantity dropped and quality deteriorated, so Guanting Reservoir was ruled out of the drinking water supply systemof Beijing since 1997. As a series of ecological protection and management project have been implemented with the 21st century coming, Guanting Reservoir restored itswater-supply function for agriculture, ecology and industryin 2003, and restored its function as drinking watersource in 2007, so it became an emergency water-supply source of Beijing again. The environmental protection status and economic development model of Guanting Reservoir Basin plays anessential role for water security of Beijing. In this paper, takenGuanting ReservoirBasin as the study case, the land use dataof different periods since 1980s have been extracted from remote sensing imagesof the study area to analyze the land use changes. Based on the land use data,Costanza ecosystem service value formula and correction parameter suitable for Chinasituations, the basin ecosystem service value is calculated to analyze the changes in leadingecosystem function ofGuanting ReservoirBasin in different periods. In combination with the social and economic statistical data, the driving factors are discussed for changes in the leading function, and the approaches are put forward to enhance the upstream ecosystem function, so as to guarantee the sustainable economic and social development in the Basin. It is indicated from the research results that: (1) the driving forces for the changes in dominate ecosystem functions of Guanting ReservoirBasin mainly result from policy factor, population factor and economic factor; (2) the ecosystem services of Guanting ReservoirBasinare presented as asymmetricspatial characteristic; and (3) the eco-compensation mechanism is an important means to balance the asymmetryof ecosystem services between the upstream and downstream of Guanting ReservoirBasin and enhance the upstream capacity for provision of ecosystem services. The quantitative eco-compensation mechanism is the key point of follow-up research to enhance ecosystem services; the scenario analysis will have a prospective potential to propose some policy suggestions with more operability.},

Abstract = {The Australian Government spends well over half a billion dollars every year in programs designed to protect, enhance or measure the environment. This diverse range of programs covers a breadth of activities such as driving changes in land management practices to protect the Great Barrier Reef, undertaking surveys of agricultural productivity, and the management of millions of dollars of environmental water that is used to protect and improve critical wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin. Earth observation (EO) data has a vital role to play in optimizing this investment and demonstrating value-for-money to taxpayers. Ubiquitous spatial coverage, decades of regular observations and paddock-scale resolution mean that EO data has a unique ability to provide insights into the effectiveness of land and water programmes and ensure that Australia is getting the maximum value from its investments. Through the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Program, Australia has pioneered the use of `big space data' techniques to enable satellite data to be effectively and easily exploited to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Australian Government. DEA is based on the Australian Geoscience Data Cube which was developed by Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and Australia's National Computational Infrastructure. The Australian Geoscience Data Cube has now been released as the Open Data Cube.},

Title = {The Value of a Decrease in Temperature by One Degree Celsius of the Regional Microclimate-The Cooling Effect of the Paddy Field},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In the face of climate change, extreme climates are becoming more frequent. There were severe droughts in Taiwan in 2020, 2014-2015, and 2002. In these years, the paddy fields were kept fallow to save water and transfer agricultural water to non-agricultural use. On the other hand, with global warming, the existence of paddy fields may be one of the natural solutions to regional temperature mitigation. This study used remote sensing to quantify the difference in temperature between paddy fields and urban areas. The result of overall surface temperature deductive analysis revealed that the temperature in the whole Taoyuan research area was 1.2 degrees C higher in 2002 than in 2003 because of fallowing of the paddy field, while in the Hsinchu research area, it was 1.5 degrees C higher in 2002 than in 2003, due to the same reason described above. In terms of the difference in land use, for the Hsinchu research area, the surface temperature deductive result showed that the average paddy field temperature in 2002 was 22.3 degrees C (sample area average), which was 7.7 degrees C lower than that of the building and road point and 4.3 degrees C lower than that of the bare land point. The average paddy field temperature in 2003 was 19.2 degrees C (sample area average), which was 10.1 degrees C lower than that of the building and road point and 8.3 degrees C lower than that of the bare land point. Then this study evaluated the economic valuation of the paddy field cooling effect using the contingent valuation method. Through the paddy field cooling effect and in the face of worsening extreme global climate, the willingness to pay (WTP) of the respondents in Taiwan for a decrease of 1 degrees C with regard to the regional microclimate was evaluated. It was found that people in Taiwan are willing to pay an extra 8.89 USD/per kg rice/year for the paddy for a decrease in temperature by 1 degrees C in the regional microclimate due to the paddy field. Furthermore, this study applied the benefits transfer method to evaluate the value of a decrease of 1 degrees C in the regional microclimate in Taiwan. The value of a decrease of 1 degrees C in the regional microclimate in Taiwan is 9,693,144,279 USD/year. In this regard, the economic value of 1 degrees C must not be underestimated. In conclusion, more caution is needed while making decisions to change the land use of paddy fields to other land uses.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to identify the gaps in the assessment and modeling of ecosystem services to help researchers, resource managers, and decision-makers develop a holistic understanding of the ecosystem service assessments' foundations. This review proposes that to efficiently assess the ecosystem services, methodologies that are region-specific and standardized in the terminologies are useful in determining the valuation component in the ecosystem services assessments' goal to explain trade-offs between development and conservation priorities for implementation of conservation policies. Ecosystem service assessments are critical for the sustainable future of Earth. Numerous scholarly studies have been conducted in the field of ecosystem services (ES) that have laid down the foundation of their valuation, mapping, and quantification. We reviewed 103 peer-reviewed publications using the SCOPUS database, perhaps the most extensive database of peer-reviewed research literature as well WoS, PUBMED, and Google Scholar databases based on certain criteria. Our review revealed that different definitions of the ES concept and the non-standardization of the economic concepts for assigning market values to the ecosystem services had shown conflicting results. Further, we also found that ES assessment methodologies depend upon the evaluation purpose and vary from qualitative approaches to modeling and integrated ones. ES assessment has considerable implications in understanding the earth's surface processes and the pursuing benefits in the form of balanced trade-offs between sustainability and development. To attain sustainable development goals, we propose shifting towards a green economy to balance the trade-off between conservation and development.},

Title = {Evaluating China's biomass power production investment based on a policy benefit real options model},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {751-761},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {In this study, a policy benefit real options model was developed to evaluate biomass power production investment in China. A method based on the cumulative probability was proposed using binomial decision tree calculations for the exercising of options in order to evaluate the optimal investment timing. Two scenarios were analyzed to identify the optimal investment strategy with/without the consideration of revenue from certified emission reduction (CER). Uncertainties in straw purchased price, government incentives, and technological improvements were considered. The results showed that it was not optimal for immediate investment in biomass power production in China. Given full government subsidy, the thresholds of straw purchased price for scenarios 1 and 2 are 213.55 and 218.87 RMB/ton, respectively, while the current straw purchased price in Chinese market is 220 RMB/ton. The investment of biomass power production would be executed at 2022 and 2028 with/without the consideration of revenue from CER in the current situation in China if there are no government incentive to encourage motivation, respectively. The conclusion could provide useful information for power enterprise decision-makers on whether and when to invest a biomass power production in China in an uncertain environment.

Abstract = {Tourism is following a path of sustained growth at the global level, with important socio-economic impacts all over the world, justifying a critical discussion on the existing methods (and limitations) for their estimation (tourism satellite accounts, input-output methods, or computable general equilibrium and social account models), along with an overview and analysis of different techniques to assess the economic value of nonmarketable tourism-related assets, like nature or cultural heritage (hedonic prices or contingent valuation) or immaterial valuable aspects (like the loyalty of visitors). The communal character of many tourism resources, with the consequent appropriation and provision problems characterizing the common pool resources, is also discussed. A more specific discussion on the contribution of tourism for economic growth (tourism-led growth hypothesis) and its limitations in the long run is framed within the consideration of the historical dimension of tourism development, through the analysis of the evolutionary aspects of the life cycle of tourism destinations, including potential negative long-term consequences of specialization in tourism. In this context, the analytic contributions related to the evolutionary economic geography, emphasizing the roles of place and time, emerge as useful tools for the study of the economic dynamics of tourism in contemporary societies, mostly when discussing the role of tourism within the context of a regional economy and its relations with other sectors, activities, and innovation dynamics.},

Abstract = {Governments around the world, as well as private industry, invest heavily in remote sensing spacecraft to obtain data about natural and environmental resources, climate change, and the relationship of earth science to human health and quality of life. Numerous studies have been undertaken to describe and measure the value of the data from these spacecraft in order to justify further investments. The studies use a wide variety of methods and generally find a large range of benefits, from quite small to very large, in part because of differences in methodologies. This article offers a general framework for measuring the value of information. The framework serves two purposes. One is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science. The second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data. Decision makers comprise three communities: consumers and producers of information, public officials whose job is to invest in data acquisition and information development (including sensors and other hardware, algorithm design and software tools, and a trained labor force), and the public at large.

Title = {Assessing the policy adoption and impact of geoinformation for enhancing sustainable mining in Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {241},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {This paper assesses the extent to which mineral rich African countries enable the creation of public geoinformation for enhancing sustainable mining in policy contexts. The paper reviews accessible works and searches databases of industry, governments, civil society, academia, and international organizations. Focus is on 23 major producer countries of globally relevant minerals across Africa. The paper finds a disconnect between mining sector policy regimes and the desire to achieve sustainable development, lack of deliberate policy provision for the adoption and usage of geoinformation to enhance Free, Prior Informed Consent and public participation in mineral resource development projects. Out of the 23, only 2 countries (9\%) have expressed the need for geoinformation in mining policies; as an input to public debate and data-driven decision making. Only 3 countries (13\%) have set parameters for buffering around environmental and social variables. Out of these 3, only 2 have explicit parameters delineating exploration and mining areas. By not requiring public geospatial data, the implications are existence of poor benefit sharing, poor understanding of environmental risks, and a lack of integrated land use planning in resource-rich African countries. Hence, policy-oriented recommendations include expanding awareness on the value of and enhancing access to geoinformation, establishing paragraphs on geoinformation in Country Mining Visions, and strengthening local capacity for handling these data. Mineral-rich African countries must optimize benefits derivable from emerging Earth Observation technologies and associated spatial data for measuring contributions of the mining sector to specific SDGs.

Abstract = {The ecosystem of the Sanjiang Plain in China has dramatically changed in the past four decades. This study investigated the history of paddy field expansion in the Sanjiang Plain and discovered the ecosystem service variations in response to paddy expansion. Integrating a series of Landsat images, we obtained the paddy expansion history from 1976 to 2015. Then, we calculated ecosystem service values (ESVs) to estimate the ecosystem service variations caused by paddy expansion in the Sanjiang Plain. The results indicate that the paddy area increased from 404,789-2,598,449 ha during 1976-2015, leading to a decline in the total ecosystem service values by 11288.04 million dollars. The largest decline in ESVs in response to paddy expansion was caused by wetland reclamation (9998.54 million dollars). Apart from agricultural products and gas regulation functions, the ESVs provided by other functions all showed a declining trend. Paddy expansion in the Sanjiang Plain increased agricultural product function at the expense of the decline of other functions. In future management practices, the rational allocation of water resources and paddy distribution are necessary in order to achieve sustainable development of both water resources and agricultural production. Some suggestions including coculture systems, restoring habitats for aquatic species, farm management that fosters biodiversity in paddy fields are provided for future sustainability.},

Title = {Cloud cover and its impact on Brazil's deforestation satellite monitoring program: Evidence from the cerrado biome of the Brazilian Legal Amazon},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {140},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The creation of a satellite rapid alert programme (DETER-A) in 2004 was a cornerstone of the Brazilian government's strategy to reduce deforestation. This programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to periods of deforestation. Due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation. This paper investigates to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the DETER-A program to detect deforestation. To test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation. The emphasis is on the state of Maranhao, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (Legal Amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not. The results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7\% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of CO2 with a value of US\$ 366 million. If the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument DETER-C/DETER INTENSO, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection.},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {ABSTR A C T Water science, water economics, and water policy issues continue to rise in importance internationally as elevated population, income growth, and climate change magnify scarcity, shortages, and injustices in water access. Based on the unique physical, institutional, and economic characteristics of water, this work's first contribution is to characterize a road forward for research innovations that enable better integration of water science, water economics, and water policy. Meeting water's sustainable development and justice goals calls for several research innovations that humanity awaits. The advances called for in this work include deep uncertainty management, red team reviews, innovative water rights design, accelerating SDG achievement, valuing water infrastructure, valuing natural water retention, incentivizing water conservation, improving financial perfor-mance of rural water systems, water network modularization, non-price scarcity signals, optimization model calibration, remote sensing, transboundary benefit sharing, optimal growth, and water valuation. The work's second contribution is to present a prototype scalable basin scale hydroeconomic analysis (HEA) as a framework for integrating these above innovations when they occur. Results of the HEA show that losses from a 50\% shortage in the basin's surface water supply can continue to protect 93\% of total economic benefits across economic sectors if an efficient water trading system is established to move water from lower to higher valued uses when shortages occur. The work concludes by noting that great advances remain needed for better and longer lives.},

Title = {From Environmental Soundness to Sustainable Development: Improving Applicability of Payment for Ecosystem Services Scheme for Diverting Regional Sustainability Transition in Developing Countries},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {In developing and emerging countries, rapid urbanization at an unprecedented pace and degradation of ecosystem services at an alarming rate have caused many regions, especially those in environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs), to encounter the regional development dilemma (RDD), in which regions can hardly divert their current development pattern to achieve a transition to sustainability. The main research focus of this study is to introduceby means of a case studya payments for ecosystem service (PES) scheme as a policy instrument that incorporates an ecosystem services (ES)-based baseline for payments and a spatial-targeting-based allocation plan to address that dilemma and to bridge, as well as achieve, sustainable development goals simultaneously at a regional scale. The water source areas of the Middle Route Project in the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China were used as the case study. Land Use/Land Cover Change (LUCC) of this area between 2002 and 2010 was detected by adopting remote sensing and spatial analysis technologies. The ecosystem services value (ESV) variation was then estimated and the eco-compensation plan was determined through comprehensively applying equivalent weighting factors of the ecosystem service of terrestrial ecosystems in China and the adjustment coefficient of the ecosystem service based on the notion of willingness to pay for ecosystem services. Results show that rapid urbanization has substantial impacts on the spatial dynamics and quality of ecosystems in the research area. From 2002 to 2010, the total ESV declined by CNY 6 billion. Therefore, the baseline eco-compensation from the benefit zone to the research area was CNY 1.1 billion under the assumption of commensurability. Responsibility ought to be shared by Henan and Hebei provinces, and Beijing and Tianjin, with payment of CNY 422.3, 388.5, 110.9, and 133 million, respectively. We drafted the allocation plan of eco-compensation based on the spatial pattern of ESV variation, and suggested policy tools tailored for subregions in the research area defined by LUCC change categories. Such an integrated study can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of regional PES schemes and provide a set of policy instruments with upgraded spatial-targeting and better cost-efficiency, particularly as blueprints for regional governments in developing and emerging countries that aim at leveraging regional sustainability through bridging and achieving SDGs.},

Abstract = {Land use changes have a considerable impact on ecosystem services (ESs). In recent years, land use changes caused by urban expansion in Nanjing City have been obvious and are expected to further change in the future. Therefore, it is urgent to quantitatively assess ecosystem service value (ESV) changes caused by previous land use changes and future potential changes in Nanjing. In this study, land use data products based on remote sensing images, Dyna-CLUE model, and the ESV equivalent coefficient method were applied to assess the impact of land use changes on ESVs in Nanjing City over the past 23 years (1995-2018), and to forecast the changes of ESV in 2030. The results indicated that the total ESVs of Nanjing City displayed a trend of first increasing and then declining in 1995-2018. From the land use classification, the water area had the largest ESV in Nanjing, followed by arable land. Additionally, the regulating service value was the highest among the four primary ESs in Nanjing from 1995 to 2030, with the highest value of 13.73 billion yuan in 2015. Among the three forecast scenarios, the ecological protection scenario had the highest total ESV and was followed by the urban expansion and business as usual scenarios. These findings may assist for the scientific decision-making of sustainable land use and ecosystem management in Nanjing City.},

Abstract = {The use of existing data from remote sensing technologies, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and economic modeling can be integrated in a visual Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool that can aid in streamlining and enhancing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and public participation. The interoperability of different data outputs provides researchers and practitioners the ability to produce high quality visualizations that can enhance the communication of proposed projects and the projected economic and social impacts on a community and surrounding area. User priority and value inputs combined with the high quality visualizations in a MCDM tool can provide multiple alignment alternatives for each transportation project participant. By providing additional and improved data through a new decision-making tool, ECO-PAL, researchers and practitioners will be able to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the efforts regarding NEPA development and make ``every day count.{''}},

Title = {Assessment of grassland use intensity by remote sensing to support conservation schemes},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {125-134},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Grassland is a land cover in the area of conflict between agriculture and conservation, where intensification of land use is a major threat to grassland biodiversity. Grassland use intensity is a key factor for the conservation value of grassland, and detailed spatial data on grassland use intensity is needed to improve strategies for biodiversity conservation. A new remote sensing-based approach using multi-temporal high resolution RapidEye satellite data was developed in the present study that makes a large-scale assessment of grassland use intensity possible. RapidEye is a constellation of five satellites with 6.5 m spatial resolution, which allows frequent and timely image acquisition targeted at specific growing seasons. Semi-natural grassland, extensively used grassland, intensively used grassland and tilled grassland could be reliably differentiated at the management plot level in a study area in southern Germany. Various combinations of images from different observation dates have been tested as classification input and their overall classification accuracies were validated by field data. Best results were achieved using a combination of five multi-temporal scenes with an overall accuracy of 85.7\%. A three-scene combination resulted in an overall accuracy of 82.2\%. The analysis showed that seasonal aspects are very important when selecting adequate observation dates. Grassland use intensity was also assessed on peatlands using a peat soil map, since land use intensity significantly affects greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. The results demonstrate the potential of targeted multi-spectral, high spatial resolution remote sensing for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic habitats, which is of vital importance to support various environmental conservation schemes through improved monitoring and reporting capabilities.

Abstract = {Collecting the earth's critical climate signatures over the next 30 years is an obvious priority for many world governments and international organizations. Implementing a solution requires bridging from today's scientific missions to `operational' constellations that are adequate to support the future demands of decision makers, scientific investigators and global users for trusted data. In earlier authored efforts, time was spent parsing out `operational' constellation components (lite review below). This paper will focus on contrasting architectural alternatives from historically different perspectives. First, the heavily securitized NPOESS architecture, while undone by requirements growth and collaborations that were not sustained; but an instructive (ambitious) constellation construct to learn from with its targeted collection of environmental parameters (starting in 1994). Second, examining the requirements of earth climate observations identified by GCOS (2006) in ECV's (essential climate variables) measured from space-based sensors with global coverage and sufficient quality to ensure the needs of major global \& international organizations (UNFCCC \& IPCC). Third, how the application of a rule-based decision engine thesis (2012) {[}17] can improve the architectural trades of earth observation satellite systems, allowing comparison(s) to existing architectures and gaining insights for recommendations to global architectures (assessing the value of alternatives and effectively exploring the trade space) and would offer the global community. These converged architecture discussions are instructive based on the time when they occurred, and their refinement of environmental \& climate variables and associated trade space(s). The examples of required environment parameters, leads into essential climate variables and becomes a critical part the knowledge domain space for a new rule based decision architecting tool that can iterate an optimized best value constellation solution as its goal. The process of discovering new architectural alternatives reinforces the necessity for international collaborative efforts and elicits identification by and responses from key stakeholders.},

Title = {Linking landscape pattern, ecosystem service value, and human well-being in Xishuangbanna, southwest China: Insights from a coupling coordination model},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Landscape pattern, ecosystem service value (ESV), and human well-being are closely related. Determining the link between the three is significant to the realization of regional sustainable development. However, the relationship is complex and vulnerable to multiple factors, many of which remain unknown. This study used remote sensing imagery of Xishuangbanna to map land-use in 1996, 2003, 2010, and 2016 and used landscape metrics to quantify landscape pattern changes. This research evaluated changes to ESV using the benefit transfer method and evaluated changes in human well-being using the evaluation index system and the entropy weight method. A coupling coordination model was used to analyze the coupling coordination state of the three, and the grey correlation method was used to determine key factors involved in the coupling mechanism. The results show that: (1) Forest, rubber, and tea are the main land-use types, with the area of forest decreasing, the area of rubber presenting an inverted V-shape change trend, the area of tea presenting an N-shape change trend, and the transformation of a large quantity of forest land into rubber and tea plantations. (2) The landscape pattern has become more fragmented, and connectivity and stability are in decline. (3) Climate regulation, water regulation, and erosion prevention are the main ecosystem services and, from 1996 to 2016, total ESV decreased by 3.53 billion yuan, mainly due to the decrease in forest ESV. Meanwhile, across the region, the area of high value decreased, and the area of median value increased, with a distribution trend of high value in the north and low value in the south. (4) The level of human well-being continues to rise. (5) The link between landscape pattern, ESV, and human well-being was relatively strong, and the coupling coordination degree first increased and then decreased, changing from grudging coordination to primary coordination and then dropping to a state of near maladjustment. Patch density and food production are the key coupling effect factors of landscape pattern and ESV on human well-being, respectively. The study results provide a reference for regional land-use policy and economic decision-making. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. CC\_BY\_NC\_ND\_4.0},

Title = {A GIS-based methodology for sustainable farming planning: Assessment of land use/cover changes and carbon dynamics at farm level},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {111},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The assessment of carbon dynamics as a climate-regulation ecosystem service (ES) by modeling of scenarios on land use and land cover (LULC) changes is widely used in environmental conservation studies to support public policies. However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007-2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production. These results are useful to support land use planning and management for both environmental conservation policies and sustainable farming production.},

Abstract = {The implementation of integrated landscape management to support local and regional human well-being is crucial in arid regions, but its application to date is very limited. Although analytical frameworks have been established to maximize ecosystem services via trade-offs between different landscape configurations, consumption factors such as water resources are rarely and weakly considered in such frameworks. In this paper, an improved integrated landscape-management analysis framework, called the Consumption-integrated Landscape Management to Ecosystem Service (CLMES), is proposed. In this framework, consumption factors are integrated at the same level as ecosystem services. The improved analytical framework is then used to assess and optimize landscape design in the Ejina Oasis, an extremely arid region in western China. Three landscape conditions (past, current, and future) are evaluated, based on the CLMES. Our results indicate that the Heihe River water-allocation program effectively promoted ecosystem services in the Ejina Oasis from 2000 to 2011. However, the excessive expansion of cropland led to a slight decline in habitat quality. An optimized landscape configuration and policy suggestions are proposed, which may be beneficial to the improvement of total water-use efficiency, oasis stability, and resilience of the ecological-social system in the Ejina Oasis.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the beginning of Rwanda's current work on natural capital accounts. Many developing countries began similar work on environmental satellite accounts in the 1990s and early 2000s, only to abandon them a few years later when the initial political interest waned. The question arises, therefore, as to whether renewed interest in these accounts has the potential to have a longer lasting impact on national accounting practices. In Rwanda's case, the decision was to begin satellite accounting work by focusing on resources where key economic trade-offs between different uses had already begun to be identified by policymakers, and where the gathering of economic statistics had already been improved as a result. It seems likely that this approach could lead to more durable satellite accounts, and that a similar approach would be feasible in many other countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Forest ecosystems are our priceless natural resource and are a key component of the global carbon budget. Forest fires can be a hazard to the viability and sustainable management of forests with consequences for natural and cultural environments, economies, and the life quality of local and regional populations. Thus, the selection of strategies to manage forest fires, while considering both functional and economic efficiency, is of primary importance. The use of decision support systems (DSSs) by managers of forest fires has rapidly increased. This has strengthened capacity to prevent and suppress forest fires while protecting human lives and property. DSSs are a tool that can benefit incident management and decision making and policy, especially for emergencies such as natural disasters. In this study we reviewed state-of-the-art DSSs that use: database management systems and mathematical/economic algorithms for spatial optimization of firefighting forces; forest fire simulators and satellite technology for immediate detection and prediction of evolution of forest fires; GIS platforms that incorporate several tools to manipulate, process and analyze geographic data and develop strategic and operational plans.},

Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Forests, serving as crucial custodians of our planet's ecological balance, also constitute a significant source of livelihood for humanity. Karst regions, recognized as some of the world's most susceptible landscapes, grapple with the dual predicaments of ecological restoration and resident impoverishment. To bridge the gap between environmental and economic concerns, this manuscript employs an amalgamation of remote sensing and socio-economic methodologies to devise a comprehensive assessment framework, thereby scrutinizing the alterations in forest ecosystems from 2001 to 2020.The investigation reveals that over the past two decades, forest rehabilitation within the study area has yielded commendable outcomes, substantially mitigating various ecological dilemmas instigated by rocky desertification in this region. The forested area has increased significantly, and the ecosystem service value has more than doubled. These improvements are largely attributed to compulsory forest conservation measures, demonstrating their decisive influence. The study advocates meticulous management and conservation strategies to safeguard these unique ecosystems and ensure their sustainability. This research underscores the significance of striking a balance between maintaining ecological integrity and fostering economic development, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on sustainable forest management in vulnerable landscapes.},

Title = {Evaluating the Utility of High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Air Pollution Data in Estimating Local PM2.5 Exposures in California from 2015-2018},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Air quality management is increasingly focused not only on across-the-board reductions in ambient pollution concentrations but also on identifying and remediating elevated exposures that often occur in traditionally disadvantaged communities. Remote sensing of ambient air pollution using data derived from satellites has the potential to better inform management decisions that address environmental disparities by providing increased spatial coverage, at high-spatial resolutions, compared to air pollution exposure estimates based on ground-based monitors alone. Daily PM2.5 estimates for 2015-2018 were estimated at a 1 km(2) resolution, derived from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm in order to assess the utility of highly refined spatiotemporal air pollution data in 92 California cities and in the 13 communities included in the California Community Air Protection Program. The identification of pollution hot-spots within a city is typically not possible relying solely on the regulatory monitoring networks; however, day-to-day temporal variability was shown to be generally well represented by nearby ground-based monitoring data even in communities with strong spatial gradients in pollutant concentrations. An assessment of within-ZIP Code variability in pollution estimates indicates that high-resolution pollution estimates (i.e., 1 km(2)) are not always needed to identify spatial differences in exposure but become increasingly important for larger geographic areas (approximately 50 km(2)). Taken together, these findings can help inform strategies for use of remote sensing data for air quality management including the screening of locations with air pollution exposures that are not well represented by existing ground-based air pollution monitors.},

Abstract = {The following article outlines a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to remote sensing in Southwest Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta that combines ethnographic inquiry and remote sensing to monitor, detect and preserve cultural resources for Alaskan Native communities. Because distinctive vegetation differences are readily visible on cultural sites during the summer months, the analysis of multispectral imagery obtained from remote sensing is particularly useful. In turn, we demonstrate the efficacy of this protocol on pre-contact settlement sites along the Ayakulik River system on Kodiak Island using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) raster of the study area. Here, support vector machine (SVM) supervised classification was highly effective at identifying spectral patterns associated with anthropogenic activity while ethnographic data helped rule out false-positive cases. In addition, we provide the results of a 2019 archaeological prospection survey carried out in conjunction with the ongoing Nunalleq Project in Quinhagak, Alaska, to further highlight the value of ethnographic data collection, ethnobotanical surveys and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based spectroscopy alongside SVM supervised classification. Finally, we propose three suggestions for future research on Yup'ik landscapes in the Y-K Delta regarding citizen science, language preservation and the use of collaborative online maps for community-based decision making.},

Abstract = {The expansion of major cities regardless of the scientific planning principles has led to the emergence of negative urban development impacts in Iran such as the degradation of natural resources and various forms of pollution. Undoubtedly, urban rivers can enhance the ecological value of the earth to an optimal extent. However, to benefit from these potentials, appropriate planning looks inevitable. Due to the lack of data and information, analyzing the quality of these resources requires the application of new methods which consider the uncertainties and complexities of the issue in the decision making. This research presents an application of fuzzy TOPSIS multi attribute group decision making to identify factors causing land degradation, distinguish the most optimal areas based on their ecological values and provide suggestions on landscape improvement. To this end, the development of Shiraz city along the Khoshk River corridor was investigated using the 1:25000 maps and satellite images (ICONOS). With respect to the river attributes and adjacent lands, the riverside was divided into four heterogeneous zones. Then, to distinguish the most optimal zone based on the ecological values, the fuzzy decision making method was applied. To this end, the expansion of human activities and biophysical criteria were defined, separately. A number of experts determined the importance of each indicator qualitatively. Finally, using the group decision making theory and fuzzy TOPSIS technique, the researchers identified the most suitable zone based on the ``biophysical criteria{''} and ``human activity criteria{''} separately as well as the whole criteria, and provided suggestions on the landscape improvement.},

Abstract = {Conservation early warning and alert systems (CEAS) provide tremendous opportunities to inform strategic and effective environmental responses. However, these systems are not systematically evaluated based on how they are contributing to conservation outcomes. We survey the current state of systems enabled by satellite monitoring to support tropical forest management and highlight their recent proliferation and the sparse evaluations of these systems in terms of user adoption and application for improving conservation decisions. To guide practitioners, funders and policymakers to choose the appropriate tool for the application, we distinguish two types of CEAS, Rapid Response and Targeted Response, characterized by the user application and the timeframe for decision-making. These tools are distinct from monitoring tools used for policy and planning which require routine, high-accuracy and quantifiable estimates of land cover change. We see a need for more systematic evaluations quantifying their environmental and socioeconomic benefits and improved indicators measuring progress toward achieving conservation outcomes. To inform system developers, we summarize best practices for increasing system adoption and use gleaned from seasoned applications of early warning and alert systems for conservation and humanitarian applications. Engaging diverse stakeholders, building permanent capacity, increasing accessibility and interpretability of the information, and communicating the information value to decision-makers help root these systems into decision-making processes. Incorporating local knowledge and on-the-ground monitoring information from stakeholders can improve alert accuracy while respectfully honoring local knowledge and garnering stakeholder trust in the systems. Strengthening cross-institutional networks, building political support, and allocating adequate resources empower decision-makers to act upon the information. Addressing today's urgent conservation challenges requires linking accessible, trusted and effective CEAS to empowered people taking conservation actions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a simple but powerful Real Options Valuation methodology suitable for valuing flexibility in complex engineered systems. It is based on value-at-risk analysis and relies on a standard discounted cash flow approach. It demonstrates the method with a case study of the architecting of flexible fleets of satellites. The architecting framework integrates spacecraft engineering design with economic analysis to maximize the financial value of a fleet to the operator under realistically uncertain, evolving market conditions. The investigation considers possible evolutions of the forecast demand for a satellite service in two distant geographical markets simultaneously. It defines flexible fleets that significantly improve various aspects of the value-at-risk distributions compared to those of a traditional, rigid fleet architecture. It shows that the flexible architectures can capture more revenue, mitigate more risk and/or reduce overall required investment. The suggested Real Options ``in{''} the system, rather than ``on{''} the system, approach allows engineers, strategists, or decision makers in engineering establishments to embed flexibility in the design of complex systems so they can maximize total lifetime project value.},

Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are a rising threat to biodiversity, national security, and regional economies, with impacts in the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars annually. Proactive or predictive approaches guided by scientific knowledge are essential to keeping pace with growing impacts of invasions under climate change. Although the rapid development of diverse technologies and approaches has produced tools with the potential to greatly accelerate invasion research and management, innovation has far outpaced implementation and coordination. Technological and methodological syntheses are urgently needed to close the growing implementation gap and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and synergy among evolving disciplines. A broad review is necessary to demonstrate the utility and relevance of work in diverse fields to generate actionable science for the ongoing invasion crisis. Here, we review such advances in relevant fields including remote sensing, epidemiology, big data analytics, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, genomics, and others, and present a generalized framework for distilling existing and emerging data into products for proactive IAS research and management. This integrated workflow provides a pathway for scientists and practitioners in diverse disciplines to contribute to applied invasion biology in a coordinated, synergistic, and scalable manner.},

Abstract = {Urbanization has profound influence on the changes of land use and land cover, which on the other hand exert significant impact on ecosystem services and their values, especially in the urban agglomerations. Kolkata urban agglomeration of India has been selected to determine the causes in changes of ecosystem services under present and projected land use land cover scenario. Land use land cover maps of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were prepared by support vector machine method, using LANDSAT satellite imageries and projected up-to 2040 using CA-Markov model. Built-up land was increased by 65.39\% during 1990-2020 and will further increase to 76.88\% by 2040. Built-up lands are mainly encroaching crop lands and wetlands. During the period of fifty years (1990-2040), the ecosystem service value will decrease from \$38,486.49 to \$28,060.79, with annual rate of decrement of 0.54\%. During the same period, the spatial extent of very low ecosystem service value will be increased from 16.60 to 58.88\%; whereas, the area coverage of very high ecosystem service value will be decreased from 2.69 to 2.35\%. Water supply contributed highest ecosystem service value followed by disturbance regulation and nutrient cycling; whereas, lacking in soil formation, pollination and biological control services contributed lowest. The study will help in decision making process for sustainable management of natural resources and also provide useful guideline for the quality improvement in urban ecosystems.},

Title = {Timely monitoring of Asian Migratory locust habitats in the Amudarya delta, Uzbekistan using time series of satellite remote sensing vegetation index},

Abstract = {The Asian Migratory locust (Locusta migratoria migratoria L.) is a pest that continuously threatens crops in the Amudarya River delta near the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan, Central Asia. Its development coincides with the growing period of its main food plant, a tall reed grass (Phragmites australis), which represents the predominant vegetation in the delta and which cover vast areas of the former Aral Sea, which is desiccating since the 1960s. Current locust survey methods and control practices would tremendously benefit from accurate and timely spatially explicit information on the potential locust habitat distribution. To that aim, satellite observation from the MODIS Terra/Aqua satellites and in-situ observations were combined to monitor potential locust habitats according to their corresponding risk of infestations along the growing season. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm was applied for classifying time series of MODIS enhanced, vegetation index (EVI) from 2003 to 2014 at an 8-day interval. Based on an independent ground truth data set, classification accuracies of reeds posing a medium or high risk of locust infestation exceeded 89\% on average. For the 12-year period covered in this study, an average of 7504 km(2) (28\% of the observed area) was flagged as potential locust habitat and 5\% represents a permanent high risk of locust infestation. Results are instrumental for predicting potential locust outbreaks and developing well-targeted management plans. The method offers positive perspectives for locust management and treatment of infested sites because it is able to deliver risk maps in near real time, with an accuracy of 80\% in April-May which coincides with both locust hatching and the first control surveys. Such maps could help in rapid decision-making regarding control interventions against the initial locust congregations, and thus the efficiency of survey teams and the chemical treatments could be increased, thus potentially reducing environmental pollution while avoiding areas where treatments are most likely to cause environmental degradation.

Abstract = {Rangelands cover similar to 23 million hectares and support a \$3.4 billion annual cattle industry in California. Large variations in forage production from year to year and across the landscape make grazing management difficult. We here developed optimized methods to map high-resolution forage production using multispectral remote sensing imagery. We conducted monthly flights using a Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) in 2017 and 2018 over a 10-ha deferred grazing rangeland. Daily maps of NDVI at 30-cm resolution were first derived by fusing monthly 30-cm sUAS imagery and more frequent 3-m PlanetScope satellite observations. We estimated aboveground net primary production as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) derived from NDVI and light use efficiency (LUE), optimized as a function of topography and climate stressors. The estimated forage production agreed well with field measurements having a R-2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 542 kg/ha. Cumulative NDVI and APAR were less correlated with measured biomass (<mml:semantics>R2</mml:semantics> = 0.68). Daily forage production maps captured similar seasonal and spatial patterns compared to field-based biomass measurements. Our study demonstrated the utility of aerial and satellite remote sensing technology in supporting adaptive rangeland management, especially during an era of climatic extremes, by providing spatially explicit and near-real-time forage production estimates.},

Abstract = {Deforestation is an environmental stressor that dramatically threatens biodiversity while having adverse, deep-rooted, socioeconomic impacts. Interventions to address deforestation require considerable long-term investments; therefore, assessing their impact is crucial. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity encourages establishing protected areas (PAs) as a strategy to conserve biodiversity, secure ecosystem services, support local livelihoods, and reduce climate change impacts. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has supported the conservation and management of PAs, yet site accessibility and data availability present challenges in assessing PAs using traditional evaluation methods. We present a novel application of satellite Earth observations for evaluating the effectiveness and impact of PAs as a deforestation mitigation strategy. Geospatial analysis and ecological forecasting methodologies provide an efficient way to quantify land cover change, estimate aboveground carbon stock, and evaluate ecosystem services provided by the PAs ex ante. We demonstrate the value of a geospatial approach through the evaluation of GEF-supported PAs in Kenya.},

Title = {Assessing Forest Cover Dynamics and Forest Perception in the Atlantic Forest of Paraguay, Combining Remote Sensing and Household Level Data},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (BAAPA) in Paraguay is one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world. The rapid growth of deforestation has resulted in the loss of 91\% of its original cover. Numerous efforts have been made to halt deforestation activities, however farmers' perception towards the forest and its benefits has not been considered either in studies conducted so far or by policy makers. This research provides the first multi-temporal analysis of the dynamics of the forest within the BAAPA region on the one hand, and assesses the way farmers perceive the forest and how this influences forest conservation at the farm level on the other. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat images from 1999 to 2016 were used to measure the extent of the forest cover and deforestation rates over 17 years. Farmers' influence on the dynamics of the forest was evaluated by combining earth observation data and household survey results conducted in the BAAPA region in 2016. Outcomes obtained in this study demonstrate a total loss in forest cover of 7500 km(2). Deforestation rates in protected areas were determined by management regimes. The combination of household level and remote sensing data demonstrated that forest dynamics at the farm level is influenced by farm type, the level of dependency/use of forest benefits and the level of education of forest owners. An understanding of the social value awarded to the forest is a relevant contribution towards preserving natural resources.},

Title = {Ecosystem Service Value Estimation of Paddy Field Ecosystems Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A paddy field ecosystem (PFE) is an important component of an agricultural land ecosystem and is also a special artificial wetland with extremely high value. Taking Tianjin (a municipality city in China) as the research area and using multi-source remote sensing data, we improved the accounting framework of the ecosystem service value (ESV) of PFEs and the calibration of model parameters. The ESV of PFEs was mapped at medium-high resolution and fine-grain at the provincial scale. The results showed that: (1) the net ESV of PFEs in Tianjin in 2019 was RMB 29.68 x 10(8), accounting for 0.21\% of GDP. The positive ESV was RMB 35.53 x 10(8), the negative ESV was RMB 5.84 x 10(8), and the average ESV per unit area was RMB 5.47 x 10(4)/ha; (2) as a proportion of the ESV of PFE, the value of climate regulation (61.27\%) was greater than the value of carbon fixation and oxygen release (15.29\%), which was greater than the value of primary products supply (8.08\%). The production value of PFEs is far lower than their ESV; (3) the total net ESV in Baodi District was RMB 16.85 x 10(8), accounting for 56.77\% of Tianjin's ESV, and the net ESV per unit area was RMB 5.72 x 10(4)/ha, both of which were higher than in other districts; (4) the pixel-based hot spots analysis showed that the number of hot spots (high-value ESV) and cold spots (low-value ESV) reached 98.00\% (hot spots 56.9\%, cold spots 41.1\%) with a significant cluster distribution. The hot spots were mostly distributed in Baodi District (37.8\%) and the cold spots were mostly distributed in Ninghe District (17.2\%). The research results can support agricultural development, improve countermeasures according to local conditions, and provide theoretical support for regional land use planning, ecological compensation policy formulation and ecological sustainable development. Our methodology can be used to assess the impact of land use change on ESV.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates the utility of high temporal and spatial resolution satellite imagery for the detection and study of the effects of intense surface runoff, particularly in respect to mitigation efforts to protect archaeological sites. We make use of PlanetScope imagery, which has recently become available as a freely available remote sensing data source with a revisit time of less than 24 hours, almost global coverage, and spectral and spatial resolution on par with other commercially available sensors. The high temporal resolution of PlanetScope data allows for better detection of changes in land cover that are the result of severe weather events, whose effects may be cleared up within several days of occurring or are more pronounced in the immediate aftermath of disturbances. Focusing on two severe storms that struck the island of Samothrace, in the northern Aegean, on July 17 and September 25/26 2017 respectively and which caused considerable damage to local infrastructure and archaeological sites, we test the utility of these data for detecting the island-wide distribution of the effects of these weather events. We find that these data are sufficiently sensitive to detect and quantify the extent of surface runoff processes and argue that the detection and monitoring capabilities of these data provide a useful tool for outlining policies to mitigate future damages to cultural heritage sites.},

Title = {Segmentation scale parameter influence on the accuracy of detecting illegal landfills on satellite imagery. A case study for Novo Sarajevo},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Illegal waste dumping has been widely regarded as one of the biggest source of environmental damage. Illegal landfills are a prevailing problem existing in a large number of countries. To control and better manage illegal landfills, it is necessary to know the current locations and contents of illegal landfills. This could increase efficiency in illegal landfill management and preserve the biodiversity and ecological balance. Remote sensing methods have been proven extremely effective in detecting potential illegal landfill sites. This paper investigates the relationship between the segmentation scale parameter and the detection accuracy of illegal landfill sites in urban areas that are not covered by vegetation or buried in the ground. The research showed that there is an optimal scale parameter (SP = 20) value for the used satellite image Pleiades 1B and area of interest (Novo Sarajevo municipality). The scale parameter's stated value gives maximum Kappa values and Overall accuracy coefficients for detected illegal landfills on the satellite image.},

Abstract = {Land use transformation plays a key role in spatial planning, it refers to the changes in land use morphology including dominant morphology and recessive morphology of a certain region over a certain period of time driven by socio-economic change and innovation. In this paper, we chose the arable land to do study. As an important subsystem in the natural ecosystem, the arable land not only guarantees food security, but also has ecological service functions. To date, the arable land transformation provides basis for management, make a decision and layout of spatial planning, efficient and rational of land resource use, promoting area sustainable development in rapid urbanization areas. At present, the introduction of land use transition to the academic circle in China becomes a hot topic, researchers focuses on researches related socio-economic development, the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of land use function or land use/ cover change, the driving mechanism based on land use transformation, analyzing the process of land use transformation and the changes of ecosystem service function, and how affects the land resource management, development of urban and rural, and land consolidation. As one of the important part for change of ecosystem service, land use transformation is not only changing the natural landscape, but also to change the function of ecosystem service. Recently, issues related to land use transformation in China have attracted interest among a wide variety of researchers as well as government officials. In this paper, we choose Maoming as the study area. It is a city which is located in the southernmost part of China, the westernmost part of Guangdong Province. I used remote sensing data in different periods of 2010, 2015 and 2018, analyzing the land use structure in different periods using geographic information techniques, and exploring the driving mechanism of land use transformation spatial-temporal patterns, and their effects on ecosystem service change. Driven by the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Maoming has unique geographic advantages and ecological environment, the transformation between the different land use types during a certain period of time arise will be changed by the socio-economic development, and also it affects the ecosystem service value and function. This paper analyzes the effects of land use change for the supply of four service function in ecosystem service: supply function, regulating function, cultural function and supporting function, from the perspective of land use morphology transformation (the dominant/recessive morphology). Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out study of land use transformation and eco-environment service change and explore the influence factors between them for understanding the regional environment and achieving coordinated development of socioeconomic and ecological environments.},

Title = {Determining the economic damage and losses of wildfires using MODIS remote sensing images},
Booktitle = {ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Pages = {1821-1831},
Abstract = {The economic evaluation of damage and losses of the areas affected by forest fires requires comprehensive studies covering a wide range of natural resources. The assessment of fire impacts requires the individualized study of each resource, such as timber resources, fruit production and hunting activity, and the analysis of their net value change based on fire intensity and ecosystem resilience. As a consequence, this concept of net value change extends the study beyond an economic valuation, integrating two concepts, the value of the resource and fire behavior. However, field sampling on large fires becomes complex because of the costs involved in field tasks and the time that will elapse before the assessment is available. The incorporation of satellite imagery to the economic valuation of fire impacts provides a new tool of undoubted interest. This paper details the methodology and the results obtained in the economic assessment of two medium (between 200-500ha) and two large fires (more than 500 ha) in the south of Spain. MODIS data were suitable for mapping medium and large fires (more than 200 ha). The advantage of using MODIS satellite images in relation to other remote sensors lies in the free download (zero cost) and temporal resolution. As other studies have shown, the normalized vegetation index was not presented as the best identifier of the burned area. However, RdNBR index allowed us to obtain reliable relationships between its value and the depreciation ratio for each resource due to the differences among resources based on fire intensity. Economic resources valuation and MODIS images (pre and post-fire) can be integrated into Geographic Information System (GIS), in order to obtain, in a geo-referenced way, the economic value per hectare resulting from fire impact. This tool should provide a procedure to help improving fire management and take more appropriate decisions about budget allocation and rehabilitation of areas affected by fires. Given current economic constraints, the use of a geo-referenced tool with free download and regular update (MODIS) allows us to the inclusion of changes, improvements and temporal or spatial adaptations according to the needs of forest managers. The methodological approach for assessing the economic impact of forest fires provided allows the application of this simple and flexible technique to any territory by previous economic valuation of natural resources presented in the interesting area.},

Abstract = {Presenting to the fracture clinic carries economic, social and societal consequences. The virtual fracture clinic (VFC) has proven to be a safe, patient-focused, cost-effective means of delivering trauma care, whilst reducing unnecessary clinic attendances. Within our institution, a Satellite VFC was established, so as to accommodate an offsite referring emergency department. The VFC database was accessed to identify the first 500 patients who were referred to the Satellite VFC. The decision made for each patient, the rate of returns to the clinic, and the rate of referrals requiring surgical intervention, following discussion at the VFC, ,were identified. A cost analysis and cost comparison was carried out between the Satellite VFC and the traditional ``face to face{''} fracture clinic. There were 500 patients referred to the Satellite VFC within the study period. Of such patients, 288 (58\%) were discharged directly following review at the Satellite VFC, 141 patients (28\%) were referred to physiotherapy, 50 (10\%) were redirected to the trauma clinic, 11 (2\%) were sent directly to hand therapy, and 10 (2\%) were sent to the ED review clinic. Patients who returned to the fracture clinic accounted for 3.8\% of all referrals, and 0.2\% of all referrals necessitated surgical intervention. This pilot initiative saved the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group over (sic)50,000. The Satellite VFC is the first of its kind in the literature. Rural communities worldwide would benefit from remote orthopaedic management of suitable fracture patterns. The true value of the Satellite VFC process comes from its use of robust patient care pathways, rationalising resource use and minimising patient travel, whilst demonstrating reliable outcomes and promoting safety.

Title = {Evaluating landscape capacity to provide spatially explicit valued ecosystem services for sustainable coastal resource management},

Abstract = {Ecosystem Services (ESs) are the direct and indirect benefits and opportunities that human obtained from the ecosystem. This study evaluated landscape capacity of providing multiple key ESs in a tropical coastal ecosystem (Sundarbans Biodiversity Region (SBR)India). Multiple supervised machine learning algorithms were utilized to classify the regions into several landscape zones. The provisioning capacities of ESs for each landscape type were derived separately from an expert opinion survey and the remote sensing based methods, and the association of the outcomes between these two approaches was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient test. A total of nine ESs were selected to quantify their economic values for several reference years. The benefit transfer and equivalent value coefficient approaches were used to aggregate the economic values for each ES. Research results indicated that the water bodies are the most important landscape units in the SBR region. This ecosystem has the highest relevant capacity to provide the necessary regulatory, supporting, provisioning, and cultural ESs. Water regulation (WR), waste treatment (WT), aesthetic, recreation, and cultural (ARC), and climate regulation (CR) are the main ESs of the SBR. These services are immensely important not only for upgrading the livelihood status of coastal communities but also for the climatic and environmental suitability of the Kolkata urban region. The correlation results between the remote sensing and expert-based capacity estimates have suggested that the proposed remote sensing approach could be an alternative to evaluate the landscape capacity of providing multiple ESs in any given ecosystem. Except for the mangrove region, a very high (> 0.7) correlation was observed between the model and expert-derived capacity values. The outcome of this study could be an important reference to the land administrators, planners, decision makers for adopting suitable land resource management plans for sustainable uses of natural resources in coastal region.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing from airborne and spaceborne platforms provides valuable data for mapping, environmental monitoring, disaster management and civil and military intelligence. However, to explore the full value of these data, the appropriate information has to be extracted and presented in standard format to import it into geo-information systems and thus allow efficient decision processes. The object-oriented approach can contribute to powerful automatic and semiautomatic analysis for most remote sensing applications. Synergetic use to pixel-based or statistical signal processing methods explores the rich information contents. Here, we explain principal strategies of object-oriented analysis, discuss how the combination with fuzzy methods allows implementing expert knowledge and describe a representative example for the proposed workflow from remote sensing imagery to GIS. The strategies are demonstrated using the first object-oriented image analysis software on the market, eCognition, which provides an appropriate link between remote sensing imagery and GIS.

Abstract = {As valuation of ecosystem goods and services derived from ecological processes becomes increasingly important in environmental decision-making, the need to quantify how restoration activities influence ecosystem function has grown more urgent, particularly within income-generating or subsistence-providing landscapes where economic needs and biodiversity goals must be balanced. However, quantification of restoration effects is often hindered by logistical issues, which include (1) the difficulty of systematically monitoring responses over large areas and (2) lack or loss of comparison sites necessary for assessing treatment effect. We explored the use of remote sensing to quantify the effects of native grass seeding and prescribed burns on ecosystem forage provisioning services within a California (U.S.A.) rangeland landscape. We used Landsat time series to monitor forage (green biomass) dynamics within 296 ha of treatment areas-distributed throughout a 36-km(2) watershed-for 6 years and to identify post hoc comparison areas when a priori comparisons were lacking. Remote sensing analysis documented gains and losses in forage provisioning services due to restoration efforts and provided critical information for adaptive management. Our results demonstrate the degree to which invaded grasslands can be resistant to change and suggest that increasing the functional complexity of restoration mixes might help increase forage availability and reduce opportunities for weed reinvasion.},

Title = {Observations and tracing of air quality during the Beijing Winter Olympic Games using Chinese satellite hyperspectral measurements},

Abstract = {In September 2021, China's Gaofen-5B satellite carrying the environmental trace gas monitoring instrument (EMI) was successfully launched, which promoted the self-directed development of remote sensing monitoring in China. During the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Winter Olympics, we used the satellite product to provide remote sensing data support for air quality assurance at the Winter Olympics. This paper introduced the domestic hyperspectral satellite product of tropospheric NO2 retrievals, analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of NO2 pollution in Beijing and its surrounding key cities during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games from January to March, and further discussed the influence of meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emission control measures on the atmospheric NO2 concentration during the Winter Olympic Games. The results showed that the average tropospheric NO2 column concentration in North China during the Winter Olympics was approximately 3.75x10(15) molecules/cm(2), which was significantly lower than that before and after the Winter Olympics. NO2 concentrations in major cities decreased between 53.14\% and 70.07\%, indicating that the temporary control policy during the Winter Olympics had a significant effect. However, the implementation of the policy varies in different cities, which is consistent with the in situ measurements of NO2 concentration by the national air quality sites. High concentrations of tropospheric NO2 occurred on two days during the event, mainly due to unfavourable wind fields. Moreover, a generalized additive model was established to distinguish and quantify the contribution of meteorological and anthropogenic factors to the change in tropospheric NO2 concentrations. For example, the decreases in NO2 concentrations in Baoding, Beijing, Tianjin and Taiyuan during the event were 48.2\%, 67.5\%, 48.8\% and 72.8\%, respectively, and emission controls and meteorology contributed 41.8\%, 32.0\%, 30.0\%, 42.8\% and 6.4\%, 35.6\%, 18.8\%, 30.1\%, respectively. In general, the influence of meteorological factors on the sharp decrease in NO2 concentration was significantly weaker than the temporary measures of NOX emission control. Satellite air quality monitoring revealed the spatial and temporal variations in air pollutants during the event. Further analysis based on the GAM model can evaluate the effectiveness of air quality control measures and benefit environmental policy-makers.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing and associated spatial technologies provide tremendous opportunity to enhance weed management and improve-protect the environment through judicious use of the most efficacious control methods for a given site. They can also be invaluable assets for detection of invasions, assessment of infestation levels, monitoring rate of spread, and determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts for weed management. In combination with other technologies such as global positioning systems and geographic information systems, sampling strategies can be devised to efficiently determine the location of weed populations in agricultural and wildland situations. Maps created from remote sensing or sampling (or both) allow site-specific weed management of only the areas requiring corrective action. Potential benefits to the land managers and the ecosystem as a whole will come from reductions in inputs, reduced environmental liability from the detrimental effects of applying control measures to entire areas, crop yield increases through better management decisions, and early detection and effective management of invading species. Improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, temporal frequency, image turnaround time, and cost of image acquisition, combined with the realization of the value of the data, are enhancing the acceptance and usage of remote sensing technologies. However, remote sensing will be best used by providing accurate, site-specific data that can be converted into information used by decision support systems (DSSs). Advances in these DSSs, and their ability to incorporate remote sensing data, have been rapid and widespread in the past 10 yr. As a result, federal management and research agencies, academic institutions, and private entities have collectively developed efforts to use this information in monitoring and management efforts for invasive species in western rangelands, aquatic ecosystems and forestry, and site-specific weed management in agronomics.},

Abstract = {Dr. Vikram Sarabhai was a great visionary, and we are celebrating his Centenary birth anniversary, this year. It was amazing to see, 50 years back, he had planned meticulously various possible remote sensing applications that materialised in the fields of weather and oceans, coastal zone management, geoscience, hydrology, forestry, land use and agriculture and contributed significantly towards national development. Not only that, he had thought about the kinds of sensors, processing and communicating technologies that would be required. He had stressed need for the domain expertise in different disciplines and collaboration with various stakeholders for developing various remote sensing-based products and services and their utilisation. The concept of the National Natural Resources Management System had born out this vision. Such approach has really paid rich dividends. Today, because of such approach, India is in forefront of operational utilisation of remote sensing data and provides weather services for farmers, potential fishery zone advisories to fishermen, accurate and reliable forecast on cyclones and droughts, groundwater targeting for drinking water, condition and status of forest and glaciers, annual forecast of production of major food grains, to name a few. The time is now appropriate to transform this world-class technology into a national system of remote sensing in collaboration with industries to provide operational services to not only users in India, but also all developing countries. Such approach will pave way in translating technology development into innovation for the benefit of all stakeholders. These benefits will help in improving particularly social and economic conditions of developing societies, and is the best way to pay tribute to him. In this article, the vision of Dr. Sarabhai vis-a-vis the status of utilisation of remote sensing in the country has been discussed.},

Abstract = {Accurate and rapid evaluation of the regional eco-environment is critical to policy formulation. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model of the Guangxi Beibu Gulf Economic Zone (GBGEZ) during 2001-2020 was established and evaluated using four indices: dryness, wetness, greenness, and heat. This paper proposes an information granulation method for remote sensing based on the RSEI index value that uses granular computing. We found that: (1) From 2001 to 2020, the eco-environmental quality (EEQ) of GBGEZ tended to improve, and the spatial difference tended to expand. The regional spatial distribution of the eco-environment is primarily in the second-level and third-level areas, and the EEQ in the east and west is better than that in the middle. The contribution of greenness, wetness, and dryness to the improvement of EEQ in the study region increased year by year. (2) From 2001 to 2020, the order of the contribution of the EEQ index in the GBGEZ was dryness, wetness, greenness, and heat. (3) The social and economic activities in the study region had a certain inhibitory effect on the improvement of the EEQ.},

Title = {Remote Sensing of Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America is an extremely important habitat for a diverse range of wetland ecosystems that provide a wealth of socio-economic value. This paper describes the ecological characteristics and importance of PPR wetlands and the use of remote sensing for mapping and monitoring applications. While there are comprehensive reviews for wetland remote sensing in recent publications, there is no comprehensive review about the use of remote sensing in the PPR. First, the PPR is described, including the wetland classification systems that have been used, the water regimes that control the surface water and water levels, and the soil and vegetation characteristics of the region. The tools and techniques that have been used in the PPR for analyses of geospatial data for wetland applications are described. Field observations for ground truth data are critical for good validation and accuracy assessment of the many products that are produced. Wetland classification approaches are reviewed, including Decision Trees, Machine Learning, and object versus pixel-based approaches. A comprehensive description of the remote sensing systems and data that have been employed by various studies in the PPR is provided. A wide range of data can be used for various applications, including passive optical data like aerial photographs or satellite-based, Earth-observation data. Both airborne and spaceborne lidar studies are described. A detailed description of Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data and research are provided. The state of the art is the use of multi-source data to achieve higher accuracies and hybrid approaches. Digital Surface Models are also being incorporated in geospatial analyses to separate forest and shrub and emergent systems based on vegetation height. Remote sensing provides a cost-effective mechanism for mapping and monitoring PPR wetlands, especially with the logistical difficulties and cost of field-based methods. The wetland characteristics of the PPR dictate the need for high resolution in both time and space, which is increasingly possible with the numerous and increasing remote sensing systems available and the trend to open-source data and tools. The fusion of multi-source remote sensing data via state-of-the-art machine learning is recommended for wetland applications in the PPR. The use of such data promotes flexibility for sensor addition, subtraction, or substitution as a function of application needs and potential cost restrictions. This is important in the PPR because of the challenges related to the highly dynamic nature of this unique region.},

Title = {An analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in Chinese terrestrial ecosystem service functions},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {57},
Number = {17},
Pages = {2120-2131},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Since Westman (1977) and Ehrlich (1982) put forward the concepts of ``the service of nature{''} and ``ecosystem service functions{''}, respectively, methods for conducting value accounting for them, and their practical application have become the subjects of intense study. Based on an overview of available research findings, we discuss three scientific hypotheses. First, the terrestrial ecosystem offers both positive and negative service functions. Second, changes in terrestrial ecosystem service functions lie not only in the number of ecosystem types and the coverage area of each type, but also in their quality. Third, the value of terrestrial ecosystem service functions should be assessed both in terms of the value stocked and the value added. We collected land use data from China during the period 1999-2008, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data based on remote sensing images from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies for the same period. We then calculated and analyzed spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service values over the 10-year period. Considering temporal change, the total value (stocked) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions decreased from 6.82 trillion Yuan RMB in 1999 to 6.57 trillion Yuan RMB in 2008. During that period, the positive value decreased by 240.17 billion Yuan RMB and the negative value increased by 8.85 billion Yuan RMB. The decrease in total value lies mainly in the humidity control, soil formation, and waste recycling functions. The total value (added) of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions increased by 4.31 billion Yuan RMB in 2000, but decreased by 0.13 billion Yuan RMB in 2008 (based on the constant price of China in 1999). The value (added) was a negative figure. From the perspective of spatial change, we can see that the supply of China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions fell slightly over the past 10 years, mainly in Northeast and Southern China. As a result of human activities on ecosystems, the loss of ecosystem service functions' value was relatively prominent in Shanxi and Gansu provinces, compared with an increase in value in Shaanxi Province. Terrestrial ecosystem service functions' value per unit area was relatively high in mid- and East China, showing a prominent spatial change over the 10-year period, but low in Western China. Some conclusions are drawn after an in-depth analysis of the factors causing the spatial and temporal changes in China's terrestrial ecosystem service functions, in the hope that our suggestions will be helpful for the management of China's terrestrial ecosystems.},

Title = {Spatial distribution of natural hazards and their proximity to heritage sites: Case of the United Arab Emirates},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) investigated World Heritage sites and listed some in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Heritage sites in any country have important cultural and economic value. However, many of the sites are subjected to potential impact by natural hazards, considering their age and the effects of climate. In the interest of reducing these impacts, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and the World Heritage Committee called for a detailed hazard assessment. This research falls within this assessment scope by applying remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to assess the spatial distribution of natural hazards and their proximity to heritage sites in the UAE. Results show that heritage sites in the northeastern UAE are more vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, and sea-level rise. Still, risk varies depending on elevation and the proximity to fault lines and the coastline. In the western UAE, the majority of heritage sites are prone to the effects of desertification and sand encroachment. This study is large-scale in nature, and specific vulnerability assessments for each heritage site are beyond the scope of this paper. The database, methodology, and output from this research could be useful for many organizations, such as those working in the fields of culture and heritage, tourism, disaster management, and urban planning. Compilation of a GIS database centering upon the heritage sites in the UAE is considered a major step forward for future studies related to the sites. The GIS database is available for interested users upon request.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {107-116},

Abstract = {Land use and the associated ecosystem service functions vary with changes in agroecological conditions. This study analyzed the distribution of ecosystem service values along the agroecological gradient in Borena landscape. Land-cover information was extracted from Landsat satellite images; and ecosystem service values were estimated using established global and local databases. Land-cover types were constrained in one or two agroecological zones with varying proportions. Cultivated land covering 53.7\% of the total landscape area, plantation forest (32.3\%) and grassland (9.4\%) land-cover types exist in all agroecological zones, with the highest proportion in the humid highland. The highest long-term average ecosystem service value was observed along the humid highland accounting for about 21.8-33.11 million \$US. The sub-humid highland consisted 5.67-8.88 million \$US. Ecosystem service value showed a decreasing trend between 1973 and 2001 along all agroecological zones and increased in 2016. Moreover, the highest depletion was found along the humid highland (7.27-18.93 million \$US) and least depletion was observed along the cold highland (1.79-4.40). Occurrence of the highest depletion along the most inhabited zone, i.e., humid highland, revealed that many of the impacts are human induced. Agroecological gradient substantially determines the amount and distribution of ecosystem service values. Sustainable land management efforts and proper land-use planning are required with special attention to susceptible zones to conserve and increase ecosystem service values.},

Abstract = {Change detection using satellite imagery has been increasing the need for effective land management, land environmental changes. Utilizing remote sensing data analysis is high application possibility about management in the field of environmental changes, because relatively wide area in a short-term is to get the visual information. The principal objective of this study was to provide that statistic approaches to determine dynamic thresholds for detection of significant change using image differencing of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Dynamic threshold look-up-table obtained from statistics (per-pixel standard deviations over 10 years) of 10-year wide-swath satellite data (SPOT/VEGETATION) was used to apply Landsat-based change detection. Two areas is utilized in research using Landsat 7 ETM+ images that have resolution 30x30 m. When achieve changed detection taking advantage of image differencing technique which is one of the changed detection technique, it choose more dynamic critical value taking advantage of middle and low resolution satellite data. As a result, it is effective that takes advantage of NDVI value more than reflection value and method to decide change standard is effective that take advantage of statistics.},

Title = {Fine-scale analysis of urban flooding reduction from green infrastructure: An ecosystem services approach for the management of water flows},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {386},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to modify the timing and amount of precipitation in the future, increasing the demand for effective adaptation at the local scale, especially to mitigate the impacts of extreme events, expected to increase in frequency and magnitude. Green infrastructure (GI) can provide a crucial water regulating ecosystem service, helping communities to adapt to the increased stormwater runoff and associated flood risks expected from climate change. This paper presents a new planning tool that utilizes remote sensing and census data to model the supply and demand for urban flood reduction services through GI. A high-resolution urban digital model is used to distinguish between permeable and impermeable areas at fine (e.g. 25 cm) spatial scale. Flood reduction capacity was modeled using two indices: i) the amount of runoff reduced by existing GI, and ii) the runoff reduction coefficient. We also analyzed the flood reduction demand using a vulnerability index. The tool is demonstrated in a historical urban center of the Northern Italy, with different scenarios used to identify priority areas of intervention. The results show that the flood reduction capacity is unevenly distributed throughout the study area. Public and private surfaces contribute different amounts of runoff with different flood reduction potentials. In eight of nine urban study areas, private properties generate more runoff than public properties under the worst scenario conditions. The study identified two priority areas of intervention, based on their mismatch between supply and demand of GI's water regulating services.},

Title = {Satellite Altimetry for Ocean and Coastal Applications: A Review},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {More than 30 years of observations from an international suite of satellite altimeter missions continue to provide key data enabling research discoveries and a broad spectrum of operational and user-driven applications. These missions were designed to advance technologies and to answer scientific questions about ocean circulation, ocean heat content, and the impact of climate change on these Earth systems. They are also a valuable resource for the operational needs of oceanographic and weather forecasting agencies that provide information to shipping and fishing vessels and offshore operations for route optimization and safety, as well as for other decision makers in coastal, water resources, and disaster management fields. This time series of precise measurements of ocean surface topography (OST)-the ``hills and valleys{''} of the ocean surface-reveals changes in ocean dynamic topography, tracks sea level variations at global to regional scales, and provides key information about ocean trends reflecting climate change in our warming world. Advancing technologies in new satellite systems allows measurements at higher spatial resolution ever closer to coastlines, where the impacts of storms, waves, and sea level rise on coastal communities and infrastructure are manifest. We review some collaborative efforts of international space agencies, including NASA, CNES, NOAA, ESA, and EUMETSAT, which have contributed to a collection of use cases of satellite altimetry in operational and decision-support contexts. The extended time series of ocean surface topography measurements obtained from these satellite altimeter missions, along with advances in satellite technology that have allowed for higher resolution measurements nearer to coasts, has enabled a range of such applications. The resulting body of knowledge and data enables better assessments of storms, waves, and sea level rise impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure amongst other key contributions for societal benefit. Although not exhaustive, this review provides a broad overview with specific examples of the important role of satellite altimetry in ocean and coastal applications, thus justifying the significant resource contributions made by international space agencies in the development of these missions.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how GEOSS and CEOS are individually and collaboratively strengthening the world's ability to manage the disasters lifecycle. The Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) of GEOSS has, through an agile development process, deployed and tested advanced information systems for Earth Observations based on interoperability arrangements. In particular AIP has focused on several Disaster Management Scenarios resulting in an architecture that has improved the ready viability and usability of data for disasters. CEOS is constructing a reference architecture, intended to streamline access to satellite data and services for disaster management. The CEOS approach aims to support disaster management activities with satellite information in a holistic fashion, taking account of their overlaps and interdependencies. Jointly GEOSS and CEOS are now working to align the approaches for Disaster Management to describe enterprise components and improve understanding of contributed systems and their roles. The coordination will lead to refinements of the Disaster Management Scenario via further implementation in AIP-5. By collaborating via the CEOS working groups and GEOSS communities of practice, these efforts are intended to engage the international community focused on disaster management to fully utilize remote sensing resources for societal benefit.},

Title = {Toward an integrated approach to crop production and pollination ecology through the application of remote sensing},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Insect pollinators provide an essential ecosystem service by transferring pollen to crops and native vegetation. The extent to which pollinator communities vary both spatially and temporally has important implications for ecology, conservation and agricultural production. However, understanding the complex interactions that determine pollination service provisioning and production measures over space and time has remained a major challenge. Remote sensing technologies (RST), including satellite, airborne and ground based sensors, are effective tools for measuring the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation health, diversity and productivity within natural and modified systems. Yet while there are synergies between remote sensing science, pollination ecology and agricultural production, research communities have only recently begun to actively connect these research areas. Here, we review the utility of RST in advancing crop pollination research and highlight knowledge gaps and future research priorities. We found that RST are currently used across many different research fields to assess changes in plant health and production (agricultural production) and to monitor and evaluate changes in biodiversity across multiple landscape types (ecology and conservation). In crop pollination research, the use of RST are limited and largely restricted to quantifying remnant habitat use by pollinators by ascertaining the proportion of, and/or isolation from, a given land use type or local variable. Synchronization between research fields is essential to better understand the spatial and temporal variability in pollinator dependent crop production. RST enable these applications to be scaled across much larger areas than is possible with field-based methods and will facilitate large scale ecological changes to be detected and monitored. We advocate greater use of RST to better understand interactions between pollination, plant health and yield spatial variation in pollinator dependent crops. This more holistic approach is necessary for decision-makers to improve strategies toward managing multiple land use types and ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Lakes as ecosystems provide many goods and services. To benefit from them in long term we must assure sustainable management. SIMILE (informative System for the Integrated Monitoring of Insubric Lakes and their Ecosystems) project is focused on developing efficient monitoring of lake water quality since it gives the critical input for adequate management. The lakes of interest for SIMILE are the Insubric lakes Como, Lugano, and Maggiore. The paper is focused on describing which tools are used in the SIMILE project to exploit different sources of lake water quality data: in-situ high-frequency monitoring (HFM) through sensors, satellite observations, and data collected by citizens. Even though the paper is focused on the SIMILE project, and thus on tools and procedures for the Insubric lakes, it can serve as an example for other lakes too, especially because the tools developed in the project, such as a collaborative platform for sharing satellite-derived water quality parameters, and mobile application and web administrator interface for citizen science, are free and open-source, they can be easily adapted if needed. Moreover, the procedures for the processing of data coming from different sources are based on free (and often also open source) software and are well documented. The tools and procedures described in this paper might be a foundation for similar practice for lakes worldwide, and thus a step forward the 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the United Nations ({''}Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all{''}).},

Abstract = {Significant recent advances in satellite remote sensing allow environmental managers to detect and monitor cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB), and these capabilities are being used more frequently in water quality management. A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately \$370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly (\$55,000-\$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.},

Title = {Approach for estimation of ecosystem services value using multitemporal remote sensing images},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services are the conditions in which human existence can be maintained and satisfied by natural ecosystems and their constituent species. Meanwhile, island cities have limited natural resources and fragile environments. So, more attention should be paid to the evaluation of their ecosystem service value (ESV). We propose an approach for estimation of ecosystem services value using land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) information obtained by multitemporal remote sensing images based on the method of equivalent value factor. The results in Zhoushan Island, China, from 1984 to 2020 showed that (1) land use and land cover significantly changed, with all LUCC decreasing in general except for the categories of construction land and water bodies. The total area increased by 67.96 km(2), and an average annual increase rate of 0.37\%, which was related to the land reclamation measures taken by people in the Zhoushan Islands. (2) Changes in ESV were significant during the last 37 years. The total annual ESV in the study area decreased from 937.98 million Yuan in 1984 to 899.13 million Yuan in 2020, with a decrease of 4.14\%. It is mostly attributable to the 5.51\% decrease of forest land, 128.69\% growth of water bodies, 28.64\% decrease of mudflats, 3.37\% decrease of cropland/grassland, and 68.38\% decrease of bare land. (3) The sensitivity index of land-use types is <1, which means that the ESV is inelastic to adjusted coefficient of ESV and the research results are reliable. We can provide theoretical methods and a basis for decision-making in support of realizing regional ecological security and the sustainable use of land resources.

Abstract = {Ecosystemservice value (ESV) included some contributions of ecological environments to human health and living, and provide cultural and economic benefits for sustaining and fulfilling living organisms. The author selected the Ebinur lake Wetland Nature Reserve as our study site to analyze the spatial distribution and dynamics of ecosystem services, and we used 1972, 1998, 2006, 2014 and 2016 images to study land use/cover change (LUCC) over these periods. LUCC is one of the key drivers that affect ecosystem services. Firstly, in 1972-2030, land use/cover (LULC) significantly changed, with all LUCC practices increasing except for the categories of water area, bare land area and barren land/other. Secondly, changes in ESV were significant during the last 60 years. The total annual ESV in the study area decreased by 50.89\% between 1972 and 2030, mostly attributable to the 6.82\% growth of saline land, 0.09\% growth of desert, 1\% decrease of wetlands and 0.95\% decrease of water bodies. Thirdly, the spatial-temporal variation of ESV was prominent. Spatial correlation was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was relatively high in the study area, which was mainly distributed in the water body and wetland regions, and these high-value regions exhibited a decreasing trend. Low values occurred around the lake areas, which increased over time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {How willing are landowners to supply land for bioenergy crops in the Northern Great Lakes Region?},

Abstract = {Land to produce biomass is essential if the United States is to expand bioenergy supply. Use of agriculturally marginal land avoids the food vs. fuel problems of food price rises and carbon debt that are associated with crop and forestland. Recent remote sensing studies have identified large areas of US marginal land deemed suitable for bioenergy crops. Yet the sustainability benefits of growing bioenergy crops on marginal land only pertain if land is economically available. Scant attention has been paid to the willingness of landowners to supply land for bioenergy crops. Focusing on the northern tier of the Great Lakes, where grassland transitions to forest and land prices are low, this contingent valuation study reports on the willingness of a representative sample of 1124 private, noncorporate landowners to rent land for three bioenergy crops: corn, switchgrass, and poplar. Of the 11\% of land that was agriculturally marginal, they were willing to make available no more than 21\% for any bioenergy crop (switchgrass preferred on marginal land) at double the prevailing land rental rate in the region. At the same generous rental rate, of the 28\% that is cropland, they would rent up to 23\% for bioenergy crops (corn preferred), while of the 55\% that is forestland, they would rent up to 15\% for bioenergy crops (poplar preferred). Regression results identified deterrents to land rental for bioenergy purposes included appreciation of environmental amenities and concern about rental disamenities. In sum, like landowners in the southern Great Lakes region, landowners in the Northern Tier are reluctant to supply marginal land for bioenergy crops. If rental markets existed, they would rent more crop and forestland for bioenergy crops than they would marginal land, which would generate carbon debt and opportunity costs in wood product and food markets.},

Title = {Estimation of Ecosystem Services Value at a Basin Scale Based on Modified Equivalent Coefficient: A Case Study of the Yellow River Basin (Henan Section), China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The value of ecosystem services is an extremely important parameter that reflects regional ecological benefits and resources. Estimating the value of ecosystem services is essential for regional land-use optimization, ecological construction, and biodiversity protection. In this study, Landsat-TM/ETM remote sensing images were used to analyze land-use data in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 of the Yellow River Basin (Henan section), China, defined by natural boundaries. An equivalent factor method was used to construct a model to calculate the ecosystem services value that introduced grain yield, regional difference coefficient, and social development stage coefficient. Thus, land-use changes and evolution of ecosystem services values in the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) in the past 30 years were analyzed. Land use in the basin changed significantly from 1990 to 2020. Except for an increase in area of construction land, areas of other land-use types decreased. Cultivated land area first increased and then decreased, whereas the water area first decreased and then increased. The total value of ecosystem services in the study area fluctuated but increased overall by 43.82 x 10(8) USD in the past 30 years. Spatially, the total value of ecosystem services was high in the southwest and low in the northeast. Among individual ecosystem service values, water conservation, gas regulation, and climate regulation accounted for a relatively high proportion of the total value. Regulation services were the main ecosystem service functions, followed by support and supply services, with cultural services accounting for the lowest proportion. Sensitivity coefficients of different land types in different periods were all less than one. Therefore, the value coefficients were reasonable, and the results were consistent with the actual situation of the study area. The study improves the method to estimate the ecosystem services value of the basin and also indicates ways to support ecological protection of the Yellow River Basin (Henan section), China.},

Title = {Determination of Spatially-Distributed Hydrological Ecosystem Services (HESS) in the Red River Delta Using a Calibrated SWAT Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The principles of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), conservation of natural capital, and water accounting requires Hydrological Eco-System Services (HESS) to be determined. This paper presents a modeling approach for quantifying the HESS framework using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT was used-after calibration against remote sensing data-to quantify and spatially identify total runoff, natural livestock feed production, fuelwood from natural forests, dry season flow, groundwater recharge, root zone storage for carrying over water from wet to dry season, sustaining rainfall, peak flow attenuation, carbon sequestration, microclimate cooling, and meeting environmental flow requirements. The environmental value of the current land use and vegetation was made explicit by carrying out parallel simulations for bare soil and vegetation conditions and reporting the incremental ecosystem services. Geographical areas with more and fewer HESS are identified. The spatial and temporal variability of annual HESS services is demonstrated for the Day Basin-which is part of the Red River delta (Vietnam)-for the period 2003 to 2013. The result shows that even though the basin is abundant with HESS, e.g., 7482 m(3)/ha of runoff, 3820 m(3)/ha of groundwater recharge, the trend for many HESS values, e.g., micro-climate cooling, meeting environmental flow requirements, and rootzone storage, are declining. It is found and proven that quantified HESS indicators highlighted the provisioning and regulating characters of ecosystem services, as well as geographical hotspots across the basin. The SWAT model shows the capability of simulating terrestrial eco-hydrological processes such as climate, soil, and current land use. The methodology illustrates how eco-hydrologists can benchmark ecosystem values and include HESS in exploring river basin management scenarios, climate change studies, and land use planning.},

The aim of this paper is to assess the conflicts and trade-off among environmental, economic and social interests by using three continuous multi-criteria approaches and a set of different weights. Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423 km(2)) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5th and 6th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak run-off, annual erosion. sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming. compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2:1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation-consensus process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mapping cities is difficult due to the dense and varied development of infrastructures in urban contexts. To adapt cities for modern faculties, regular monitoring of developing infrastructures is essential. The built-up land use map derived from remote sensing images shows how cities expand horizontally across the landscape as they grow over decades. Recent studies have shown that when planning for a more sustainable future in metropolitan settings, adding vertical components in the computation of built-up is beneficial for better understanding. As illustrated in this paper, the built-up area of an urban region is extracted from high-resolution LISS IV satellite sensor image data using deep learning techniques. The height of an urban built-up is estimated from Cartosat-1 stereo images using photogrammetric methods and automatic terrain extraction. This study combines the use of a deep learning model with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data to extract the urban built up volume. The results demonstrate that the western and northwestern areas of the study region see greater changes in urban volume compared to the central business district and other parts of the city. This work demonstrates a step-by-step strategy for studying urban growth patterns. It helps in understanding urban growth, population mobility patterns, societal typology, environmental indicators. The outcome of such study could be useful in the evaluation of various indicators of growth such as economic growth, traffic density conditions, utility planning, policy framework such as master plan preparation, and so on for governmental authorities.},

Abstract = {Crop area information can provide decision support for agricultural production management, and it is an important basis for formulating grain policy and economic plan. Remote sensing has an irreplaceable role in large-scale agricultural monitoring, in which optical remote sensing is greatly influenced by cloud and rain weather. It is often unable to obtain clear and clear optical remote sensing images in the critical period of crop growth, which seriously images the accuracy and timeliness of the classification of crop remote sensing. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capable of monitoring ground objects throughout the day and all weather, Polarimetric SAR data also include scattering matrix, geometric details and permittivity information, it is sensitive to the geometry and height of vegetation, which can make up for the lack of optical remote sensing and has unique advantages in crop identification and monitoring. So full polarization SAR has wide application demand and great potential in crop remote sensing monitoring. The effective use of full polarimetric SAR data to classify crops is of great academic and practical value for promoting the greater role of radar technology in national agricultural remote sensing monitoring and agricultural supply side structural reform. This paper summarizes the different data types and polarization decomposition methods of polarization SAR used in crop identification. According to the current research, there are the following deficiencies: first, most of the research subjects are rice, and dry land crops are less studied. Secondly, the identification of dry land crops is not accurate enough, and the average recognition accuracy is less than 85\%. Finally, there are few researches on the scattering mechanism, which leads to poor rationality and poor universality. First, determine the scattering mechanism of dry land crops, and use scattering mechanism to improve the accuracy and universality of remote sensing recognition of dryland crops. Second, how to make use of the special imaging method of SAR to optimize the design is applicable to polarimetric SAR classification algorithm. Third, how to better integrate with optical remote sensing and other multi -source data, these three points will become the key problem to be solved in polarimetric SAR crop classification in the future.},

Abstract = {As the carrier of economic activities, land resource is an indispensable production factor of economic development. Economic growth leads to increased demand for land and changes in land utilization form. Therefore, changes in land use and land cover can reflect regional economic development situations to some extent. This paper proposed a method to predict regional economic situations based on remote sensing images, in which land use and land cover data is extracted by remote sensing images classification. Taking Zhoushan City as study area, the land use and land cover information from 2000 to 2015 was obtained through Landsat satellite images and then was used to construct regional economic development prediction models for 7 economic indexes. The results showed that the prediction errors of gross domestic product, products of primary industry, products of secondary industry, products of tertiary industry, fixed assets investment, gross output value of fisheries, and total tourist income are 7.8\%, 9.11\%, 6.93\%, 7.74\%, 15.31\%, 7.29\%, 11.76\%, respectively.},

Abstract = {New industrial dynamics are disrupting the space sector. New stakeholders bringing in capital, technologies, and knowledge from other industries are developing next-generation space infrastructures and services. Both commercial and institutional space projects have to be valuable for a wider set of end-users, asking not only for economic returns but also social and environmental benefits. Space organizations urge understanding and fostering value in the New Space Economy ecosystem. Indeed, end-users are still struggling to enact the expected value of satellite data and solutions for their business. This paper aims to investigate the expected value and the level of adoption (enacted value) of satellite data and satellite-based solutions in the New Space Economy ecosystem from end-users' perspective. We interviewed 21 managers from end-user organizations in different sectors (i.e., Insurance \& Finance, Energy \& Utility, Transportation \& Logistics). Value is deeply discussed in general management literature, and we identify Value Theory as the theoretical lens with the most explanatory power for the phenomenon under examination. From the end-users' perspective, we frame the expected value and the enacted value in taking strategic and tactical decisions regarding their activities, services and products, laying the foundations for further studies of value mechanisms in the New Space ecosystem. Our research set a theoretical and conceptual foundation on value in the New Space ecosystem. It also delineates the blurred boundaries of the New Space ecosystem, the main stakeholders involved, and their perception of value. Insights and implications for strategic and innovation management are also provided. Practitioners may exploit our research results and leverage the end-users-oriented framework to develop next-generation space projects in the New Space ecosystem. We also discuss the limitations and further developments of this research.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) are the benefits that humans receive from nature. The payments for ES provide financial incentives to urban managers to conserve natural ecosystems. The spatial pattern and intensity of ES values have become leading principles of urban planning. Although most ES evaluations of urban regions are at the city scale, urban land planning is typically made at the landscape level. The applications of remote sensing data provide a great opportunity for quantifying the ES in a finer analytical unit. In this study, we investigated the spatial patterns of ES in Beijing by calculating the economic value of each ES based on the landscape type. We compared the ES intensities observed in different administrative districts and land use types, and we obtained the following results: (1) The ES values in Beijing are distributed in a spatial pattern with low value at the center and high values in the surrounding area, with the highest value in Miyun District and the lowest value in Dongcheng District. The difference in ES intensity between above two districts is 4.087 x 10(4) yuan per hectare. (2) The ES type with higher value in Beijing are hydrology regulation and climate regulation services. (3) The land use type of forest is the main source of ES values, accounting for 67.2\% of the total value. This study provides a spatial clarification of ES value in Beijing, which could supply a scientific reference to support urban optimization and resource allocation.},

Title = {New valuation for defying degradation: Visualizing mangrove forest dynamics and local stewardship with remote sensing in coastal Ecuador},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {123-132},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coastal mangrove forests have been undervalued and converted to other uses throughout the developing world for almost half a century. The causes and consequences of mangrove deforestation have been well-documented; however fewer studies have examined the political factors contributing to conservation and the social dimensions of habitat restoration. We combine remote sensing analysis with ethnographic research to quantify patterns of mangrove cover change between 1985 and 2014, and to qualitatively explore local observations and testimonies of conflict over resources in the Jambelf Archipelago, Ecuador. Our results reveal that shrimp aquaculture was a pervasive force shaping spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove cover change from 1985 to 1999. Thereafter, trends of deforestation decelerated to reveal signs of recovery in some locations due to new policies, institutional transformations at multiple levels, and local commitment to community mangrove reforestation. Our research suggests that sustained local commitment to stewardship emerged from local discontent with historically ineffective policies that permitted a struggle between artisanal fishers and shrimp farmers over resources and territory. This context shaped the evolution of policy and provided a ripe environment for successful community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in 2000 when the Ecuadorian government began granting collective stewardship rights to artisanal fishers and other ``ancestral user groups{''} for mangrove conservation. We conclude that the state's empowerment of artisanal fishers with resource rights served as a critical turning point toward more socially just policies with transformative impacts on previously degraded mangrove landscapes.},

Abstract = {Vessel traffic is one of the most wide-spread anthropogenic contributors to ocean noise worldwide and has the potential to alter ecosystems upon which cetaceans and other acoustically sensitive marine organisms rely. Canada's SGaan Kinghlas-Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area (SK-B MPA) is one such area whose productive ecosystem could benefit from greater monitoring of human induced threats in order to inform management. Despite earning official designation as a Marine Protected Area under the Oceans Act in 2008, little remains known about vessel traffic in the region and the associated potential impacts on vulnerable marine species. Therefore, to increase our understanding of vessel traffic and accompanying noise at SK-B MPA, satellite AIS and acoustic data were investigated. The results of this study suggest that variations in ambient sound levels in the region are driven by near and distant shipping events, thus having implications for future management of the MPA.},

Abstract = {Urbanization, and the resulting land use/cover change, is a primary cause of the degradation of coastal wetland ecosystems. Reclamation projects are seen as a way to strike a balance between socioeconomic development and maintenance of coastal ecosystems. Our aim was to understand the ecological changes to Jiangsu's coastal wetland resulting from land use change since 1977 by using remote sensing and spatial analyses. The results indicate that: (1) The area of artificial land use expanded while natural land use was reduced, which emphasized an increase in production-orientated land uses at the expense of ecologically important wetlands; (2) It took 34 years for landscape ecological security and 39 years for ecosystem services to regain equilibrium. The coastal reclamation area would recover ecological equilibrium only after a minimum of 30 years; (3) The total ecosystem service value decreased significantly from \$2.98 billion per year to \$2.31 billion per year from 1977 to 2014. Food production was the only one ecosystem service function that consistently increased, mainly because of government policy; (4) The relationship between landscape ecological security and ecosystem services is complicated, mainly because of the scale effect of landscape ecology. Spatial analysis of changing gravity centers showed that landscape ecological security and ecosystem service quality became better in the north than the south over the study period.},

Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly recognized that computer methods such as models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be valuable tools for analyzing a geographical area in terms of it's hazards vulnerability, Vulnerability is an important aspect of households' experience of poverty. The measurement and analysis of poverty, inequality and vulnerability are crucial for cognitive purposes (to know what the situation is), for analytical purposes (to understand the factors determining this situation), for policy making purposes (to design interventions best adapted to the issues), and for monitoring and evaluation purposes (to assess whether current policies are effective, and whether the situation is changing). Here vulnerability defined as the probability or risk today of being in poverty - or falling deeper into poverty - in the future. Vulnerability is a key dimension of well being since it affects individuals' behavior (in terms of investment, production patterns, coping strategies) and their perception of their own situation. This study has been conducted with the joint collaboration of World Food Programme (WFP) and International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Sri Lanka for identifying regions and population which are food insecure, for analyzing the reasons for vulnerability to food insecurity in order to provide decision-makers with information to identify possible sectors of intervention and for identifying where and for whom food aid can be best utilized in Sri Lanka. This new approach integrates GIS and Remote sensing with other statistical packages to allow consideration of more spatial/physical parameters like accessibility to economic resources, particularly land and the assets of the built environment, creating employment, and attracting investment in order to improve the quality and quantity of goods and services for the analysis which leads the analysis to represent the real scenario. For this study a detailed topographic data are being used along with MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and ASTER level 2 decor relation stretch data for vegetation cover images. Other social indicators of poverty, access to resources, communal services, social services, social tensions, Multi-ethnic collaboration, capacity for self governance, Government effectiveness and demographic data of Sri Lanka are also been used for this study. This paper illustrates the efforts of GIS and Remote Sensing applications along with Statistical Packages for Vulnerability analysis in terms of food insecurity and poverty and also addresses the ultimate utility of these studies.},

Title = {Alpine grassland management based on ecosystem service relationships on the southern slopes of the Qilian Mountains, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {288},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Grassland management is one of the most important means to address grassland degradation on the QinghaiTibet Plateau, but at present, the primary goal is still to improve grassland productivity, and little research has been conducted on grassland management based on its ecosystem service relationships. Based on remote sensing and meteorological data, we calculated and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes, trade-offs and synergistic relationships between livestock production and water retention services in alpine grassland on the southern slopes of the Qilian Mountains (SSQM), and designed a grazing management plan for sustainable development in the region. The results showed that the value of livestock production and water retention services of alpine grassland decreased from east to west, and their relationship is dominated by synergy and complemented by trade-offs. The synergistic relationships are concentrated in the Qinghai Lake Basin in the south and the river valleys in the north, while the trade-offs are scattered in the steeper terrain in the western and eastern parts of the study area. The scenario of preserving all water retention services and losing some livestock production services is sustainable. Based on this scenario we divided the alpine grassland of the study area into maintenance grazing, rotational grazing and grazing exclusion of 65.8\%, 32.0\% and 2.2\%, respectively. Our study demonstrates that ecosystem service relationships have the potential to guide grassland management, and the results will provide new approaches to alpine grassland management.},

Volume = {50},

Pages = {310-319},
Abstract = {UAVs have already demonstrated to be effective in many fields. Nevertheless, at the moment, it is not still clear the type and the value of benefits they can provide for remote sensing purposes in agriculture. In particular, in the Italian context, this technique has still to demonstrate that derivable information can improve ordinary crop management. Furthermore, it is not still clear if costs are consistent with the ones of the agricultural sector and if any actual benefit can be really obtained. Some basic questions have to be answered: (a) are costs consistent with sector incomes? and (b) which is the related economic/environmental value? In this work reference values for UAV costs and productivity are proposed. A cost simulating model, based on both technical and economic considerations, and parameterized in respect of the size of the imaged area is proposed. Different UAV company paradigms are considered demonstrating that sustainable costs can be obtained only by making remote sensing skills internal to company. A brief discussion is also given, concerning (a) UAV potential market in the Italian viticulture context and (b) expected minimal composition that a company, basing its business on this type of service, should have.},

Abstract = {The ecosystem services provided by the Bangladesh Sundarbans contribute in various sectors especially to the livelihood of the surrounding peoples, but they are often overlooked in the valuation process. This study investigates the significance of ecosystem services on peoples' lives and how these services are affected by climate change and other factors. Here an economic valuation framework was used to list the ecosystem services provided by this mangrove forest. Direct uses included timber, golpata (Nypa fruticans), honey, beeswax, fish, shrimp larvae and tourism. Indirect uses included carbon storage, protection from cyclones and tidal surges, breeding and nursery grounds for the aquatic species, and biodiversity conservation. This work also found that the ecosystem services were diminished by fresh water flow reduction, overharvesting, sea level rise, salinity increase, poaching, and climate change. In the present context and future scenario, sea level rise will be an important contributor to changes in ecosystem services. But because many factors impact sea level rise, the impact of climate change takes on less importance than many other causes of ecosystem service degradation in the Bangladesh Sundarbans.},

Abstract = {The continuous urban expansion changes the urban ecological landscape pattern and urban ecosystem functions that possess serious challenge before urban environmental and ecological management. In this context, assessing the relationship between rapid urban expansion and ecosystem services play an important role for the urban sustainability and development related to planning and policies. This study mainly focuses on the assessment of the dynamic nature of urbanization and its impact on urban ecosystem services through land use and land cover (LULC) changes of Old Malda Municipal town, Eastern India. The ecosystem service values (ESVt) are analyzed using Remote Sensing data and GIS techniques corresponding with the global Value Coefficient (VC) for four-time periods (1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017) to estimate total ecosystem service values (ESV,) and individual ecosystem service function change. Coefficient of Sensitivity (CS) is also applied to test the reliability of the estimated VC used as proxies for each LULC categories. The result of the study landscape reveals that the ecosystem service values (ESVs) decreased by 25\% from US\$ 1.33 million to US\$ 1.07 million because of losing cropland and vegetation cover by 34\% and 35\% respectively during 1990-2017. In case of individual ecosystem service functions, regulating services increased by 12\% since 1990-2017 with highest contributing services of water regulation (57\%), water supply (22\%) and waste treatment (8\%) respectively while maximum decline is recorded in soil formation (33.33\%) followed by climatic regulation (31.82\%) and nutrient cycling (31.25\%). The decline in total and some individual ESV in the study landscape requires for urgent measures to be taken to enhance the urban ecosystem sustainability through effective planning and policies.},

Abstract = {On December 12, 2006, both the European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 and Environmental Satellite recorded a high-magnitude flood event on the River Dee in Wales (U. K.) only 28 min apart. This unique opportunity enables the creation of a very rare but extremely useful observed data set for flood inundation studies. For flood management purposes, hydrodynamic models are often run after an event but with field data gauged during the event to approximate both flood area and depth. As an adequate a priori definition of model parameters is difficult, they tend to be run with multiple parameter sets to generate a likelihood of inundation map. However, as field observations of events are often very scarce, these output maps cannot be validated with field-observed probabilities. This paper illustrates how this unique set of spaceborne radar images can be used in combination with five widely used image processing techniques to generate an event-specific inundation map that expresses a degree of belief that a given pixel is possibly flooded. It is expected that the value of this multialgorithm ensemble-based map opens up new ways to evaluate the performance of hydrodynamic models, as it contains information which has, to the authors' knowledge, not previously been available.},

Title = {Quantitative evaluation of ecological cumulative effect in mining area using a pixel-based time series model of ecosystem service value},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {120},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Study on the ecological cumulative effect (ECE) in mining area is an effective way to understand the impact of long-term coal mining on the ecological environment. However, the existing quantitative models to evaluate the ECE in mining area focus more on region-wide features, static analysis and multi-temporal comparison with numerical results, but less on the spatial heterogeneity, dynamic changes trajectory and visual mapping of ECE. In order to fill this gap, we have proposed a pixel-based time series model of ecosystem service value (ESV) to quantify the ECE in mining area and reveal its spatial distribution, heterogeneity and dynamic process. The model was constructed from three dimensions, namely space, time and element, which were analyzed from pixel scale, the whole research period and the perspective of ESV respectively. Taking Yanzhou coalfield as the study area, from 1987 to 2016 as the time span, the model was used to analyze the ECE. The study results showed that: 1) it could display the detail about each pixel's spatio-temporal change of ESV credibly by dynamic equivalent factor method based on time-series remote sensing (RS), with equivalent factor rectified by remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) pixel by pixel. 2) The pixel-based time series model of ESV showed a good performance in reflecting the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of ECE, revealing the direction and extent of accumulation, and achieving the dynamic evaluation of ECE in the time dimension. 3) The change of ecosystem service value cumulant (COESVC) in Yanzhou coalfield decreased by 644.49 million RMB, showing obviously negative ECE. The areas with negative ECE were mainly distributed outside the area above mining faces, while that with positive ECE mostly appeared in waterlogged areas, especially those within the area above mining faces. The evaluation result of ECE could be used in decision-making for improving ecological quality and developing coal mining strategies. This paper may also offer an idea and method for dynamic and quantitative evaluation of the ECE in mining and similar area by time-series Landsat-based RS.},

Abstract = {The Nile Delta, in northern Egypt, is an extensive wetland with many lakes. The land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes and water pollution of these lakes are greatly affecting the sustainable development and the ecosystem. This study aims to investigate the impact of LULC and the water quality of Edku, Manzala, and Burullus lakes on the ecosystem service value (ESV) due to recent economic development. The changes of ESV associated with LULC dynamics and changes are calculated and evaluated using the integration of both the geographic information system and remote sensing techniques. The images of the years 2011 and 2021 are used to study the LULC changes and predict the land use and ESV of the study area for the year 2031. Furthermore, the effects of the developments during the period 2011-2021 on water quality are presented and evaluated. The land use evaluation during the period 2011-2021 showed that the economic development positively affected the water surface and urban areas changes and the water quality of the three lakes; however, the water pollution of Manzala lake is still extremely high. The water surface of Edku, Burullus, and Manzala lakes increased by 2.46\%, 0.83\%, and 15.69\%, respectively, and 12.47\%, 0.74\%, and 2.24\%, respectively, for the urban changes. The changes during the period 2011-2021 show that Manzala lake ESV increased by 4.91\%, and it may decrease by 0.11\% during the period 2021-2031. The ESV during the periods 2011-2021 and 2021-2031 is 5.04\% and - 4.17\%, respectively, for the Burullus lake, and - 0.89\% and - 6.20\%, respectively, for Edku lake. These results reveal that the ESV is vital for land resources management of the lakes and development strategies should be accurately addressed to estimate the impact of these projects.},

Abstract = {Satellite remote sensing has a particularly important role: many initiatives are now operating and others, with more advanced technological possibilities, are planned, often being the result of international co-operation. In this context it is necessary to establish an appropriate regulation of these activities, as the interests at stake are considerably divergent. Industrialised countries are in fact able to play an active role in the development of space activities, while developing countries, not holding the necessary technology, more or less passively witness such activities. The most controversial point is the interpretation of the principle of sovereignty, from which both parties move to reach opposite results. In favour of the industrialised countries one can invoke the principles of exploration and use on a non discriminatory basis, laid down by the Outer Space Treaty and also by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, without mentioning the social and economic opportunities deriving from the development of activities bringing considerable benefits to mankind. It is equally true, though, that other principles exist, asserted to the point of sustain their common law status, such as the principle of permanent sovereignty on natural resources and the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of other States, which are the foundation on which the claims of the sensed States are based. My paper, taking into special consideration the UN Gen. Ass. Resolution 41/65 of 1986 on the ``Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from the Outer Space{''}, would illustrate how the international co-operation is pushed on. The Principles on Remote Sensing of the United Nations do not mention the issues concerning the international commercialisation of the data, the notion of public benefit or intellectual property. The use of the data and the packaging of the relevant products require great investments by the industries and the latter are not willing to make these investments if a legal protection of the products and a technological followup for at least ten years is not assured. The most frequent form of protection of the remote sensing data, protecting from improper appropriation, reproduction and distribution, is the right of intellectual property. We will consider the remote sensing data protection foreseen in the United States, France, ESA and for primary data by an European Directive. A wider and inexpensive distribution of remote sensing data concerning the protection of the Earth's environment may be a concrete realisation of the international co-operation which extends to all countries the benefits deriving from a peaceful use out outer space. The market of space data concerning Earth observation is in full progress and it has not yet reached a sufficient maturity for the application of the laws of the market. At present the procedures change considerably from one country to another, and at times from one operator to another in the same country; they vary according to the nature of the data of the programs, of the categories of the users or of the use of the information. For the purpose of this study we shall consider the policy of the United States and of France and of the ESA, which have launched remote sensing satellites in outer space for the longest time, in order to stress the apparent differences. The study of the most emblematic data distribution policies shows an increasingly strong opening, albeit carried out in different manners, in favour of research in disciplines concerning the Earth. The initiatives of rules of the European Union concerning satellite data and the protection of environment prove the developing interest in this sector for a growing international co-operation.},

Abstract = {One of the most important environmental issues which Romania faces as member of the European area is land management and natural resources exploitation within protected areas. A good example is the Natura 2000 ROSCI0103 Lunca Buzaului (Buzau and Braila Counties, Romania). This protected area was established with the purpose of conserving habitats and species characteristic of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, in a region with significant anthropic stress generated by alluvial deposits exploitation, waste storage, agricultural activity, and hydro energy producing potential. The need to put such area in value requires an integrated approach, based on the use of GIS and remote sensing data. In this study, the following resources have been used: Pleiades panchromatic and multispectral images at 0.5 and 2 m spatial resolution, orthophotos with a 2.5 m spatial resolution, a digital terrain model (DTM) based on a 30 m network, topographical plans with 1: 5000 and 1: 10000 scales, thematic vectors for land using - after Corine Land Cover 2006 data sets. The time difference in the acquirement of images, the exploitation of all the aforementioned data, provides the possibility of having a time scale perspective, between 1970 and 2012. The data have been processed using specific software - ArcGis 10.0 for management of spatially referenced data, ENVI EX for remote sensing data processing and RockWorks 12 for geological and hydrogeological data processing. In the next step, processed remote sensing data, correlated with field collected data has led to the following processes:. Design of the flooding areas, along Buzau River and an environmental impact assessment associated with different scenarios;. Evaluation of actual fluvial erosion processes for the Buzau River system, both under natural state and influenced by the alluvial material extraction activities which are taking place in the area. From geomorphological point of view, the specificity of this habitat is given by the pronounced dynamic processes and, consequently, by the necessity of efficient land management. The results related to the extension of flooding areas at different flow rates, morphological instability, and the presence of erosional risk sections, have been correlated with land use characteristics (from Corine Land Cover) for the entire studied region. Obtained results: GIS data base, flooding and geomorphological risk maps. All these are useful useful for developing effective management plans in order to achieve conservation objectives for species and habitats, for mitigating environmental impact, and for elaborating a geological resources sustainable exploitation strategy.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Spatial simulation may be used to model the potential effects of current biodiversity approaches on future habitat modification under differing climate change scenarios. To illustrate the approach, spatial simulation models, including landscape-level forest dynamics, were developed for a semi-natural grassland of conservation concern in a southern Italian protected area, which was exposed to woody vegetation encroachment. A forest landscape dynamics simulator (LANDIS-II) under conditions of climate change, current fire and alternative management regimes was used to develop scenario maps. Landscape pattern metrics provided data on fragmentation and habitat quality degradation, and quantified the spatial spread of different tree species within grassland habitats. The models indicated that approximately one-third of the grassland area would be impacted by loss, fragmentation and degradation in the next 150 years. Differing forest management regimes appear to influence the type of encroaching species and the density of encroaching vegetation. Habitat modifications are likely to affect species distribution and interactions, as well as local ecosystem functioning, leading to changes in estimated conservation value. A site-scale conservation strategy based on feasible integrated fire and forest management options is proposed, considering the debate on the effectiveness of protected areas for the conservation of ecosystem services in a changing climate. This needs to be tested through further modelling and scenario analysis, which would benefit from the enhancement of current modelling capabilities of LANDIS-II and from combination with remote sensing technologies, to provide early signals of environmental shifts both within and outside protected areas.},

Abstract = {In the past thousands of years, the Grand Canal not only promoted political, economic and cultural development in China, but also formed the pattern of cities which tie along the canal called ``Canal Cities{''}. To comprehend the relationship between the city and the canal can benefit the urban planning and development. Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System technology enable us to analyze the spatio-temporal change effectively. In this study, we employ aero photographs taken in 1955 and SPOT5 images taken in 2002 as data resources. We integrates Wallis filter, visual and object-oriented interpretation, and buffer analysis. Proper models and indices were adopted for presenting the concrete city pattern change characteristics in both temporal and spatial scale. The results show that there is strong correlation between the canal and the city, and that the city development was guided by the Grand Canal. The information is necessary for the urban planning, management and policy-making, and can be used for reference by other ``Canal Cities{''}.},

Abstract = {Insights from satellite observations are increasingly being used to enhance a range of domains from highly specialised scientific research through to everyday applications directly benefiting members of the public. A particular category of satellite observations-Earth Observations (EO)-is concerned with capturing information regarding the Earth's atmospheric and environmental conditions and observing human activity and its impact on the Earth's surface. A growing number of technologies and services heavily rely on EO data and the rapidly improving fidelity, coverage, timeliness and accessibility of such observations are providing significant opportunities for new applications of economic and societal benefit. With the increasing importance, relevance and size of EO data sets, it is critical to understand how the value of such data can be maximised by complementing EO with other sources of data and efficiently making complex interpretations and decisions. The wide adoption and availability of smartphones, Internet devices and increased accessibility to information has paved the way for large numbers of citizens and communities to participate in scientific, technological, societal and decision-making activities. This chapter discusses the experience of the European Space Agency funded Crowd4Sat project led by the University of Sheffield that investigated different facets of how crowdsourcing and citizen science impact upon the validation, use and enhancement of Observations from Satellites products and services.},

Abstract = {1. Animal-borne telemetry has revolutionized our ability to study animal movement, species physiology, demography and social structures, changing environments and the threats that animals are experiencing. While there will always be a need for basic ecological research and discovery, the current conservation crisis demands we look more pragmatically at the data required to make informed management decisions. 2. Here, we define a framework that distinguishes how research using animal telemetry devices can influence conservation. We then discuss two critical questions which aim to directly connect telemetry-derived data to applied conservation decision-making: (i) Would my choice of action change if I had more data? (ii) Is the expected gain worth the money and time required to collect more data? 3. Policy implications. To answer questions about integrating telemetry-derived data with applied conservation, we suggest the use of value of information analysis to quantitatively assess the return-on-investment of animal telemetry-derived data for conservation decision-making.},

Title = {Integration of Remote-Sensing Techniques for the Preventive Conservation of Paleolithic Cave Art in the Karst of the Altamira Cave},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Rock art offers traces of our most remote past and was made with mineral and organic substances in shelters, walls, or the ceilings of caves. As it is notably fragile, it is fortunate that some instances remain intact-but a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors can lead to its disappearance. Therefore, as a valuable cultural heritage, rock art requires special conservation and protection measures. Geomatic remote-sensing technologies such as 3D terrestrial laser scanning (3DTLS), drone flight, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) allow us to generate exhaustive documentation of caves and their environment in 2D, 2.5D, and 3D. However, only its combined use with 3D geographic information systems (GIS) lets us generate new cave maps with details such as overlying layer thickness, sinkholes, fractures, joints, and detachments that also more precisely reveal interior-exterior interconnections and gaseous exchange; i.e., the state of senescence of the karst that houses the cave. Information of this kind is of great value for the research, management, conservation, monitoring, and dissemination of cave art.},

Title = {The Six Dimensions of Value Associated to the use of Copernicus Sentinel Data: Key Findings From the Sentinel Benefits Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {The role of Earth Observation (EO) data from satellites in supporting informed decision-making and more efficient operational processes is becoming increasingly recognized. However, analysing the value that this generates remains a challenge. Often, top-down cost-benefit analyses are used to justify budgets but with very broad-based, macro-economic assumptions. The approach discussed in this paper is bottom-up building on the use of a single product or service arising from the use of data coming from one or more of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. This allows a much finer, detailed understanding of how the data is being used and hence contributing to informed decision making. A case-based, value-chain methodology has been applied through which the impact on society can be analysed. Whilst early cases focused on economic value i.e., monetized benefits, later ones recognise that often the benefits may be wider than this. For instance, organisations can benefit through an increased reputation, or societal values such as quality of life can be felt. Consequently, a set of non-monetary dimensions have been defined which provide a new framework for the analysis. The six dimensions are described in the paper and have been tested on a significant number of recent cases. The paper describes the updated methodology and the results obtained through its application.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Changes of Land-Use/Land Cover Change and the Effects on Ecosystem Service Values in Derong County, China, from 1992-2018},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Monitoring the spatio-temporal variation of the land-use/land cover change (LULC) and ecosystem service value (ESV) changes will help achieve regional sustainable development and management. Derong County is a part of the Hengduan Mountains area, the most crucial ecological functional area in China, and LULC has changed tremendously in the past 30 years. However, the effects of LULC changes on ecosystem services is not well understood. Based on 1992, 1995, 2005, 2013, and 2018 remote sensing images, we used visual interpretation to obtain LULC data and used global value coefficients and modified local value coefficients to assess the spatial-temporal changes of ESV and LULC from 1992 to 2018. The results showed that: (1) From 1992 to 2018, shrubland and grassland decreased, while built-up land, snow, forestland, water body, and cropland area increased. (2) The ESV with an overall decrease of 0.25 x 10(8) yuan, ecological projects have played a positive role in improving ESV. In contrast, the main decrease factor of ESV was the increase in agricultural economic development and urban expansion from 1992 to 2018. (3) The ESV spatial distribution indicated the value density of ESV was on the decline, and with the greatest deterioration in Dianyagong. The highest density of ESV area is distributed in Waka, and the lowest density of ESV area is distributed in Bari.

Abstract = {The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs) are a set of terms of interest for the development of global spatial data infrastructures. These SBAs form a two level hierarchy (categories and subcategories) ranging from natural disasters to human health. The SBAs are used widely by international geographic information sharing initiatives and policy makers. One of the uses of the SBAs is to allow users to search a spatial data infrastructure for resources that relate to the theme of interest (category or subcategory) selected. However, the SBAs are currently only specified in English. In this paper, we provide a translation of the SBAs into Italian, Spanish, French, and Slovenian in order to support multilingual search, and we underline the issues involved in the translation. Since some of these issues seem to be strictly related to a few discrepancies present in the original version of the SBAs, this paper also proposes a revision of the original set of terms in English.},

Title = {Subways and CO2 emissions: A global analysis with satellite data},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {883},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {This paper estimates a global CO2 emissions model using satellite data at 25 km resolution. The model incorporates industrial sources (including power, steel, cement, and refineries), fires, and non-industrial population-related factors associated with household incomes and energy requirements. It also tests the impact of subways in the 192 cities where they operate. We find highly significant effects with the expected signs for all model variables, including subways. In a counterfactual exercise estimating CO2 emissions with and without subways, we find they have reduced population-related CO2 emissions by about 50 \% for the 192 cities and about 11 \% globally. Extending the analysis to future subways for other cities, we estimate the magnitude and social value of CO2 emissions reductions with conservative assumptions about population and income growth and a range of values for the social cost of carbon and investment costs. Even under pessimistic assumptions for these costs, we find that hundreds of cities realize a significant climate co-benefit, along with benefits from reduced traffic congestion and local air pollution, which have traditionally motivated subway construction. Under more moderate assumptions, we find that, on climate grounds alone, hundreds of cities realize high enough social rates of return to warrant subway construction.},

Abstract = {Solid waste management system is a tedious task that is facing both developing and developed countries. Site Suitability analysis and route optimization for solid waste disposal can make waste management cheap and can be used for sustainable development. However, if the disposal site(s) is/are not sited and handle properly, it can cause environmental pollution and affect public health, hence the application of GIS and Remote Sensing to waste disposal Site Suitability analysis and route optimization for solid waste in Yola town. Different factors or criteria were considered in relation to solid waste disposal sites. In order to achieve the aim of this paper, the Boolean logic was used, where suitable areas were assigned value 1 and unsuitable area were assigned 0 for each of the criteria. The Boolean images were overlaid to produce the suitability map. The result of the suitability analysis gave a total of six sites out of which three met the criteria of size having an area of 612.75Ha which constitute 6.12\% of the total area of the study area. The optimized route were generated connecting the proposed disposal site which are truck 1, truck 2, and truck 3 with distances of 19.65km, 17.16km and 22.11km respectively. It is recommended that remote sensing and GIS can be used in increasing efficiency of solid waste management in an urban settlement.},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Most current approaches to landscape scale ecosystem service assessments rely on detailed secondary data. This type of data is seldom available in regions with high levels of poverty and strong local dependence on provisioning ecosystem services for livelihoods. We develop a method to extrapolate results from a previously published village scale ecosystem services assessment to a higher administrative level, relevant for land use decision making. The method combines remote sensing (using a hybrid classification method) and interviews with community members. The resulting landscape scale maps show the spatial distribution of five different livelihood benefits (nutritional diversity, income, insurance/saving, material assets and energy, and crops for consumption) that illustrate the strong multi-functionality of the Sahelian landscapes. The maps highlight the importance of a diverse set of sub-units of the landscape in supporting Sahelian livelihoods. We see a large potential in using the resulting type of livelihood benefit maps for guiding future land use decisions in the Sahel.},

Title = {Quantifying landscape pattern and ecosystem service value changes: A case study at the county level in the Chinese Loess Plateau},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Implementation of ecological restoration projects in the Chinese Loess Plateau has improved the ecological environment significantly, and altered the structure of rural land use dramatically. Therefore, it is critical to characterize and quantify the changes in landscape patterns and ecosystem service value (ESV), especially at the county level, to provide sustainable land-use plans to local policymakers. This study mapped land use for 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015 by using remote sensing imagery of Yongshou County, a typical hilly-gully region in Loess Plateau, and quantified the changes in landscape patterns by using spatial metrics. It employed the benefit transfer method to estimate changes in ESV. The results showed the following: (1) Grassland, forestland and cropland were the main land-use types, with the most increased area in forestland and grassland. (2) The landscape pattern was becoming more fragmented, and connectivity and accessibility decreased. (3) The total ESV increased by 3.5 million RMB, mainly because of increased ESV in grassland; meanwhile, synergies existed among regulation and support services, and trade-offs existed among supply services and regulation. (4) The changes in land-use types and landscape patterns had significant positive effects on the ESV. These results on ESV change with land-use support scientific decision-making services for the formulation of land-use planning and landscape structure adjustment plans at the county level to ensure sustainable management of ecosystems.

Abstract = {Marine aquaculture has been expanding rapidly in recent years, driven by the growing demand for marine products. However, this expansion has led to increased competition for space and resources with other coastal zone activities, which has resulted in the need for larger facilities and the relocation of operations to offshore areas. Moreover, the complex environment and exposure to environmental conditions and external threats further complicate the sustainable development of the sector. To address these challenges, new and innovative technologies are needed, such as the incorporation of remote sensing and in-situ data for comprehensive and continuous monitoring of aquaculture facilities. This study aims to create an integrated monitoring and decision support system utilizing both satellite and in-situ data to monitor aquaculture facilities on various scales, providing information on water quality, fish growth, and warning signs to alert managers and producers of potential hazards. This study focuses on identifying and estimating parameters that affect aquaculture processes, establishing indicators that can act as warning signs, and evaluating the system's performance in real-life scenarios. The resulting monitoring tool, called ``Aquasafe{''}, was evaluated for its effectiveness and performance by test users through real-life scenarios. The results of the implemented models showed high accuracy, with an R-2 value of 0.67. Additionally, users were generally satisfied with the usefulness of the tool, suggesting that it holds promise for efficient management and decision making in marine aquaculture.},

Abstract = {One of the major accompaniments of the globalization is the rapid growing of urban areas. Urban sprawl is the main environmental problem affecting those cities across different characteristics and continents. Various reasons for the increase in urban sprawl in the last 10 to 30 years have been proposed {[}1], and often depend on the socio-economic situation of cities. The quantitative reduction and the sustainable handling of land should be performed by inner urban development instead of expanding urban regions. Following the principal ``spare the urban fringe, develop the inner suburbs first{''} requires differentiated tools allowing for quantitative and qualitative appraisals of current building potentials. Using spatial high resolution remote sensing data within an object-based approach enables the detection of potential areas while GIS-data provides information for the quantitative valuation.},

Abstract = {Taking representative Tamarix chinensis forest in the national-level special protection zone for ocean ecology of Changyi city in Shandong province of China as the objective, this research studied how to use remote sensing technology to evaluate natural eco-environment and analyze spatiotemporal variation. In the process of constructing the index system of ecological environment effect evaluation based on RSEI (Remote Sensing Ecological Index) model, AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth), Salinity, Greenness, Wetness, Heat and Dryness, which can represent the ecological environment of the reserve, were selected as the corresponding indexes. In order to accurately obtain the value of the RSEI of the study area and to retain the information of the original indexes to the greatest extent, the SPCA (spatial principal components analysis) method was applied in this research. Finally, the RSEI was applied to evaluate the ecological and environmental effects and to analyze the spatial characteristics and spatiotemporal evolution of the study area. The results not only provide scientific evidence and technical guidance for the protection, transformation and management of the Tamarix chinensis forest in the protection zone but also push the development of the universal model of the ecological environment quality with a remote sensing evaluation index system at a regional scale.},

Abstract = {Soil salinization is one of the significant phenomena accelerating land degradation processes, which in turn cause loss of soil productivity, reduction in biomass production and human health implications. Due to high spatial and temporal variability of soil salinity, mapping and tracking its changes is an essential issue for anticipating natural disasters like desertification and for mitigating severe economic and social consequences in especially arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The main objective of this study is to review the most recent remote sensing applications for soil salinity assessment via various multispectral data such as LANDSAT, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT, IKONOS, Quick Bird and the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) series of satellites, as well as hyperspectral data such as HuanJing-Hyper Spectral Imager (HJ-HSI) and Hyperion Earth-Observing 1 (EO-1). Furthermore, utility of recent remote sensing analysing techniques and methods including linear spectral unmixing, Decision-Tree Analysis (DTA), supervised maximum likelihood classification, principal components analysis, inverted Gaussian function, partial least square regression technique and regression kriging approaches are discussed. Examples of spatio-temporal changes in salt affected Mediterranean soils are referred. In addition, various spectral bands which are sensitive to soil salinity for each of the multispectral data are introduced. Besides, details are given on the generation of salinity and vegetation indices to achieve the most significant correlation with ground electrical conductivity values by means of combining appropriate spectral bands with special focus on the Mediterranean countries.},

Title = {Three Most Widely Used GNSS-Based Shoreline Monitoring Methods to Support Integrated Coastal Zone Management Policies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {143},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Shoreline monitoring is essential for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). It provides the necessary information needed to manage the settlement of coastal areas, establishes guidelines for management of socioeconomic activities within the coastal areas, provides information necessary for recovery actions of beach regeneration, and provides a reference baseline for studies related to climate change in coastal zones. Shoreline monitoring methods are largely dependent on goals, costs, implementation, and applicability. For monitoring of short coastal shorelines (e.g., tens to hundreds of kilometers), global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based methods are emerging as low-cost approaches that offer rapid, weather-independent, and quickly updatable products that could benefit policy makers when high costs of traditional methods, such as photogrammetry and remote sensing, are of concern. However, various GNSS methods applicable to shoreline monitoring exist, making it difficult for decision makers to choose a suitable approach. Using a case study of the Pernambuco State ICZM in Brazil, this study evaluates three of the most commonly used GNSS-based shoreline monitoring methods, that is, relative kinematic (RK), real-time kinematic (RTK), and precise point positioning (PPP) methods. It also provides a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and limitations. The results highlight the issues and important considerations in choosing an economically viable GNSS method for mapping shoreline changes, particularly for supporting ICZM policies.},

Abstract = {In the U.S. Northern Great Plains, growing seasons are short but extremely productive. Farms and ranches are large, so many of precision agriculture's early adopters reside in the region. Crop yield maps at season's end reveal sizable variations across fields. Farm management relying upon uniform chemical applications is ineffective and wasteful. We provided information about crop and range status in near-real-time, so that in-season decisions could be made to optimize final yields and minimize environmental degradation. We created learning communities, in which information is shared among scientists, farmers, ranchers, and data providers. The new information for agricultural producers was satellite and aerial imagery. Value-added information was derived from ETM+, AVHRR, IKONOS, and MODIS sensors. The emphasis was on reducing the time between acquisition of data by a satellite and delivery of value-added products to farmers and ranchers. To distribute large spatial data sets in short times to rural users we relied upon satellite transmission (Direct PC). Results include: (1) management zone delineation, (2) variable-rate fertilizer applications, (3) weed detection, (4) irrigation efficiency determination, (5) detection of insect infestation, (6) specification of crop damage due to inadvertent chemical application, and (7) determination of livestock carrying capacities on rangelands.},

Abstract = {Protecting areas of important ecological value is one of the main approaches to safeguarding the Earth's ecosystems. However, the long-term effectiveness of protected areas is often uncertain. Focusing on China's ecological conservation redline policy (Eco-redline policy) introduced in recent years, this study attempted to examine the effectiveness of alternative policy interventions and their implications on future land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns. A scenario analysis was employed to elucidate the implications of different policy interventions for Chongqing capital, one of the most representative cities in China. These interventions considered the spatial extent of Eco-redline areas (ERAs) and the management intensity within these areas. LULC data for two different periods from 2000 (first year) to 2010 (end year) were derived from satellite images and then used for future (2050) LULC projections, incorporating the various policy interventions. Furthermore, several landscape indices, including the shape complexity, contrast, and aggregation of forest patches were calculated for each scenario. After comparing the scenarios, our analysis suggests that the current extent of ERAs may not be sufficient, although their management intensity is. Therefore, we suggest that during the optimization of the Eco-redline policy, ERAs are gradually increased while maintaining their current management intensity.},

Abstract = {Sustainable agricultural management is essential not only to maintain productivity of current farmlands, but also to conserve natural environments. Records of agricultural activities are required to assist rapid assessment of agricultural lands, and thus, designation of management plans and policies. By the 1980s, when unfavorable environmental impacts of conventional tillage practices were widely recognized, agronomists introduced conservation tillage to benefit soils and agricultural environments, and soon began programs to monitor adoption of conservation tillage practices. The role of remote sensing in acquiring this information has been increasing because remote sensing technologies can provide the broad scope and the ability to collect sequential imagery to estimate trends and patterns of adoption of alternative tillage practices. This review encompasses comparisons of remote sensing techniques with more conventional methods for surveying and estimating tillage status, applications of remote sensing technologies, data processing and analysis, validation and field data collection, impacts of terrain, spectral and spatial resolution, timing and temporal detail, and prospects of future instruments.

East Coast Surabaya is an area with the most extensive and diverse mangrove ecosystems along the coast of Surabaya. Currently Pamurbaya used as a recreational object or nature tourism called eco tours. Utilization of mangrove ecosystem as a place of this eco tour bring positive impact on economic potency around pamurbaya area. So, to know the value of the economic potential of mangrove ecosystems for support of nature tourism Pamurbaya region needs to study mapping mangrove ecosystem conditions in the East Coast area of Surabaya. Mapping of mangrove conditions can use remote sensing technology by utilizing satellite image data with high resolution. Data used for mapping mangrove ecosystem conditions on the east coast of Surabaya are high resolution satellite image data of Pleiades 1A and field observation data such as Ground Control Point, soil spectral parameters and water quality. From satellite image data will be classification of mangrove vegetation canopy classification using NDVI vegetation index method using algorithm formula which then will be tested correlation with field observation data on reflectant value of field and water quality parameter. The purpose of this research is to know the condition of mangrove ecosystem to know the economic potential of mangrove ecosystem in supporting Pamurbaya nature tourism. The expected result of this research is the existence of basic geospatial information in the form of mangrove ecosystem condition map. So that can be used as decision makers to find out how big economic potential of mangrove ecosystem in supporting nature tourism Pamurbaya beside that can be used as reference research related mapping, conservation and development of mangrove ecosystem.},

Title = {A New Framework of 17 Hydrological Ecosystem Services (HESS17) for Supporting River Basin Planning and Environmental Monitoring},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Hydrological ecosystem services (HESS) describe the benefits of water for multiple purposes with an emphasis on environmental values. The value of HESS is often not realized because primary benefits (e.g., food production, water withdrawals) get the most attention. Secondary benefits such as water storage, purification or midday temperature cooling are often overlooked. This results in an incorrect evaluation of beneficial water usage in urban and rural resettlements and misunderstandings when land use changes are introduced. The objective of this paper is to propose a standard list of 17 HESS indicators that are in line with the policy and philosophy of the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and that are measurable with earth observation technologies in conjunction with GIS and hydrological models. The HESS17 framework considered indicators that can be directly related to water flows, water fluxes and water stocks; they have a natural characteristic with minimal anthropogenic influence and must be quantifiable by means of earth observation models in combination with GIS and hydrological models. The introduction of a HESS framework is less meaningful without proper quantification procedures in place. Because of the widely diverging management options, the role of water should be categorized as (i) consumptive use (i.e., evapotranspiration and dry matter production) and (ii) non-consumptive use (stream flow, recharge, water storage). Governments and responsible agencies for integrated water management should recognize the need to include HESS17 in water allocation policies, water foot-printing, water accounting, transboundary water management, food security purposes and spatial land-use planning processes. The proposed HESS17 framework and associated methods can be used to evaluate land, soil and water conservation programs. This paper presents a framework that is non-exhaustive but can be realistically computed and applicable across spatial scales.},

Title = {Assessment of Environmental Water Security of an Asian Deltaic Megacity and Its Peri-Urban Wetland Areas},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Achieving urban water security requires sustaining the trade-offs between the exploitation of water/environmental resources and ecosystem services. This achievement not only reduces the pollution and contamination in the environment, level of water stress, but also secures good ambient water quality and future for people's well-being and livelihoods. Changes in land use and land cover and growth of impervious structures can immediately generate severe ecological and social issues and increase the level of natural or manmade risks, affecting the condition of ecosystem services within and in the vicinity of an urban region. As a result of these transformations and further exploitation, due to the growing anthropogenic pressure, surface water and groundwater quality can be deteriorated compared to ambient water quality standards (for both chemical and biological pollutants). Based on land use and land cover (LULC) data retrieved from remote sensing interpretation, we computed the changes of the ecosystem service values (ESV) associated with the LULC dynamics, water quality and, finally, urban water security during the pre- and post-monsoon periods of 2009, 2014 and 2019 in Kolkata, an Asian deltaic megacity, and its peri-urban wetlands named East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW). The area under wetlands reduced comprehensively in 2009-2019 due to the conversion of wetlands into various other classes such as urban settlement, etc. The quality of surface water bodies (such as rivers, lakes, canals and inland wetlands) deteriorated. The groundwater quality is still under control, but the presence of arsenic, manganese and other metals are a clear indication of urban expansion and related activities in the area. As a result, there was a change in the ESV during this timeframe. In the pre-monsoon period, there was an increase in total ESV from US\$53.14 million in 2009 to US\$53.36 million and US\$59.01 million in 2014 and 2019, respectively. In the post-monsoon period, the ESV decreased from US\$67.42 million in 2009 to US\$64.13 and US\$61.89 million in 2014 and 2019, respectively. These changes can be attributed to the peri-urban wetlands and the benefits or services arising out of them that contribute more than 50\% of the total ESV. This study found that the area under wetlands has reduced comprehensively in the past 10 years due to the conversion of wetlands for various other uses such as urban expansion of the Kolkata City, but still, this peri-urban wetland supports the urban water security by providing sufficient ecosystem services. In conclusion, the transformation in extent of the water-related ecosystem is a crucial indicator of urban water security, which also measures the quantity of water contained in various water-related ecosystems. Quantitative analysis of the LULC change, hence, is important for studying the corresponding impact on the ecosystem service value (ESV) and water quality that helps in decision-making in securing urban water future and ecosystem conservation.},

Title = {An optimal modeling approach for reducing carbon footprint in agricultural water-energy-food nexus system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {316},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Modern agriculture calls for efficient and environmental-friendly agricultural water and land management practice. Agricultural water and land utilization mode has a great impact on the amount of carbon emissions, and thus the aim of this work is to propose an optimal modeling approach for generating efficient agricultural water and land management alternatives and reducing carbon emission in agricultural water-energy-food nexus system. This study presents a novel approach consisting of carbon footprint lifecycle assessment method and bi-level multi-objective stochastic programming model. The proposed approach has contributions in following aspects: (1) the environmental impact of different resource allocation strategies can be measured in optimization (2) the spatial variability of spatial data (e.g., ET0 and precipitation); can be fully reflected via remote sensing information; (3) tradeoffs among two decision-making levels and their conflicting objectives under randomness of surface water availability can be addressed. The proposed approach was applied to the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China. After solving the proposed model, the optimal water and land use alternatives under different hydrological years can be generated. Decision makers can plan agricultural production strategy according to optimization schemes, and reduce carbon emission through increasing vegetable cultivation and surface water utilization. Furthermore, the performance comparison of different models indicated that fierce conflicts exist between income fairness and economic benefits. The comprehensive evaluation value of bilevel multi-objective stochastic programming model is 0.7036, which is highest among single- and multiobjective models, showing that such model has obvious advantage in dealing with multiple decision-making levels and conflicting objectives. This approach can help decision makers of similar regions manage the agricultural production system in a more efficient and environment-friendly way.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},

Abstract = {Integrating ecosystem service value (ESV) into the evaluation system for sustainable land use (SLU) in fast-growing cities is an effective way to implement Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 15 and 11 of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Taking ESV as the intermediate parameter, six sustainability indicators were developed to evaluate SLU from two dimensions: sustainable land ecosystem services and economic development. These indicators are the total supply and demand index (RT) of ecosystem services, the potential supply and demand index (RP) of ecosystem services, the ecological cost index per unit of GDP (RC), the eco-economic coordination index (RD), the eco-economic equilibrium index (RE), and the ESV-based sustainable land use index (RS). Empirical research was conducted in Qingdao, a fast-growing city in eastern China, to verify the validity of the indicators. Five sets of Landsat TM/ETM/OLI remote sensing images from 1996, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2017 were used to analyze the land use and ESV changes in Qingdao. The results indicate that land use changes in fast-growing cities significantly affect the ESV. The decrease in the area of ecological land and the expansion of construction land caused by rapid urbanization reduced ESV. The RC and RD of Qingdao were sustainable, while the RT and RP were unsustainable, and the RE showed volatility, which reduced the evaluation level of SLU in Qingdao from extremely strongly sustainable (L1) to moderately sus-tainable (L3). Thus, it is necessary to improve the ESV of Qingdao. Optimization strategies for promoting SLU in Qingdao are proposed based on the results, confirming that the evaluation provides guidance for land use management.},

Title = {Monitoring the effects of land consolidation on the ecological environmental quality based on remote sensing: A case study of Chaohu Lake Basin, China},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As a kind of activity to break down the original land ecosystem, land consolidation causes the ecosystem to undergo a process of ``stability-unstable-stable{''}. The Chaohu Lake Basin is a typical traditional agricultural planting area and extensive implementation of large-scale land consolidation projects. By monitoring the impact of land consolidation activities in a specific time period in the basin on the project areas and surrounding environment, the spatial and temporal impacts of large-scale land consolidation on regional eco-environmental quality are analyzed. This study mainly monitors crop growth, soil moisture and temperature changes in the land consolidation project area, and the corresponding changes in the surrounding environment. The response of ecological environment factors caused by land consolidation can be embodied in indicators such as humidity, greenness, heat and dryness. Four indicators of NDVI, WET, LST, and NDBSI were selected, using principal component analysis, monitoring the environmental quality changes in the land consolidation areas of Chaohu Lake Basin. Result shows that the ecological environmental quality of the study area exhibits long-term convergence and short-term divergence, and the correlation between the ecological indicators is not significant. The average contribution rate of the first principal component eigenvalue is 67.94 \%. The implementation period of the land consolidation project will seriously interfere with the ecological environment, but it can be restored within 3-5 years after implementation, and the ecological environmental quality of the project area will continue to improve. Land consolidation not only can improve the quality of the ecological environment in the consolidation area, but also can promote the surrounding environment. The findings provide theoretical basis and decision guidance for the improvement of land consolidation planning and design (reconstruction) in China, and offer suggestions on strategy-oriented support and scientific basis for promoting the long-term development of land consolidation worldwide.},

Abstract = {Citizen science is a promising way to increase temporal and spatial coverages of in-situ data, and to aid in data processing and analysis. In this paper, we present how citizen science can be used together with Earth observation, and demonstrate its value through three pilot projects focusing on forest biomass analysis, data management in emergencies and water quality monitoring. We also provide recommendations and ideas for follow-up activities. In the forest biomass analysis pilot, in the state of Durango (Mexico), local volunteers make in-situ forest inventory measurements with mobile devices. The collected data is combined with Landsat-8 imagery to derive forest biomass map of the area. The study area includes over 390 permanent sampling plots that will provide reference data for concept validation and verification. The emergency data management pilot focuses in the Philippines, in the areas affected by the typhoons Haiyan in November 2013 and Hagupit in December 2014. Data collected by emergency workers and citizens are combined with satellite data (Landsat-8, VHR if available) to intensify the disaster recovery activities and the coordination efforts. Simple processes for citizens, non-governmental organisations and volunteers are developed to find and utilize up to date and freely available satellite imagery for coordination purposes and for building new not-for-profit services in disaster situations. In the water quality monitoring pilot, citizens around the Baltic Sea area contribute to the algae situation awareness by collecting algae observations using a mobile application. In-situ observations are compared with surface algal bloom products based on the satellite imagery, e.g. Aqua MODIS images with 500 meter resolution. As an outcome, the usability of the citizen observations together with satellite data in the algae monitoring will be evaluated.},

Title = {Forest dependency, co-management and improvement of peoples' livelihood capital: Evidence from Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In order to reduce peoples' dependency on forests, to improve their livelihoods, and to conserve forest resources a number of protected areas (PA) in Bangladesh has been brought under PA comanagement. In this study, we examined the dependency of forest dependent communities (FDC) on forests, and the impacts of PA co-management on their livelihood capital drawing data from Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS), a pioneer PA of south-eastern Bangladesh. Data on forest dependency was collected through a participatory survey along 28 randomly selected forest trails and remote sensing (RS) analysis of betel leaf plots inside the CWS. To analyze the livelihood capital, we adopted a sustainable livelihood framework and interviewed randomly selected 843 FDC members, and 88 local people who were not involved in PA co-management as control. Remote sensing based vegetation indices were derived to evaluate the trends of vegetation condition in the CWS. Results show that 481 persons were entering into the CWS in a day to collect forest products having an estimated market value of about USD1,856. Even though the extent of cultivation had reduced but local people were still practicing betel leaf farming. The livelihood improvement activities under PA co-management had positive impacts, and livelihood capital indices of the FDC members were significantly higher than that of control group. Similar impact was also reflected in five livelihood capital, and notably the mean monthly household income (financial capital) of FDC members had increased by 53\% in five years. The RS based vegetation indices indicate that overall forest condition was gradually improving from 2010 to 2015. In order to endure the livelihood of FDC members and to conserve the forests of CWS sustainably, we recommend further strengthening of human and social capital along with appropriate institutional support.},

Title = {Remote sensing for assessing the zone of benefit where deep drains improve productivity of land affected by shallow saline groundwater},

Abstract = {The installation of deep drains is an engineering approach to remediate land salinised by the influence of shallow groundwater. It is a costly treatment and its economic viability is, in part, dependent on the lateral extent to which the drain increases biological productivity by lowering water tables and soil salinity (referred to as the drains' zone of benefit). Such zones may be determined by assessing the biological productivity response of adjacent vegetation over time. We tested a multi-temporal satellite remote sensing method to analyse temporal and spatial changes in vegetation condition surrounding deep drainage sites at five locations in the Western Australian wheatbelt affected by dryland salinity-Morawa, Pithara, Beacon, Narembeen and Dumbleyung. Vegetation condition as a surrogate for biological productivity was assessed by Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the peak growing season. Analysis was at the site scale within a 1000 m buffer zone from the drains. There was clear evidence of NDVI increasing with elevation, slope and distance from the drain. After accounting for elevation, slope and distance from the drain, there was a significant increase in NDVI across the five locations after installation of deep drains. Changes in NDVI after drainage were broadly consistent with measured changes at each site in groundwater levels after installation of the deep drains. However, this study assessed the lateral extent of benefit for biological productivity and gave a measure of the area of benefit along the entire length of the drain. The method demonstrated the utility of spring NDVI images for rapid and relatively simple assessment of the change in site condition after implementation of drainage, but approaches for further improvement of the procedure were identified.

Abstract = {Mangroves are unique ecosystem found mainly in tropical coastal region in saline environment and under tidal influence. It has enormous ecological and economic value to the environment and local people. However, the problems are arising in tropical coastal region like Sundarban, where both natural and ever increasing anthropogenic activities have complicated the growth and development of mangroves. Therefore, spatio-temporal monitoring of mangroves has huge importance for their conservation in Sundarban World Heritage Site, the largest mangrove population in the world. Remote sensing has been proven as an important tool to monitor such ecosystem, but the traditional pixel based approach has several drawbacks. Recently, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach in remote sensing has helped to overcome such drawbacks. The present study attempts to analyse the status of mangroves over the time period of 40 years (1975-2015) in the study area using Landsat time series images through OBIA. The result reveals that the mangroves are gradually reducing over the last 40 years and about 4\% mangrove area has been converted into water. It is a major indication of increase in sea water level, making many islands vulnerable. The time series analysis in some islands, like Bhangaduni, Bulchery, Dalhousie and Halliday shows the land area as well as mangroves have been destroyed more than one-third. If the process continues at the same rate, these islands may soon completely disappear.},

Title = {System modelling of very low Earth orbit satellites for Earth observation},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {475-491},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The operation of satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO) has been linked to a variety of benefits to both the spacecraft platform and mission design. Critically, for Earth observation (EO) missions a reduction in altitude on can enable smaller and less powerful payloads to achieve the same performance as larger instruments or sensors at higher altitude, with significant benefits to the spacecraft design. As a result, renewed interest in the exploitation of these orbits has spurred the development of new technologies that have the potential to enable sustainable operations in this lower altitude range. In this paper, system models are developed for (i) novel materials that improve aerodynamic performance enabling reduced drag or increased lift production and resistance to atomic oxygen erosion and (ii) atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) for sustained drag compensation or mitigation in VLEO. Attitude and orbit control methods that can take advantage of the aerodynamic forces and torques in VLEO are also discussed. These system models are integrated into a framework for concept-level satellite design and this approach is used to explore the system-level trade-offs for future EO spacecraft enabled by these new technologies. A case-study presented for an optical very-high resolution spacecraft demonstrates the significant potential of reducing orbital altitude using these technologies and indicates possible savings of up to 75\% in system mass and over 50\% in development and manufacturing costs in comparison to current state-of-the-art missions. For a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, the reduction in mass and cost with altitude were shown to be smaller, though it was noted that currently available cost models do not capture recent commercial advancements in this segment. These results account for the additional propulsive and power requirements needed to sustain operations in VLEO and indicate that future EO missions could benefit significantly by operating in this altitude range. Furthermore, it is shown that only modest advancements in technologies already under development may begin to enable exploitation of this lower altitude range. In addition to the upstream benefits of reduced capital expense and a faster return on investment, lower costs and increased access to high quality observational data may also be passed to the downstream EO industry, with impact across a wide range of commercial, societal, and environmental application areas.},

Abstract = {A cost-benefit analysis defines the optimal monitoring technique to fight against tankers' illegal oil dumping in the sea: aerial inspection of maritime areas is compared with inspection using imperfect but costly satellite information to design aerial inspection, when polluters are fined if observed by a plane. We provide theoretical modeling and show that, at the equilibrium of the game between polluters and the monitoring agency, satellite information can decrease pollution, reduce monitoring costs, or both, depending an the social cost of pollution. We prove that the condition under which combining satellite and aerial observation dissuades more polluters than only relying on aerial monitoring does not depend on satellite information accuracy. A numerical example applies the model to the choice of the optimal monitoring technique over the Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) techniques and Geographical information system (GIS) applications, which provide more economical and time saving methods than ground-based measurements, have been widely used for earth observation and environmental assessments. Thus, consider Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, the present and past conditions of the coniferous species and land change that are within 100 meters away from the road alignment were evaluated to explain the changes in the road effect zone. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat images of the years between 2000 and 2015 were performed by using thresholds to estimate temporal and spatial changes of the coniferous species. The value of thresholds (0.45<NDVI<0.65) for the NDVI reflections from healthy coniferous species have been taken into consideration in summer season. Binary classification was applied for NDVI reflection values of productive coniferous forests (PcF) and degraded coniferous forests (DcF), and then comparisons were performed to investigate temporal and spatial changes. The results investigated that approximately 18 \% of the coniferous forests within the 100 m road buffer zone were turned into DcF. Beside beekeeping, grazing and social activities are defined as disturbances in research area. In conclusion, current roadside forestry applications and managements for road edges needs improved techniques and planning for sustainable management in forest road zones.},

Abstract = {Classically, remote sensing has been used as input data for land cover mapping. Through remote sensing studies at the University of New Brunswick Faculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, broader applications have been developed. These include: 1) fuel moisture mapping using optical and thermal infrared NOAA-AVHRR and MODIS images, as well as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (single-polarized images from ERS-1 and RADARSAT-1 and polarimetric images from RADARSAT-2); 2) determination of plant nitrogen and chlorophyll content using narrow-band hyperspectral data; and 3) imaging system applications in the wood industry. The third type of applications include: 1) mapping of internal wood features using X-ray computer tomography images, 2) monitoring of wood deformations using digital images acquired in the visible band, and 3) use of near-infrared spectroscopy to identify and sort wood by species, colour, physical properties, and surfacing/aging history. This last technology will also be used to determine lignin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose contents of wood products for value-added applications.},

Abstract = {Environment transformation is inevitable in the coastal lands of eastern China. It is a land characterized by rapid urbanization, which requires an objective method to evaluate environmental quality (EQ). In this study, a remote sensing-based theoretical research framework was used to create a synthetic remote sensing environmental index (RSEI). Then, spatio-temporal characteristics and transformation of EQ were evaluated by applying the RSEI to the coastal lands of Hangzhou Bay. Results demonstrated that: (1) the background value of the RSEI remained stable, but the standard deviation of the RSEI increased from 0.227 to 0.268 from 2000 to 2015; (2) the overall structure of EQ became polarized such that the two extreme grades (excellent and poor) increased by 13.000\%; and (3) the lands where prominent EQ changes occurred were in Yinzhou (improvement) and Pinghu (degradation) in Hangzhou Bay.},

Title = {Introduction to Space Systems for Meteorology},
Booktitle = {HANDBOOK OF SATELLITE APPLICATIONS,2ND EDITION},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {1161-1170},
Abstract = {The world's meteorological satellite systems are today vital to every nation in the world not only for reliable weather forecasts but also for key storm warnings and potential disaster alerts in the case of hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, monsoons, floods, and other violent and potentially lethal meteorological events. Since the advent of polar-orbiting and geosynchronous meteorological satellites, the ability to predict weather accurately and reliably, forever longer periods of time, has increased to a remarkable extent. With a diverse suite of sophisticated instruments, meteorological satellites also gather essential data for climate change studies as well. The first systems were pioneered by the USA and by NASA experimental satellites, but over time Europe, Russia, Japan, China, and India have evolved increased capabilities to monitor weather systems using increasingly sophisticated imaging systems. Today, this allows effective sharing of meteorological data on a global scale. The combination of polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites has allowed higher resolution images to be combined into accurate regional and global displays to see broad patterns of weather formations. New capabilities such as lightning intensity mapping have allowed greater capability to predict storm patterns in near real time and thus identify rapidly where the most violent and more energetic storm fronts are headed. The global sharing of meteorological data and the combined imaging of international meteorological satellites have not only greatly contributed to effective long range weather forecasting on land and in the oceans but have also allowed the collection of data to monitor longer-term conditions associated with climate change, global warming, and increases in aridity in some regions and increased rainfall in others. In short, meteorological satellites have evolved, particularly in the last decade, to serve an important role in not only short-to medium-term weather forecasting but also to provide important data with regard to national, regional, and global environmental assessment and analysis including the major ocean conditions known as La Nina and El Nino. The value of meteorological satellite systems and other Earth observation satellite systems for measuring the internationally recognized essential climate variables (ECVs) and for monitoring changes on land, oceans, and atmosphere is greatly increased when the acquired data is made available to national and international user organizations. A study by the International Academy of Astronautics recommends, among other things, that space agencies, companies, universities and nongovernmental organizations, and other international bodies already acting for the coordination of space agencies in the area of climate monitoring should work together to guarantee over time the continuous operational availability of the space sensors and datasets that are necessary for the monitoring of the space-observable ECVs (International Academy of Astronautics, in Study on Space Applications in Climate Change and Green Systems: The Need for International Cooperation, November 2010, eds. J.C. Mankins, M. Grimard, Y. Horikawa, ISBN EAN 9782917761113, pp. 15-21). Such cooperation is aimed at reinforcing the programmatic coordination of the Earth science programs worldwide, in the frame of institutions such as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), with the goal of guaranteeing the continuous long-term availability for all nations of all space-observable ECV, as defined by the global climate observing system (GCOS); and contribute to the elaboration and implementation of GEO data sharing principles (http://www.earthobservations.org/art\_015\_002.shtml). Despite patterns of data sharing and international cooperation with regard to data collection by meteorological satellite systems, there are limits to full disclosure of all satellite data. In particular, there remain certain areas of strategic concern in the context of possible military or defense-related use of meteorological and remote sensing data in the case of hostilities. It is partially because of these strategic and national defense-related concerns that so many different meteorological satellite systems have been deployed and why some parts of the imaging might be encrypted in a manner so that all data that is collected may not be in all instances fully shared. Despite these strategic concerns and interests, most meteorological satellite imaging data is today widely shared and global cooperation is quite universal. The areas of satellite communications, remote sensing, and satellite navigation have all - to some degree - evolved toward more commercialized economic models and thus have become more oriented to competitive markets. This is not to say that these other space applications services are fully commercialized since there are some well-defined military, defense, and governmental services for satellite communications, remote sensing, and satellite navigation that remain as ``publicly provided services.{''} In the case of meteorological satellites, however, these space applications remain almost entirely as governmental services. Despite discussions and analysis of how meteorological services might transition to commercial service providers within the USA, the provision of space-based meteorological services seems likely to remain as essentially a ``public good{''} and not completely commercialized in any spacefaring nation. Although many countries, private businesses, and individuals derive major benefits from meteorological satellite images, no viable economic model has yet evolved whereby these services might be fully commercialized. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), however, is currently evolving a new commercial space policy that mentions possible conditions whereby either ``hosted payloads{''} on commercial satellites or certain routine, operational space functions might be transferred to the commercial space sector -perhaps on a temporary basis. The particular focus in this regard refers to potential future gaps in US polar orbiting meteorological satellite coverage that could occur in 2017. This potential commercialization of some meteorological satellite services in the U.S. is discussed later in this section. In the chapters that follow specific information about various national and regional meteorological satellite systems will be presented. This introductory chapter provides a quick overview of the various systems that have evolved over time and some information perspective on how these systems are coordinated and work together through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the World Weather Watch (WWW) program ( World Meteorological Organization http://www.wmo.int/pages/index\_en.html also see ``Lessons Learned about the Integrated Global Observing Strategy through the World Weather Watch{''} http://www.un.org/earthwatch/about/docs/igusland.htm).},

Abstract = {Fragmentation of landscapes with conservation value is very important to show what their conditions in protected areas are. This kind of study is important for protected area management and for the situation of the biodiversity. This study is focused on mapping and assessment of three types of protected landscapes: forests, transitional woodland/shrub and alpine meadows using remote sensing data. The study area includes parts from South Pirin and Slavyanka. The aim is to show what is the current situation and what are the conditions of selected protected areas and what is the risk of landscape fragmentation. The landscape fragmentation tool (LFT v2.0) in GIS environment was used for mapping the fragmentation. The results show that protected areas are mainly not fragmented. It is clear from the spatial analysis that the territory with conditionally natural landscapes has a compact structure and the fragmentation of the habitats is very small.},

Abstract = {Gains and losses in ecosystem service values (ESV) in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province during rapid urbanization were analyzed in terms of land-use changes. Decision-making on coastal development based on ESV estimation is significant for the sustainable utilization of coastal resource. In this study, coastal land-use changes in Zhejiang Province during rapid urbanization were discussed based on remote-sensing derived land-use maps created in the years 1990, 2000 and 2010. The ESV changes in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province from 1990 to 2010 were estimated by using the established ESV estimation model. The analysis results demonstrate the following: (1) with the continuous acceleration of urbanization, land-use types in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province changed significantly from 1990 to 2010, demonstrated by considerable growth of urban construction land and reduction of forest land and farmland; (2) in the study period, the total ESV in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province continuously decreased in value from RMB 35.278 billion to 29.964 billion, a reduction of 15.06\%; (3) in terms of the spatial distribution of ESV, the ESVs in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province were generally converted from a higher ESV to a lower ESV; (4) estimates of ESV for the three years 1990, 2000 and 2010 appear to be relatively stable; and (5) land-use intensity in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province continuously increased during the 20 years. The spatial distribution of land-use intensity was consistent with that of the ESV change rate. Disordered land-use changes from forestland and farmland to urban construction land was a major cause of ESV loss.},

Journal = {CULTURAL TRENDS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-119},
Abstract = {In Canada, government initiatives for the measurement of cultural value can be traced to the 1949 Royal Commission on National Development in Arts, Letters and Sciences, and later evolved to include more empirical measurement with the Culture Statistics Program (1972) as well as research into the social dimensions of cultural investment. In 2009, Statistics Canada launched a four-year Feasibility Study to culminate in the creation of a Canadian Culture Satellite Account (CSA), an accounting framework to measure the impact of culture, the arts, heritage and sport on the Canadian economy. Taking account of both the recent and broader historical context out of which the CSA emerged, this paper examines its intended use and future plans. The CSA is a useful tool to the Government of Canada in supporting its activities related to the funding of culture, but this paper takes the position that it is not in and of itself a sufficient means for measuring the value of culture in Canada, and so it is best understood as part of a constellation of tools with differing but complementary approaches.},

Title = {Evaluating the utility of protected area status and conservation legislation in tropical forest conservation using satellite data: a case study of the great hornbill in Thailand},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Preserving wildlife and their environment from anthropogenic activities requires identification and establishment of protected areas, and monitoring of their long-term effects on wildlife and habitat. Tropical forests are one of the most at-risk habitats and many tropical species have become extinct recently due to human activity. It is imperative to monitor habitat in protected areas and without in order to identify strategies and legislative policies that optimize conservation outcomes. To this end, I quantified habitat fragmentation for the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) in Om Koi Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, pre- and post-establishment, within and outside the protected area, from 1973, 1985, and 1992, to assess the effectiveness of the protected area status, established in 1978, and a national logging ban, established in 1989, in preserving and restoring hornbill habitat. The results demonstrate that the establishment of Om Koi Wildlife Sanctuary did not decrease the rate of hornbill habitat fragmentation relative to areas outside the protected area. While the protected area had less fragmentation to begin with, protection status did not affect the rate of loss. Fragmentation increased significantly both inside and outside the protected area between the first and second time points (p < 0.05), after the protected area was first established. However, the national logging ban policy implemented in 1985 seems to have successfully halted the fragmentation of habitat within the protected area and surrounding unprotected areas, with all areas showing no significant change (p > 0.05). While not significant, the rate of fragmentation outside the protected area was greater. This suggests that the establishment of a protected area alone may not be sufficient to stop or reverse anthropogenic damage to endangered habitat and the species that utilize these environments. The incorporation of multiple strategies for management is likely needed to increase the ability of protected areas to preserve tropical forest species and habitats. The assessment of protected areas via satellite and ground-level data is an essential tool for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies and improving outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the experiences of mature students at a satellite campus of an English higher education institution. Twenty students over age 25 who fit various widening participation criteria were interviewed at four points during their first two years of bachelor's level study at a higher education (HE) centre in an area underserved by HE. Three aspects (familial, aspirational and social capital) of Yosso's model of community cultural wealth emerged as assets supporting students' success. Staying in their home communities allowed them to benefit from family and community networks, and their aspirations for their children fuelled their motivation. The study extends critical race theory to mature mostly white working-class students in English HE, contributing to policy debates about the role of satellite centres in supporting widening participation agendas. HEIs need to consider the capitals that mature students bring with them to their studies and how those support persistence.},

Abstract = {Arid regions of the world occupy up to 35\% of the earth's surface, the basis of various definitions of climatic conditions, vegetation types or potential for food production. Due to their high ecological value, monitoring of arid regions is necessary and modern vegetation studies can help in the conservation and management of these areas. The use of remote sensing for mapping of desert vegetation is difficult due to mixing of the spectral reflectance of bright desert soils with the weak spectral response of sparse vegetation. We studied the vegetation types in the semiarid to arid region of Mond Protected Area, south-west Iran, based on unsupervised classification of the Spot XS bands and then produced updated maps. Sixteen map units covering 12 vegetation types were recognized in the area based on both field works and satellite mapping. Halocnemum strobilaceum and Suaeda fruticosa vegetation types were the dominant types and Ephedra foliata, Salicornia europaea-Suaeda heterophylla vegetation types were the smallest. Vegetation coverage decreased sharply with the increase in salinity towards the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. The highest vegetation coverage belonged to the riparian vegetation along the Mond River, which represents the northern boundary of the protected area. The location of vegetation types was studied on the separate soil and habitat diversity maps of the study area, which helped in final refinements of the vegetation map produced.},

Title = {Integrating Cultural Ecosystem Services in an Ecosystem Satellite Account: A Case Study in the Gulf of Saint-Malo (France)},

Abstract = {This paper develops an accounting approach for estimating cultural ecosystem services. Ecosystem satellite accounts should be able to include cultural ecosystem services, which raise numerous assessment difficulties. A new assessment method is proposed, which uses the production for own use of households who carry out recreational activities depending on cultural ecosystem services. An application is carried out in the Gulf of Saint-Malo (France). A survey was implemented in order to collect the accounting data. Six recreational activities mixing the consumption of pure leisure (mainly sport) and marine cultural ecosystem services (mainly fishing and seascape watching) were considered: onshore fishing and shellfish gathering; hiking; recreational boating and offshore fishing; canoeing and kayaking; light sailing; scuba-diving and underwater fishing. The results show that the household production value for these six marine and coastal recreational activities in the Gulf of Saint-Malo ranges between 210 M and 276 M, contributing to 97\% of the output of recreational services for these activities. It means that the current national accounting system captures only 3\% of the output of marine recreational activities. About 82\% of production means are devoted to the consumption cultural ecosystem services, while the remaining part of the production value is assigned to the consumption of sportive services. Hence, the production value associated to the main uses of marine cultural ecosystem services can be estimated at between 172 and 226 M, with respective value-added of 110 M and 154 M. These results definitively point out the necessity of distinguishing recreational services which depend only on human activities from cultural ecosystem services which depend on outputs from ecosystem processes, in order to avoid over-estimating or confusing estimates of marine cultural ecosystem services.

Abstract = {The Yellow River Delta is the youngest large river delta in the world and is an important part of the national coordinated regional development strategy. In this paper, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, Landsat remote sensing images in the summer (June-September) of 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were selected to remove clouds and mask water body information. The median value is taken to synthesize the remote sensing images of each year and extract multiple indices of greenness, wetness, heatness, and dryness. Then integrate the population density data by principal component analysis to quickly construct an improved composite remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI). The results showed that the average contribution of the six indicators of greenness (NDVI and FVC), wetness (NDMI), heatness (LST), dryness (NDBSI), and population density (Pop) to the first principal component (PC1) was above 79\%, and the construction of an improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI) based on PC1 was feasible in the Yellow River Delta. In the past 20 years, the ecological and environmental quality of the Yellow River Delta has shown a continuous trend of improvement. The ecological environment quality has improved by 3570.95 square kilometers, accounting for 48.0\% of the total area, while the ecological environment quality has degraded by 712.99 square kilometers, accounting for only 9.6\% of the total area. The improved area is 38.4\% more than the degraded area, which shows that the ecological environment quality has improved in general. The ecological environment quality in Kenli County has improved the most. The ecological projects have been implemented in this area with the most obvious effect, and the investment in ecological environmental protection in this area should be continued or increased. The use of the GEE platform can obtain timely and accurate spatial and temporal patterns and evolution of ecological environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta, which is of great significance for ecological environmental protection and construction.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the work is caused by the need to track the changes in natural environment to anthropogenic impacts, especially in residential areas, and ensure proper valuation of land. The main aim of the study is substantiation of conceptual and technological foundations for creation of monitoring system of the land and the dynamics of the anthropogenic impact on the territory for mapping and cadastral valuation. The methods: interpretation of remote sensing data; route field observations on the reference test sites; method of landscape analysis; method of systemic mapping; analysis of thematic maps of different scale; cartometrics research based on geoinformation technologies. The results. The paper introduces the results of studying the nature of the changes of anthropogenic load on the landscapes of Sakhalin on the basis of cartometric analysis of forest-covered areas, logging, and residential areas by maps in scale 7:700000, published in the mid 1980-s and by space images transmitted from scanner Landsat-7, Landsat-8 with a resolution of 15-30 m. The authors identified the trends to change in the area of different types of landscapes and settlements in the island territory. Landscapes of the south of Sakhalin was subjected to change during the development of forest management, mining, water management. Valuable industrial forests in accessible areas are essentially heavily modified. However, forest management is possible under condition of ensuring environmental safety and reproduction of renewable forest resources in the region. Residential load in the South-Eastern part of Sakhalin is relatively low. The increase in the area of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is not due to multi-storey construction, but due to individual housing construction. The capabilities of ArcGIS allow assessing the growth of the urban area on individual areas of the city. Summary. The authors revealed that for the time between the topographic and space shooting, the residential load on plain type landscapes has increased almost throughout, and especially near residential zones of southern Sakhalin. Environment monitoring allows discovering quickly the effects on the ecosystem and carrying out the actions to reduce negative consequences.},

Abstract = {Variable rate technology nitrogen (VRT-N) application, a precision management approach to synchronize N input with crop demand, has received increasing attention in recent years. Although existing field trials have suggested the agronomic and environmental feasibility of VRT-N adoption, the potential benefits at large scale remain a puzzle to farmers and policy-makers, partly because no tools are available for aggregated assessments. In this study, we develop a scalable framework to support large-scale precision N management by fully leveraging recent advances in crop modeling, remote sensing, and publicly available weather and soil datasets. Using this new framework, we investigated the agronomic and environmental benefits of VRT-N application for corn compared to Uniform-N application across 9 states and ca. 2600 fields in the US Corn-Belt. Our results showed that, given an Extension-reported service fee of 6.2 USD\$/ha for applying N at variable rate, the multi-year averaged mean agronomic margin of adopting VRT-N were only 6.7 \$/ha more than Uniform-N. Accounting for the environmental cost of N leaching and N2O emission increased the mean benefit of VRT-N to 26.4 \$/ha. Agronomic benefits in general increased with the yield heterogeneity in field, and the mean value was driven by a small fraction of very heterogenous fields. Additional benefits from managing the temporal variability were 29.5 \$/ha and 51.6 \$/ha on average from an agronomic and environmental perspective, respectively. Environmental benefits are considerable but are unlikely to drive farmer adoption in the absence of new incentives for precision technologies. Although various uncertainties remain to be reduced, the current framework opens opportunity to ingest future improvements in models and geospatial datasets and could serve as a foundation for other precision management practices such as seeding rate and irrigation.},

Abstract = {Modern precision weed management relies on site-specific management tactics to maximize resource use efficiency and yield, while reducing unintended environmental impacts caused by herbicides. Scouting for weeds is an important activity to assist weed management decision making, and has been carried out by trained specialists through extensive and routine visual examination of the fields. Recent advancements in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)-based tools and geospatial information technology have created enormous applications for efficient and economical assessment of weed infestations as well as site-specific weed management. The utilization of UAS-based technologies for weed management applications is currently in its infancy, but this field has witnessed rapid growth in recent times in terms of aerial data acquisition and analysis. Challenges exist in UAS platform reliability, sensor capability and integration, image pre-processing, quantitative assessment and prediction, final product development, and product delivery. This review summarizes current knowledge on the utility of UAS platforms and remote sensing tools for weed scouting and precision weed management. Further, it critically examines potential opportunities and limitations to current UAS technologies, with particular emphasis on the lessons learned from UAS-based weed management research conducted at Texas A\&M University.},

Abstract = {Until recently, continuous monitoring of global vegetation productivity has not been possible because of technological limitations. This article introduces a new satellite-driven monitor of the global biosphere that regularly computes daily gross primary production (GPP) and annual net primary production. (NPP) at 1-kilometer (km) resolution over 109,782,756 km(2) of vegetated land surface. We summarize the history of global NPP science, as well as the derivation of this calculation, and current data production activity. Thefirst data on NPP from the EOS (Earth Observing System) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor are presented with different types of validation. We offer examples of how this new type of data set can serve ecological science, land management, and environmental policy. To enhance the use of these data by non-specialists, we are now producing monthly anomaly maps for GPP and annual NPP that compare the current value with an 18-year average value for each pixel, clearly identifying regions where vegetation growth is higher or lower than normal.},

Abstract = {The twentieth century has certain advantages Such as a higher standard of living for many, while it also has some problems like more polluted environment, the ruin of ecosystem and the devastated nature. Because of this reason, necessity of environment research increases gradually. Therefore in this thesis, suggest an information system for natural environment and ecosystem, also including maps services via internet. And the wide areas of environment narrows down natural environment and ecosystem in this thesis. This thesis represents the integrated 3D DEM using both the process of satellite image and the real value of topographic maps. This DEM is draped on satellite image processed to improve representations of the real world. The 3D visualization and 3D animation with satellite imagery data enables to depict more vivid and realistic world. This thesis also describes and implements the natural environmental/ecological information system that consists of 7 modules to systematically manage environmental data through an enhanced user interface. We use topographic map, satellite imagery data and several thematic maps. Each module has a user interface enabling to assist particular needs of decision-making, for ecological/environmental assessments associated with spatial analysis of ecosystem and classification of the environmental status quo and other purposes. In short, the implemented information system can not only supply environment information to the people through the related institution, the wild-life protection organization and national park but also improves quality of service. In addition, this system will be contributed to more efficient decision-making through the establishment of ecosystem grade.},

Abstract = {The Great Mekong Subregion (GMS) contains one of the world's largest tropical forests and plays a vital role in sustainable development and provides a range of economic, social and environmental benefits, including essential ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, the forest in this Subregion is experiencing deforestation rates at high level due to human activities. The reduction of the forest area has negative influence to the environmental and natural resources issues, particularly, more severe disasters have occurred due to global warming and the release of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, in order to conduct forest management in the Subregion efficiently, the Forest Cover and Carbon Mapping in Greater Mekong Subregion and Malaysia project was initialized by the Asia-Pacific Network for Sustainable Forest Management and Rehabilitation (APFNet) with the collaboration of various research institutions including Institute of Forest Resource Information Technique (IFRIT), Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAF) and the countries in Sub region and Malaysia comprises of Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (Yunnan province and Guangxi province), Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The main target of the project is to apply the intensive use of recent satellite remote sensing technology, establishing regional forest cover maps, documenting forest change processes and estimating carbon storage in the GMS and Malaysia. In this paper, the authors present the implementation of the project in Thailand and demonstrate the result of forest cover mapping in the whole country in 2005 and 2010. The result of the project will contribute towards developing efficient tools to support decision makers to clearly understand the dynamic change of the forest cover which could benefit sustainable forest resource management in Thailand and the whole Subregion.},

Title = {Cost benefit analysis of survey methods for assessing intertidal sediment disturbance: A bait collection case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {306},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Coastal management requires cost-effective, yet accurate, assessments of habitat condition, especially in areas protected by statutory conservation measures. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide alternatives to manned aircraft and walk-over (WO) surveys. To support coastal managers with method selection, we compare the costs and benefits of the three techniques using the extent of bait collection (sediment scarring from manual digging) on intertidal mudflats from three UK sites. UAV and WO surveys were conducted in parallel and aerial photography was downloaded from the Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO). Digging was digitised from estimations on foot (WO) or by manually labelling imagery with confidence assigned (UAV/CCO). Method efficacy is compared with respect to spatial coverage, control over survey time/location, spatial resolution, positioning accuracy, and area of digging detected. Personnel hours and up-front costs (e.g. training/equipment), costs for personnel time standardised by shore area, personnel risk, and environmental impact are also compared. Regarding efficacy, CCO imagery had extensive shore coverage compared to UAV and WO, however, assessments are restricted to times/locations with available imagery. Each method's resolution was sufficient to detect digging. WO achieved the highest resolution (on foot), but the lowest positioning accuracy, in contrast to accurate feature delineation on aerial imagery. An additive two-way ANOVA revealed a significantly higher percent area of `dug' sediment (all confidence levels) recorded by UAV than WO. CCO was the most cost-effective with no fieldwork/equipment costs. UAV had the highest up-front costs, but WO was more costly for personnel hours/ km2 for survey time and digitisation. For all methods, digitisation was the most time-consuming aspect. Compared to WO, UAV achieved rapid shore surveys and the CCO and UAV methods minimise personnel risks. UAV and WO both cause wildlife disturbance, with trampling an additional WO impact. With each method suited to sediment disturbance assessment, selection will depend on resources and objectives and will be aided by this holistic cost-benefit analysis. Cost-effectiveness will improve with evolving regulations that facilitate UAV use and technological developments (e.g. machine learning for disturbance detection) that could significantly expedite imagery analysis and enable broadscale assessments from CCO or satellite imagery.},

Abstract = {A prolonged drought in the western United States has resulted in alarming levels of mortality in conifer forests. Satellite remote sensing holds the potential for mapping and monitoring the effects of such environmental changes over large geographic areas in a timely manner. Results from the application of a forest canopy reflectance model using multitemporal Landsat TM imagery and field measurements, indicate conifer mortality can be effectively mapped and inventoried. The test area for this project is the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit in the Sierra Nevada of California. The Landsat TM images are from the summers of 1988 and 1991. The Li-Strahler canopy model estimates several forest stand parameters, including tree size and canopy cover for each conifer stand, from reflectance values in satellite imagery. The difference in cover estimates between the dates forms the basis for stratifying stands into mortality classes, which are used as both themes in a map and the basis of the field sampling design. Field measurements from 61 stands collected in the summer of 1992 indicate 15\% of the original timber volume in the true fir zone died between 1988 and 1992. The resulting low standard error of 11\% for this estimate indicates the utility of these mortality classes for detecting areas of high mortality. Also, the patterns in the estimated mean timber volume loss for each class follow the expected trends. The results of this project are immediately useful for fire hazard management, by providing both estimates of the degree of overall mortality and maps showing its location. They also indicate current remote sensing technology may be useful for monitoring the changes in vegetation that are expected to result from climate change.},

Abstract = {Natural and anthropogenic forcing factors and their changes significantly impact water resources in many river basins around the world. Information on such changes can be derived from fine scale in situ and satellite observations, used in combination with hydrological models. The latter need to account for hydrological changes caused by human activities to correctly estimate the actual water resource. In this study, we consider the catchment area of the Garonne river (in France) to investigate the capabilities of space-based observations and up-to-date hydrological modeling in estimating water resources of a river basin modified by human activities and a changing climate. Using the ISBA-MODCOU and SWAT hydrological models, we find that the water resources of the Garonne basin display a negative climate trend since 1960. The snow component of the two models is validated using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover extent climatology. Crop sowing dates based on remote sensing studies are also considered in the validation procedure. Use of this dataset improves the simulated evapotranspiration and river discharge amounts when compared to conventional data. Finally, we investigate the benefit of using the MAELIA multi-agent model that accounts for a realistic agricultural and management scenario. Among other results, we find that changes in crop systems have significant impacts on water uptake for agriculture. This work constitutes a basis for the construction of a future modeling framework of the sociological and hydrological system of the Garonne river region.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities, climate variability and environmental stresses have greatly affected forest ecosystems globally. Thus, monitoring of forest health is essential for proper planning and effective management. The present study employed an integrated approach of remote sensing and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to assess the forest health in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in India. Advanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, forest fragmentation, rainfall and soil types were derived from remote sensing data. Multiple buffer zones of villages, roads, railways and canals were also determined for analyzing the forest health status. These layers were prepared in the geographical information system. These layers were given weightage using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. These layers were integrated to prepare forest health map using weighted overlay method. The results revealed that the largest forest area was found under moderately healthy forest (37\%) followed by healthy forest (31\%) and unhealthy forest (13\%). Of the total area of the Reserve, 19\% area was under non-forest category. Human-induced disturbances such as encroachment, illegal sand mining, livestock grazing and forest conversion to agriculture have been attributed to the unhealthy forest in the Reserve. The receiver operating characteristic curve value and area under curve (0.792) show reliability of forest health map. The findings of this study may be helpful for forest managers, conservationists and local communities in devising sustainable strategies for effective management of the forest. The methodological framework adopted in this study may be utilized in other geographical regions interested in assessing forest health.},

Abstract = {For society to benefit fully from its investment in Earth Observation, the data must be accessible and familiar to a global community of users who have the skills, knowledge and understanding to use the observations appropriately in their work. Future `Environmental Data Scientists' will need to draw on multiple data and information sources, using data analysis, statistics and models to create knowledge that is communicated effectively to decision-makers in government, industry, and civil society. Networks, cloud computing and visualization will become increasingly important as citizen scientists, data journalists and politicians increasingly use Earth observation products to give their arguments and decisions scientific credibility. The overarching aim of Earth Observation education must therefore be to support life-long learning, allowing users at all levels to remain up-to-date with EO technologies and communication mechanisms that are relevant to their individual needs. Current and emerging methodologies for interactive education (such as ``MOOCs{''} and mobile learning), and hands-on engagement with real data (such as through citizen science projects) will be central to outreach, training and formal education in this field. To achieve this, it will be important to engage a wider community of experts from a range of disciplines, and to establish a comprehensive network of educators, technical experts, and content producers. It will also be important to encourage ``crowd-sourcing{''} of new contributions, to help maintain scientific and educational quality. A case study from the World Bank's Open Learning Campus illustrates the opportunities to influence thinking much beyond the environmental data scientist community.},

Title = {Navigating nature's toll: Assessing the ecological impact of the refugee crisis in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar's Rakhine state has resulted in a significant influx of refugees into Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. However, the ecological impact of this migration has received limited attention in research. This study aimed to address this gap by utilizing remote sensing data and machine learning techniques to model the ecological quality (EQ) of the region before and after the refugee influx. To quantify changes in land use and land cover (LULC), three supervised machine learning classification methods, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), were applied. The most accurate LULC maps obtained from these methods were then used to assess changes in ecosystem service valuation and function resulting from the land use changes. Furthermore, fuzzy logic models were employed to examine the EQ conditions before and after the Rohingya influx. The findings of the study indicate that the increased number of Rohingya refugees has led to a 9.58\% decrease in forest area, accompanied by an 8.25\% increase in settlement areas. The estimated total ecosystem services value (ESV) in the research area was \$67.83 million in 2017 and \$67.78 million in 2021, respectively. The ESV for forests experienced a significant decline of 21.97\%, equivalent to a decrease of \$5.33 million. Additionally, the reduction in forest lands has contributed to a 13.58\% decline in raw materials and a 14.57\% decline in biodiversity. Furthermore, utilizing a Markovian transition probability model, our analysis reveals that the EQ conditions in the area have deteriorated from ``very good{''} or ``good{''} to ``bad{''} or ``very bad{''} following the Rohingya influx. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of integrating ecological considerations into decision-making processes and developing proactive measures to mitigate the environmental impact of such large-scale migrations.},

Abstract = {Natural and anthropogenic forcing factors and their changes significantly impact water resources in many river basins around the world. Information on such changes can be derived from fine scale in situ and satellite observations, used in combination with hydrological models. The latter need to account for hydrological changes caused by human activities to correctly estimate the actual water resource. In this study, we consider the catchment area of the Garonne river (in France) to investigate the capabilities of space-based observations and up-to-date hydrological modeling in estimating water resources of a river basin modified by human activities and a changing climate. Using the ISBA-MODCOU and SWAT hydrological models, we find that the water resources of the Garonne basin display a negative climate trend since 1960. The snow component of the two models is validated using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover extent climatology. Crop sowing dates based on remote sensing studies are also considered in the validation procedure. Use of this dataset improves the simulated evapotranspiration and river discharge amounts when compared to conventional data. Finally, we investigate the benefit of using the MAELIA multi-agent model that accounts for a realistic agricultural and management scenario. Among other results, we find that changes in crop systems have significant impacts on water uptake for agriculture. This work constitutes a basis for the construction of a future modeling framework of the sociological and hydrological system of the Garonne river region.},

Abstract = {The circular economy (CE) has gained importance in the post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery. Businesses, while realising the CE benefits, have challenges in justifying and evaluating the CE benefits using available performance measurement tools, specifically when considering sustainability and other non-traditional benefits. Given the rising institutional pressures for environmental and social sustainability, we argue that organisations can evaluate their CE implementation performance using non-market-based environmental goods valuation methods. Further, the effectiveness of the CE performance measurement model can be enhanced to support supply chain sustainability and resilience through an ecosystem of multi-stakeholder digital technologies that include a range of emerging technologies such as blockchain technology, the internet-of-things (IoT), artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and tracking technologies. Accordingly, a CE performance measurement model (CEPMM) is conceptualised and exemplified using seven COVID-19 disruption scenarios to provide insights that can be addressed through CE practices. Analyses and implications are presented along with areas for future research.},

Abstract = {Water is a limited natural resource; therefore, continuous monitoring is required to develop methods and policies to support its sustainability. An approach like satellite radar altimetry is a powerful technique for monitoring water level variations. It was designed and developed for smooth surfaces such as the open ocean, but to some extent, it is now used to study the inland waters as well. The satellite radar altimetry coupled with passive remote sensing enabled the monitoring of continental surface water, such as inland seas, lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, by providing information about its water level, river discharge, lake extent, and its volume. This study estimated the monthly water balance of an ungauged lake, located in Pakistan, using satellite radar altimetry and passive remote sensing. The Manchar Lake is significant for its ecological, social, and economic value but is not monitored regularly and hence cannot be managed well. Due to the unavailability of gauge data, it is challenging to calculate Lake's water balance directly. The water levels from sentinel 3A combined with Landsat 8 derived lake surface areas were used to estimate changes in the lake's volume, which were used in the water balance equation. The primary inflows to the Lake are from Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD), Indus River, and runoff from hills. Whereas, the outflows are evaporation, groundwater recharge, and domestic and agricultural water use. This study provides Manchar Lake's monthly water balance from July 2016 to July 2019. An inconsistent and random water balance values are observed during the study period, with outflows exceeding inflows 40\% of the time. The Lake's ecosystem depends on the availability of sufficient water, and the negative water balance may cause a threatening situation. The approach and results may provide valuable information for water resource management of the Manchar Lake using satellite data, which has still existential issues of ground observations.},

Abstract = {The soon-to-be allocated 5G mobile technology using a 3.5 GHz frequency band has posed challenges because the spectrum of 3.5 GHz has utilized satellite services. By examining the case of Indonesia, this paper aims to investigate the social and economic aspects of two scenarios, i.e., implementing 5G using 3.5 GHz or retaining the use of the satellite for 3.5 GHz. The technological management method developed by Kano Models was used to assess the social aspect, and the net benefit was calculated to assess the economic aspect. The findings indicated that most existing services offered via satellite are in the attractive category, meaning that if such satellite services are eliminated, the market will not change significantly; however, implementing 5G at the frequency of 3.5 GHz would increase economic value due to the much higher license fee paid by the operators to the government.},

Title = {An environmental domain classification of Canada using earth observation data for biodiversity assessment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Broad ecosystem based classifications are increasingly applied as a context to consider, understand, and manage biodiversity. The need for more spatially explicit, repeatable, transferable, transparent, and defensible environmental regionalization has become apparent. increased computing power, sophisticated analysis software, and the availability of spatially explicit descriptions of the environment, principally derived from Earth observation data, have facilitated the development of statistical ecosystem regionalizations. These regionalizations are desired to produce environmentally unique ecoregions to provide the basis for stratification for ongoing biodiversity monitoring efforts. Using a suite of indicators of the physical environment, available energy such as vegetation production, and habitat suitability all derived from remote sensing technology at 1 km spatial resolution, we undertook an environmental regionalization using a two-stage multivariate classification of terrestrial Canada. A relatively large number of classes were initially derived (100) and a hierarchical clustering approach was then applied to derive a 40 level classification. These clusters where then used to assess which clusters were the most dissimilar to the majority thus providing indication of the most unique environmental domains across Canada. Secondly, a 14 class stratification was then produced to emulate the current ecozone stratification commonly used in Canada. Results indicated that a number of unique clusters exits across Canada, specifically the forest/urban-industrial/cropland mosaic in the southern portion of Ontario, the mixed wood forests in south-central Ontario and western Quebec, the foothills of south western Alberta, regions of the southern Arctic and the northern Boreal shield (particularly the areas south of Hudson Bay and Labrador). A resemblance between the 14 class stratification and the ecozone classification for Canada is evident; locations of within and between ecozone heterogeneity are also indicated. A critical key benefit of utilising ecoregions quantitatively using key indicators, such as those derived from remote sensing observations, is the capacity to establish, and quantify, how well particular networks of sites, or plot locations, represent the overall environment. As such, the incorporation of these types of methods, and remotely derived indicators, into biodiversity assessment is an important area of ongoing research. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) and Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) have been planned and funded by the NASA Earth Science Division. Both programs have a focus on engaging stakeholders and developing science useful for decision making. The resulting programs have funded significant scientific output and advancements in understanding how satellite remote sensing observations can be used to not just study how the Earth is changing, but also create data products that are of high utility to stakeholders and decisions makers. In this paper we focus on documenting thematic diversity of research themes and methods used, and how the CMS and ABoVE themes are related. We do this through developing a Correlated Topic Model on the 521 papers produced by the two programs and plotting the results in a network diagram. Through analysis of the themes in these papers, we document the relationships between researchers and institutions participating in CMS and ABoVE programs and the benefits from sustained engagement with stakeholders due to recurring funding. We note an absence of policy engagement in the papers and conclude that funded researchers need to be more ambitious and explicit in drawing the connection between their research and carbon policy implications in order to meet the stated goals of the CMS and ABoVE programs.},

Abstract = {Copernicus is the European Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme that delivers data and information to better understand the Earth and sustainable manage the environment. Based on the processing of environmental data collected from Earth observation Sentinel satellites, contributing missions and in situ sensors, Copernicus services provide near-real-time data on a global level. From 2008 up to 2020, the expected investment of the European Commission and the European Space Agency in the Copernicus programme is EUR 8.2 billion. Copernicus services transform satellite and in situ data into value-added information by processing and analysing data - data sets that have been collected over the years have become comparable and searchable. The Copernicus programme has six services (land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency, and security) that support the development of many applications by offering products to users in the geoinformatics sector through Geographic Information System (GIS). As of June 2018, Copernicus Data and Information Access Services are operational through five access platforms known as DIAS. Cloud-based platforms have been developed to facilitate and standardize access to Copernicus data and information. Because DIAS platforms provide mass storage and data processing services, users can access information from a singleentry point. The Copernicus programme provides and, in the future, will provide even more new business opportunities for development in many areas such as environmental protection, urban management, spatial planning, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, transport, climate change, tourism, etc.},

Title = {New land-cover maps of Ghana for 2015 using Landsat 8 and three popular classifiers for biodiversity assessment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Remote-sensing products provide opportunities to monitor complex phenomena on the Earth from space for good decision-making. An example is land-cover maps, which are useful for monitoring both human-and naturally induced environmental changes to enhance environmental management for the benefit of the society. Yet there are numerous critical areas of the world such as biodiversity hotspots where the inaccessibility of quality satellite images has hindered progress in our understanding and management of the natural environment. The West African biodiversity hotspot is one such area where persistent thick clouds in freely available satellite images has been a great discouragement to the production of local land-cover maps to monitor the ongoing deforestation and rapid environmental change. Ghana is a country in West Africa where no land-cover map (except global ones) has been published for over a decade although large tracts of land have been converted from their natural states to agricultural land. In this article, we present 30 m land-cover maps of the country using Landsat 8 images and three popular classifiers Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and random forest (RF) - for the year 2015. We produced these maps for use in our future biodiversity assessment in the region. An overall accuracy (OA) of 85.5\% (kappa = 0.77) was achieved for MLC, with similar but slightly lower accuracies for RF and SVM, which indicates that advanced classification algorithms may not have many advantages when applied to process only multispectral optical data. We observe that shrublands, crop-lands, and orchards are the dominant classes occupying 35.6\%, 31.9\%, and 18.4\% of the country's land area, respectively. This further indicates that >50.0\% of the country's land area is under agriculture. Thick forests occupy only 8.0\% of the land and are almost entirely confined to forest reserves, highlighting the usefulness of these nature reserves. Our maps will provide input for research advancement, policy formulation, and environmental management at both national and subnational levels.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in the upper Suha watershed in Enemay district, Gojjam, Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to assess land use/cover (LULC) change of the study area between 1986 and 2015 and to analyse its impact on selected ecosystem services. The LULC change was assessed by using Landsat Thematic Mapper(TM) 1986 and Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIS) 2015. The socio-economic survey was collected through key informant interviews and focus group discussion. The Landsat data were analysed using ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 (R) and ArcGIS 10.5 (R) softwares. The ecosystem services were estimated using the value transfer method. The results revealed that farmland, plantation forests and settlement increased by 18\%, 93\% and 125\%, respectively whereas natural forest, shrubland and grassland decreased by 54\%, 82\% and 16\%, respectively. The result also showed that the total ecosystem service value decreased from \$31.5 million in 1986 to \$24.36 million in 2015 mainly due to the decreasing areas of natural forest, shrubland and grasslands. The research results suggest that future land use planning should give emphasis on properly managing the natural and semi-natural vegetation that has high ecosystem service values.},

Title = {Developing Priority Observational Requirements from Space Using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory},

Abstract = {Over a two-year period beginning in 2015, a panel of subject matter experts, the Space Platform Requirements Working Group (SPRWG), carried out an analysis and prioritization of different space-based observations supporting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s operational services in the areas of weather, oceans, and space weather. NOAA leadership used the SPRWG analysis of space-based observational priorities in different mission areas, among other inputs, to inform the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT)-based value model and the NOAA Satellite Observing Systems Architecture (NSOSA) study. The goal of the NSOSA study is to develop candidate satellite architectures for the era beginning in approximately 2030. The SPRWG analysis included a prioritized list of observational objectives together with the quantitative attributes of each objective at three levels of performance: a threshold level of minimal utility, an intermediate level that the community expects by 2030, and a maximum effective level, a level for which further improvements would not be cost effective. This process is believed to be unprecedented in the analysis of long-range plans for providing observations from space. This paper describes the process for developing the prioritized objectives and their attributes and how they were combined in the Environmental Data Record (EDR) Value Model (EVM). The EVM helped inform NOAA's assessment of many potential architectures for its future observing system within the NSOSA study. However, neither the SPRWG nor its report represents official NOAA policy positions or decisions, and the responsibility for selecting and implementing the final architecture rests solely with NOAA senior leadership.},

Abstract = {Choice experiment surveys are commonly used to assess the general public's willingness to pay for different levels of environmental quality. However, respondents need to understand what they are valuing or they will make potentially wrong assumptions based on different experiences and frames of reference. Three-dimensional computer generated models or Virtual Environments (VE) have so far seen little use in economics research, probably due to the complexity and cost of developing and delivering them to study participants. The few studies that have used them find that VE are superior to static image presentations in helping people evaluate complex data. For this study we developed virtual environments for a choice experiment about coastal erosion management using free, easy-to-use software and Google Earth(C) satellite imagery and presented these to respondents as video tours. Our results indicate that the VE treatment reduced choice error, reduced left-right bias and improved respondent engagement and retention when compared with static images. There were also differences in WTP between the two groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Hazelnut has nutritional and economic value as an agricultural product. Hazelnut, mostly grown in Turkey, has not been planted in all agricultural areas, and the yield and the quality of hazelnut differentiate depending on place where it is grown. This can be a result of response of environmental conditions. In this study, recent hazelnut growth areas were determined by Remote Sensing techniques for Trabzon province of Turkey. By using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques, environmental data such as elevation, slope, aspect, geology, and soil data were produced and analyzed to examine environmental conditions on the growth areas of Turkish hazelnut. Spatial analysis shows that environmental and topographic differences affect the hazelnut growth. According to determined environmental conditions, potential hazelnut growth areas should be determined for effective agricultural plantation.},

Title = {Regional importance of crop yield constraints: Linking simulation models and geostatistics to interpret spatial patterns},

Abstract = {Over the next few decades, a central goal of agricultural research and policy will be to increase average regional crop yields in the face of diminished gains in genetic yield potential, likely climatic changes, decreased resource availability, and stricter environmental standards. Fundamental to the pursuit of effective investment strategies is an ability to quantify tradeoffs associated with potential policy and management changes. However, the data needed to predict regional yield responses to change, namely observations of yields and climatic, soil, and management conditions in farmers' fields, are often difficult to obtain. In this paper, we investigate the value of data on the spatial distribution of yields for understanding causes of landscape yield variability. Stochastic simulation models, which employ the CERES model to simulate crop yields across a landscape, are used to translate assumed spatial patterns of soil and management conditions into spatial pattern of yields. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to repeat this process for many different realizations of conditions, resulting in a modeled relationship between yield patterns and the relative importance of soil and management yield constraints, both of which can be computed in the controlled simulation environment. The derived relationship then allows one to infer from observed yield patterns the true proportion of yield variability explained by soil and management. This procedure was tested for wheat in the Yaqui Valley, an intensive agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico, where yield patterns have been previously estimated with remote sensing. Comparison of simulated and observed yield patterns indicated that roughly 80\% of spatial yield variance in 2001-2002 was attributable to management variations. The ability of simulation models to aid interpretation of landscape patterns is potentially invaluable for understanding yield constraints in many agricultural regions, where direct observations of soil and management variables are infeasible.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examines urban quality of life by assessing the relationship between observed socioeconomic conditions and urban forest amenities in Terre Haute, Indiana, USA. Using remote-sensing methods and techniques, and ordinary least squares regression, the paper determines the relationship between urban leaf area and a population density parameter with median income and median housing value. Results demonstrate positive correlations between urban leaf area, population density, and their interaction with median income and median housing value. Furthermore, leaf area, density, and their interaction statistically account for observed variance in median income and median housing value, indicating that these variables may be used to study observed quality-of-life metrics. The methods used in this study may be useful to city managers, planners, and foresters who are concerned with urban quality-of-life issues, and who are interested in developing and implementing alternative policy assessment regimes.},

Abstract = {Integrated hydrogen energy systems (IHESs) have attracted extensive attention in mitigating climate problems. As a kind of large-scale hydrogen storage device, underground hydrogen storage (UHS) can be introduced into IHES to balance the seasonal energy mismatch, while bringing challenges to optimal operation of IHES due to the complex geological structure and uncertain hydrodynamics. To address this problem, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based optimal scheduling method for underground space based IHES is proposed. The energy management problem is formulated as a Markov decision process to characterize the interaction between environmental states and policy. Based on DDPG theory, the actor-critic structure is applied to approximate deterministic policy and actor-value function. Through policy iteration and actor-critic network training, the operation of UHS and other energy conversion devices can be adaptively optimised, which is driven by real-time response data instead of accurate system models. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheduling method and the benefits of underground space are verified through time-domain simulations.},

Abstract = {The functions of wetlands are of significant value to social economy and ecology. However, in the past 50 years, wetlands in China have suffered severely from development pressure and are confronted with the threats of area loss. In recent years, assessment of wetland resources has aroused enormous attention, since it can further protect wetland resources and provide scientific basis for decision-makers. In this paper, wetland ecosystems are studied in terms of its ecological, social, and economic benefits, and integrated assessment system of the sustainability of the wetland resources of East Dongting Lake Nature Reserve has been built, adopting DELPHI method, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and PSR model. First, an index system of integrated assessment of wetland resources was constructed, and the indexes involve the following five aspects, ecological environment, safeguard system, reasonable utilization of wetlands, social culture and economic system. An index system of integrated assessment for wetland resources established was composed of 5 subsystems, with 34 indicators involved. By conducting field investigation in East Dongting Lake and by performing remote sensing data processing, an integrated assessment score of 1.035 was given to East Dongting Lake. Finally, a general analysis of the study area was given and a few countermeasures were suggested.},

Abstract = {The Black Sea catchment is internationally known as one of ecologically unsustainable development and inadequate resource management, which has led to severe environmental, social and economic problems. The EnviroGRIDS @ Black Sea Catchment project addresses these issues by bringing several emerging information technologies that are revolutionizing the way we are able to observe our planet. The Group on Earth Observation Systems of Systems (GEOSS) is building a data-driven view of our planet that feeds into models and scenarios to explore our past, present and future. EnviroGRIDS aims at building the capacity of scientist to assemble such a system in the Black Sea Catchment, the capacity of decision-makers to use it, and the capacity of the general public to understand the important environmental, social and economic issues at stake. EnviroGRIDS will particularly target the needs of the Black Sea Commission (BSC) and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) in order to help bridging the gap between science and policy. This will allow the project to benefit from an existing large network of potential end-users and national authorities. In return these commissions will be able to use the results of the EnviroGRIDS project to accomplish their mission. EnviroGRIDS objectives, in particular, match perfectly those of the Black Sea Commission, enabling it to become a central piece of information system in the region. EnviroGRIDS will also build a strong collaboration with the new PEGASO project on integrated coastal zone management in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Indeed, understanding the relationships between the expected changes in the catchment area and the ongoing development of coastal zones is of crucial importance for the future of the Black Sea region.},

Title = {Assessing the Welfare Impacts of Forest Ecosystem Service Management Policies and Their Distributional Rules},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Community based management (CBM) is widely advocated as an effective method for governing and managing ecosystem services (ES). However, the distributional rules and maximum harvesting levels are likely to affect both the effectiveness of CBMs in maintaining ES and the fairness and equity of access to these ES. This article proposes a methodological approach for investigating normative trade-offs involved in CBM of forests, where forest conservation objectives need to be traded off against livelihoods objectives. The study uses remote sensing methods to quantify forest ES supply in Namizimu Forest Reserve in Malawi, and links this to demand for ES within the villages near the reserve. It then investigates how a plausible set of CBM rules can be developed to cap consumption of forest products to sustainable amount and quantifies, by using monetary valuation techniques, how these set of rules may affect the total well-being of local population. Our results demonstrate that, due to the spatial mismatches between demand and supply, the distribution of provisioning ES to the population across the harvesting area is unequal in biophysical terms. The current available stock of forest products is sufficient to cover the current demand, however, it is higher than the mean annual increment indicating that this level of consumption is ecologically unsustainable and will lead to forest degradation as shown under the business-as-usual scenario. We then examined the impact of governance and how CBM rules to allocate forest ES to different social groups (poor and rich) under a co-management regime will affect total societal welfare. We found that the distributional scenario that maximises total societal welfare expressed in monetary terms across the whole harvesting area is the scenario that distributes 40\% of biomass to the rich group while the remaining 60\% is allocated to the poor group. However, this scenario maximises Willingness to Pay (WTP) at total level but does not maximise WTP in each sub-area of forest but just for those that have a high availability for biomass. This indicates that the distributional rules that maximise total welfare at aggregate level may not maximise welfare at local level where constraints from biomass availability require to restrict further the distribution of forest products. When biomass availability is low, total societal welfare is maximised with distributional rules that distribute more trees to richer. Yet, a policymaker may choose a distributional rule that distribute more trees to the poor on normative grounds and forego the objective of maximising total welfare. In such cases the WTP analysis outlined in this paper can support the policymaker in choosing the distributional rule that minimise trade-offs between efficiency, i.e., maximising total welfare, and livelihoods objectives.},

Abstract = {Small satellites bring new capabilities to space-based missions. They offer users the capability of having less expensive satellites that may provide users with information as single entities or as constellations. The ability to have a satellite that may be launched for opportunistic missions must be balanced against the risks associated with the more COTS based components often used in such satellites. However, the savings achieved by using COTS can very quickly be offset by the expense of validating the reliability of the components using conventional larger satellite concepts. Therefore, there needs to be a new paradigm that assesses risk for small satellites that is congruent with the costs and responsiveness of small satellites. This paper proposes the use of the economic quantity of utility as this measure.},

Abstract = {``Lameiros{''} are ancestral semi-natural meadows, essential elements of mountain landscapes in Northern Portugal. In the ``lameiros{''} a traditional irrigation system is used and water is applied all year around. They are mainly used for forage production for autochthonous bovine feeding, but they are also important for the water and nutrients cycle regulation, erosion control and as barrier to forest fires propagation. Although recognized for their economical, environmental, landscaping, cultural and genetic value, the perpetuation of these ``lameiros{''} could be at risk, at medium term, due to human desertification in the mountain regions and to the announced constraints in use of water resources. To preserve these landscapes it is essential to know them better and to better characterize them. Therefore a monitoring program using remote sensing tools is now being developed to evaluate different patterns of ``lameiros{''}, and their spatial extent and evolution. Two important questions are determinant in this program: the selection of the most appropriate spatial resolution for monitoring ``lameiros{''}, and the availability of satellite historical data. In this context, NDVI were compared in two selected test sites, with and without full irrigation. Data were derived from several field campaigns with a spectroradiometer and using different sensors: i) Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 (30m pixel), ii) SPOT 4 and SPOT 2 (20m pixel), iii) SPOT 5 (10m pixel). The NDVI temporal series produced were evaluated considering ``lameiros{''} management and weather data. Results obtained so far indicate that the SPOT images provide data at the most adequate scale.},

Title = {Using NASA Earth observations and Google Earth Engine to map winter cover crop conservation performance in the Chesapeake Bay watershed},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {248},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Winter cover crops such as barley, rye, and wheat help to improve soil structure by increasing porosity, aggregate stability, and organic matter, while reducing the loss of agricultural nutrients and sediments into waterways. The environmental performance of cover crops is affected by choice of species, planting date, planting method, nutrient inputs, temperature, and precipitation. The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) oversees an agricultural cost-share program that provides farmers with funding to cover costs associated with planting winter cover crops, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) have partnered with the MDA to develop satellite remote sensing techniques for measuring cover crop performance. The MDA has developed the capacity to digitize field boundaries for all fields enrolled in their cover crop programs (> 26,000 fields per year) to support a remote sensing performance analysis at a statewide scal,e and has requested assistance with the associated imagery processing from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, scripts were developed to process Landsat 5/7/8 and Harmonized Sentinel-2 imagery to measure winter cover crop performance. We calibrated cover crop performance models using linear regression between satellite vegetation indices and USGS / USDA-ARS field sampling data collected on Maryland farms between 2006 and 2012 (1298 samples). Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values showed significant correlation with the natural logarithm of cover crop biomass (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.56) and with observed percent vegetative ground cover (p <= 0.01, R-2 = 0.68). The GEE scripts were used to composite seasonal maximum NDVI values for each enrolled cover crop field and calculate performance metrics for the winter and spring seasons of three enrollment years (2014-15, 2015-16, and 2017-18) for four Maryland counties. Results from winter 2017-18 demonstrate that rye and barley fields had higher biomass than wheat fields, and that early planting, along with planting methods that increase seed-soil contact, increased performance. The processing capabilities of GEE will support the MDA in scaling up remote sensing performance analysis statewide, providing information to evaluate the environmental outcomes associated with various agronomic management strategies. The tool can be modified for different seasonal cutoffs, utilize new sensors to capture phenology in winter and spring, and scale to larger regions for use in adaptive management of winter cover crops planted for environmental benefit.},

Title = {A long-term and comprehensive assessment of urbanization-induced impacts on ecosystem services in the capital city of India},
Journal = {CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Globally, the present rate of urbanization in mega-urban centers is altering ecosystem functions and resultant ecosystem services of the landscapes. The natural and semi-natural ecosystems within the urban regions are under threat of loss and degradation. Estimating the economic values of the ecosystem services obtained from these natural and semi-natural ecosystems can play an important role in urban policy and decision making. The main objective of this paper is to quantify the changes in ecosystem service values (ESVs) in response to land use land cover (LULC) dynamics and urbanization in the capital city of India, Delhi. Using satellite imageries over the past two decades (1998-2018) we show the estimated changes in ESVs with the global value coefficient (VC) of proximate biomes. The study relies on benefit transfer approach of ESs valuation wherein the ESVs of proximate biomes, derived from one/multiple study site, are used in assessing ESVs at another site. For determining the reliability of the study, a sensitivity analysis is performed to check the effectiveness of VC. The results show a total decline of ecosystem services (ESs) in monetary terms by US\$ 7.614 million ha(-1) year(-1) from 1998 to 2018 with prominent changes in LULC. The change analysis shows a loss (US\$ 3.6141 million) of regulatory and provisional services. The prominent part (US\$ 2.675 million) of this loss was due to decline in city forest cover by 6426.09 ha. The city has benefitted from initiatives in implementation of bio-diversity parks and plantation drives, but also suffers widespread loss of forest over the years. The ESs monitoring at the city administrative divisions (i.e. district-wise) highlights the importance of conservation of natural ecosystems within the urban area with distribution equity. The results provide insights that should be considered for urban planning in order to protect natural resources, ESs, and thus overall well-being of residents.},

Abstract = {This study emphasizes the use of remote sensing parameters NDVI and LST to identify decadal change of three different years 1999, 2009, and 2019 in green cover in Dehradun city. Data analysis was done by using satellite imagery Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 TM. The relationship between NDVI and LST are inversely proportional. The result shows the continuous decrease in green cover with an increase in temperature over the time of Dehradun city. From this study, we came to know that the area under NDVI (Very High) value is decreasing from 10\% in the year 1999 to 3.7\% in the year 2009 and further 0.6\% in the year 2019 and in contrast, the area under LST range(>35 degrees C) is increasing from 1.68\% in the year 1999 to 16.55\% in the year 2009 and finally reaches to 39.75\% in the year 2019. This results in environmental damage of Dehradun city over the time period. This study helps the decision makers of different organizations who want to do urban planning, climate change analysis, and forest fire risk management study in reducing sustainable damage.},

Abstract = {Information provided by satellite data is becoming increasingly important in the field of agriculture. Estimating biomass, nitrogen content or crop yield can improve farm management and optimize precision agriculture applications. A vast amount of data is made available both as map material and from space. However, it is up to the user to select the appropriate data for a particular problem. Without the appropriate knowledge, this may even entail an economic risk. This study therefore investigates the direct relationship between satellite data from six different optical sensors as well as different soil and relief parameters and yield data from cereal and canola recorded by the thresher in the field. A time series of 13 years is considered, with 947 yield data sets consisting of dense point data sets and 755 satellite images. To answer the question of how well the relationship between remote sensing data and yield is, the correlation coefficient r per field is calculated and interpreted in terms of crop type, phenology, and sensor characteristics. The correlation value r is particularly high when a field and its crop are spatially heterogeneous and when the correct phenological time of the crop is reached at the time of satellite imaging. Satellite images with higher resolution, such as RapidEye and Sentinel-2 performed better in comparison with lower resolution sensors of the Landsat series. The additional Red Edge spectral band also has advantage, especially for cereal yield estimation. The study concludes that there are high correlation values between yield data and satellite data, but several conditions must be met which are presented and discussed here.},

Abstract = {The geographical location of Mauritius near the warm tropical waters of the Indian Ocean coupled to the vast exclusive economic zone approximating 2.3 million square kilometers, encourage the promotion of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems. Technological advancements have enabled offshore structures to pump the cold water lying at 1000m depth in the seawater column to the surface, and through the temperature difference set up with the warm surface layer, drives a turbine and generates electricity. In this study, a model has been developed to compute the temperature difference between the deep (1000m) and surface (20m) seawater layers around Mauritius. An algorithm has been implemented to determine the net power generated from a proposed OTEC power plant, acquired through the processing of sea surface temperature satellite images, at a resolution of 1 km. The spatial and temporal variations of the net power generated has been observed by splitting the annual data into four monsoonal time frames. Results show that the south-western region of Mauritius possesses high OTEC resources, with annual mean daily net power generation capacity of about 95MW, representing about 20\% of the peak power demand of the island. Moreover, the bathymetry of the southern region is propitious due to deep cold water availability at a proximity of less than 5km from the coastline. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the OTEC system are found to be 1.9 and 22.8\%, respectively. A cost-benefit analysis indicates that profits of the order of 4.5 times the initial investment can be generated.},

Title = {Viable contribution of Tibetan sacred mountains in southwestern China to forest conservation},

Abstract = {The Tibetan sacred mountains (TSMs) cover a large area and may represent a landscape-scale conservation opportunity. We compared the conservation value of forests in these mountains with the conservation value of government-established nature reserves and unmanaged open-access areas in Danba County, southwestern China. We used Landsat satellite images to map forest cover and to estimate forest loss in 1974-1989, 1989-1999, and 1999-2013. The TSMs (n = 41) and nature reserves (n = 4) accounted for 21.6\% and 29.7\% of the county's land area, respectively. Remaining land was open-access areas (i.e., areas without any restrictions on resource use) (56.2\%) and farmlands (2.2\%). Within the elevation range suitable for forests, forest cover did not differ significantly between nature reserves (58.8\%) and open-access areas (58.4\%), but was significantly higher in TSMs (65.5\%) after controlling for environmental factors such as aspect, slope, and elevation. The TSMs of great cultural importance had higher forest cover, but patrols by monastery staff were not necessarily associated with increased forest cover. The annual deforestation rate in nonsacred areas almost tripled in 1989-1999 (111.4 ha/year) relative to 1974-1989 (40.4 ha/year), whereas the rate in TSMs decreased in the later period (19.7 ha/year vs. 17.2 ha/year). The reduced forest loss in TSMs in 1989-1999 was possibly due to the renaissance of TSM worship and strengthened management by the local Buddhist community since late 1980s. The annual deforestation rate in Danba decreased dramatically to 4.4 ha/ year in 1999-2013, which coincided with the implementation of a national ban on logging in 1998. As the only form of protected area across the Tibetan region during much of its history, TSMs have positively contributed to conserving forest at a landscape scale. Conservation of TSM forests largely relied on the strength of local religious institutions. Integrating community-based conservation of TSMs within the government conservation network would benefit the conservation of the Tibetan region.},

Title = {A Bayesian Deep Image Prior Downscaling Approach for High-Resolution Soil Moisture Estimation},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {4571-4582},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) estimation is a critical part of environmental and agricultural monitoring, with satellite-based microwave remote sensing being the main SM source. However, the limited spatial resolution of most current remote sensing SM products reduces their utility for many applications, such as evapotranspiration modeling and agriculture management. In this article, to address this issue, we propose a Bayesian deep image prior (BDIP) downscaling approach to estimate the high-resolution SM from satellite products. More specifically, the high-resolution SM estimation problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem, and solved via a neural network comprising of a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for modeling the prior spatial correlation distribution of the underlying high-resolution SM variables, and a forward model characterizing the SM map degeneration process for modeling the data likelihood. As such, the proposed BDIP approach provides a statistical framework that integrates deep learning with forward modeling in a coherent manner for combining different sources of information, i.e., the knowledge in the forward model, the spatial correlation prior in FCNN architecture, and the remote sensing data and products. Experiments on the downscaling of SM active passive SM products using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products show that SM maps estimated using the proposed method provide greater spatial detail information than other downscaling methods, with the SM estimates very close to in situ measurements.},

Title = {Study on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Ecosystem Service Values and Driving Mechanism in the Yan River Basin from 1990 to 2020},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Ecological and environmental degradation are among the major challenges facing humanity today. The analysis of ecosystem service value assessments can therefore serve as a means to guide ecosystem restoration, as well as provide indications for sustainable land use and land management decisions. The present study examines changes in land use and the associated ecosystem service values in the Yan River Basin in China for the period of 1990-2020. Based on high-resolution Landsat satellite data, we obtained detailed land type distribution data for the basin, allowing the analysis of the internal structure and the degree of influence of the land use by using information entropy and elasticity coefficient. We also explored the spatiotemporal differentiation of ESVs by applying the method of equivalent factors and hotspot analysis. Finally, we identified possible drivers for development patterns observed in the watershed using geodetector models. During the study period, the area of arable land dropped continuously, while the scope of forest land, grassland, and construction land increased. The land type layout developed in the direction of reduced uniformity. ESVs measured in monetary terms first rose and later fell, but nevertheless increased by 1.152 billion yuan overall. The decrease was mainly due to the accelerated urbanization construction in the later stage. Spatially, ESV distribution coincided with the land-use pattern, showing a growing pattern from north to south. The changes were due not to the role of a single factor but the joint interactions between multiple factors such as human activities, natural factors, and landscape patterns. The results can provide a basis for constructive suggestions to connect and promote the basin's natural and socio-economic surroundings, and also reflect the effectiveness of the policy of systematically stopping cultivation and planting trees and grass on stunted cultivated land.},

Abstract = {The 1992 Earth Summit and its message of sustainable development drove the launching of a System for integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting, the SEEA. Since then, sustainable development and the SEEA have given way to green growth and green economy indicators in the latest 2012 Summit. A lengthy revision process has now produced a curtailed SEEA central framework. The new framework focuses on expenditures for environmental protection and resource management, and stocks and flows of economic resources; both are covered by the conventional national accounts. Environmental degradation, notably from pollution, is left to experimental ecosystem accounts. Further revision of the SEEA should reverse this retrenchment from integrative environmental-economic accounting. A comprehensive satellite system, rather than a limited statistical standard, might put the SEEA back on the policy agenda.},

Abstract = {Cyclone is one of the major coastal hazards affecting the Indian coastline bringing floods and widespread damage due to rain, storm surges and heavy winds. Hence, coastal risk assessment is essential to identify the threats to the land and population, from cyclones. The risk assessment has been carried out in northern coast of Tamil Nadu, India, for the stretch from Kattivakkam to Kovalam. Risk is the probability of expected losses from a given hazard and it varies according to the vulnerability of the region. The risk assessment has been structured in four components, namely, Environmental Vulnerability, Social Vulnerability, Hazard Potential and Mitigation Capacity. The thematic layers and hazard maps are created using Satellite data and Geographic Information System. Coastal risk indices are generated for each component of risk using Analytic Hierarchy Process. Based on the index value, the level of risk is mapped and the results help in faster and appropriate decision making.},

Abstract = {A Geographic Information System (GIS) is defined as a computer based tool useful for capturing, storing, retrieving and manipulating, displaying and querying both spatial and non-spatial data about given areas to generate various planning scenarios for decision making. On the other hand, an Urban Management Information System (UMIS) is an economic resource that can benefit decision makers in the planning, development, and management of urban projects and resources using statistical data such as social, economic, demographic, housing and health data. Since Internet technology reduces the cost of data management and information distribution to mass usages as in UMIS, web based systems are mostly used for a UMIS applications throughout the world. Nowadays, the number of satellite cities is rapidly increasing in Turkey, especially in Istanbul. A satellite city for Istanbul can be defined as a mini city established outside Istanbul that has its own shopping centers, schools, social clubs, cinemas, restaurants, etc. Though it is not a municipality by itself, it needs to conform to the requirements of both the municipality it belongs to and its management. In this study, a prototype web-GIS based UMIS is developed for satellite cities. The system integrates the digital base map and statistical data of a satellite city that can be input through a user-interface and offers a variety of querying and reporting options. The developed system is tested for one satellite city in Istanbul and the results showed that it is promising as a starting system for other similar applications.},

Abstract = {Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are often conducted to evaluate the worth of existing data and data yet to be collected from proposed new missions. As missions increasingly require a broader Earth systems focus, it is important that the OSSEs capture the potential benefits of the observations on end-use applications. Toward this end, the results from the OSSEs must also be evaluated with a suite of metrics that capture the value, uncertainty, and information content of the observations while factoring in both science and societal impacts. This article presents a soil moisture OSSE that employs simulated L-band measurements and assesses its utility toward improving drought and flood risk estimates using the NASA Land Information System (LIS). A decision-theory-based analysis is conducted to assess the economic utility of the observations toward improving these applications. The results suggest that the improvements in surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and total runoff fields obtained through the assimilation of L-band measurements are effective in providing improvements in the drought and flood risk assessments as well. The decision-theory analysis not only demonstrates the economic utility of observations but also shows that the use of probabilistic information from the model simulations is more beneficial compared to the use of corresponding deterministic estimates. The experiment also demonstrates the value of a comprehensive modeling environment such as LIS for conducting end-to-end OSSEs by linking satellite observations, physical models, data assimilation algorithms, and end-use application models in a single integrated framework.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on flood risk analysis and risk prevention in Santiago de Chile. It presents a conceptual framework for flood risk analysis in urban areas and demonstrates the utility of a mixed set of methods, including remote sensing and GIS techniques, to improve the methodological basis for flood risk assessment and risk prevention. Population growth and land-use changes are analysed as key elements of urban development and indicators of flood risk production. A conceptual framework comprising the core elements of exposure, elements at risk and vulnerability serves as a tool for risk analysis and risk assessment, and is applied to the municipalities of La Reina and Penalolen. The chapter reviews existing institutional responses to land-use and risk management and, based on expert interviews, detects their deficits. As a conclusion, recommendations to improve flood risk prevention in Santiago de Chile are made. The absence of a systemic view of flood risk resulting from complex ecological and social processes is the chief weakness of current risk prevention in Santiago de Chile.},

Abstract = {This study was an attempt to analyse the regional environmental quality with the application of remote sensing, geographical information system, and spatial multiple criteria decision analysis and, to project a quantitative method applicable to identify the status of the regional environment of the study area. Using spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) approach with expert knowledge in this study, an integrated regional environmental quality index (REQI) was computed and classified into five levels of regional environment quality viz. worse, poor, moderate, good, and very good. During the process, a set of spatial criteria were selected (here, 15 criterions) together with the degree of importance of criteria in sustainability of the regional environment. Integrated remote sensing and GIS technique and models were applied to generate the necessary factors (criterions) maps for the SMCE approach. The ranking, along with expected value method, was used to standardize the factors and on the other hand, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was applied for calculating factor weights. The entire process was executed in the integrated land and water information system (ILWIS) software tool that supports SMCE. The analysis showed that the overall regional environmental quality of the area was at moderate level and was partly determined by elevation. Areas under worse and poor quality of environment indicated that the regional environmental status showed decline in these parts of the county. The study also revealed that the human activities, vegetation condition, soil erosion, topography, climate, and soil conditions have serious influence on the regional environment condition of the area. Considering the regional characteristics of environmental quality, priority, and practical needs for environmental restoration, the study area was further regionalized into four priority areas which may serve as base areas of decision making for the recovery, rebuilding, and protection of the environment.},

Title = {Assessing the provisioning potential of ecosystem services in a Scandinavian boreal forest: Suitability and tradeoff analyses on grid-based wall-to-wall forest inventory data},

Abstract = {Determining optimal forest management to provide multiple goods and services, also referred to as Ecosystem Services (ESs), requires operational-scale information on the suitability of the forest for the provisioning of various ESs. Remote sensing allows wall-to-wall assessments and provides pixel data for a flexible composition of the management units. The purpose of this study was to incorporate models of ES provisioning potential in a spatial prioritization framework and to assess the pixel-level allocation of the land use. We tessellated the forested area in a landscape of altogether 7500 ha to 27,595 pixels of 48 x 48 m(2) and modeled the potential of each pixel to provide biodiversity, timber, carbon storage, and recreational amenities as indicators of supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ESs, respectively. We analyzed spatial overlaps between the individual ESs, the potential to provide multiple ESs, and tradeoffs due to production constraints in a fraction of the landscape. The pixels considered most important for the individual ESs overlapped as much as 78\% between carbon storage and timber production and up to 52.5\% between the other ESs. The potential for multiple ESs could be largely explained in terms of forest structure as being emphasized to sparsely populated, spruce-dominated old forests with large average tree size. Constraining the production of the ESs in the landscape based on the priority maps, however, resulted in sub-optimal choices compared to an optimized production. Even though the land-use planning cannot be completed without involving the stakeholders' preferences, we conclude that the workflow described in this paper produced valuable information on the overlaps and tradeoffs of the ESs for the related decision support.

Number = {5},
Pages = {521-530},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to document a case study of a disaster in Bangladesh and the role of an information management system for disaster management planning. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a methodology that considers perceptions or constructions including the role of information systems to be dependent on the social and cultural structures, which is helpful in reducing destruction in disaster-prone areas. Findings - Advances in information technology in the form of the internet, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, satellite communication, etc. are beneficial in many aspects of the planning and implementation of hazard reduction arrangements. Research limitations/implications - Natural disasters strike countries, both developed and developing, cause enormous destruction and create human suffering, and have negative impacts on national economies. Bangladesh suffers regularly and frequently from disasters like floods, cyclone storms, tidal surges, river bank erosion and earthquakes. Practical implications - Incorporating knowledge of information management system is becoming increasingly important in the derivation of management solutions for disasters. Originality/value - Information systems including GIS, communication technology, other information retrieval and information management systems should be maintained during natural disasters to reduce the cost and time for contingency. In this paper, an attempt is made to highlight the role of information technology in the management of natural disasters in Bangladesh.},

Title = {Decommissioning vs. reusing offshore gas platforms within ethical decision-making for sustainable development: Theoretical framework with application to the Adriatic Sea},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {199},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This paper integrates ethics into decision-making for sustainable development to help planners choose between decommissioning and reuse of an offshore gas platform within a social perspective. To do so, I match multi-criteria analysis (MCA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), weighted life-cycle assessment (WLCA), and monetary life-cycle assessment (MLCA) to four main ethical standpoints: MCA for duty to the current generation by minimising impacts (strong sustainability in a linear economy), WLCA for duty to the current and future generations by minimising impacts (strong sustainability in a circular economy), CBA for duty to the current generation by maximising welfare (weak sustainability in a linear economy), and MLCA for duty to the current and future generations by maximising welfare (weak sustainability in a circular economy). Analytical results demonstrated that reuse of the platforms is more suitable than decommissioning in a linear economy. Thus, the decision on decommissioning vs. reuse is primarily a matter of inter-generational equity. Numerical results with non-marginal assessments for a case study in the Adriatic Sea suggested that support for reuse of the platform is 100\% of the solution space based on MCA, 72\% based on WLCA, 89\% based on CBA, and 83\% based on MLCA. However, after accounting for the estimated impacts, WLCA no longer supports reuse. Thus, the decision on decommissioning vs. reuse depends secondarily on the sustainability perspective. Sensitivity analyses based on greater positive and negative perceptions of reuse and with greater social and environmental concerns showed that reuse is a robust choice with respect to perceptions (i.e., the information gap is not relevant) and concerns (i.e., stakeholder representativeness is not significant) for all sustainability paradigms and economic approaches. Therefore, the main policy implications are that the avoided decommissioning costs should be shared in terms of inter-generational distributive justice; and that employment and biodiversity benefits from reuse should be stressed within a strong sustainability perspective.},

Title = {Island urbanization and its ecological consequences: A case study in the Zhoushan Island, East China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Islands, which provide multiple ecosystem services, are subject to increasing urbanization pressure due to the ongoing marine development, especially in developing countries. Insights into the island urbanization mechanism and its ecological consequences are essential to sustainable development. In the present paper, the satellite images, nighttime lights, and topographic data were integrated to characterize the spatially explicit urbanization process and mechanism during 1995-2011 in the Zhoushan Island, East China. Furthermore, the corresponding spatially explicit changes in ecosystem services, including net primary productivity (NPP), carbon sequestration and oxygen production (CSOP), nutrient cycling, crop production, and habitat quality, were quantified based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) models. The results showed that the Zhoushan Island had experienced a rapid urbanization over the years, with significant urban encroachment on the farmland and tidal flat. Moreover, the urban land expansion was positively correlated with that of the nighttime lights and negatively correlated with the elevation, slope, and the distance to shoreline. These indicated that the urban expansion was resulted from the enhancement of socioeconomic activities, and concentrated in the near-shore areas with low altitude and gentle slope. The urban encroachment on other land use types resulted in a decrease of 3.4 Gg C a(-1) NPP, 8.7 Gg a(-1) CSOP, 13.2 Gg a(-1) nutrient cycling, and 12.3 t a(-1) crop production, respectively. In addition, the habitat quality in 11\% area of this island degraded substantially. Therefore, to achieve sustainable development of islands, it is urgent to implement more stringent policies, such as island spatial regulation, environmental impact assessment, intensive land use, and urban greening, etc. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Constructing landscapes of value: Capitalist investment for the acquisition of marginal or unused land-The case of Tanzania},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {652-663},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The current global wave of land acquisition variously debated as land grabbing or investment in land is promoted by the World Bank and the FAO as creating win win-situations for local populations and investors alike. Common policy recommendations suggest expanding the production of export crops, by making use of marginal or unused land. Considerable potentials for such an expansion are assumed. Taking Tanzania as a case study, the evidence for such types of land is assessed by using a broad range of statistics. We will argue firstly, that the terms marginal and unused land serve as a manipulative terminology for the benefit of attempts to commercially valorize and commodify African landscapes, from biofuel to large-scale food production and tourism. However, they relate to different rationalities of domination. Unused land refers to a state-bureaucratic narrative, which excludes user groups deemed irrelevant for national development, while marginal land refers to a capitalist-economic narrative that excludes what is not profitable. Secondly, the terms are analyzed as categories central for state simplification of social relations attached to land. Modelling of these land use categories based on remote sensing is an attempt to compensate weak state capacities to enhance the legibility of the landscape by constructing it as a landscape of commercial value.

Abstract = {Mixed agro-silvo-pastoral landscapes are typically of significant natural, economic and cultural value. The montado (wood pasture) dominated systems of southern Portugal are a prime example, and experience high rates of land cover change. Tracking these changes is of importance for landscape level conservation and management. Whilst satellite remote sensing is the most realistic approach at large spatial scales, heterogeneous landscapes can present challenges to the accurate classification of land cover and its change. In this investigation we demonstrate a novel approach to the investigation of land cover change over a 25year period (1984-2009) in an area of importance for the conservation of the Iberian lynx, Black vulture, and other threatened biodiversity in south-east Alentejo, Portugal. We apply a Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) to Landsat imagery from these two years, and then Change Vector Analysis (CVA) on the transformed data to highlight areas of vegetation gain and loss during the intervening period. Using a 2009 land cover classification, and a set of rules based on these vegetation changes, we then predict the land change over the 25year period focussing on predominant classes of vegetation physiognomy. The results are discussed in terms of probable drivers, as well as implications for biodiversity and other landscape values.},

Abstract = {Wetlands which are the planet's most important ecosystem have high scientific research -value and will bring us both social and economic benefits. However, duing to various natural and man made factors, more and more wetlands have converted to agricultural land and urban land. Now, the changes in wetlands' area and quantity have caused public's widespread concern. And wetland's management and protection will benefit from the improvement of the wetland information abstraction's precision. Improving the classification precision of the RS image is a difficult problem because of the small scale of remote sensing images. This paper which is about the wetland remote sensing images extraction is based on the LANDSAT ETM remote sensing data, and the result of the Wavelet Packet reconstruction will be used as the sample set of the Active Support Vector Machine.At the end of this paper, a comparative analysis of the experimental results will show between the single classification (SVM, BPNN) method and the solution which is proposed in this article. This method can be proved to obtain very good classification results through many experiments on remote sensing image classification I've done. Experimental results show that this algorithm's classification accuracy is better than the single classification's. Moreover, in the active learning process, the bad influence of the image's isolated and intersection points on the classification is avoided, and the number of training samples are reduced greatly.},

Abstract = {The development of urbanization is still expanding on the earth, and the rapid expansion of cities has changed the regional landscape pattern and significantly affected the value of regional ecosystem services in developing countries such as China. Zhongmu County, as the core area of Zhengzhou-Kaifeng integration, studying the temporal and spatial transformations of its landscape pattern and ecosystem service value (ESV) is of great significance to the region's sustainable development. Based on remote sensing images and socioeconomic data, this study aims to explore the landscape pattern of Zhongmu County from 2005 to 2018 and its impact on ESV. Research methods include an ESV equivalent factor method, landscape pattern index, spatial autocorrelation, and other methods. The results showed that: (1) During the study period, the patch density and shape complexity, landscape diversity, and fragmentation of the overall landscape in the study area continued to increase while landscape connectivity decreased. (2) The total amount of ESV increased by 10.05 million USD; ESV had certain differences in spatial distribution: high-value clusters were mainly located at the boundary of the Yellow River in the north, while low-value clusters had a significant eastward expansion trend. (3) ESV increased significantly in areas where cultivated land was transferred to waters and forests, and ESV in areas where waters transferred to construction land and cultivated land was significantly reduced. (4) ESV had a significant positive spatial correlation with patch density, edge density, mean patch fractal dimension, mean patch size, and the landscape shape index, and a spatially negative correlation with the contagion index and cohesion index. The spatial and temporal changes in landscape patterns and ESV were all mainly driven by the regional development ``Zhengzhou-Kaifeng integration `` policy. Therefore, the ESV can be improved, and the ecological security of the urban integration area can be guaranteed through policy measures such as optimizing the layout of construction land and adjusting the uniform distribution of green areas by the land-use policy.},

Title = {Impact of landscape patterns on ecological vulnerability and ecosystem service values: An empirical analysis of Yancheng Nature Reserve in China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Abstract = {In this study, an ecological vulnerability assessment indicator system was constructed using the ``exposure-climate sensitivity-adaptive capacity{''} framework according to the theory of ecological vulnerability. An improved ecosystem service value calculation model was proposed based on empirical parameters. Using Yancheng Nature Reserve in China as an example, we employed remote sensing data to conduct an empirical analysis of the changes in the spatiotemporal pattern, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of typical landscape types over the period from 1987 to 2013. The statistical results derived from landscape pattern indices (LPIs) showed that during the investigation period, three natural wetland landscape types (i.e., Spartina alterniflora, Suaeda glauca, and Phragmites australis) showed gradually increased fragmentation in the study area. The ecological vulnerability scores of the major landscape types (in descending order) were P. australis (0.053), farmland (0.047), S. alterniflora (0.042), S. glauca (0.031), and bare mud flat (0.002). The results derived from the ecosystem service value fluctuation index (ESVFI) showed that from 1987 to 1997, the value of the ecosystem services provided by S. glauca and P. australis wetlands decreased, whereas that of S. alterniflora wetlands increased continuously. From 2002 to 2013, the value of the ecosystem services provided by all three types of natural wetland showed a downward trend. In conclusion, the combined effects of human and natural factors, including the expansion of farmland and the invasion of S. alterniflora, and changes in seawater erosion and deposition led to changes in the landscape patterns, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of the Yancheng Nature Reserve during the investigation period. The results indicate that a ``dual adaptive{''} management system based on natural succession and supplemented by appropriate manual intervention should be implemented, and the management efficiency and flexibility should be improved to meet the common needs of biodiversity conservation and economic development.

Abstract = {Chongming Island is the world's largest alluvial island. Its coastal wetland and tidal flats provide many important ecological services including buffers against tidal surges and staging areas for migratory birds. Due to its extraordinary resources, scenic qualities, and its proximity to the city of Shanghai 45 km away, the island is also an attractive tourist destination, and it supports important agricultural and fisheries economies. Yet, large-scale land reclamation projects that are severely affecting these ecosystems have been implemented. In this paper, we report an investigation of changes in land use and ecosystem services on Dongtan (East Beach of Chongming Island) between 1990 and 2000. We used three LANDSAT TM and/or ETM data sets to estimate changes in the size of five land-cover/land-use categories, and we also used previously published value coefficients to estimate changes in the value of ecosystem services delivered by each land category. Finally, we ranked the contribution of various ecosystem functions to the overall value of the ecosystem services. We determined that the total value of ecosystem services in Dongtan declined by 62\% from \$ 316.77 to 120.40 million per year between 1990 and 2000 (totaling \$855.26-981.85 million over 10-years). This massive decrease is largely attributable to the 71\% loss of wetlands/tidal flats. Our sensitivity analysis suggested that these estimates were relatively robust. We also found that the contribution of water regulation, water supply, waste treatment, and raw materials increased, while the contribution of nutrient cycling, food production, disturbance regulation, recreation, habitat/refugia, and biological control decreased during the 10-year time period. We conclude that future land-use policy formulation should give precedence to the conservation of these ecosystems over uncontrolled reclamation, and that further land reclamation should be based on rigorous environmental impact analyses.

Abstract = {Coastal environments are complex systems undergoing continuous evolution at a range of spatial and temporal scales. In this context, geomorphological and ecological features can be strongly related. We propose a synoptic remote sensing approach to monitor the temporal dynamics of both biotic and abiotic factors in estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Through the combination of spaceborne optical and SAR imagery, we derived both ecological and morphological parameters, to be integrated for a multi-temporal analysis of the dominant processes and trends in coastal landscapes. These dynamics were studied at three locations: Bevano (IT), the Scheldt (B-NL) and Erme (UK). The objectives were to detect and analyze interannual variations of processes and environmental dynamics. The results highlight that overtime, the morphology of different subsystems represents a balance between inputs (forcing agents like tidal range) and natural responses (related responses of the vegetation evolution). As a final remark the calculation of the uncertainties (subsidence rates) using new monitoring techniques such as satellite remote sensing has a specific added value that could be used for simulations over varying time scales and it should be considered as a potential `add in' for an integrated management approach to coastal monitoring and control.

Abstract = {With the rapid development of edge data intelligence, task offloading (TO) and resource allocation (RA) optimization in multiaccess edge computing networks can significantly improve the Quality of Service (QoS). However, for the online scenario, traditional methods (e.g., game theory and numerical methods) cannot adapt to dynamic environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to adjust the policy to get long-term rewards. Nevertheless, since the joint problem of TO and RA is nonconvex and NP-hard, existing DRL methods cannot guarantee high efficiency because of the large action space. To solve the above problem, we propose a fast learning with integrated reward and reduced action space-based DRL framework (FLIRRAS), which adopts a low-complexity approach to jointly optimize TO and RA strategies. The FLIRRAS framework combines DRL with numerical methods to iteratively pursues the discrete TO and continuous RA. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to learn environmental information, which can get prior knowledge of the offloading decision. Furthermore, a novel reward integrating the utility of TO and RA is designed to motivate the agent to find the optimal policy. To solve the dilemma that the action space is too large, low-complexity convex optimization methods, i.e., subgradient projection and KKT condition, are used to supplement and adjust the decision, which reduces the network parameters and the decision space. In addition, given the dynamic online environment, we introduce the experience replay mechanism, where policy is updated regularly to reflect the best mapping between states. The experiment results show that the performance of FLIRRAS is better than greedy and other DRL approaches, and it outperforms the latest DRL method by over 18.0\% in terms of execution time.},

Abstract = {One of the major concerns for pipeline operators is to efficiently monitor the events happening over the pipeline corridor, or right-of-way (ROW). Monitoring of the ROW is an important part of ensuring the safe and efficient transportation of oil and gas. Events occurring within this zone require rapid assessment and, if necessary, mitigation. These events could be physical intrusions such as encroachment from growing settlements, impact of vegetation, pipeline leakage or geoenvironmental hazards. Analysis of satellite imagery can provide an efficient and low cost solution to access and quantify change across the ROW. Examining these events over a periodic interval requires implementation of specific methods that can support the ongoing monitoring and decision making practices. In this context, satellite remote sensing images can provide a low cost and efficient solution for monitoring the physical and environmental impacts over the ROW of pipeline system. This paper reports on the development of a methodological approach for environmental change analysis using high resolution satellite images that can help decision making in pipeline systems. Analysis results and maps produced during this work provide an insight into landcover change over the study area and expected to support in on-going pipeline management practices. Two methods, Vegetation index differencing and post classification comparison have been implemented to identify change areas in the Taranaki region of the North Island of New Zealand. Vegetation index differencing with NDVI shows increase or decrease of overall vegetation within the study area. Special focus was given on large area increase and decrease with area threshold value above 0.2 hectare. Detailed analysis of change was conducted with post classification comparison method that uses land cover classification results of year 2010 and 2013. An overall change of 10\% has been observed throughout the study area with large area change of approximately 5\%. Results obtained from post classification comparison method were further analyzed with 6 focus areas and compared with the existing soil data and rainfall data. The methods adopted during this study are expected to provide a base for environmental change analysis in similar pipeline corridors to support decision making.},

Title = {Multi-scenario simulation of ecological risk assessment based on ecosystem service values in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {194},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this study, a framework for ecological risk assessment based on ecosystem service values and risk probability was established. Remote sensing was used to estimate the value of ecosystem services at the regional scale. Considering the natural and anthropogenic factors and using the entropy weight method to assign weights, probability index was constructed. In addition, multiple scenarios based on the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) method were simulated to reduce subjective uncertainty in the assessment. The results showed that the ecosystem service values generated by the gas regulation value accounted for the largest proportion, with a ratio of 46\% in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. From 2005 to 2015, the value of ecosystem services decreased, falling by 2.5 x 10(7) Yuan. The level of ecological risk was relatively high, with a corresponding area ratio of 32.89\%. Spatially, the areas with high risk were concentrated in the southeastern areas, and areas with relatively low risk were distributed in the western and northern areas. This high risk was probably caused by urbanization which was characterized by reduction of farmland and increase in impervious surface. Multi-scenario simulation showed that the areas of unstable ecological risk zones covered 30\% and were mainly concentrated in the surroundings of developing cities. In areas of unstable risk distribution, the relationship between development and protection should be considered. This framework increases the reliability and practicability of ecological risk assessment results and has potential application value for regional risk control in the context of urbanization.},

Journal = {TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-35},
Abstract = {In addition to land, labor, and capital, which have long been agriculture's traditional assets, technology and information management has become the fourth asset of increasing importance and has come to be known as precision agriculture. Information of both spatial and temporal dimensions is required for precision agriculture. Remote sensing imagery acquired from satellites, aircrafts, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers tremendous potential in providing information in both dimensions for precision crop management. Of course, spatial data is valuable only to the extent that it is timely delivered and properly interpreted to drive decision making. To help regional producers benefit from recent advancements in spatial technology, we have innovated in multiple frontiers, including sensor technology, Internet data delivery, and knowledge diffusion. Airborne Environmental Research Observational Camera and International Space Station Agriculture Camera were developed to provide near real-time high-resolution imagery. Data acquired by the two sensors and those by satellites are delivered to users through Digital Northern Great Plains (DNGP) and a zone-mapping application for precision agriculture (ZoneMAP), the two systems that were designed to allow regional producers access to remote sensing data easily and efficiently. By creating a learning community, we lowered the barrier for end users to understand and learn the technologies effectively from peers as well as professionals. Through continuous innovative efforts, we have been helping the producers utilizing the spatial technology to increase profit while reducing waste for over one decade.},

Abstract = {One of the major degradation arise in the satellite images is poor weather conditions (i.e., haze). Haze is an environmental distortion which significantly affect and minimize the efficiency of remote sensing image interpretation. To tackle this complication, this research work introduced a new approach named as multi-scale retinex histogram equalization with U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal (MSRHE with U-Net DOPT) scheme. In this scheme, multi-scale retinex technique is applied to eliminate ambient atmospheric light value of inhomogeneous information and retain only object surface reflection but they suffer from dark tone. So, of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization is employed to brighten the image tone with limited contrast level. Then the enhanced image is restored using U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal technique which deeply extract the feature information with dragonfly optimized ReLU activation unit to enhance the system efficiency. This resolved criteria can greatly improve the image efficiency to generate haze-free image. At the same time, the techniques such as dark channel prior (DCP) method, urban remote sensing haze removal (URSHR) method were employed to comparatively analysed with MSRHE with U-Net DOPT. Three parameters such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), feature similarity (FSIM) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed to quantitatively estimate the test (query) result. The experimental result concludes that the proposed technique works well when compared with other classic approaches.},

Abstract = {The unique Hyrcanian (Caspian) forests of northern Iran provide vital ecosystem services for local and global communities. We assess the status and trends of key ecosystem services in this region where native forest conversion has accelerated to make way for housing and farm development. This is a mountainous forested area that is valuable for both conservation and multiple human uses including recreation and farming. It contains globally significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. A rapid, qualitative, and participatory approach was used including interviews with local households and experts in combination with assessment of land use/cover remote sensing data to identify and map priority ecosystem services in the Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the interests of the beneficiaries, eight priority services (food production, water supply, raw materials, soil conservation, water regulation, climate regulation, biodiversity, and recreation) were identified and mapped. The results indicate the current typical spatial distribution of the provided services based on structural characteristics of the study landscape and their changing trends through a comparison of past, present and future land use, and land cover. Although food production and recreation have greatly increased in recent decades, the other services, in particular timber production, biodiversity, and water purification and supply are being gradually lost. The results of this study and of others elsewhere should raise awareness of ecosystem service status and trends and the value of examining these since they provide much of the information to inform natural resources policy and decision making. The declines in supply of key ecosystem services both within and outside the protected area are creating conflicts within communities as well as impacting on the integrity of the area and careful planning and conservation is required to provide win-win opportunities.},

Title = {A Framework for Assessing Readiness of Satellite Assembly, Integration and Testing Organization},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {83472-83488},
Abstract = {Purpose: The success of satellites in orbit depends on the quality of the engineering processes adopted in the development cycle of the mission. The facilities and processes provided by Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) laboratories support the verification and validation of satellite' systems regarding their capacities to operating into space environmental conditions. Choose an ideal AIT organization to a particular satellite project requires knowing their processes and services provided. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the services for satellite AIT provided by an AIT organization. The framework, named PRONT-AIT, allows to assess the organization's readiness based on both process areas and criteria of adherence to the stakeholder's requirements. Methodology/approach - Inspired by the CMMI model, the framework was structured in process areas, covering management and technical processes of the AIT organization, that supports 5 levels of readiness. Each readiness level expresses the organization maturity in terms of the processes and practices established to provide the services required by a particular space project. Findings - The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its use to assess the readiness of a particular AIT organization on meeting the specific requirements of two types of satellites: remote sensing and CubeSat satellites. The results reveal that the example organization readiness fully reached level 2 (Manageable Readiness) for remote sensing satellite and partially reached level 2 for CubeSat satellite. Originality/value - The framework has a good value to satellite project managers because it supports them on evaluating an AIT organization prior to contracting its services. Higher readiness level revealed by PRONT-AIT gives to the satellite project manager more confidence on the AIT organization capacities. Thus, an AIT organization is not chosen solely on the basis of the facilities it offers and the cost of the services but also on the level of readiness revealed by this framework.},

Title = {Development of an invasive species distribution model with fine-resolution remote sensing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) is recognized as one of the most aggressively invasive species throughout the Western United States. Mapping its suitable habitat is of paramount importance to effective management, and thus, becomes a high priority for conservation practitioners. In previous studies, species distribution models (SDMs) have been applied to predicting the suitable habitats of saltcedar at national scale, but at coarser spatial resolution (1 km). Although such studies achieved some success, they are lacking of capability to accommodate fine-scale resolution environmental variables, and therefore, fail to uncover detailed spatial pattern of habitats. The objective of this study was to develop a remote sensing driven SDM so as to characterize suitable habitats of saltcedar at very fine spatial scale (30 m). We exploited several fine-scale environmental predictors through remote sensing images, and utilized the logistic regression model to analyze the species-habitat relationship by identifying influential factors with subset selection criteria. We also incorporated the spatial autocorrelation with regression kriging method. Our results indicated that the model incorporating spatial autocorrelation achieved a higher accuracy than that of regression only model. Among 10 environmental variables, the distance to the river and the phenological attributes summarized by the harmonic analysis were regarded as the most significant in predicting the invasive potential of saltcedar. We conclude that remote sensing driven SDM has potential to identify the suitable habitat of saltcedar at a fine scale and locate appropriate areas at high risk of saltcedar infestation, which could benefit the early control and proactive management strategies to a large extent.

Title = {Content Placement Based on Utility Function for Satellite Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {163150-163159},
Abstract = {The incorporation of the cognitive radio (CR) technology as a spectrum management tool in satellite communication has attracted considerable research attention because the CR allows the coexistence of the primary and secondary networks using the same resources. In this paper, satellites and their users are considered as a primary network, and the terrestrial base stations (BSs) and their users are considered as a secondary network. Besides, it is considered that terrestrial users cause interference to satellite users due to technical and environmental constraints. This interference reduces satellite users' satisfaction with downloads rate. In such a cognitive satellite network environment, content placement may also cause a decrease in user satisfaction. The successful download probability (SDP) is analyzed in this work based on different terrestrial user density. To utilize the satellite cache resources effectively, we propose two transmission strategies based on the terrestrial user density, namely, the multi-point cooperative transmission strategy (CT) and the parallel transmission strategy (PT). In addition, based on the cache service probability we determine the ratio of content distribution most popular content (MPC) and general popular content (GPC) and optimize the content placement process using the utility function in CT mode. Through computer simulation, we give numerical results of our method. The obtained numerical results show that the proposed strategies are effective in content placement.},

Title = {Research and Innovation in the Private Forestry Sector: Past Successes and Future Opportunities},

Abstract = {The private forestry sector faces enormous challenges from complex environmental issues concurrent with societal concerns about intensive forest management and application of silvicultural tools. At the same time, research and development spending and the scientific workforce in the forestry sector has declined. However, the forestry sector has a long history of strategic deployment of science and technology to manage timberlands for many uses, including ecological services. To address science and societal needs from future forests, we describe past successes and potential future innovations of the forestry sector across (1) genetics, (2) silviculture and productivity, (3) harvesting and logging technology, (4) environmental sustainability, and (5) remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicles. Developing technology is only one component, however; progressing towards sector goals of diversifying the workforce, explicitly valuing research collaborations, and integrating big data across ownerships to guide management decisions will hasten innovation. With the growing complexity of social-ecological-economic challenges, the private forestry sector must enact a tactical approach to addressing stressors with evolving research structures. We offer a vision of a vibrant private forestry sector poised to integrate technological innovation to continue meeting society's needs through the intersecting effects of climate change and other challenges. Study Implications: The complexity of challenges facing private forest managers is growing as stressors from climate change interact with social and economic pressures on forests. Further, spending on forestry research and development and student enrollment in forestry degree programs has declined. In this article, we describe significant technological improvements in regenerating, growing, and sustainably harvesting intensively managed forest through a changing research landscape. We review key past examples of production and sustainability improvements and describe future innovation space across the intensively managed conifer stands through the life cycle of seed-to-saw. We envision that technological improvements in forest genetics, remotely operated harvesting equipment, high-resolution information about vegetation and the earth's surface, and analysis of big data will increase the private sector's ability to make precise management decisions. A more developed and broader technological tool set will ensure the private forest sector is poised to supply ecosystem services and demand for wood products.To realize the gains from future innovation, the forest sector needs to support initiatives that explicitly value an inclusive and diverse workforce, cross-disciplinary problem-solving, and improved communication with external stakeholders.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Mosquitoes are vectors of major pathogen agents worldwide. Population dynamics models are useful tools to understand and predict mosquito abundances in space and time. To be used as forecasting tools over large areas, such models could benefit from integrating remote sensing data that describe the meteorological and environmental conditions driving mosquito population dynamics. The main objective of this study is to assess a process-based modeling framework for mosquito population dynamics using satellite-derived meteorological estimates as input variables. A generic weather-driven model of mosquito population dynamics was applied to Rift Valley fever vector species in northern Senegal, with rainfall, temperature, and humidity as inputs. The model outputs using meteorological data from ground weather station vs satellite-based estimates are compared, using longitudinal mosquito trapping data for validation at local scale in three different ecosystems. Model predictions were consistent with field entomological data on adult abundance, with a better fit between predicted and observed abundances for the Sahelian Ferlo ecosystem, and for the models using in-situ weather data as input. Based on satellite-derived rainfall and temperature data, dynamic maps of three potential Rift Valley fever vector species were then produced at regional scale on a weekly basis. When direct weather measurements are sparse, these resulting maps should be used to support policy-makers in optimizing surveillance and control interventions of Rift Valley fever in Senegal.},

Title = {Environmental vulnerability assessment using Grey Analytic Hierarchy Process based model},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {145-154},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Environmental management of an area describes a policy for its systematic and sustainable environmental protection. In the present study, regional environmental vulnerability assessment in Hirakud command area of Odisha, India is envisaged based on Grey Analytic Hierarchy Process method (Grey-AHP) using integrated remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Grey-AHP combines the advantages of classical analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and grey clustering method for accurate estimation of weight coefficients. It is a new method for environmental vulnerability assessment. Environmental vulnerability index (EVI) uses natural, environmental and human impact related factors, e.g., soil, geology, elevation, slope, rainfall, temperature, wind speed, normalized difference vegetation index, drainage density, crop intensity, agricultural DRASTIC value, population density and road density. EVI map has been classified into four environmental vulnerability zones (EVZs) namely: ` low `, ` moderate ` ` high `, and ` extreme ` encompassing 17.87\%, 44.44\%, 27.81\% and 9.88\% of the study area, respectively. EVI map indicates that the northern part of the study area is more vulnerable from an environmental point of view. EVI map shows close correlation with elevation. Effectiveness of the zone classification is evaluated by using grey clustering method. General effectiveness is in between `' better `' and `' common classes `'. This analysis demonstrates the potential applicability of the methodology. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Shallow water habitat mapping is important to do because: (1) it can support the planning, management, and decision making of government spatial; (2) it can support and design a Marine Protected Area (MPA); (3) it can conduct a scientific research program to determine a knowledge about benthic ecosystem and seabed geology; (4) it can do seabed resource valuation, both biotic and abiotic, for economic and management goals. Nowadays, the standardization of thematic map details level in coastal ecosystem has not determined, especially in shallow water habitat based on coastal management needs in certain scale. The study aims to compare map accuracy level between SPOT 6, Sentinel 2A, and Landsat 8 classification results using support vector machine algorithm. The study site is in Wakatobi Island, including Kapota Island and Kompoone Island. The in-situ data took on July 2019. The 347 ground truth and transect images in the field analyzed using Coral Point Count with Excel Extension (CPCe). The classification scheme that was gotten is 8 habitat benthic classes, then conducted classification with classify them to be 6 and 5 classes. The result from SPOT 6 for 5 habitat classes has the highest overall accuracy. The differences between pixel (spatial resolution) and the amount of classification scheme influence accuracy results.},

Title = {A systematic review on the definition, criteria, indicators, methods and applications behind the Ecological Value term},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Volume = {129},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The ``Ecological Value{''} (EV) term has been spread in the literature since 1860; however, there is no consensus on its definition and the criteria for its assessment. To identify, assess and summarize the main definitions, criteria, indicators and applications behind the EV term, we performed a systematic literature review of 209 articles published over the last 10 years. Methods included documentation of the following data: i) study area, ii) study subject, iii) study object; iv) criteria, indicators and methods used in the analyses, v) applications of the EV term, and vi) if the study was performed in a natural protected area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was conducted to uncover the association among studies regarding the use of EV and to test for homogeneity among the articles publishing research involving EV. A bootstrap technique was used for MCA validation. The main findings exposed the polysemy of the term and the paucity in the definition, mainly derived by the lack of a theoretical framework. Only 74, out of the 209 revised articles, involved numerical analysis to evaluate criteria. The more recurrent criteria were those related with ecological properties (biodiversity, vulnerability) and with functional characteristics (fragmentation, connectivity and resilience). Remote sensing techniques were the more frequent method for the assessment of EV. The main applications in the use of this term were for natural and urban planning, biodiversity conservation and payment for ecosystem services. An explicit heterogeneity among articles, with and without numerical analysis, was denoted by MCA. Finally, we concluded that the EV term is highly related with the intrinsic values of the landscape.},

Title = {LUCC and Ecosystem Service Value Assessment for Wetlands: A Case Study in Nansi Lake, China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wetland is one of the most important ecosystems in the world. A healthy wetland ecosystem is important to the development of a regional and even global economy, and it is also beneficial to the human living conditions. In this paper, remote sensing (RS), landscape metrics were used to analyze the land use/land cover change (LUCC), landscape pattern change and the ecosystem services value (ESV) from 1987 to 2017 in Nansi Lake wetland of China. The results showed: 54.4\% of the natural wetlands in Nansi Lake were replaced by constructed wetlands in the past 30 years, the ecosystem was degraded and the landscape structure was fragmented due to the severe drought in 2002 and the development of aquaculture and tourism in recent years. The ESV of Nansi Lake wetland fluctuated from 1987 to 2017, and the average annual ESV (\$8134/hm(2)) was much lower than that of global and China's wetlands, the LUCC driven by human production and economic development leads to the reduction of ESV, especially the rapid increase of constructed wetlands. Finally, the implications of wetland laws and policies, wetland monitoring, assessment and database construction, and wetland regional development strategies were discussed for wetland protection and management.},

Title = {Development of a Methodology for Strategic Environmental Assessment: Application to the Assessment of Golf Course Installation Policy in Taiwan},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Some countries, including Taiwan, have adopted strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to assess and modify proposed policies, plans, and programs (PPPs) in the planning phase for pursuing sustainable development. However, there were only some sketchy steps focusing on policy assessment in the system of Taiwan. This study aims to develop a methodology for SEA in Taiwan to enhance the effectiveness associated with PPPs. The proposed methodology comprises an SEA procedure involving PPP management and assessment in various phases, a sustainable assessment framework, and an SEA management system. The SEA procedure is devised based on the theoretical considerations by systems thinking and the regulative requirements in Taiwan. The positive and negative impacts on ecology, society, and economy are simultaneously considered in the planning (including policy generation and evaluation), implementation, and control phases of the procedure. This study used the analytic hierarchy process, Delphi technique, and systems analysis to develop a sustainable assessment framework. An SEA management system was built based on geographic information system software to process spatial, attribute, and satellite image data during the assessment procedure. The proposed methodology was applied in the SEA of golf course installation policy in 2001 as a case study, which was the first SEA in Taiwan. Most of the 82 existing golf courses in 2001 were installed on slope lands and caused a serious ecological impact. Assessment results indicated that 15 future golf courses installed on marginal lands (including buffer zones, remedied lands, and wastelands) were acceptable because the comprehensive environmental (ecological, social, and economic) assessment value was better based on environmental characteristics and management regulations of Taiwan. The SEA procedure in the planning phase for this policy was completed but the implementation phase of this policy was not begun because the related legislation procedure could not be arranged due to a few senators' resistance. A self-review of the control phase was carried out in 2006 using this methodology. Installation permits for 12 courses on slope lands were terminated after 2001 and then 27 future courses could be installed on marginal lands. The assessment value of this policy using the data on ecological, social, and economic conditions from 2006 was higher than that using the data from 2001. The analytical results illustrate that the proposed methodology can be used to effectively and efficiently assist the related authorities for SEA.},

Title = {Modeling the Spatial Distribution of Soil Nitrogen Content at Smallholder Maize Farms Using Machine Learning Regression and Sentinel-2 Data},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients that indicate soil quality and an important component for plant development. Accurate knowledge and management of soil nitrogen is crucial for food security in rural communities, especially for smallholder maize farms. However, less research has been done on generating digital soil nitrogen maps for these farmers. This study examines the utility of Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables to map soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms. Three machine learning algorithms-random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XG) were investigated for this purpose. The findings indicate that the RF (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0076\%) model performs slightly better than the GB (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.0083\%) and XG (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.0077\%) models. Furthermore, the variable importance measure showed that the Sentinel-2 bands, particularly the red and red-edge bands, have a superior performance in comparison to the environmental variables and soil indices. The digital maps generated in this study show the high capability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to generate accurate nitrogen content maps with the application of machine learning. The developed framework can be implemented to map the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen. This will also contribute to soil fertility interventions and nitrogen fertilization management to improve food security in rural communities. This application contributes to Sustainable Development Goal number 2.},

Abstract = {Taking Yancheng coastal wetland of China as the case, and using remote sensing images in 1997, 2007 and 2017 as the data sources, the spatial-temporal changes characteristics of landscape elasticity (LE) were analyzed from three dimensions of ecosystem service value (ESV), ecological vulnerability (EV) and human disturbance (H). From 1997 to 2017, Yancheng coastal wetland landscape structure showed a trend of increasing proportion of aquaculture ponds and construction land area, while decreasing proportion of natural wetland area The total ESV decreased first and then increased, the average ESV per unit area in 1997, 2007 and 2017 were 5.23 x 10(4) USD center dot hm(-2), 4.28 x 10(4) USD center dot hm(-2), 5.95 x 10(4) USD center dot hm(-2), respectively. The average EV decreased from 0.182 to 0.170 during 1997 to 2017. The average H increased from 0.175 to 0.198 during 1997 to 2017. In terms of spatial differentiation, the ESV, the EV and the H all showed the characteristics of land-sea differences. The average LE increased from 0.263 in 1997 to 0.914 in 2017, showing a downward trend from land to sea and the southern region was better than the northern region. This study can provide reference for the sustainable construction and management in Yancheng Coastal wetland World Natural Heritage Site.},

Abstract = {With regional socio-economic development and increasing population, the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystem environments on the earth's surface have changed markedly. Ecological shelter zone reconstruction (ESZR) is an ecosystem restoration and conservation project, which aims to ensure the safety of the ecological environments of-regions and basins. We selected the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (from Yibin to Chongqing) as the study area and determined the connotation of ESZR. At the same time, the planning scope and construction content of the ecological barrier in this specific region have been preliminarily explored. Meanwhile, a set of related planning methods was proposed, the ecological effects of which were quantitatively assessed and confirmed through the calculation of ESVs. Compared with the conditions in 2005, the study showed that the value of the services of the whole ecosystem augmented significantly under the slope classification, increasing by 103.23\%. At the same time, the land use pattern has been optimized, and the vegetation coverage has been enhanced. The ESZR can effectively improve the ecosystem service function of slope land (mainly slope > 25 degrees) and the regional ecological environment, solve the rocky desertification of the study area and provide an effective decision in relation to supporting regional green sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Ecological services are defined as the conditions and processes through which natural ecosystems and the species that comprise them, sustain and fulfill human life, or the goods and services provided by ecosystem which contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly. Ecological service value has been a hot topic in ecological economic research. Beijing, the capital of China, covers an area of more than 16,410 square kilometers and has a population of 14.93 million people. It's also a fast-growing city with rapid urbanization, which may significantly impact ecological services and functions. Such effects are difficult to quantify and are seldom taken into account in the policy making process. So this article tried a technical process for calculating the ecological service value based on remote sensing. Then the article estimated variations in ecological services value in response to land use changes in Beijing from 1990 to 2006, and provided useful information and advice to policy-making for sustainable development of ecological environment.},

Title = {Assessing the benefit of satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence in crop yield prediction},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large-scale crop yield prediction is critical for early warning of food insecurity, agricultural supply chain management, and economic market. Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (fivefold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future.},

Abstract = {Road extraction plays an important role in urban planning and city extension issues, as well as in road monitoring, traffic management and map updating. Technological advances may offer a wealth of data and techniques that could be implemented in road delineation and extraction, as well as in change detection projects. Among the various methods that have been developed for this purpose, remote sensing techniques and especially digital processing of satellite data could contribute significantly in this direction. This paper presents the study of a road network which concerns the city of Kastoria located in northwestern Greece and its surrounding area. The special character of the road network is closely related to the city's cultural value which is depicted in its structure. Satellite images of various spatial resolutions were employed for digital processing. Landsat 8 imagery was used in order to detect and delineate the linear features through spatial enhancement, while Landsat 5 images were used to detect changes over time through visual interpretation. Semi-automatic techniques were applied to SPOTmaps products to extract the road network, while an object-oriented approach was applied to QuickBird imagery in order to combine the spatial components with spectral properties. Through semi-automatic digitization and object-oriented workflows, the export of the studied part of the road network in vector format was achieved, thus facilitating the process and reducing the required time. The resulted data are efficient in road network delineation and could be combined with other data for road maintenance and extension, change detection issues, as well as for cultural and touristic purposes.},

Abstract = {A watershed is a fluvial geomorphological unit in which all the precipitation and streams drain into a common outlet such as the mouth of a bay or any point along a stream channel. Stream flow and the water quality of a river are affected by both anthropogenic and natural factors existing within the catchment area, hence it is vital to study watershed and its management. This includes identification of problems and issues impacting the natural resources of the watershed and recommending management solutions that will benefit the community, the economy and the environment and would bring about a sustainable development within the watershed. The present study seeks to generate various thematic maps in GIS domain like Drainage, Geomorphology, Road, Rail, Canal, Forest, Settlement, Land Use Land Cover etc. using high resolution satellite data (IRS LISS IV and Cartosat-1). The application of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to give suitable weightage value to various factors in each layer. In this paper, Land Resource Development Plan (LRDP) map has been generated to suggest conservation of forest, Farmbund, Social forestry etc. to protect soil loss, soil erosion and also Water Resource Development Plan (WRDP) map has been generated to suggest to make some structures like Canal, check dam, reservoir for the conservation of water resources. The future implication of the study would be to control damaging runoff and degradation of land and thereby conservation of soil and water.},

Abstract = {The use of plants in cities and the ecosystem services they provide has attracted increased attention both publicly and within the research literature. Increasingly, the value of urban green and blue space is being recognised for its multiple benefits to human wellness and ecological integrity.\& nbsp;A quantitative assessment of studies considering nature-based solutions and ecosystem services can identify the current evidence -base for improving the provisioning of plant ecosystem services management and understanding barriers to adoption of nature-based solutions. Here, we provide a systematic review of the literature to characterise the current state of research on ecosystem service provision by urban blue and green space.\& nbsp;We identified 684 relevant studies on urban plant literature and extracted key research themes. Studies were generally focused on terrestrial systems (89\%) compared to aquatic systems such as blue space (11\%). Geographically most studies were focused on Europe (39\%), Asia (23\%), and N. America (22\%). Trees were the most frequently reported vegetation type studies (29\%) followed by generic vegetation (20\%), grassland (11\%), forest (7\%), and aquatic vegetation (5\%). Many studies were short (41\%), collecting data only over a single year or single field season. Many of the long-term studies are concerning land use/land cover change. Most studies (64\%) were conducted for less than five years. The most-reported methodology was remote sensing technology (15\%), followed by field surveys (8\%), stakeholder surveys (6\%), and ecosystem service models (5\%). The most-reported ecosystem service types were regulation and maintenance (54\%), cultural (28\%), and provisioning (16\%). Only a small number of studies looked solely at disservice (1\%) or discussed ecosystem services in generic terms. Disservices were reported in only 16\% of studies with the greatest single category of a disservice being biogenic volatile organic compounds and allergenic potential. Few studies (13\%) reported on the use of nature-based solutions and these 80\% only focused on a single nature-based solution. There was a lack of detail on plant species, 68\% (n = 468) did not list the species studied.\& nbsp;We conclude that there is a broad spectrum of research on urban vegetation services, overall, the focus of the literature is uneven. Research should seek to examine the species-specific responses to urbanisation and counter geographic disparities. There is also a need for longitudinal experimental data to identify the functioning and ecosystem service provision of green infrastructure in both urban green and blue space and factors that influence performance over policy-and management-relevant timescales.

Title = {Effects of improved land-cover mapping on predicted ecosystem service outcomes in a lowland river catchment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Reliable quantification of ecosystem service (ES) provision in agricultural landscapes depends on accurate mapping of the spatial configuration of land-use and land cover (LULC). In this paper we explore the benefits of enhanced spatial and thematic resolution in LULC mapping in terms of predicting ecosystem services and associated natural capital-based land-use policies. Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images were processed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate a LULC map at 10 m resolution, which was compared to existing datasets at 20 m, 25 m, and 100 m resolution in the River Welland catchment (Eastern England). Spatial resolution had a significant effect on the abundance and spatial configuration of land cover types. For example, detected woodland cover in the finest resolution dataset was 2x that in the coarsest data. Finer spatial resolution also allowed small, fragmented patches of woodland and grassland to be identified. ES provision (crop yield, carbon storage and pollinator abundance) was estimated from each map using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The finest resolution map resulted in 21\% lower predicted wheat production (due to lower estimates of cultivated land cover), 7\% higher predicted carbon stocks and 43\% higher predicted wild bee abundance compared to the coarsest resolution map. The estimated monetary value of ES provision increased by 23.2\% between the 10 and 100 m dataset. We recommend that a LULC resolution of at least 10 m should be employed in agricultural landscapes to accurately capture ES provision. This can be achieved using GEE and could be used as a basis for the development of future natural capital policy.},

Abstract = {The goal of the regional policy in the wider context is to assure the balance between different areas and locations. There are no objective and politically or ``expertly{''} influenced tool till today, which help us monitor the urban processes and independently to know the statement of urban changes in the area e.g. the tool for urban dynamics measurement during the time. The paper is focused on adjustment of such monitoring and creation of data set and urban dynamics indicator from validated data set based on Earth remote sensing of the Earth as simple and non-influenced tool for urban dynamics monitoring and measurement during the time. The main goal of the paper is to show how luminance data from the Earth remote sensing in the regions can monitor changes in the area e.g. how is possible to create urban dynamics indicator.},

Title = {Environmental factors and human activity as drivers of tree cover and density on the Island of Socotra, Yemen},

Abstract = {Socotra Island, in the western Indian Ocean, harbors high biodiversity and endemism and makes up the largest part of the Socotra archipelago UNESCO World Heritage site. Its climatic, pedological, and geomorphological characteristics, together with the long geological isolation and inaccessibility, led to the flourishing of unique tree diversity, with great cultural and ecological value. Lately, trees on Socotra are facing new threats linked to the abandonment of traditional management practices, climate change impacts, and growing human pressure. This study assesses the relative influence of environmental factors and human activity as drivers of tree cover and density, which can be used to support land management policies for the conservation of this key local resource. Tree cover and density were assessed on a total of 3600 plots of 0.5 ha each, laid on a regular grid covering the entire area of the island through Collect Earth, a free open source software tool that allows an augmented visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite images. A total of 770,000 trees, with an average of 2.14 trees/ha, were estimated on the island. The collected data was validated by ground surveys in 26 plots. The relative influence of selected predictors (seven environmental, two anthropic) on tree cover and density was analyzed through logistic and survival regression. Tree cover and density were found to be impacted positively by steeper slopes, higher rainfall, and marked precipitation seasonality and negatively by relatively warmer temperatures and a higher sand content in the soil. Distance of each plot from the nearest road and settlement was calculated and neither of these anthropic predictors emerged as significant, indicating that the limited number of trees present are not currently as affected by anthropic pressure, but, instead, their presence is mostly limited by the harsh climatic and pedological factors. However, as human population and development increase, periods of drought rise, and extreme and random climatic events intensify, these additional stresses on the environment could negatively impact the availability of natural resources in the terrestrial environment. Lastly, potential recommendations to the existing conservation policies and Socotra Conservation Zoning Plan are discussed based on the results. {[}GRAPHICS] .},

Title = {Massachusetts Roadmap to Net Zero: Accounting for Ownership of Soil Carbon Regulating Ecosystem Services and Land Conversions},
Journal = {LAWS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The state of Massachusetts (MA) has passed comprehensive climate change legislation and a roadmap of achieving Net Zero emissions in 2050, which includes the protection of environmental resources (e.g., soil) and green space across the state. Soil resources are an integral part of the land cover/land use. They can be a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of the conversion of ``low disturbance{''} land covers (e.g., evergreen forest, hay/pasture) to ``high disturbance{''} land covers (e.g., low-, medium-, and high-intensity developed land). These often ``invisible{''} GHG emissions can be considered as ``negative externalities{''} and ``external costs{''} because of the difficulty in assigning ownership to the emissions. The combination of remote sensing and soil information data analysis can identify the ownership associated with GHG emissions and therefore expand the range of policy tools for addressing these emissions. This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for MA by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. The results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions, which can be linked to ownership. The state of MA can use these remote sensing tools and publicly available data to quantify and value GHG emissions based on property ownership, therefore ``internalizing{''} the costs of these emissions for a cost-effective climate mitigation policy.},

Abstract = {BackgroundCoastal wetlands with high biodiversity and productivity provide essential ecosystem services that have a significant positive socio-economic impact. However, coastal reclamation, pollution, and climate change are threatening coastal wetlands. Thus, it is critical to identify priority areas for restoration and improve habitat resilience to adapt to environmental changes. Here, we propose a general analysis framework integrating nature-based solutions (NbS) into habitat restoration to increase coastal resilience to multiple stressors in Sansha Bay, southeast China.ResultsThe total loss of value in ecosystem services due to reclamation in Sansha Bay was US\$162.18 million from 2000 to 2015. The coastal habitats were at medium risk of degradation, with some high-risk areas concentrated in the northwest and along the west coasts, which were prioritized for restoration.ConclusionsOur proposed framework, which integrates hard and soft engineering such as mudflat renovation, mangrove afforestation, and an ecological seawall, can aid in the improvement of coastal resilience. The project cost was US\$12.71 million and was estimated to generate US\$36.75 million in environmental services. We recommend evaluating and monitoring shoreline changes, environmental factors, and marine biological resources using long-term sampling surveys and remote sensing methods. Our findings can serve as a guide for government decision-making in coastal restoration planning and management.},

Abstract = {The wide application of agricultural greenhouses globally has brought economic benefits; however, it has also led to many environmental problems. The timely and accurate acquisition of greenhouse areas and distribution is valuable for authorities seeking to optimize regional agricultural management and mitigate environmental pollution. Automatic extraction of the greenhouses from high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery based on deep learning can reduce labor costs and improve operational efficiency to have better application prospects. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel fused fully convolutional network (FCN) optimized by the optimal scale object-oriented segmentation results for agricultural greenhouse extraction from high spatial resolution RS imagery. First, to make full use of remote sensing feature images of target objects and to not increase the complexity of the deep learning network, we constructed a decision-level fusion FCN network that can simultaneously input multiple remote sensing images for preliminary extraction of greenhouse. Second, to address a defect in the classical FCN network causing the easy loss of ground object details, we optimized the preliminary extraction results from FCN by the results of object-oriented segmentation. Finally, the optimized greenhouse extraction results were processed by the mathematical morphology, and the final extraction results were obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Multi-channel fused FCN model could use the unique spectral characteristics of different ground objects. (2) Optimized initial extraction results from FCN based on the optimal scale object-oriented segmentation results could fully maintain the edge details of the greenhouse. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extract the greenhouse effectively. The precision and F value of our proposed method are 92.68\% and 0.94.

Title = {Remote Sensing of Volcanic Processes and Risk},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Remote sensing data and methods are increasingly being embedded into assessments of volcanic processes and risk. This happens thanks to their capability to provide a spectrum of observation and measurement opportunities to accurately sense the dynamics, magnitude, frequency, and impacts of volcanic activity in the ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), infrared (IR), and microwave domains. Launched in mid-2018, the Special Issue ``Remote Sensing of Volcanic Processes and Risk{''} ofRemote Sensinggathers 19 research papers on the use of satellite, aerial, and ground-based remote sensing to detect thermal features and anomalies, investigate lava and pyroclastic flows, predict the flow path of lahars, measure gas emissions and plumes, and estimate ground deformation. The strong multi-disciplinary character of the approaches employed for volcano monitoring and the combination of a variety of sensor types, platforms, and methods that come out from the papers testify the current scientific and technology trends toward multi-data and multi-sensor monitoring solutions. The research advances presented in the published papers are achieved thanks to a wealth of data including but not limited to the following: thermal IR from satellite missions (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, ASTER, TET-1) and ground-based stations (e.g., FLIR cameras); digital elevation/surface models from airborne sensors (e.g., Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), or 3D laser scans) and satellite imagery (e.g., tri-stereo Pleiades, SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope); airborne hyperspectral surveys; geophysics (e.g., ground-penetrating radar, electromagnetic induction, magnetic survey); ground-based acoustic infrasound; ground-based scanning UV spectrometers; and ground-based and satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging (e.g., TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2). Data processing approaches and methods include change detection, offset tracking, Interferometric SAR (InSAR), photogrammetry, hotspots and anomalies detection, neural networks, numerical modeling, inversion modeling, wavelet transforms, and image segmentation. Some authors also share codes for automated data analysis and demonstrate methods for post-processing standard products that are made available for end users, and which are expected to stimulate the research community to exploit them in other volcanological application contexts. The geographic breath is global, with case studies in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Hawai'i, Alaska, Kamchatka, Japan, Indonesia, Vanuatu, Reunion Island, Ethiopia, Canary Islands, Greece, Italy, and Iceland. The added value of the published research lies on the demonstration of the benefits that these remote sensing technologies have brought to knowledge of volcanoes that pose risk to local communities; back-analysis and critical revision of recent volcanic eruptions and unrest periods; and improvement of modeling and prediction methods. Therefore, this Special Issue provides not only a collection of forefront research in remote sensing applied to volcanology, but also a selection of case studies proving the societal impact that this scientific discipline can potentially generate on volcanic hazard and risk management.},

Abstract = {Agricultural activities, especially reclamation, are considered major threats to the wetland ecosystems in Sanjiang Plain, the largest concentrated area of the freshwater wetlands in China. In the past decades, the area of the cultivated land and its grain production have been increased at the cost of wetlands shrinkage. The large-scale land reclamation severely affected the ecosystems in this region. However, such effects at the regional scale are seldom evaluated quantitatively. We used three datasets of LANDSAT MSS and/or TM imagery to estimate the area changes and the transition of land use types from 1980 to 2000. We also valued changes in ecosystem services delivered by each land category using value coefficients published by Costanza et al. {[}Nature 387, 1997, 253-260]. Sensitivity analysis suggested that these estimates were relatively robust. Finally, the contribution of various ecosystem functions was ranked to the overall value of the ecosystem services in this study. According to our estimates, the total annual ecosystem service values in Sanjiang Plain have declined by about 40\% between 1980 and 2000 (\$ 156284-182572.18 million in total over 20 years). This substantial decline is largely attributed to the 53.4\% loss of wetlands. For individual ecosystem functions, waste treatment, water supply and disturbance regulation account for more than 60\% to the total ecological values. During those two decades, the contribution of disturbance regulation, cultural and recreation decreased, while the contribution of water regulation, nutrient cycling, food production, raw materials and climate regulation increased during the same period. We also put forward a few proposals concerning the future land use policy formulation and sustainable ecosystems. They are adjusting the `food first' agricultural policy, establishing more nature reserves for wetlands, creating systems for the rational use of water, harnessing the degraded cultivated land and encouraging eco-tourism.},

Abstract = {Protected areas are experiencing increased levels of human pressure. To enable appropriate conservation action, it is critical to map and monitor changes in the type and extent of land cover/use and habitat classes, which can be related to human pressures over time. Satellite Earth observation (EO) data and techniques offer the opportunity to detect such changes. Yet association with field information and expert interpretation by ecologists is required to interpret, qualify and link these changes to human pressure. There is thus an urgent need to harmonize the technical background of experts in the field of EO data analysis with the terminology of ecologists, protected area management authorities and policy makers in order to provide meaningful, context-specific value-added EO products. This paper builds on the DPSIR framework, providing a terminology to relate the concepts of state, pressures, and drivers with the application of EO analysis. The type of pressure can be inferred through the detection of changes in state (i.e. changes in land cover and/or habitat type and/or condition). Four broad categories of changes in state are identified, i.e. land cover/habitat conversion, land cover/habitat modification, habitat fragmentation and changes in landscape connectivity, and changes in plant community structure. These categories of change in state can be mapped through EO analyses, with the goal of using expert judgement to relate changes in state to causal direct anthropogenic pressures. Drawing on expert knowledge, a set of protected areas located in diverse socio-ecological contexts and subject to a variety of pressures are analysed to (a) link the four categories of changes in state of land cover/habitats to the drivers (anthropogenic pressure), as relevant to specific target land cover and habitat classes; (b) identify (for pressure mapping) the most appropriate spatial and temporal EO data sources as well as interpretations from ecologists and field data useful in connection with EO data analysis. We provide detailed examples for two protected areas, demonstrating the use of EO data for detection of land cover/habitat change, coupled with expert interpretation to relate such change to specific anthropogenic pressures. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and feasibility of using EO data and techniques to identify anthropogenic pressures, suggesting additional research efforts required in this direction.

Title = {Decision tree (DT) and stacked vegetation indices based mangrove and non-mangrove discrimination using AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data: a study at Marine National Park (MNP) Jamnagar, Gulf of Kutch},
Journal = {WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Mangroves, vital salt-tolerant coastal forests, confer numerous societal benefits. However, mapping and monitoring these dense, coastal ecosystems is challenging due to limited field access. Leveraging recent hyperspectral remote sensing advancements, this study addresses this challenge. Hyperspectral imaging's narrow contiguous bands are potent for characterizing vegetation structure. The research centers on evaluating hyperspectral remote sensing potential, identifying suitable vegetation indices (VI) for the study area, and employing a multistage Decision Tree (DT) by stacking Vis at each stage to extract distinctive mangrove features. Mangrove attributes like unique leaf greenness, high canopy moisture, coastal-induced temperature moderation, and distinct shortwave infrared absorption contrast them from terrestrial vegetation. Various spectral Vegetation Indices (VI) capture these features by utilizing hyperspectral image bands across wavelengths. The proposed study employs Decision Tree (DT) classifier to optimize feature extraction for mangrove mapping by employing VI-based decision functions to discriminate mangroves from non-mangrove classes. Focused on the Marine National Park (MNP) in Jamnagar, Gulf of Kutch, the study exploits AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data. It employs the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) for vegetation separation, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) for elevated canopy moisture analysis, and Shortwave Infrared Absorption Depth (SIAD) to assess unique shortwave infrared absorption in mangroves. Moreover, it integrates the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI) and Normalized Difference Mangrove Index (NDMI) for mangrove recognition. Stacking these indices in a DT remarkably boosts classification accuracy, yielding a peak overall accuracy (OA) of 94.71\% and a kappa value (k) of 0.86. Published data and reports corroborate these results. This milestone furnishes preliminary insights into mangrove presence, vital for remote sensing-driven mapping and monitoring within challenging field-access environments. Furthermore, these findings pave the way for species-level discrimination via spectral matching and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.},

Title = {Integrated evaluation of Ecosystem Services in Prawn-Rice rotational crops, Vietnam},

Abstract = {The hydrologic condition in Kien Giang province on the west coast of Vietnam's Mekong Delta is unique in the sense that it has extensive saline water intrusion during the dry season every year. Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80\% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1\% and 59.4\% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions.

Abstract = {This study was carried out with the aim of feasibility evaluation of the application of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches for settling balance between economic development and environmental impact as well as to facilitate the respective decision-makings in Zemkan basin, west of Iran. The biobjectives of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches are minimizing the destructive effects on the environment (less erosion and sediments) and maximizing the economical incomes resulted from different land uses (more net present value). Satellite images were used for recognition of different land uses and the areas of these land use. In this study, the environmentalists and Zemkan basin users were selected as environmental and economical players, respectively. The results reveal that Nash bargaining solution, which is the result of the multi-objective game theory model, differs from Pareto optimalities, obtained through the classical multi-objective model. Nash bargaining solution offered more satisfactory solutions based on decision-makers' priorities. In addition, the overall results showed that the results of fuzzy programming approach were very close to the results of the multi-objective game theory model. Therefore, in both methods, the decision variables of semi-closed forest, open forest, non-irrigated agricultural lands and barren rocky lands were eliminated and the ones of rural areas, urban areas, and water body remained unchanged. The innovation of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches, which can be understood and interpreted well by decision makers, is setting a kind of balance between economic and environmental concerns in watershed management. The results also show that multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches can be applied to many other issues concerning the environmental management. The upcoming researches can concentrate on developing a third objective like social concerns and accordingly to-objective games would be applied instead of bi-objective ones.},

Abstract = {Coastline extraction is a fundamental work for coastal resource management and coastal environmental protection. Today, by using digital image processing techniques, coastline extraction can be done with remote sensing imagery systems. In this study, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imagery (OLI) data have been the main data source due to free access and sufficient spatial resolution for coast line extraction. This research is focused on determining the coastline length and measuring land area by using Landsat 8 OLI satellite image for Bodrum Peninsula, Turkey. Three commonly used methods have been applied in order to determine sea-land boundary line and its length, and area of the study area. The Automatic Water Extraction Index (AWEI), Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised classification technique and on screen digitizing method was chosen for identification of coastal boundaries. Results of coastline length and land areas of Bodrum by using AWEI, ISODATA and on-screen digitizing are compared with each other. This study shows that with using optimal threshold value, AWEI can be used for coast line extraction method with coherently for Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery. The overall results show that coastline extraction from satellite imagery can be done with sufficient accuracy using spectral water indices instead of time consuming on-screen digitizing.},

Abstract = {The analysis of the environmental situation in urban areas is of higher importance than ever because of the altered urban ecosystem itself and its impacts on ecosystem services for the rapidly growing urban population. A major challenge remains in developing methods to assess and value ecosystem services and integrate them in urban decision-making processes. In this paper, the urban environmental indicator ``Biotope Area Ratio{''} (BAR) is studied. We aim to analyse the benefits and limits of the BAR to assess and manage the urban ecosystem services using high resolution remote-sensing. We choose two urban environmental settings in Berlin and Seoul where the BAR has been already successfully applied. Results show that the BAR as is represents a valuable instrument and augments existing indicators but that there are modifications advisable to address recent challenges of ecosystem services in urban areas. For the successful implementation as a planning instrument we identify the legally required regulation in the planning process and the existence of reliable data as major challenges. The investigated high resolution remote-sensing based approach provides some advantages to map surface types of the urban environment for a first screening, monitoring and evaluation of implemented measures of the BAR and can therefore support existing field mappings. Insights from our study may stimulate developments of explicitly assessing and managing urban ecosystem services using aggregated indicators such as the BAR and may highlight the importance of a more adequate representation of the urban environment in decision-making processes in other cities in the future.

Title = {Assessment of the Urban Expansion and Its Impact on the Eco-Environment-A Case Study of Hefei Municipal Area},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {With the advancement of urbanization, the ecological environmental changes caused by the continuous expansion of cities have become a major concern. Thus, this study is based on a remote sensing image map of Hefei city from 1984 to 2020, which is now in the process of rapid development. We constructed an index system with ecological land, ecosystem service value, ecological environment quality, urban land expansion coefficient, urban heat island rate index, total pollutant emissions, ecological pressure, and ecological deficit, and then evaluated the ecological environment of Hefei city with the help of the entropy weight comprehensive evaluation method. The results show that (1) in the positive evaluation index, the ecological land area was reduced to half of the original area, the ecological service value was reduced by 0.37 times its initial value, and the eco-environmental index was <35 and still decreasing. (2) In the negative evaluation index, the urban heat island ratio index increased by nearly 10 times its initial value, the total emission of various pollutants increased by 6.64 times its initial value, the ecological deficit increased year by year after 1999, and the ecological pressure in 2020 increased to 3 times that in 1999. (3) The overall environmental score of the Hefei urban area has decreased by 48.6 times its initial value. The values of positive evaluation indexes are decreasing, whereas the values of negative evaluation indexes are increasing, and both these items are moving backward, leading to the decrease in the comprehensive ecological environmental score. It can be noticed that the urban expansion of Hefei has had a severe impact on the ecological environment, resulting in the continuous reduction in the ecological land area, a serious urban heat island effect, and continuous weakening of regional ecological service functions. The study results can be used for reference in alleviating the impacts of urban expansion on the environment, promoting the optimization of the urban landscape and the sustainable development of the social economy and environment.},

Title = {Mangrove plantation suitability mapping by integrating multi criteria decision making geospatial approach and remote sensing data},
Journal = {GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 5},
Abstract = {Mangroves are woody plant communities that appear in tropical and subtropical regions, mainly in intertidal zones along the coastlines. Despite their considerable benefits to humans and the surrounding environment, their existence is threatened by anthropogenic activities and natural drivers. Accordingly, it is vital to conduct efficient efforts to increase mangrove plantations by identifying suitable locations. These efforts are required to support conservation and plantation practices and lower the mortality rate of seedlings. Therefore, identifying ecologically potential areas for plantation practices is mandatory to ensure a higher success rate. This study aimed to identify suitable locations for mangrove plantations along the southern coastal frontiers of Hormozgan, Iran. To this end, we applied a hybrid Fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP (FDANP) model as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to determine the relative importance of different criteria, combined with geospatial and remote sensing data. In this regard, ten relevant sources of environmental criteria, including meteorological, topographical, and geomorphological, were used in the modeling. The statistical evaluation demonstrated the high potential of the developed approach for suitable location identification. Based on the final results, 6.10\% and 20.80\% of the study area were classified as very-high suitable and very-low suitable areas. The obtained values can elucidate the path for decision-makers and managers for better conservation and plantation planning. Moreover, the utility of charge-free remote sensing data allows cost-effective implementation of such an approach for other regions by interested researchers and governing organizations.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem based approach (EBA) for resource management is a concerted, environmentally tuned and an integrated framework that holistically addresses the ecological character of the natural resource, its societal benefit spectrum and its environmental functions. In this paper, the EBA concept is closely linked with the emerging concept of multiple use systems (MUS) while taking account of environmental, economic, and social factors that govern the ecosystems services and benefits. We elucidate a multi-scalar approach and multiple case studies to understand EBA particularly in context of a wetlandscape. At the global scale, Ramsar sites of international importance are geospatially analyzed with reference to their agro-ecology and biodiversity. At regional scale, the agrarian use of inland wetlands in India was re-evaluated taking account of database from a recent inland wetland inventory. At the local scale, drawing on the landscape characterization and the ecological economics for fresh water Lake Kolleru in India and the Muthurajawela Marsh-Negombo Lagoon coastal marsh in Sri Lanka, we illustrate some of the practical challenges in balancing wetland conservation, development needs and the overall well-being of local people. We also discuss how variability in the scale, geophysical characteristics of the site and the data availability confines the ability to simplify a single complete approach to address issues in complex ecosystem such as wetlands. All levels of the study are supported by a variety of earth observation data and the geographical information system (GIS) tools. The site level analysis also draws on socio-economic assessment tools.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal trade-offs of land multi-functionality and function zoning at finer township scale in the middle reaches of the Heihe River},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {115},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Trade-off occurs when two or more land use functions compete with each other, and high degree of trade-off tends to impede the maximization of land resource utility. Identifying the pattern of trade-offs among multiple land functions is an essential way to achieve sustainable land management. However, effective governance depends heavily on the trade-off information at finer scales which is difficult to acquire due to the challenges in collecting social and economic data at these scales. To overcome this limitation, we developed a framework to reveal the spatio-temporal pattern of land multi-functionality in the middle reaches of the Heihe River in 2006 and 2016 at the township scale by assimilating datasets from multiple sources especially including remote sensing and Internet-based geospatial data. Then we examined the trade-offs and synergy among different land functions by correlation analysis and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. Finally, we conducted land function zoning analysis using the k-means clustering method to get different zones for the purpose of land management. The results showed that land multi-functionality in the middle reaches of the Heihe River showed highly temporal and spatial variations, which was characterized by the strongest economic and social functions around town centers, the strongest environmental functions at the mountainous areas, and the prominent social functions in the ethnic towns. The quantified value of land multi-functionality increased rapidly by 35.0\% from 2006 to 2016 with economic, social and environmental function increasing by 61.4\%, 47.8\% and 6.4\% respectively. The trade-offs and synergies among land functions were complex. The synergy between economic function and social function was at a high level and stable, while the trade-off between environmental function and economic function was high but slightly weakened. We identified three hotspots of trade-offs and synergies among multiple land functions, which corresponded to low-intensity development, high-intensity development, and restrictive development for restoration and protection. Based on the trade-offs and synergies among land functions, we classified the study area into four zones, which were useful for land management. Our research highlights the use of Internet-based geospatial and remote sensing data to get fine-scale information about land multi-functionality, and provides scientific guidelines for sustainable land use.},

Title = {Integration of remote-sensing based metrics and econometric models to assess the socio-economic contributions of carbon sequestration in unmanaged tropical dry forests},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the global climate. Equally important are the socio-economic co-benefits of carbon sequestration, given their implications for designing policies focused on conservation or restoration of tropical forests. Much debate has been around how to account for, and maximize, the co-benefits of carbon sequestration. Prior research suggests that a better understanding of the spatial relationship between carbon sequestration potential and forest types and dynamics - as a function of geographical context and time - is needed to better estimate their socio-economic benefits. Hence, this paper uses the Tropical Dry Forests of Central and South America to propose a new approach to quantify carbon sequestration of this biome, and its efficiency, using time series of the Terra-MODIS satellite. Our estimations of carbon sequestration are then coupled with a benefit transfer approach to infer carbon sequestration's monetary cost. Results reveal that these tropical forests sequester an annual average of 22.3 +/- 3.3 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) or in total, 1.16 GtCO(2). The associated social cost of carbon, calculated using three econometric models, ranges from USD 489 ha(-1) yr(-1) to USD 2828 ha(-1) yr(-1). These results can open new perspectives regarding the benefits of carbon sequestration against the costs of the negative impacts of climate change for national welfare accounts, their relevance for environmental policy-making, and the implementation or monitoring of carbon-based incentive programs (e.g., WAVES).},

Title = {Valuing map validation: The need for rigorous land cover map accuracy assessment in economic valuations of ecosystem services},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {23-28},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Valuations of ecosystem services often use data on land cover class areal extent. Area estimates from land cover maps may be biased by misclassification error resulting in flawed assessments and inaccurate valuations. Adjustment for misclassification error is possible for maps subjected to a rigorous validation programme including an accuracy assessment. Unfortunately, validation is rare and/or poorly undertaken as often not regarded as a high priority. The benefit of map validation and hence its value is indicated with two maps. The International Geosphere Biosphere Programme's DISCover map was used to estimate wetland value globally. The latter changed from US\$ 1.92 trillion yr(-1) to US\$ 2.79 trillion yr(-1) when adjusted for misclassification bias. For the conterminous USA, ecosystem services value based on six land cover classes from the National Land Cover Database (2006) changed from US\$ 1118 billion yr(-1) to US\$ 600 billion yr(-1) after adjustment for misclassification bias. The effect of error-adjustment on the valuations indicates the value of map validation to rigorous evidence-based science and policy work in relation to aspects of natural capital. The benefit arising from validation was orders of magnitude larger than mapping costs and it is argued that validation should be a high priority in mapping programmes and inform valuations.

Title = {Modelization of the socio-ecological systems for the elaboration of a referential framework for the environmental and territorial sustainability: application in the massif du Fouta-Djalon (Guinea)},
Journal = {CYBERGEO-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Abstract = {This research has evaluated the interface of society-space-resources dynamics in the Massif of the Fouta-Djalon from a perspective of sustainable environmental and territorial decision taking. It combines remote sensing and systemic modelization to analyse the dynamics of the territorial system. From the treatment of Landsat satellite images from 1975, 1985, and 2006, the retrospective land occupation of 31 years is characterized. It shows an expansion of the inhabited and agro pastoral territory against the forestry one. The universe of possible future of the socioecological system of the massif was analysed over 150 years through three scenarios. The scenarios are ``constant value{''}, fluctuation mini-max{''} and ``continued annual growth{''} Those scenarios showed that the territorial system of the future is worrying from the ecological perspective and also from the social stability perspective. After the analyse of these scenarios, the best future perspective of the territorial system is presented in the ``sustainable acceptable{''} scenario or durability model. An implementation scheme accompanies this model of integrated and sustainable administration of territory and environment.},

Title = {Ocean colour opportunities from Meteosat Second and Third Generation geostationary platforms},
Journal = {OCEAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {703-713},
Abstract = {Ocean colour applications from medium-resolution polar-orbiting satellite sensors have now matured and evolved into operational services. These applications are enabled by the Sentinel-3 OLCI space sensors of the European Earth Observation Copernicus programme and the VIIRS sensors of the US Joint Polar Satellite System programme. Key drivers for the Copernicus ocean colour services are the national obligations of the EU member states to report on the quality of marine, coastal and inland waters for the EU Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Further applications include CO2 sequestration, carbon cycle and climate, fisheries and aquaculture management, near-real-time alerting to harmful algae blooms, environmental monitoring and forecasting, and assessment of sediment transport in coastal waters. Ocean colour data from polar-orbiting satellite platforms, however, suffer from fractional coverage, primarily due to clouds, and inadequate resolution of quickly varying processes. Ocean colour remote sensing from geostationary platforms can provide significant improvements in coverage and sampling frequency and support new applications and services. EUMETSAT's SEVIRI instrument on the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation platforms (MSG) is not designed to meet ocean colour mission requirements, however, it has been demonstrated to provide valuable contribution, particularly in combination with dedicated ocean colour polar observations. This paper describes the ongoing effort to develop operational ocean colour water turbidity and related products and user services from SEVIRI. SEVIRI's multi-temporal capabilities can benefit users requiring improved local-area coverage and frequent diurnal observations. A survey of user requirements and a study of technical capabilities and limitations of the SEVIRI instruments are the basis for this development and are described in this paper. The products will support monitoring of sediment transport, water clarity, and tidal dynamics by providing hourly coverage and long-term time series of the diurnal observations. Further products and services are anticipated from EUMETSAT's FCI instruments on Meteosat Third Generation satellites (MTG), including potential chlorophyll a products.},

Title = {Landscape Evolution and It's Impact of Ecosystem Service Value of the Wuhan City, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization and industrialization and enhanced ecological protection measures have greatly influenced landscape change, which has exacerbated regional landscape competition and conflicts and indirectly affected the supply of ecosystem services. Clarifying the relationship between ecosystem service change and landscape change is useful for understanding the impact of ecosystem conversion on socio-economic development and providing a knowledge base for relevant policy decisions. In this study, we used remote sensing technology to process Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imageries, combined with transformation analysis and kernel density analysis to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of land use change in Wuhan City from 1980 to 2020. We also estimated the ESV in the region using the improved unit area value equivalent method to reveal the trends of ESV changes in Wuhan. The results showed that land use changes in Wuhan during 1980-2020 occurred mainly in terms of decreases in farmland, forestland, and bare land, as well as increases in built-up land and water bodies. The built-up land was mainly concentrated in the main urban areas, but its area in each suburban area has increased in recent years. In contrast, farmland was mainly distributed in suburban areas, and its area has been decreasing in recent years due to the impact of urban expansion. However, the reduction is compensated for by the reclamation of ecological land such as grassland and forestland, which has aggravated the loss of ecosystem service values in the study area. In addition, human activities such as urban expansion have increased the demand for water resources, while also leading to ecological problems such as water scarcity and water quality degradation, which have caused serious losses to key ecosystem services in Wuhan city. Therefore, in order to alleviate the competition and conflicts in the landscape and mitigate the loss of ecosystem service values in this area, we have proposed some constructive suggestions for future urban planning and water quality improvements in Wuhan. The focus of these suggestions is on controlling the expansion of built-up land, as well as the conservation of ecological land and resource protection. Meanwhile, our findings can also provide reference information for land resource planning and ecological monitoring, and help researchers to understand the contribution of ecosystem service functions in relation to socio-economic development.},

Abstract = {Biomedical waste is among the most significant sources, which threaten the global environmental health hazard. The adverse effects on our environment due to biomedical waste can be reduced through the selection of appropriate land-fill site. Multi-criteria of site selection depending on consideration of the various factors concerning road/transport network, land use, surface water, geomorphology, geology, habitation/residential areas, soil texture, and groundwater table and the use of different thematic layers assessment method seems unavoidable. The present investigation involves the utility of geospatial data and GIS techniques, which is an important tool for the creation of database for various thematic maps. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is an especially useful and structured approach to compare and assigning of weight, relative importance, and decision-making analysis. In the study area IRS-IC/ID satellite's 23.5 m, Landsat 30 m spatial resolution, and ground truth data have been used to couple with the AHP method. The study presents the results based on geospatial data, GIS and AHP method is an endeavor to identify and mark the most suitable site for disposed-off the biomedical waste in Lucknow city, Uttar Pradesh, India.},

Abstract = {We describe the design, implementation and performance of a novel airborne system, which integrates commercial waveform LiDAR, CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) camera and hyperspectral sensors into a common platform system. CAF's (The Chinese Academy of Forestry) LiCHy (LiDAR, CCD and Hyperspectral) Airborne Observation System is a unique system that permits simultaneous measurements of vegetation vertical structure, horizontal pattern, and foliar spectra from different view angles at very high spatial resolution (similar to 1 m) on a wide range of airborne platforms. The horizontal geo-location accuracy of LiDAR and CCD is about 0.5 m, with LiDAR vertical resolution and accuracy 0.15 m and 0.3 m, respectively. The geo-location accuracy of hyperspectral image is within 2 pixels for nadir view observations and 5-7 pixels for large off-nadir observations of 55 degrees with multi-angle modular when comparing to LiDAR product. The complementary nature of LiCHy's sensors makes it an effective and comprehensive system for forest inventory, change detection, biodiversity monitoring, carbon accounting and ecosystem service evaluation. The LiCHy system has acquired more than 8000 km(2) of data over typical forests across China. These data are being used to investigate potential LiDAR and optical remote sensing applications in forest management, forest carbon accounting, biodiversity evaluation, and to aid in the development of similar satellite configurations. This paper describes the integration of the LiCHy system, the instrument performance and data processing workflow. We also demonstrate LiCHy's data characteristics, current coverage, and potential vegetation applications.},

Abstract = {Underground infrastructures and buildings are new urban forms. This paper will give an overview of the strategic framework for developing and managing urban underground space (UUS) development, which represents a rational iterative process going through steps of -criteria framing{''}, -data building{''}, -city-scale zoning{''}, -project-scale evaluating{''}, -decision analyzing{''}, and -policy making{''}. Each step will be illustrated in detail, while we will mainly focus on project evaluation by introducing new urban economic indicators, and on decision analysis by using decision criteria in scenario analysis. Optimization of urban underground space use has to take into account social-economic demand and supply capacity of geo-space resources. Urban development land can be classified based on a zoning system mapping subsurface integrated quality, which is an indicator combining engineering constructability and development value of below-ground space. Based on this macro-zoning of UUS at a city scale, high potential land parcels can be selected or stock-taken for short-term development, while special protection area can he reserved for valuable geo-resources protection for long-term use. An economic model is developed to perform micro-analysis for project scenario evaluation. Two economic indicators (-underground development rate{''} and -underground premium{''}) will help to integrate underground options into real-estate project appraisal. The decision criteria will take into account direct and indirect costs generated along the project life cycle, developer gains and social benefits for the whole community, opportunities for synergetic resources exploitation (e.g. geothermal energy use), and risks induced by sectorial development patterns (e.g groundwater damage). These main criteria of cost, benefit, opportunity and risk are useful for decision-makers to promote urban subsurface projects in a sustainable way. At the end, a multi-criteria decision-making process with perthrmance indicators will be demonstrated, designed to guide strategic development and policy making. The improvement in policy baking will further change the -criteria flaming{''} for successful underground development practices, enabling a continuous improvement cycle for underground space managemeny in urban areas.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems provide a number of functions that are essential to human existence and well-being. However, anthropogenic activities and climate change are severely pressuring these ecosystem services. Changes in land use/cover (LU/LC) induced by human activities affect the environment's ecosystem and alter the ecosystem services value (ESV). Decision-making on development based on ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment is significant for the sustainable utilization of resources. In the current study, Beijing in China from 1995 to 2015 and Freetown in Sierra Leone from 2000 to 2018 were used for monitoring the change in (LU/LC) and ecosystem services. To investigate the changes in ESV utilizing an ESV model, cross-sectional field research, GIS technology and economic valuation of natural capital were all combined. In Beijing, land use and land cover (LU/LC) were as follows: forest > farm > urban > water in all periods of the investigated sites. Furthermore, LULC in Freetown was as follows: dense vegetation > spare vegetation > urban > bare > water in 2018. Changes in LU/LC in two areas reflect the trend toward the agriculture sector. Prediction of LU/LC showed a significant decrease in the agriculture areas in Beijing and Freetown that negatively affected the ecosystem. Results showed a lower ESV after prediction than before prediction in Beijing and Freetown, with loss and decrease in ESV caused by excessive economic benefits. Results showed that dense vegetation contributed the most to ecosystem services overall. The finding from this work indicated that for better sustainable ecosystem services, effective land-use regulations should be taken to control vegetation deterioration and protect water bodies.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing imagery is the most suitable tool for monitoring, managing, and evaluating land -use overlay fluctuations, especially forest cover for large areas. Free-and medium-resolution satellite imagery is a useful tool that allows scientific researchers and management organiza-tions to monitor forest development in developing countries, such as Vietnam. In this study, we used SPOT 4 and Planet remote sensing data to assess land-use status fluctuations in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau area, Vietnam, between 2000 and 2021 (the overall accuracy was 90.52\%, Kappa value = 0.89). The results showed that from 2000 to 2010, the rate of natural forest loss in this area was 0.32\%/year, of which, more than 6500 ha were converted to other uses. Between 2010 and 2021, the rate of natural forest loss gradually decreased (0.09\%/year) instead of fluctuating between different types of land use. The area of forests, perennial crop land, and annual crop land tended to increase from 2000 to 2010; however, from 2010 to 2021, the area of plantation forests decreased markedly, while the area of perennial crop land and annual crop land continued to expand. The analysis of the policies on forest management, exploitation, and protection was applied locally, to explain the causes of the change in spatiotemporal aspects of the types of land -use cover in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. Restoring forest areas during 2010-2021 initially improved effectiveness in forest management and protection. Furthermore, the results provide a better understanding of the current position and role of the government apparatus, cadres, and ethnic minorities in socioeconomic development associated with forest protection and develop-ment on the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. The results of this study can help managers monitor annual forest-cover fluctuations based on free remote sensing imagery to reduce both the cost of man-agement and surveying, yielding relatively accurate results.},

Title = {Remote Sensing of Mangroves and Estuarine Communities in Central Queensland, Australia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Great Barrier Reef catchments are under pressure from the effects of climate change, landscape modifications, and hydrology alterations. With the use of remote sensing datasets covering large areas, conventional methods of change detection can expose broad transitions, whereas workflows that excerpt data for time-series trends divulge more subtle transformations of land cover modification. Here, we combine both these approaches to investigate change and trends in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, that encompasses a national park and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. Nine information classes were compiled in a maximum likelihood post classification change analysis in 2004-2017. Mangroves decreased (1146 hectares), as was the case with estuarine wetland (1495 hectares), and saltmarsh grass (1546 hectares). The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2017 land cover maps were 85\%, 88\%, 88\%, 89\%, 81\%, and 92\%, respectively. The cumulative area of open forest, estuarine wetland, and saltmarsh grass (1628 hectares) was converted to pasture in a thematic change analysis showing the ``from-to{''} change. We generated linear regression relationships to examine trends in pixel values across the time series. Our findings from a trend analysis showed a decreasing trend (p value range = 0.001-0.099) in the vegetation extent of open forest, fringing mangroves, estuarine wetlands, saltmarsh grass, and grazing areas, but this was inconsistent across the study site. Similar to reports from tropical regions elsewhere, saltmarsh grass is poorly represented in the national park. A severe tropical cyclone preceding the capture of the 2017 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image was likely the main driver for reduced areas of shoreline and stream vegetation. Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on coastal ecosystem dynamics to enable planning to achieve more effective conservation outcomes.},

Abstract = {Since the reform and opening-up, the society and economy of China has rapidly developing, and the living standard of person has been greatly improved. However, along with the rapid economic development, China is facing a series of environmental problems such as ecological destruction, environmental pollution and land degradation etc. It is essential to conduct an in-depth research on the existing environmental problems in China. According to the carrying capacity assessment of land and resources, using multi-source remote sensing data such as MODIS data, nighttime light data as well as the socio-economic statistics and meteorological data from 2002 to 2013, the evaluation model of the national ecological environmental quality is established based on the combination of multi-criteria decision making algorithms and principal component analysis. The assessment model of ecological environmental quality is verified by comparing the evaluation results of two different models: environmental performance index, ecological carrying capacity and eco-environmental quality index. All of results have shown a downward trend. Lastly, the better relationship between the ecological environmental quality and the ecological carrying capacity is established. The R-squared reaches 0.5023 and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.7087, which reveals the reliability and scientificity of the ecological environmental quality assessment model of China constructed in this study. The results show that the quality of ecological environment in China shows a downward trend in general. The area of the eco-environmental quality index between 0.6-0.8 performs a downward trend temporally, and then it decreased to the value between 0.4-0.6. The boundary between 0.4-0.6 and 0.6-0.8 spread southward.},

Title = {Comparison of PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and landsat 8 data in soybean yield estimation within-field variability with random forest regression},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Accurate timely and early-season crop yield estimation within the field variability is important for precision farming and sustainable management applications. Therefore, the ability to estimate the within-field variability of grain yield is crucial for ensuring food security worldwide, especially under climate change. Several Earth observation systems have thus been developed to monitor crops and predict yields. Despite this, new research is required to combine multiplatform data integration, advancements in satellite technologies, data processing, and the application of this discipline to agricultural practices. This study provides further developments in soybean yield estimation by comparing multisource satellite data from PlanetScope (PS), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat 8 (L8) and introducing topographic and meteorological variables. Herein, a new method of combining soybean yield, global positioning systems, harvester data, climate, topographic variables, and remote sensing images has been demonstrated. Soybean yield shape points were obtained from a combine-harvester-installed GPS and yield monitoring system from seven fields over the 2021 season. The yield estimation models were trained and validated using random forest, and four vegetation indices were tested. The result showed that soybean yield can be accurately predicted at 3-, 10-, and 30-m resolutions with mean absolute error (MAE) value of 0.091 t/ha for PS, 0.118 t/ha for S2, and 0.120 t/ha for L8 data (root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.111, 0.076). The combination of the environmental data with the original bands provided further improvements and an accurate yield estimation model within the soybean yield variability with MAE of 0.082 t/ha for PS, 0.097 t/ha for S2, and 0.109 t/ha for L8 (RMSE of 0.094, 0.069, and 0.108 t/ha). The results showed that the optimal date to predict the soybean yield within the field scale was approximately 60 or 70 days before harvesting periods during the beginning bloom stage. The developed model can be applied for other crops and locations when suitable training yield data, which are critical for precision farming, are available.},

Title = {Changes in Ecosystem Service Values in Response to the Planting of Eucalyptus and Acacia Species in the Gilgel Abay Watershed, Northwest Ethiopia},
Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Plantation of Eucalyptus and Acacia species emerges as a promising alternative in the tropics in a scenario of high demand for provisional and regulating ecosystem services. The research aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem service values in response to planting practices of Eucalyptus and Acacia species in the Gilgel Abay watershed, Northwest Ethiopia. The threshold values of NDVI were employed to classify land-use/covers using cloud-free satellite imagery data in 1984, 1998, 2013, and 2021. The benefit transfer method of modified value coefficient was used to estimate ecosystem service values (ESVs) of the study watershed. Total ESV decreased from 1984 to 1998 due to the expansion of cultivated land at the expense of natural forests, shrubs, and grasslands. As food production increased, performance levels of climate regulation, erosion control, and nutrient cycle declined. In contrast, the service values of erosion control, climate regulation, and nutrient cycles were the major contributors to the overall increase in ESV from 1998 to 2021. This was caused by expanding Acacia and Eucalyptus species plantation at the expense of cultivated land in the watershed. The research revealed a trade-off relationship between provisional and other ecosystem services, such as regulating and supporting ecosystem service values in response to land-use system transformation. As a result, it is suggested that synergistic interactions between regulating, provisional, and supporting ecosystem service values be developed by merging plantation and cultivated land. Maintaining the right proportions of degraded plantations, protected natural forests, farmlands, and wetland ecosystems can be the most effective way to provide optimal multiple ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Under the background of ecological civilization construction and the overall planning of land and space, it is particularly important to explore the land use ecosystem service value and its zoning control. This paper, taking Chayu County, a typical alpine valley area of southeast Tibet as an example and based on the remote sensing interpretation data of three periods in 2000, 2010 and 2020, employs the three-level spatial scale from the village level, the township level to the county level to converge step by step, and uses a series of model algorithms to analyze and calculate the regional ecosystem service value and their dynamic changes, as well as spatial agglomeration and regional type division. The research shows that the land use types mainly consist of forest land, grassland and unused land, whose overall change range is small during the study period. The conversion of land use types is mainly between forest land, grassland and unused land and the land use index generally presents a spatial pattern of ``high in the southwest and low in the northeast{''}, showing a decreasing trend to some degree. ESVI generally presents a differentiation pattern of ``high in the west and low in the east{''}, with obvious spatial differentiation characteristics of kernel density, significant clustering and distribution characteristics and stable variation range, displaying an overall spatial pattern with characteristics of ``dense in the west and sparse in the east, high in the north and low in the south{''}. Based on the administrative village scale, the study area is divided into three different types of land use ecological function areas: habitat maintenance function area, biological protection function area and production support function area. Differentiated approaches to appropriate development and construction and the corresponding optimization paths of ecological protection will be put forward.},

Abstract = {The Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas is an agriculturally rich area supporting intensive production of vegetables, fruits, grain sorghum, and cotton. Modern agricultural practices involve the combined use of irrigation with the application of large amounts of agrochemicals to maximize crop yields. Intensive agricultural activities in past decades might have caused potential contamination of soil, surface water.. and groundwater due to leaching of pesticides in the vadose zone. In an effort to promote precision farming in citrus production, this paper aims at developing an airborne multispectral technique for identifying tree health problems in a citrus grove that can be combined with variable rate technology (VRT) for required pesticide application and environmental modeling for assessment of pollution prevention. An unsupervised linear unmixing method was applied to classify the image for the grove and quantify the symptom severity for appropriate infection control. The PRZM-3 model was used to estimate environmental impacts that contribute to nonpoint source pollution with and without the use of multispectral remote sensing and VRT. Research findings using site-specific environmental assessment clearly indicate that combination of remote sensing and VRT may result in benefit to the environment by reducing the nonpoint source pollution by 92.15\%. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of precision farming for citrus production in the nexus of industrial ecology and agricultural sustainability. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP(1,2)) is a joint response of German Earth observation research institutions, value-adding (VA) resellers and space industry to the increasing demand on accurate, quantitative information about the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems. With its hyperspectral capabilities covering the visible, nearand short-wave infrared wavelengths, EnMAP will provide high quality, standardized, and consistent data on a timely and frequent basis. Its primary focus will be on the considerable improvement of already standardized products and the development of new quantitative and highly informative data and its derivatives. Only an imaging spectrometer, such as EnMAP, can resolve and detect biophysical, biochemical, and geochemical variables in distinct detail. This will tremendously increase our understanding of coupled biospheric and geospheric processes and thus, enable the management to ensure the sustainability of our vital resources. After a successfully accomplished phase A, EnMAP has been approved by the German Aerospace Agency in the beginning of 2006. The instrument performance allows for a detailed monitoring, characterisation and parameter extraction of vegetation targets, rock/soils, and inland and coastal waters on a global scale. By the scientific lead of the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) and the industrial prime ship of Kayser-Threde, the ongoing planning aims towards an internationalisation of the mission approach. The EnMAP instrument provides information based on 218 contiguous spectral bands in the wavelength range from 420 nm to 2450 nm. It is characterized by a SNR of > 500:1 in the VNIR and an SNR of > 150:1 in the SWIR range at a ground resolution of 30 m x 30 m.},

Title = {Application of GIS-based multi-criteria decision making analysis (GIS-MCDA) in selecting locations most suitable for siting engineered landfills - the case of Ashanti Region, Ghana},

Abstract = {Purpose The study aimed to use geographic information system (GIS) based multi-criteria decision making analysis (GIS-MCDA) to select areas suitable for siting landfills in Ashanti region. It also sought to ascertain variables most sensitive to the siting of landfill in the region. Design/methodology/approach This study utilized GIS-based Multi-criteria decision making analysis -AHP to model and select areas most suitable to siting landfills within the region. Overall, 16 variables including wind speed and hydraulic conductivity (which were previously neglected in landfill siting in Ghana) were identified through comprehensive literature review. These variables were weighted using AHP method and integrated using the weighted linear combination (WLC) in GIS environment to develop five sub-models: the physical environmental, sociocultural, economic/technical, climatic and hydrogeological sub-models. These sub-models were further weighted and then integrated to derive the final suitability model. Findings Results show that 13\% (3,067 km(2)) of the region was identified as most suitable to siting engineered landfills. The study also identified 11 sites which are considered most suitable for situating landfills. On a sensitivity angle, hydrogeological (R-2 = 0.5923; p = 0.003) and physical environmental sub-model (R-2 = 0.254; p = 0.034) significantly predicted the final suitability model developed. Practical implications Ghana's Landfill Guidelines seeks to optimize site selection and ancillary services that culminate into achieving sanitary landfills by 2020. Evidence still abounds on the unsuitability of existing and in some cases, new landfill sites presenting environmental and social negative impacts. The comprehensive evaluation of most crucial variables - social and environmental factors that determine an optimal landfill location - will be of immense help to policy planners like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) towards upgraded landfills. The authors hope that, concerned agencies will adopt the model in the study and integrate into their existing landfill suitability modeling techniques to provide a more grounded framework that optimizes landfill site selection within the study area. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to consider a regional-level waste collection site selection in Ghana using comprehensive sets of social and environmental factors and will therefore contribute immensely to EPA's goal of achieving upgraded landfills by 2022.},

Abstract = {Evaluating the impact of an ecological restoration program on ecosystem services is crucial, given the role of such a program in boosting sustainable ecosystem management. This study examines the impact of one of the large-scale ecological restoration programs in China, the Grain for Green Program (GGP), on ecosystem service management in the Exibei region of China. This region is studied, as it is a key source water area with rich biodiversity and has been experiencing GGP for 20 years. To achieve the stated goal the changes of land use and ecosystem services value (ESV) and the ecosystem services scarcity value (ESSV) in the Exibei region were quantified and assessed based on remote sensing images from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and field survey data. The results indicated that the expansion of construction land and the increase of water body were the dominant land use changes throughout the study period. Farmland, forestland and grassland decreased by 2.61\%, 0.47\% and 1.41\% after the GGP, respectively. The ESV of the entire Exibei region increased slightly in response to land use change during 1990-2015, with an annual loss of 0.08\% before the implementation of GGP and an annual growth of 0.03\% after the implementation of GGP. Moreover, forestland was the dominant contributor to ESSV after the implementation of the GGP. Its annual growth rate was four times higher than before the commencement of GGP. The results of this study contribute to the protection of the Exibei region ecosystem, and more importantly, the future management of the ecosystem service in the hilly regions of southern China.},

Abstract = {In the central and northern highlands of Ethiopia, native forest and forest biodiversity is almost confined to sacred groves associated with churches. Local communities rely on these `church forests' for essential ecosystem services including shade and fresh water but little is known about their region-wide distribution and conservation value. We(1) performed the first large-scale spatially-explicit assessment of church forests, combining remote-sensing and field data, to assess the number of forests, their size, shape, isolation and woody plant species composition, (2) determined their plant communities and related these to environmental variables and potential natural vegetation, (3) identified the main challenges to biodiversity conservation in view of plant population dynamics and anthropogenic disturbances, and (4) present guidelines for management and policy. The 394 forests identified in satellite images were on average similar to 2 ha in size and generally separated by similar to 2 km from the nearest neighboring forest. Shape complexity, not size, decreased from the northern to the central highlands. Overall, 148 indigenous tree, shrub and liana species were recorded across the 78 surveyed forests. Patch a-diversity increased with mean annual precipitation, but typically only 25 woody species occurred per patch. The combined results showed that >50\% of tree species present in tropical northeast Africa were still present in the 78 studied church forests, even though individual forests were small and relatively species-poor. Tree species composition of church forests varied with elevation and precipitation, and resembled the potential natural vegetation. With a wide distribution over the landscape, these church forests have high conservation value. However, long-term conservation of biodiversity of individual patches and evolutionary potential of species may be threatened by isolation, small sizes of tree species populations and disturbance, especially when considering climate change. Forest management interventions are essential and should be supported by environmental education and other forms of public engagement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatially Explicit Mapping of Soil Conservation Service in Monetary Units Due to Land Use/Cover Change for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Studies of land use/cover change (LUCC) and its impact on ecosystem service (ES) in monetary units can provide information that governments can use to identify where protection and restoration is economically most important. Translating ES in monetary units into decision making strongly depends on the availability of spatially explicit information on LUCC and ES. Yet such datasets are unavailable for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) despite its perceived soil conservation service value (SCSV). The availability of remote sensing-based datasets and advanced GIS techniques has enhanced the potential of spatially explicit ES mapping exercises. Here, we first explored LUCC in the TGRA for four time periods (1995-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010, and 2010-2015). Then, applying a value transfer method with an equivalent value factor spatialized using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), we estimated the changes of monetary SCSV in response to LUCC in a spatially explicit way. Finally, the sensitivity of SCSV changes in response to LUCC was determined. Major findings: (i) Expansion of construction land and water bodies and contraction of cropland characterized the LUCC in all periods. Their driving factors include the relocation of residents, construction of the Three Gorges Dam, urbanization, and the Grain for Green Program; (ii) The SCSV for TGRA was generally stable for 1995-2015, declining slightly (<1\%), suggesting a sustainable human-environment relationship in the TGRA. The SCSV prevails in regions with elevations (slopes) of 400-1600 m (0 degrees-10 degrees); for Chongqing and its surrounding regions it decreased significantly during 1995-2015; (iii) SCSV's sensitivity index was 1.04, 0.53, 0.92, and 1.25 in the four periods, respectively, which is generally low. Chongqing and its surrounding regions, with their pervasive urbanization and dense populations, had the highest sensitivity. For 1995-2015, 70.63\% of the study area underwent increases in this sensitivity index. Our results provide crucial information for policymaking concerning ecological conservation and compensation.},

Title = {Monetized Estimates of the Ecosystem Service Value of Urban Blue and Green Infrastructure and Analysis: A Case Study of Changsha, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Urban blue-green infrastructure (BGI) forms the basis of a regional ecosystem. Quantitative calculations can identify the weak points of a typical ecological environment, which is helpful for providing a basis for the spatial planning and ecological environment protection of developing cities. Currently, assessment of BGI ecosystem services focuses on local temperature, climate, and entertainment aesthetics, and the integrity of ecological indicators needs improvement. The assessment is usually conducted within large blue-green areas such as parks and rivers, and street greening is typically ignored. Roof gardens and unmanaged blue-green spaces also have ecosystem service functions. Therefore, our study aimed to extract the basic design distribution of urban blue-green spaces more accurately and monetize the value of its ecosystem services. Changsha, one of the top ten ecologically competitive cities in China, was the research focus. First, four types of BGI, forest, grassland, wetland, and waterbody, were extracted using remote sensing images and ArcGIS10.8. Second, the adjusted value coefficient was used to quantify the service value and geographic spatial distribution of the four BGI ecosystems in monetary terms. The results showed that in 2020, the total economic value of ecosystem services (ESV) generated by BGI in the study area was CNY 36.25 billion. Among ecosystem services, forest land climate regulation and waterbody hydrological regulation accounted for the largest proportion, at CNY 6.543 and 15.132 billion, respectively. The urban center had the weakest climate regulation capacity, and the Xiangjiang River Basin had the strongest hydrological regulation capacity. The urban center had the lowest ESV, thus requiring the attention of urban planners in the future. This study evaluated and optimized the distribution of BGI in Changsha according to the ESV of the existing BGI to help improve the ESV of the city center and create a green, ecological, and healthy city.},

Title = {Satellite Ocean Color Based Harmful Algal Bloom Indicators for Aquaculture Decision Support in the Southern Benguela},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {The aquaculture industry of southern Africa faces environmental threats from harmful algal blooms (HABs), which have the potential to cause devastating economic losses (Pitcher et al., 2019). Satellite earth observation offers a systematic and cost effective method for operational monitoring of HABs over large areas. Whilst the chlorophyll-a concentration ({[}Chl-a]) product, often used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, can be used to indicate high biomass blooms (elevated biomass against a background signal of 5-10 mgChl m(-3)), there is a clear need for value-added products that not only alert on bloom presence, but also on the bloom type and persistence. This study demonstrates the identification of different phytoplankton communities that can feasibly be identified in bloom concentrations from space, relevant to the aquaculture industry of South Africa. In terms of water-leaving reflectance, 76 \% of the variance in the red and NIR spectral region is significantly positively correlated to phytoplankton abundance, {[}Chl-a], and the maximum line height (MLH) (defined as the height of the maximum reflectance peak above a baseline between 665 and 753 nm). The MLH is related to dominant phytoplankton types derived from phytoplankton count data, in order to identify thresholds which represent blooms that pose a high hypoxia and/or toxicity risk; whilst 0.0016 < MLH < 0.003 represent low to moderate concern mixed assemblage blooms, MLH > 0.003 has a strong likelihood of indicating high biomass dinoflagellate or Pseudo-nitzschia blooms. These techniques are routinely used by the aquaculture industry in South Africa for decision support and risk mitigation. The high biomass nature of the South African regional waters provide strong assemblage-related spectral variability, which can be exploited with the spectral bands of OLCI and MERIS. Application to these sensors not only ensures future monitoring capability, but also allows the creation of a historical risk climatology that can guide the site selection of industries sensitive to the presence of HABs, such as aquaculture facilities and desalination plants.},

Title = {Patterns of landscape seasonality influence passerine diversity: Implications for conservation management under global change},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {117-125},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The importance of environmental heterogeneity for biodiversity across scales is widely recognized in ecological theory and profusely supported by evidence. However, our understanding of the effects of spatiotemporal patterns of landscape functional properties on biodiversity is still rather limited. We examined the relationship between common passerine species richness and ecosystem functioning dynamics, namely seasonality, measured by satellite remote sensing. We focused on rural landscapes of a mountain National Park in Portugal undergoing rapid reshaping from agro-pastoral mosaics to early successional landscapes. We applied multi-model inference to compare the hypothesis of landscape seasonality as a driver of species richness with three competing hypotheses representing structural habitat heterogeneity, disturbance, and availability of food resources. We found support for landscape seasonality and its spatial heterogeneity in explaining passerine richness in mountain rural landscapes. Conversely, no significant support of the remaining hypotheses was found. These results highlight the role of ecosystem functioning variability in space and time. They also stress the importance of considering species-energy relationships for conservation at the landscape level. Specifically, they provide support and guidance to the identification of meaningful functional attributes of the landscape that shape its biodiversity. Our results further demonstrate the utility of remote sensing approaches and products to measure those attributes and follow their trends through time. Spatially-explicit measures of energy variability, such as the functional amplitude between winter and summer retrieved from earth observations, can link global socio-environmental change to species' responses and support the inclusion of landscape seasonality on conservation and monitoring frameworks.},

Title = {Ecosystem Services Assessment of Two Watersheds of Lancang River in Yunnan, China with a Decision Tree Approach},
Journal = {AMBIO},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {In the Langcang (Upper-Mekong) watershed, degraded watershed ecosystems in upland areas threaten cultivation practices, water resources, and dam development downstream. Assessment of ecosystem services and the factors that threaten them is an important first step to support watershed management. This, however, requires detailed information that is often missing in mountainous regions. To overcome this, in this paper, we adopt a decision tree approach to assess protection, biodiversity, and production services in two mountainous watersheds (Fengqing and Xiaojie) of the Lancang River Basin. Decision tree rules were built on the basis of field surveys, available references, ecosystem maps derived from remote sensing, expert knowledge, basic topographic information, and community interviews. Decision tree results showed that forest cover and agro-forestry practices contribute greatly to improved ecosystem functioning in the Fengqing Catchment compared to the Xiaojie Catchment. The results were consistent with field observations. The decision tree method proved to be a suitable and flexible tool for the rapid assessment of watershed ecosystem services, for highlighting those areas that need more in-depth research, and for guiding watershed and ecosystem management.},

Title = {A machine-learning approach to human footprint index estimation with applications to sustainable development},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The human footprint index (HFI) is an extensively used tool for interpreting the accelerating pressure of humanity on Earth. Up to now, the process of creating the HFI has required significant data and modeling, and updated versions of the index often lag the present day by many years. Here we introduce a near-present, global-scale machine learning-based HFI (ml-HFI) which is capable of routine update using satellite imagery alone. We present the most up-to-date map of the HFI, and document changes in human pressure during the past 20 years (2000-2019). Moreover, we demonstrate its utility as a monitoring tool for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15), `Life on Land', which aims to foster sustainable development while conserving biodiversity. We identify 43 countries that are making progress toward SDG15 while also experiencing increases in their ml-HFI. We examine a subset of these in the context of conservation policies that may or may not enable continued progress toward SDG15. This has immediate policy relevance, since the majority of countries globally are not on track to achieve Goal 15 by the declared deadline of 2030. Moving forward, the ml-HFI may be used for ongoing monitoring and evaluation support toward the twin goals of fostering a thriving society and global Earth system.

Title = {QoE-Driven Social Aware Caching Placement for Terrestrial-Satellite Networks},
Journal = {CHINA COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {60-72},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In remote terrestrial-satellite networks, caching is a very promising technique to alleviate the burden of space cloudlet (e.g., cache-enabled satellite user terminal) and to improve subscribers' quality of experience (QoE) in terms of buffering delay and achievable video streaming rate. In this paper, we studied a QoE-driven caching placement optimization problem for video streaming that takes into account the required video streaming rate and the social relationship among users. Social ties between users are used to designate a set of helpers with caching capability, which can cache popular files pro-actively when the cloudlet is idle. We model the utility function of QoE as a logarithmic function. Then, the caching placement problem is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the user's average QoE subject to the storage capacity constraints of the helpers and the cloudlets. Furthermore, we reformulate the problem into a monotone submodular optimization problem with a partition matroid constraint, and an efficient greedy algorithm with 1 - 1/e approximation ratio is proposed to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed caching placement approach significantly outperforms the traditional approaches in terms of QoE, while yields about the same delay and hit ratio performance compare to the delay-minimized scheme.},

Abstract = {In Ghana, farmers perceive protected forests as land banks for increasing agricultural productivity to support subsistence living. This has led to fragmentation of existing protected forests. Two of such reserve forests namely Bia Conservation Area and Krokosua Hills Forest Reserve have been encroached through lumbering for timber and area expansion of no-shade cocoa production systems. The purpose of this study was to develop a multi-disciplinary strategy to increase forest connectivity using cocoa agroforest corridors. Biophysical assessments involving satellite images for vegetation patterns, and expert data from a decision support system were used to select suitable sites for the corridor within a Geographic Information System framework. Socio-economic assessments of the opportunity costs of alternative farming systems to cocoa agroforestry in the delineated corridors show that while timber trees planted within cocoa agroforests settings would help offset the yield losses in cocoa shade-yield relationships compared to full sun-production systems, the on-farm benefits of cocoa agroforestry alone are insufficient to justify the adoption. Paying farmers premium prices for cocoa and substantial off-farm environmental and ecosystem services under agroforestry systems can tip the balance towards adoption.},

Abstract = {The paper discusses methods for estimating the value of commercially exploited fish stocks and the cost of exploiting them. Methods which are recommended in the System of National Accounting (SNA) satellite system and the System for Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) and relevant for this task are discussed. The paper questions the relevance of some of these methods. It argues for the integration of economic accounting for wild fish stocks with estimation of efficient management of them. Using biological and economic data makes it possible to produce consistent estimates of the value of fish stocks and the cost of exploiting them. These estimates are useful for national accounting and for guiding management of fisheries. This method allows estimation of the cost of inefficiency of fisheries management besides estimation of the cost of depletion. The different methods are illustrated using data on commercial fisheries in Iceland and the fish stocks that they exploit. It is shown that even if all methods are based on market valuation and use only objective data they lead to very different outcomes.},

Abstract = {The application of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies provides powerful tools when used to investigate wildlife and its habitat for an analysis or modelling approach. In this context, birds have been of great and progressive value as biological and environmental indicators. In order to learn about the common approaches used-its methods, processing steps, trends, advantages and challenges-over 120 representative publications of the last 30 years that made use of satellite images for avian applications have been reviewed. The reviewed studies have shown that GIS-based analyses of satellite and bird data have been well established for efficient ecosystem descriptions and species modelling within a large range of scales and habitats. In order to improve the quality of inference and for comparative analyses, it is recommended that further studies are documented in detail. Also, in order to verify and improve the obtained results, additional ground data on the main structure of the vegetation relevant to the bird species in question are usually necessary. Satellite-based remote sensing applications in ornithology could be used increasingly for assisting in habitat evaluation, habitat modelling and monitoring programmes and in achieving overall wildlife conservation and management objectives effectively. This is especially true for remote regions of the world that are difficult to access where few habitat studies have been undertaken to date but whose study is urgently needed.},

Abstract = {The government's technology policy is an important guideline and direction for the development of technology industry in Taiwan. Taiwan government proposed a two-phase process of high-technology industrialization development and, established center-satellite factory system which has effectively enhanced cooperation on the dimension of business management, total quality management, technology transference, and financial support. This mechanism effectively upgrades the industry level and makes a significant contribution to Taiwan's economical miracle. This study adopts Olhson's (1995) model to explore the internal innovation of the information technology (IT) industry, from which it proceeds to observe the external behavior of the industry in terms of market power, in order to analyze how innovation and market power affect market value under keen competition. Empirical results show a positive correlation between innovation and market value of the IT industry, which indicates the importance of innovation to the development of firms and an explanatory capability outside the book values of firms. Market power indicates an insignificant correlation to market value except in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which implies the economic contribution of SMEs in Taiwan.},

Title = {Fuzzy-based vulnerability assessment of coupled social-ecological systems to multiple environmental hazards and climate change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {299},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Climate change and combining related parameters of environmental hazards have left a considerable challenge in assessing social-ecological vulnerability. Here we integrated a fuzzy-based approach in the vulnerability assessment of mangrove social-ecological systems combining environmental parameters, socio-economic, and vegetative components from exposure dimensions, sensitivity and adaptive capacity along the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman for the first time. This study aims to provide critical information for habitat-scale management strategies and adaptation plans by assessing the vulnerability of mangrove social-ecological systems. This study provides a methodology framework that consists of five steps. Step 1: We com-bined the fuzzy weighted maps of seven environmental hazards, including tidal range, maximum wind speeds, drought magnitude, maximum temperatures, extreme storm surge, sea-level rise, significant wave height, and social vulnerability. This map combination determined that the computed exposure index is from 1.07 to 4.32 across the study areas, with an increasing trend from the coasts of the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. Step 2: We integrated the fuzzy weighted maps of four sensitivity variables, including area change, health change, seaward edge retreat, and production potential change. The findings show that the sensitivity index is from 1.40 to 2.64 across the study areas, increasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 3: Besides, we combined the fuzzy weighted maps of three adaptive capacity variables, including the availability of migration areas, recruitment, and local communities' participation in restoration projects and education pro-grams. The result showed that the index value across the study areas varies between 0.087 and 2.38, decreasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 4: Implementing fuzzy hierarchical analysis process to determine the relative weight of variables corresponding to exposure, sensitivity and adaptive ca-pacity. Step 5: The integration of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and the vulnerability index maps in the study areas showed variation from 0.25 to 5.92, with the vulnerability of mangroves from the west coast of the Persian Gulf (Nayband) decreasing towards Khamir, then increasing to the eastern coasts of the Gulf of Oman (Jask and Gwadar). Overall, the results indicate the importance of the proposed approach to the vulnerability of mangroves at the habitat scale along a coastal area and across environmental gradients of climatic, maritime and socio-economic variables. This study validated the findings based on the ground truth measurements, and high -resolution satellite data incorporated the Consistency Rate (CR) in the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The overall accuracy of all classified remote sensing images and maps consistently exceeded 90\%, and the CR of the 25 completed questionnaires was <0.1. Finally, this study indicates differences in vulnerability of various habitats, leading to focus conservation completion and rehabilitation and climate change adaptation planning to support the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-13 implementation.},

Abstract = {The Po Plain (Italy) is a complex mixture of urban and rural landscapes. Between Lombardy and Piedmont, the rural zone includes the largest rice crop area in Europe, accounting for 40\% and 90\% of the European and Italian rice production, respectively. The monitoring of this crop system is important by both environmental and economic points of view, because of its impacts on ecosystems, society and markets. In particular, the near real time (NRT) provision of information about crop status at farm scale is relevant for different players (i.e. farmers, consultants, policy makers, insurance companies). In this study, a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), implemented for the provision and dissemination of NRT crop status information, is presented. These information, derived from very high resolution satellite imagery, can be helpful to support loss adjusters in their workflows. The SDI architecture is designed as a seamless solution from satellite data download to presentation of added value information, which are retrieved and displayed on a mobile device, directly in the field.},

Title = {Dynamic partitioning of tropical Indian Ocean surface waters using ocean colour data - management and modelling applications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Over the past few decades, partitioning of the surface ocean into ecologically-meaningful spatial domains has been approached using a range of data types, with the aim of improving our understanding of open ocean processes, supporting marine management decisions and constraining coupled ocean-biogeochemical models. The simplest partitioning method, which could provide low-latency information for managers at low cost, remains a purely optical classification based on ocean colour remote sensing. The question is whether such a simple approach has value. Here, the efficacy of optical classifications in constraining physical variables that modulate the epipelagic environment is tested for the tropical Indian Ocean, with a focus on the Chagos marine protected area (MPA). Using remote sensing data, it was found that optical classes corresponded to distinctive ranges of wind speed, wind stress curl, sea surface temperature, sea surface slope, sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic currents (Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Tukey honestly significantly different tests, alpha = 0.01). Between-class differences were significant for a set of sub-domains that resolved zonal and meridional gradients across the MPA and Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge, whereas between-domain differences were only significant for the north-south gradient (PERMANOVA, alpha = 0.01). A preliminary test of between-class differences in surface CO2 concentrations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 demonstrated a small decrease in mean pCO(2) with increasing chlorophyll (chl), from 418 to 398 ppm. Simple optical class maps therefore provide an overview of growth conditions, the spatial distribution of resources - from which habitat fragmentation metrics can be calculated, and carbon sequestration potential. Within the 17 year study period, biotic variables were found to have decreased at up to 0.025\%a(-1) for all optical classes, which is slower than reported elsewhere (Mann-Kendall-Sen regression, alpha = 0.01). Within the MPA, positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions and negative Southern Oscillation Indices were weakly associated with decreasing chl, fluorescence line height (FLH), eddy kinetic energy, easterly wind stress and wind stress curl, and with increasing FLH/chl, sea surface temperature, SSH gradients and northerly wind stress, consistent with reduced surface mixing and increased stratification. The optical partitioning scheme described here can be applied in Google Earth Engine to support management decisions at daily or monthly scales, and potential applications are discussed.},

Title = {Regionalization of Coarse Scale Soil Moisture Products Using Fine-Scale Vegetation Indices-Prospects and Case Study},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a critical role in many hydrological, biological and biogeochemical processes. It is relevant to farmers, scientists, and policymakers for making effective land management decisions. However, coarse spatial resolution and complex interactions of microwave radiation with surface roughness and vegetation structure present limitations within active remote sensing products to directly monitor soil moisture variations with sufficient detail. This paper discusses a strategy to use vegetation indices (VI) such as greenness, water stress, coverage, vigor, and growth dynamics, derived from Earth Observation (EO) data for an indirect characterization of SSM conditions. In this regional-scale study of a wetland environment, correlations between the coarse Advanced SCATterometer-Soil Water Index (ASCAT-SWI or SWI) product and statistical measurements of four vegetation indices from higher resolution Sentinel-2 data were analyzed. The results indicate that the mean value of Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) correlates most strongly to the SWI and that the wet season vegetation traits show stronger linear relation to the SWI than during the dry season. The correlation between VIs and SWI was found to be independent of the underlying dominant vegetation classes which are not derived in real-time. Therefore, fine-scale vegetation information from optical satellite data convey the spatial heterogeneity missed by coarse synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived SSM products and is linked to the SSM condition underneath for regionalization purposes.},

Title = {Research on the Boundary Delimitation Method of National Park Based on Cultural Service Protection},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {843-855},
Abstract = {China is in the process of establishing and improving the national park system and carrying out pilot projects. With China's vast territory and diverse ecological systems, appropriate delimitation of the boundaries of national parks is a key scientific issue in the construction of the national park system. Guidelines for the establishment of national parks attach great importance to its cultural service functions such as scientific research, education and public recreation. It is of practical significance to consider the cultural service values of ecosystems when exploring the boundary delimitation methods used to delineate national parks. Based on remote sensing images and network big data resources, this paper selects the Guangdong-Hong Kong- Macao Greater Bay Area as the study area and evaluates the value of ecosystem cultural services in this area. From the perspective of cultural service protection, this paper simulates a variety of scenarios and determines the optimal boundaries through comparative analysis, taking the risk of decision-making into consideration. The principal findings are as follows. (1) Cultural service value varies greatly among regions. (2) Considering the risk and balance of decision-making, seven risk coefficients (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1) between 0 and 1 were considered, and this analysis generated seven scenarios for national park boundaries. (3) Scenario 5 is the most favourable, with cultural, recreational, biodiversity, recuperative and aesthetic cultural efficiency values of 1.292, 1.520, 1.469, 1.543 and 1.430 respectively. This study provides a novel approach for the delineation of national park boundaries, and serves as a reference for regional development planning.},

Title = {The Impact of Ecological Restoration Projects in Dry Lands: Data-based Assessment and Human Perceptions in the Lower Reaches of Heihe River Basin, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Desertification is a critical environmental problem in China's northwestern region. In this context, since the early 2000s, projects targeting ecological restoration have been implemented in the lower reaches of the Heihe River basin. Using multi-scale remote sensing data and field observations, this paper examines the outcomes of the ecological restoration projects. Specifically, this paper examines the vegetation change through remote sensing and local perceptions of the projects through semi-structured questionnaires. The results from remote sensing reveal that during the restoration projects, vegetation coverage in riparian areas of the lower reaches of the Heihe River basin increased. However, this increase cannot be simply equated with ecological recovery. Expansion of farmland and afforested areas have also contributed to the increase in vegetation coverage. Questionnaire results reveal that although locals perceived improvements in the ecological conditions of the lower reaches, most of them were more about future environmental changes. Additionally, results indicate that ecological restoration projects redistributed water resources in the local river reaches and, as a result, local residents living in riparian areas perceive greater benefit. Therefore, the implementation of the project may have actually negatively impacted the water accessibility of those living in the drier Gobi Desert areas.},

Abstract = {The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest freshwater lake on Earth, has lost circa 90\% of its original water surface in 1960. Maps of different land cover categories provide a suitable baseline to plan and implement effective measures to combat ongoing desertification, such as reforestation of dried out Aral Sea soils. In this study, we used satellite-based remote sensing data and applied a machine learning method (Random Forest) to map land cover in the Aralkum in 2020. We tested different satellite data from optical (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2) and Radar instruments (Sentinel-1) and trained a random forest model for classifying different combinations of these data sets into ten distinct land cover classes. We further calculated per-pixel uncertainty based on posterior classification probability scores. An accuracy assessment, based on in-situ data, revealed that the average overall accuracy of land cover maps was 86.8\%. Fusing optical and radar instruments achieved the highest overall accuracy (88.8\%, with lower/higher 95\% confidence interval values of 87.6\%/89.9\%, and a Kappa value of 0.865. Classification uncertainty was lower in more homogeneous landscapes (i.e. large expanses of a single land cover class like water or shrubland). Only around 9\% of the study area was still water in 2020, while 32\% was covered by saline soils with high erosion risk. Several potential applications of this land cover map in the Aralkum exist - spanning many areas of environmental impact assessment, policy, and planning and management or afforestation. This methodological framework can similarly provide a useful template for more broadly assessing large-scale, land dynamics at high-resolution in the entire Aralkum and surrounding areas.},

Title = {Integrated Methodology for Urban Flood Risk Mapping at the Microscale in Ungauged Regions: A Case Study of Hurghada, Egypt},

Abstract = {Flood risk mapping forms the basis for disaster risk management and the associated decision-making systems. The effectiveness of this process is highly dependent on the quality of the input data of both hazard and vulnerability maps and the method utilized. On the one hand, for higher-quality hazard maps, the use of 2D models is generally suggested. However, in ungauged regions, such usage becomes a difficult task, especially at the microscale. On the other hand, vulnerability mapping at the microscale suffers limitations as a result of the failure to consider vulnerability components, the low spatial resolution of the input data, and the omission of urban planning aspects that have crucial impacts on the resulting quality. This paper aims to enhance the quality of both hazard and vulnerability maps at the urban microscale in ungauged regions. The proposed methodology integrates remote sensing data and high-quality city strategic plans (CSPs) using geographic information systems (GISs), a 2D rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) simulation model, and multicriteria decision-making analysis (MCDA, i.e., the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)). This method was implemented in Hurghada, Egypt, which from 1996 to 2019 was prone to several urban flood events. Current and future physical, social, and economic vulnerability maps were produced based on seven indicators (land use, building height, building conditions, building materials, total population, population density, and land value). The total vulnerability maps were combined with the hazard maps based on the Kron equation for three different return periods (REPs) 50, 10, and 5 years to create the corresponding flood risk maps. In general, this integrated methodology proved to be an economical tool to overcome the scarcity of data, to fill the gap between urban planning and flood risk management (FRM), and to produce comprehensive and high-quality flood risk maps that aid decision-making systems.},

Title = {Conformity testing of satellite-derived quantitative surface variables},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {149-169},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reliable compliance information of quantitative earth observation (EO) products is a prerequisite for future usages of satellite-derived evidence in (1) regulatory initiatives addressing air quality, development aid, climate risk, agricultural subsidies and the state of the environment among others, (2) liability debates between customers and providers of value-added (quantitative) EO products and services, and (3) auditing efforts and/or contractual negotiations for the operational exploitation of EO data. Irrespective of context, the conformity of an item can only be established with respect to permissible deviations from an agreed reference. The uncertainty of the reference should ideally be smaller than that of the candidate item, and their combined uncertainty should be smaller than the width of the interval defining permissible deviations. While these considerations are an integral part of conformity testing in legal metrology they are not yet included in validation efforts of satellite-derived quantitative surface information. Outside of scientific application contexts, however, the certified compliance of quantitative earth observation products is likely to induce new usages of such information in commercial, judiciary and regulatory contexts. This contribution introduces conformity testing and compares it to validation efforts assessing the value of biophysical EO products with respect to the quality objectives provided by the global climate observing system (GCOS). The findings suggest that, (1) current GCOS quality objectives must be complemented before they may serve as unambiguous requirements for conformity testing of EO products, (2) a consensus on the choice of decision rules must be sought (between data providers and users) since this has a direct impact on what is deemed compliant, and (3) the uncertainty associated with current field validation methods for quantitative biophysical variables is presumably too large to meet the 150-13528 criteria. The latter thus challenges the eligibility of current field validation methods to provide the reference needed in efforts assessing GCOS compliance of third party EO datasets.

Abstract = {Understanding the complexity of earth-system processes is crucial to convey improved information on the environment to decision-makers and the general public. Addressing this need by sharing environmental data is challenging because it requires a common agreed framework that allows easy and seamless integration of data from different sources. In this regard, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) portends major benefits through various sharing mechanisms and by giving access to services that could be linked together to process and generate new understandable knowledge and information. Various United Nations projects could greatly benefit from the GEOSS approach.},

Abstract = {This research aims to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics and associated climate variables in Taiwan by utilizing mean-variance analysis (MVA), relative directional persistence analysis, and Pearson's product moment correlation analysis on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived NDVI3g data from 1982 to 2012. The results indicate a slightly increasing mean-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value with a relatively higher variance during the 1990s and lower variance during the 2000s, which may be explained by the observed fluctuation in precipitation. Additionally, NDVI patterns are identified as increasing in the first half of the year and decreasing in the second half of the year. Spatially, decreasing patterns are observed in all regions except that the northern counties exhibit an increasing NDVI pattern supported by the observed increase in precipitation. Moreover, sunshine duration and temperature are positively correlated with NDVI, whereas precipitation and cloud amount exhibit a negative correlation with NDVI in Taiwan. In the context of global environmental change, this research highlights the utility of applying a combined spatial-temporal approach to remote sensing products. This is an approach with potential applications such as landscape management, conservation practice, and water resource management for policy makers and stakeholders in and beyond Taiwan.},

Title = {Applicability of remote sensing oceanographic data in the detection of potential fishing grounds of Rastrelliger kanagurta in the archipelagic waters of Spermonde, Indonesia},

Abstract = {Rastrelliger kanagurta is among the pelagic fish of commercial value caught in the archipelagic waters of Spermonde, Indonesia. The dynamic oceanographic pattern in this area influences the distribution of this pelagic fish. Understanding the relationship between the distribution of fish and environmental factors is important in exploring fisheries resources. This study used Rastrelliger kanagurta fishing-catch data during the high-catch season in the second quarter, which was from April to June (2008 and 2009), and satellite data of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS-Aqua. The study aimed to identify the relationship between fish distribution with chl-a and SST constructed using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), detect the potential fishing grounds, and determine the impact of climate change on fish distribution based on temperature projection of IPCC-AR5-RCPs. The distribution of Rastrelliger kanagurta was significantly associated (p < 0.0001) with the preferred range of chl-a at 0.30-0.40 mg/m(3) and SST at 30.00-31.00 degrees C. The potential fishing ground maps showed that areas with high potential catch were located near the coast to offshore (3-20 M), with acceptable level of map accuracy at 83.34\%; with kappa value at 0.70. Increased temperature of 1.80 degrees C resulted in movement of potential fishing grounds to the southern part of Makassar Straits leading to the archipelagic waters of Spermonde. In contrast, increased temperature of 2.60 degrees C and 3.30 degrees C resulted in lesser potential fishing grounds area which shifted further to the south. The results of this study indicated applicability of remote sensing in contributing to optimal fishing effort and decision making for long-term management of Rastrelliger kanagurta resources.},

Title = {SSLnDO-Based Deep Residual Network and RV-Coefficient Integrated Deep Fuzzy Clustering for Cotton Crop Classification},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 2},
Abstract = {The excellent classification accuracy of remote sensory images has led to a major expansion of their use in agricultural field surveillance in recent years. The accurate classification of crop is very significant for agricultural management and food security. There are diverse varieties of crops are available. Among them, each possesses same spectral curves. Due to increasing number of remote sensing information, a major limitation arises in the domain of crop classification is how to determine significant data from huge volume of information to maintain categorization accuracy and implementation time. Consequently, one of the main obstacles in the agricultural industry is the precise classification of crops. Deep Residual Network (ResNet)-based Social Sea Lion Driver Optimization (SSLnDO)-based Deep Fuzzy Clustering (DFC), where the distance is calculated using RV coefficient, are used to develop an effective method for classifying cotton crops. Finally, classification of the cotton crop is successfully accomplished using Deep ResNet, and the network classifier is trained by inserting produced SSLnDO. The vegetation index is generated for each color band independently. Combining the Social Ski Driver (SSD) optimization and the Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO) method yields the newly developed SSLnDO. A maximum testing accuracy of 0.940, a sensitivity of 0.931, and a specificity of 0.926 have been achieved by the designed model. When comparing the accuracy value produced by the proposed method for image-2 to the existing approaches, namely WLI-Fuzzy + BS-Lion NN, OSVM-OCNN, GAN, Hybrid CNN-RF, Deep learning, and Deep ResNet, they are 15.21\%, 11.06\%, 15.21\%, 9.04\%, 4.36\%, and 2.3\% higher.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the impact of current Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) management practices on future Ecosystem Services (ESs) provisioning has been emphasized because of the effect of such practices on ecological sustainability. We sought to model and predict the impacts of future LULC changes on subsequent changes in Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) in fragile environments undergoing complex LULC changes, Su-Xi-Chang region. After mapping and classifying the LULC for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010 using GIS and remote sensing, a Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model was employed to model future LULC changes for the year 2020. ESV was predicted using the projected LULC data and the modified ES coefficients adopted by Xie et al. (2003). The projected results of the changes in LULC reveal that construction land expanded extensively, mainly at the expense of farmland, wetland, and water bodies. The predicted results of the ESVs indicate that water bodies and farmland are the dominant LULC categories, accounting for 90\% of the total ESV. Over the study period, ESVs were diminished by 7.3915 billion CNY, mostly because of the decrease in farmland, water bodies, and wetland. A reasonable land use plan should be developed with an emphasis on controlling construction land encroachment on farmland, wetlands, and water bodies. The rules of ecological protection should be followed in LULC management to preserve ecological resources.},

Abstract = {This study analysed the forest fragmentation of Coqueiral Environmental Protected Area (APA Coqueiral), located in Coqueiral, South region of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the forest fragmentation of Coqueiral APA, using landscape metrics, as well as, elaborating landscape simulation models to provide future scenarios of ecological restoration, and then, to compare these simulations to the current landscape. Land use analyses were carried out through Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing techniques, using a SPOT 5 satellite image (SPOTMAP). Forest fragmentation was analysed by FRAGSTATS software for calculating landscape metrics such as: area, perimeter, shape, and, patch connectivity. We performed 1 and 5 m buffers maps, and a virtual restoration of the Permanent Protected Areas (APP) for landscape simulations. Landscape fragmentation analyses showed that natural vegetation is distributed within 360 patches, being 137 of them smaller than 1 ha. Landscape simulation models revealed that natural vegetation has increased from 1943.13 ha to 2299.02 ha in the restored APP simulation (natural vegetation/restored APPs = VA). The average patch size increased from 7.66 m to 15.75 m in the same simulation in comparison to the current landscape. VA showed a smaller shape value (1.93), indicating that patch shape is simpler in this simulation. This is an important result from the conservation point of view, because as simpler a shape of a patch is, smaller the edge effect is. Isolation values were not statistically different in the simulations: 38.9 m (VN); 40.64 m (VB1); 42.89 m (VB5) e 39.75 m (VA), what indicates low isolation between patches, even in the current landscape. Connectivity index was high (99\%) for all simulations, indicating that landscapes have high structural connectivity. These data are relevant inputs to decision makers and to a better planning and management of the APA Coqueiral, allowing us to indicate the priority areas for conservation in this natural reserve.},

Title = {Space Exploration Through Self-Replication Technology Compensates for Discounting in Net Present Value Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Business Case?},

Abstract = {Self-replication technology is a little known technology that is currently under development and that has enormous implications for affordable space exploration. In particular, the prospect of 3D printing of actuators and electronics offers the prospect of realizing a universal constructor, which is the basis of a selfreplicating machine. The universal constructor is a generalpurpose automated factory that is supported by a number of robotic devices. If programmed appropriately, it can manufacture a copy of itself (as well as other products). We present an overview of self-replication research and its application to colonization of the Moon at very low cost-it offers a means to overcome the high cost of launch through exponential exploitation of in situ resources. Combined with in situ resource utilization, a universal constructor can construct (in theory) almost any product within certain constraints. Indeed, its productivity dwarfs any potential cost reductions in launch costs. We shall focus on defining several critical technological developments. It has potential commercial applications in extremely low-cost manufacturing of solar power satellites for clean energy production for the Earth. Self-replication capability offers a mechanism for offsetting discounting of future revenue (as computed by net present value cost-benefit analysis) by generating exponentially increasing revenue over time. It represents a `'Bold'' (as advocated by Peter Diamandis) approach for a start-up company, toward which steps are being taken. These steps will be discussed in detail. However, the revolutionary economics will make it challenging to attract capital investment despite eliminating the discounting effect. Nevertheless, a business case can be made despite a long-time horizon of investment due to nu-merous progressive spin-off applications. Over the long term, self-replication technology could revolutionize space exploration by providing for remote construction of complete (although simple) spacecraft in large numbers from in situ resources. By virtue of this massive productive capacity offered by self-replication technology, missions that are currently considered too expensive or impractical become feasible, for example, space-based geoengineering, asteroid exploitation and/or mitigation, and difficult outer planet locations such as Enceladus, interstellar precursor missions, etc.},

Abstract = {Detection of key factors driving fire frequency, especially in protected areas, is important for effective management of ecosystems. In this study, we used Generalized Linear Models to test the contribution of natural (NDVI, wind speed, dry matter productivity, soil moisture, percentage tree cover, elevation and temperature) and anthropogenic (distance from settlements) factors as predictors of fire frequency in Hwange National Park and adjacent areas. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate the variable contribution to fire frequency. The model results indicated that all the variables that were used contributed significantly to fire recurrence (p < 0.05). Distance from settlements contributed the most to the model whilst dry matter productivity and annual average temperature were second and third respectively. Removal of distance from settlements from the model increased the AIC value to 1411.2 while removal of dry matter productivity and temperature resulted in AICs of 1269.9 and 1265.8 respectively. Results showed that settlements which are found in the vicinity of the protected area influence the recurrence of fires. Findings from this study can be used for strategic fire management and for the development of effective measures to minimize fire recurrence in a protected area.},

Title = {Modeling the impact of local environmental variables on tree-related power outages along distribution powerlines},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {221},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Accurate vegetation risk modeling requires detailed and timely information on the physical structure of roadside trees in conjunction with local environmental and management factors. This study aims to understand the contribution of multiple environmental and management variables on tree-related power outages during storm events at a fine scale. We developed and compared five candidate vegetation risk models (VRMs) comprising 19 predictor variables falling into four categories: (1) forest characteristics, (2) soil and terrain, (3) vegetation management, and (4) utility infrastructure using Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The VRM model consisting of all four categories of predictor variables demonstrated the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) value of 0.8320. The VRM that excluded tree-related variables exhibited the lowest AUC-ROC value of 0.7760. Two VRMs excluding soil/terrain and vegetation management variables performed marginally worse than the model with all variables. According to Shapley Additive Explanation analysis, the LiDAR-derived tree variables (proximity tree pixels), length of primary distribution overhead, median tree height, and wire properties (i.e., covered or bare) reported the highest importance-variables. This study's findings can guide vegetation risk at fine scales, which will help improve electrical grid resilience and hardening.},

Abstract = {The increasing vulnerability of infrastructure and human lives particularly in areas of the Megacities as well as the broad acceptance of sustainability as guiding principal for societal development is putting new emphasis on global processes and the associated geophysical variability and global change. In Earth system studies, the need for integrated data sets is increasingly obvious, both for observational studies of system processes and the validation of integrated system models. Though rapidly improving, the current scientific knowledge of the Earth system with respect to the main processes, the key indicators and the major forcing factors is still limited. Therefore, a more or less complete monitoring of the system's state and trends is mandatory if a valuable contribution of global monitoring to environmental security and sustainability is to be expected. Thus, integrated global monitoring is a prerequisite for global environmental management of a sustainable Earth. Specialised global observing systems have already been initiated and partly are implemented (e.g. the G30S, the Global Terrestrial, Climate and Ocean Observing Systems: GTOS, GCOS, GOOS). However, these systems are largely based on space-born remote sensing techniques, while investment in urgently needed in-situ measurements are smaller and often decreasing. Moreover, the integration of ground-based networks, data archiving and distributing facilities to provide integrated data sets of in-situ observations is still at its infancy, Space geodesy is now capable of monitoring variables of potential value for environmental monitoring systems. Moreover, in some of the existing networks, these techniques provide crucial: auxiliary observations. It is therefore of fundamental value to fully integrate geodetic monitoring techniques into a global integrated Earth monitoring system, which is a significant step towards an Earth information system for sustainability. This integration should follow the Global Integrated Observing Strategy.},

Abstract = {Unprecedented urbanization has occurred globally, which has converted substantial natural landscapes into impervious surfaces and further impacted ecosystem services and functioning. In this study, we quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization and investigated the impacts of urbanization on the ecosystem service value (ESV) in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China from 1980 to 2018. The results show that the GBA has experienced extensive urbanization, with the urban area increasing from 2607.4 to 8243.5 km(2) from 1980 to 2018. Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Foshan exhibited the top five highest urban expansion rates. Throughout the study period, edge expansion was the most dominant growth mode, with a decreasing trend, while infilling increased in the GBA. The total ESV loss induced by urban expansion in the GBA reached 40.5 billion yuan over the past four decades. The ESV loss due to the water body decrease caused by urbanization was the largest. Our study suggests that decision-makers should control new urban areas and protect water bodies, wetlands, and forests with high ESVs to promote the sustainable development of urban agglomerations.},

Abstract = {The effects of soil salinity on growth and yield of sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) are used to illustrate how soil and plant samples (<<ground truth>>), digital videographic or SPOT HRV spectral observations, and image analysis by unsupervised classification can be used jointly to quantify and map variations in weighted electrical conductivity (WEC, dS m(-1)) of the root zone and MELD (metric tons of millable stalks ha(-1)). The combined data for the 1992 and 1993 growing seasons of the study showed that each dS m(-1) increase in WEC reduced stalk population by 0.6 stalks m(-2), stalk weight by 0.14 kg, and stalk yields by 13.7 metric tons ha(-1). Sugarcane growth and yield were not affected by root: zone salinities less than about 2dS m(-1), but no millable stalks were produced at salinities in excess of 10 dS m(-1). The 25 pixels ha(-1) of SPOT is a good scale for mapping salt stress patterns and taking sire-specific ameliorative actions. The combination of satellite or aerial spectral observations, ground truth, and image classification procedures demonstrated in this study is readily applicable to other vegetation stresses.},

Abstract = {The mid-Atlantic Regional Earth Science Applications Center (RESAC) was established in the Geography Department at the University of Maryland (UMD) by NASA's Earth Science Applications Program. The mid-Atlantic RESAC is to provide improved land cover mapping and ecological modeling capabilities for a diverse consortium of partners in Government, Academia, Industry and NGOs within the 178,000 km(2) Chesapeake Bay watershed. It is one of 7 regional centers established nationwide and leverages expertise in satellite remote sensing to address applications of regional significance including land cover change, land use planning, carbon exchange modeling, and integrated environmental monitoring. Examples of issues that are being addressed include nutrient runoff to the Chesapeake Bay, urban sprawl, farm and forest productivity, landscape fragmentation effects on biodiversity, a land manager decision support system, and educational outreach. The mid-Atlantic RESAC provides an example of how scientific advances can be focused on practical applications that challenge our ability to manage resources sustainably. A brief overview of the RESAC is provided and specific applications are reviewed using examples that emphasize the utility of remote sensing and GIS capabilities. Results of field activities undertaken during the 1999 growing season, for example, are used with a fusion of multitemporal Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper and SPOT panchromatic imagery to classify vegetation types, and to characterize development of the severe drought that took place in the region.},

Title = {Urban Expansion Was the Main Driving Force for the Decline in Ecosystem Services in Hainan Island during 1980-2015},

Abstract = {Hainan Island is one of China's most ecologically diverse areas. Human activities and climate change have recently influenced Hainan Island's ecosystem services. Therefore, scientific methods are urgently needed to investigate the characteristics of these services' spatial and temporal variations and their driving mechanisms for maintaining Hainan Island's biodiversity and high-quality ecological conservation. Based on multivariate remote sensing and reanalysis data, this study analysed the spatial and temporal variations in water retention, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and oxygen release services on Hainan Island during 1980-2015 using various ecosystem service models such as INVEST, CASA and RULSE. Then, we analysed different ecosystem service drivers using a random forest model. The results indicated that (1) from 1980 to 2015, the change characteristics of different ecosystem types (arable, forest, and grassland) decreased, and the proportion of decrease was 0.98\%, 0.55\% and 0.36\%, respectively. Built-up and water increased significantly, and the proportion of increase reached 1.46\% and 0.51\%, respectively. (2) Hainan Island's functions of water retention, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and oxygen release services decreased from 23.31 billion m3, 2.89 billion t, 9.68 million t and 56.05 million t in 1980 to 23.15 billion m3, 2.79 billion t, 9.42 million t and 55.53 million t in 2015, respectively. The high value area was mainly distributed in Hainan Island's central mountainous area, and the low value area was mainly distributed in the lower-elevation coastal area. (3) In the past 35 years, urban expansion has been the leading factor in the reduction of Hainan Island's ecosystem service capacity. However, its central nature reserve and other forms of ecological protection have improved its ecosystem service capacity, which has alleviated the overall declining trend of its amount of ecosystem service functions. (4) The driving forces for the spatial distribution of Hainan Island's ecosystem services were analysed using a random forest algorithm, which indicated that its spatial distribution was mainly driven by rainfall, soil moisture, actual evapotranspiration, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. This study is expected to help planners develop effective environmental policies to accommodate the potential ecological risks associated with urban expansion during the construction of Hainan Island's future free trade port while filling the gaps in existing studies.},

Abstract = {As conservation of sensitive habitats is a high priority issue in European environmental policy, there is considerable interest in mapping and monitoring specific habitats of high conservation value. In this study, we discuss the potential of the Swiss mire monitoring program to monitor small area habitats in sufficient detail. The monitoring scheme combines nationwide probability sampling and predictive habitat mapping based on a field data sample. Thus, it is designed to identify spatio-temporal changes at the stand level and to derive hard statistics for the sub-national level. For feasibility reasons, the thematic focus is on semi-quantitative mean indicator values derived from vegetation records. These measures provide robust estimates of essential floristic site conditions. Regression models based on CIR aerial photographs are applied to continuously map respective measures across the sample mires. The present study explores the required investment of data for model-based mapping. Exemplary mapping results are presented and validated within a reference mire. Repeated tests show that about one hundred field records are needed to guarantee optimal prediction accuracy and reliable error estimates for all target variables. The corresponding 95\% error quantiles in a test data set are below 0.7. To evaluate the benefit of high resolution orthophotos (30 cm resolution), the model prediction is compared with results obtained from coarsened images. Although the original CIR images produce the best model performance, the models based on resolutions comparable to modern satellite images still show considerable potential to assess larger areas where the use of digital aerial photographs is limited. The resulting spatially-explicit in-depth information can resolve the common thematic limitations of stand-alone remote sensing applications in conservation monitoring. As the method is applicable consistently across a range of habitat types, we argue that it has the potential to become a standard method for operational monitoring of priority habitats in European nature conservation.},

Abstract = {Night-time light emissions maps derived from coarse resolution satellite imagery provide a means to obtain continent-wide or even global estimates of the area covered by human settlements. Such night-time light emissions maps can also be regarded as a surrogate measure for a range of other socioeconomic and environmental indicators, notably population number \& density, GDP, energy consumption \& wastage, skyglow and tranquil areas. The MANTLE project builds upon a project definition phase incorporating a state of the art review and user-requirements survey carried out across the EU to define, produce and present a range of information products derived from night-time satellite imagery that are of value to national and international users. MANTLE uses reduced gain data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) to derive country and EU-wide night-time light emissions mosaics. Regression-based modelling techniques have demonstrated that strong relationships exist between these DMSP OLS data and such parameters as population, GDP, road lighting, energy wastage and total energy consumption. This paper describes some of the analyses carried out during the MANTLE project and presents preliminary versions of some potential MANTLE products.},

Abstract = {Fishery management in Brazil has many challenges, including the engagement of fishers, building institutional (NGO, university, etc.) relationships to carry out research and provide key data for managers, and strengthening the capacity to articulate effective management strategies (policy institution). Here we report on recent work to address some of these challenges for the Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) fishery in the Parnaiba Delta Protected Area. These include meetings to create inter-sector communication, citizen science and ethnobiology to support data collection and biological sampling, satellite tagging to discern tarpon movements, and the first data-limited stock assessment. The research occurred between September 2018 and April 2020 in the Parnaiba Delta and adjacent marine area, specifically in the Canarias Islands (MA), Pedra do Sal (PI), and Bitupita (CE). Gonadosomatic indices (GSI > 5\%) of female tarpon suggested that tarpon migrate to the Parnaiba Delta to spawn in the dry season (July-December). These GSI findings corresponded with the ethnobiology results in which the fishers confirmed more intense fishing effort in the dry periods due in part to the added value of the gonads. Satellite-tagged tarpon remained close to the Buraco and Boca da Barra fishery areas, thus, close to the Parnaiba Delta region. The information collected here will enhance the collaborative formulation of an unprecedented management plan for the tarpon fishery in this region.},

Abstract = {Through the lens of conventional national accounting, resource depletion and natural environment degradation often appear misleadingly as desirable economic growth. The old System of National Accounts (SNA) has been revised and a set of environmental `satellite accounts' proposed. Certain weaknesses, however, pervade the new proposals. The conventional measurements remain largely unaltered, and the satellite accounts are of unclear purpose and unnecessarily complex. As proposed, they rely on the valuation of environmental stocks, while the economically more important flow accounts, to their detriment, are to be derived indirectly from changes in stock values. The SNA, the paper stresses, is primarily an economic framework, incapable of capturing all environmental change, and the national accounts are far more useful economically than environmentally. Greening the accounts would be optional for most affluent countries, whose overriding environmental concern is pollution. This can be addressed directly through taxation and regulation. Pollution information in satellite accounts can indeed be valuable, but revised and fully integrated resource accounting is a priority concern for those developing countries that are running down natural resources, and for which conventional accounting distorts macroeconomic measurement, analysis and policy. The paper argues that green accounting can only ensure income (sometimes called weak) sustainability, which should be considered as a step leading ultimately to an ecological (or stronger) sustainability.},

Abstract = {The assessment of sustainability in cropping system is an important issue for natural resources management and environmental protection. Incorporating the geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technologies, an initial idea of the crop sustainability assessing system was thus proposed, based on ecosystem services value (ESV) assessing criterions. The system is basically constituted by two major parts, which were net primary production (NPP) based ESV evaluating system and universal soil loss equation (USLE) based conserving soil and water (CSW) evaluating system. The input datasets includes temporal moderate resolution satellite images (HJ-CCD), Meteorological data, DEM data and soil data. To test the efficiency of the proposed system, an assessment was thus conducted along the Huai river watershed. The results showed that the value of sustainability for the study area was 40.89 x 10(4) yuan/m(2) in average. Besides, a descending trend of sustainable value was found along the watershed from the outer region to center. Moreover, it was pointed out that the agroecosystem provided more value or services in feeding people than in maintaining the sustainability of the environment, comparing with the other ecosystem, such as forests and wetlands. Thereby, it is recommended to maintain or increase the ecosystem diversity in a place, which would be able to enhance the sustainability of it. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Analysis of the implementation effects of ecological restoration projects based on carbon storage and eco-environmental quality: A case study of the Yellow River Delta, China},

Abstract = {As an important means to address global climate change and land-use/land-cover (LULC) change, ecological restoration projects (ERPs) have a large effect on carbon storage functions and eco-environmental quality. However, the various ERPs carried out in the Yellow River Delta region have important implications for ecological security strategies in China. Therefore, based on land-use data and remote sensing image data, with the help of ArcGIS and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platforms, this study uses the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, an improved remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model and other methods to deeply examine the evolutionary trends of eco-environmental quality and carbon storage during the implementation of ERPs in the Yellow River Delta and selects key implementation areas for in-depth analysis to determine the implementation effects of ERPs. Our findings suggested that the RSEI and carbon storage levels in the study area had opposite evolutionary trends from 2001 to 2020. Among them, the RSEI showed a fluctuating upwards trend (0.4461 (2001) and 0.5185 (2020)), while the total carbon stock showed a fluctuating downwards trend (30.67 Tg (2001) and 26.40 Tg (2020)). However, from 2015 to 2020, the RSEI and carbon storage were at a relatively stable level, which indirectly indicated that the ERPs carried out during the period from 2015 to 2020 had achieved a good comprehensive implementation effect. In addition, the areas with better improvement effects from 2015 to 2020 were primarily located in the mouth of the Yellow River Delta (Areas C and D), and their RSEI and the total carbon stock showed a certain upwards trend. This research can promote the formulation of the management strategy of ERPs in the Yellow River Delta, which is of tremendous importance to the ecological environmental preservation and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},

Number = {92},
Pages = {145-156},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Coastal lagoons worldwide are very dynamic complexes where both ocean and land events are important drivers; any modifications in either of these will have an impact in the coastal waterbody. Coastal lagoons often present problems due to human induced alterations to their hydrosedimentary flows. In this study, a diagnosis was made of the sedimentation problems in the Chantuto-Panzacola coastal lagoon complex. A physical diagnosis was made using hydrodynamics and physical characteristics, followed by computational simulations. Then an ecological diagnosis was performed, using satellite imagery, databases and field data. This was followed by a socio-economic diagnosis and an evaluation of the ecosystem services the lagoon system provides. A severe sedimentation problem was found following the diagnosis and using the Revised Universal Soil-Loss Equation. It was established that a relationship exists between the sedimentation of the coastal lagoon complex and erosion in the upper watershed. Three options were proposed: No action, dredging and reforestation. A brief cost/benefit analysis was made for each alternative and the reforestation alternative was seen to be the most feasible and environmentally sensitive. The benefits of reforestation will not only be reaped within the lagoon complex, but also in the high watershed, where there will be fewer landslides and lower vulnerability to erosion.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-73},
Abstract = {Land use information is one of the most sought inputs for various resource and environmental management studies as well as climate models. In this study, an attempt was made to obtain land cover information from temporal data set of Advance Wide Field Sensor aboard Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-P6 using data mining classification technique. This study mainly focuses on the utility of visually interpreted thematic maps as an additional input for improving classification accuracies. The temporal data sets were co-registered to sub-pixel accuracy and were atmospherically corrected using modified dark pixel subtraction method. The visual thematic maps (wastelands and forest cover maps) were also co-registered to satellite data to a near pixel accuracy. Digital values were extracted for various classes and rule sets were generated using See-5 data mining software. These rule sets were ported into ERDAS Imagine Knowledge Engineer and the temporal data sets were classified. The results indicate that temporal satellite data at monthly intervals have a good potential to capture the land cover information including temporal dynamics of crop cover in agricultural lands. Addition of legacy maps obtained through monoscopic visual interpretation has helped to improve classification accuracies significantly. However, there exists a co-registration issue between visual maps as well as satellite data that have influenced the classification accuracies. The decision tree classification algorithm (See-5) used in this study is able to exploit the temporal variation in target spectral properties as well as thematic information from legacy maps satisfactorily. There has been a substantial improvement in various categories of forests as well as wastelands due to addition of visual maps. This has further reduced the misclassification of other vegetation categories, thereby improving the overall classification accuracy. Overall, kappa statistic of 0.885 was achieved with multitemporal satellite data, which was further improved to 0.932 with the addition of visual maps.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Worldwide sustainable development is threatened by current agricultural land change trends, particularly by the increasing rural farmland abandonment and agricultural intensification phenomena. In Mediterranean countries, these processes are affecting especially traditional olive groves with enormous socio-economic costs to rural areas, endangering environmental sustainability and biodiversity. Traditional olive groves abandonment and intensification are clearly related to the reduction of olive oil production income, leading to reduced economic viability. Most promising strategies to boost traditional groves competitiveness-such as olive oil differentiation through adoption of protected denomination of origin labels and development of value-added olive products-rely on knowledge of the olive varieties and its specific properties that confer their uniqueness and authenticity. Given the lack of information about olive varieties on traditional groves, a feasible and inexpensive method of variety identification is required. We analyzed leaf spectral information of ten Portuguese olive varieties with a powerful data-mining approach in order to verify the ability of satellite's hyperspectral sensors to provide an accurate olive variety identification. Our results show that these olive varieties are distinguishable by leaf reflectance information and suggest that even satellite open-source data could be used to map them. Additional advantages of olive varieties mapping were further discussed.},

Abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been the biggest environmental problem in Korea since the 2010s. The present study considers the value of urban forests and green infrastructure as an ecosystem service (ES) concept for PM2.5 reduction based on satellite and spatial data, with a focus on Seoul, Korea. A method for the spatial ES assessment that considers social demand variables such as population and land price is suggested. First, an ES assessment based on natural environment information confirms that, while the vitality of vegetation is relatively low, the ES is high in the city center and residential areas, where the concentration of PM2.5 is high. Then, the ES assessment considering social demand (i.e., the ESS) confirms the existence of higher PM2.5 values in residential areas with high population density, and in main downtown areas. This is because the ESS of urban green infrastructure is high in areas with high land prices, high population density, and above-average PM2.5 concentrations. Further, when a future green infrastructure improvement scenario that considers the urban forest management plan is applied, the area of very high ESS is increased by 74\% when the vegetation greenness of the green infrastructure in the residential area is increased by only 20\%. This result suggests that green infrastructure and urban forests in the residential area should be continuously expanded and managed in order to maximize the PM2.5 reduction ES.},

Title = {Mapping regional patterns of large forest fires in Wildland-Urban Interface areas in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {112-126},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Over recent decades, Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) trends in many regions of Europe have reconfigured the landscape structures around many urban areas. In these areas, the proximity to landscape elements with high forest fuels has increased the fire risk to people and property. These Wildland-Urban Interface areas (WUI) can be defined as landscapes where anthropogenic urban land use and forest fuel mass come into contact. Mapping their extent is needed to prioritize fire risk control and inform local forest fire risk management strategies. This study proposes a method to map the extent and spatial patterns of the European WUI areas at continental scale. Using the European map of WUI areas, the hypothesis is tested that the distance from the nearest WUI area is related to the forest fire probability. Statistical relationships between the distance from the nearest WUI area, and large forest fire incidents from satellite remote sensing were subsequently modelled by logistic regression analysis. The first European scale map of the WUI extent and locations is presented. Country-specific positive and negative relationships of large fires and the proximity to the nearest WUI area are found. A regional-scale analysis shows a strong influence of the WUI zones on large fires in parts of the Mediterranean regions. Results indicate that the probability of large burned surfaces increases with diminishing WUI distance in touristic regions like Sardinia, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, or in regions with a strong peri-urban component as Catalunya, Comunidad de Madrid, Comunidad Valenciana. For the above regions, probability curves of large burned surfaces show statistical relationships (ROC value > 0.5) inside a 5000 m buffer of the nearest WM. Wise land management can provide a valuable ecosystem service of fire risk reduction that is currently not explicitly included in ecosystem service valuations. The results re-emphasise the importance of including this ecosystem service in landscape valuations to account for the significant landscape function of reducing the risk of catastrophic large fires.

Title = {Enhancing the Application of Earth Observations for Improved Environmental Decision-Making Using the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {The mitigation of losses due to extreme climate events and long-term climate adaptation requires climate informed decision-making. In the past few decades, several remote sensing and modeled-based Earth observations (EOs) have been developed to provide an unprecedented global overview and routine monitoring of climate and its impacts on vegetation and hydrologic conditions, with the goal of supporting informed decision-making. However, their usage in decision-making is particularly limited in climate-risk vulnerable and in situ data-scarce regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to EOs. Here, we describe the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX), which was developed to address this crucial limitation and facilitate the application of EOs in decision-making, particularly in the food and water-insecure regions of the world. First, the EWX's core framework, which includes (i) the Viewer, (ii) GeoEngine, and (iii) Support Applications, is described. Then, a comprehensive overview of the Viewer, which is a web-based interface used to access EOs, is provided. This includes a description of (i) the maps and associated features to access gridded EO data and anomalies for different temporal averaging periods, (ii) time series graphs and associated features to access EOs aggregated over polygons such as administrative boundaries, and (iii) commonly used EOs served by the EWX that provide assessments of climate and vegetation conditions. Next, examples are provided to demonstrate how EWX can be used to monitor development, progression, spatial extent, and severity of climate-driven extreme events to support timely decisions related to mitigation of food insecurity and flooding impacts. Finally, the value of a regional implementation of EWX at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, is highlighted. Regional implementation of the EWX facilitates access to regionally focused EOs and their availability at polygon boundaries most relevant to the local decision-makers. Similar instances of EWX implemented in other regions, especially those susceptible to food and water security, will likely further enhance the application of EOs for informed decision-making.},

Title = {Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland with Multi-Temporal Landsat-8 Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Using plastic mulching for farmland is booming around the world. Despite its benefit of protecting crops from unfavorable conditions and increasing crop yield, the massive use of the plastic-mulching technique causes many environmental problems. Therefore, timely and effective mapping of plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) is of great interest to policy-makers to leverage the trade-off between economic profit and adverse environmental impacts. However, it is still challenging to implement remote-sensing-based PMF mapping due to its changing spectral characteristics with the growing seasons of crops and geographic regions. In this study, we examined the potential of multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery for mapping PMF. To this end, we gathered the information of spectra, textures, indices, and thermal features into random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms in order to select the common characteristics for distinguishing PMF from other land cover types. The experiment was conducted in Jizhou, Hebei Province. The results demonstrated that the spectral features and indices features of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), GI (greenness index), and textural features of mean are more important than the other features for mapping PMF in Jizhou. With that, the optimal period for mapping PMF is in April, followed by May. A combination of these two times (April and May) is better than later in the season. The highest overall, producer's, and user's accuracies achieved were 97.01\%, 92.48\%, and 96.40\% in Jizhou, respectively.},

Title = {Habitat modelling of escolar fish (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum, Smith 1843) in the southwestern Indian Ocean using remote sensing data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 22},
Abstract = {Escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) belongs to Gempylidae family, is a top predator species that plays a crucial role in the marine ecosystem. However, limited information is available regarding their spatial-temporal variations in habitat, while habitat suitability index (HSI) modelling has been widely used in recent years for conservation, fisheries, and ecology. We compared an Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM) and a Geometric Mean Model (GMM) to gain insights into their habitat distribution. Fishery data were collected from the southwestern Indian Ocean between 2010 and 2014. Ten oceanographic remote sensing data sets were compiled, and four of them were selected based on their higher R-2 values obtained from Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Random Forest (RF) analyses for constructing the model combination. Meanwhile, Suitability Index (SI) curves were employed to determine the habitat suitability range for escolar. Environmental parameters were combined using a step-wise approach and applied for both AMM and GMM. The models were evaluated based on the Lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. Eventually, AMM was chosen over GMM with the AIC value was 28.49 and 31.25, respectively. The selected model combination of AMM was Sea Surface Height (SSH), Oxygen (O), and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) meaning these parameters influenced the distribution of escolar. The SI curve of the chosen model indicated the habitat range for each parameter as follows: SSH (0.61-0.69 m), O (222-230 mmol m(-3)), and SST (18.7-21.1 \& DEG;C). The most suitable habitat for escolar was observed within the coordinates 36 oS-30 oS and 28 oE-36 oE. Thus, this method is demonstrated in a case study where just presence data are provided and the incorporation of remote sensing environmental factors is gathered. This result could help improve escolar fishery management in the southwestern Indian Ocean.},

Title = {European Union's Last Intact Forest Landscapes are at A Value Chain Crossroad between Multiple Use and Intensified Wood Production},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Research Highlights: The European Union's last large intact forest landscapes along the Scandinavian Mountain range in Sweden o ff er unique opportunities for conservation of biodiversity, ecological integrity and resilience. However, these forests are at a crossroad between intensified wood production aimed at bio-economy, and rural development based on multi-functional forest landscapes for future-oriented forest value chains. Background and Objectives: We (1) estimate the area of near-natural forests potentially remaining for forest harvesting and wood production, or as green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation and human well-being in rural areas, (2) review how forest and conservation policies have so far succeeded to reduce the loss of mountain forests, and (3) discuss what economic, socio-cultural and ecological values that are at stake, as well as different governance and management solutions. Materials andMethods: First, we estimated the remaining amount of intact mountain forests using (1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory, (2) protected area statistics, (3) forest harvest permit applications and actually harvested forests, (4) remote sensing wall-to-wall data on forests not subject to clear-felling since the mid-1950s, (5) mapping of productive and non-productive forestland, and (6) estimates of mean annual final felling rate. Second, we review policy documents related to the emergence of land use regulation in north Sweden, including the mountain forest border, and illustrate this with an actual case that has had significant policy implementation importance. Results: There is a clear difference between the proportions of formally protected productive forestland above the mountain forest border (52.5\%) and north Sweden in general (6.3\%). A total of 300,000 ha of previously not clear-felled mountain forest outside protected areas remain, which can support novel value chains that are not achievable elsewhere. Conclusions: The mountain forests in Sweden provide unique conservation values in the European Union. Since the beginning of the 1990s, policy regulations have been successful in limiting forest harvesting. Currently, however, mountain forests are a battle ground regarding intensification of forest use, including logging of forests that have never been subject to clear-felling systems vs. nature conservation and wilderness as a base for rural development. The ability of mountain municipalities to encourage sustainable rural forest landscapes must be strengthened.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization management of open-field crops. Opportunities for improvement of nitrogen use efficiency based on crop nitrogen status monitoring. The improvement of nitrogen use efficiency in crops is currently an important issue in farming due to current and future economical and environmental constraints. Splitting of N fertilizer application is the most suitable approach for providing an optimal match of N need and supply. The implementation of monitoring methods to assess crop N status is required to define the relevant amounts and periods required for split applications. This paper discusses the available methods of split N fertilizer application and their mode of use and implementation. After a short overview of the concept of crop N status, the main existing methods to estimate nitrogen needs are examined for their accuracy, specificity and sensitivity based on research conducted at CRA-W (Production and Sectors Department, Crop Production Systems Unit) over the last two decades, focusing specifically on the potato crop. The methods and the results described relate to the petiole sap nitrate concentration test assessed via a reflectometer, the measurement of leaf chlorophyll concentration with a handheld chlorophyll meter, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence readings with handheld fluorimeters, and the measurement of crop light reflectance with a handheld radiometer (ground-based remote sensing) or with satellite imagery (spatial remote sensing). Conditions for implementing such methods within decision support systems are briefly described, by focusing on the need to use relative values rather than raw values taken from the readings, and also on the requirement for threshold value definition. The integration of crop nitrogen status values into N fertilization recommendation models is illustrated through a Decision Support System created at CRA-W for the potato crop.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},

Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Wetlands provide many essential ecosystem services for human well-being. The ecological assessment of wetland ecosystem services is problematic and thus is an important focus in the field of ecological research. In this study, an ecological assessment system containing the ecosystem product value, ecosystem regulation service value, and ecosystem cultural service value was established to calculate the gross ecosystem product in the Nansi Lake Wetland, China. Based on remote sensing images, field studies, and literature reviews, the gross ecosystem product was estimated for the years 1985, 1992, 2005, 2011, and 2017. The results showed that the gross ecosystem product of the Nansi Lake Wetland increased from 40.91 x 10(8) USD in 1985 to 46.28 x 10(8) USD in 2017. The gross ecosystem product of the altered wetlands increased by about 8.5 times with a rising linear relationship, while natural wetlands presented a nonlinear relationship. Furthermore, except for the changes in climatic condition, anthropogenic interference factors such as coal mining activities, farming practices, and government policies have promoted significant services in the Nansi Lake Wetland over the past 30 years. This study could provide important insight into the ecological assessment of wetland ecosystems and thus inform policy for the protection and better use of wetland resources.},

Title = {Estimating the Societal Benefits of Satellite Instruments: Application to a Break-even Analysis of the GeoXO Hyperspectral IR Sounder},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {This paper describes the process, and lessons learned in a preliminary benefits study of a proposed infrared hyperspectral sounder (HSS) for NOAA's next generation geostationary satellite program (GeoXO). The valuation of government-owned satellite systems providing a public good with a complex array of instruments is a nascent field of study. Many different sensor configurations are possible, but there are restrictions due to physical and budget constraints. Accounting for economic considerations during the design and planning phase for satellite constellations helps to ensure that the most cost effective instruments are selected. To assess whether the HSS instrument should be included on GeoXO, we applied a value of information approach and found the benefits associated with this instrument are likely to substantially outweigh the costs. Value of information studies often focus on data and information that has a direct use case. Estimating benefits for the HSS is especially challenging because data are not used directly by decision makers. Instead these data along with information from other Earth observing (EO) satellites play a key role in producing the inputs necessary for modern numerical hydrometeorological modeling. We describe strategies to assess the marginal (i.e., incremental) contribution of an instrument that is part of a complex information production process. We make several recommendations that, if implemented, would improve the quality of future studies of this kind. This includes (1) a systems approach to observing system planning, (2) improving the design of observing system experiments (OSSE and OSE), and (3) better tracking of the decisions and needs of end-users, especially those external to the agency.},

A variety of parameters can be inferred via altimeter measurements, including sea surface height, sea surface wind speeds, significant wave heights, and topography of land, sea ice, and ice sheets. Taking advantage of these parameters with the long record of altimeter data spanning multiple decades has allowed a diverse range of societal applications. As the constellation of altimeter satellites grows, the proven value of the missions to a diverse user community can now be demonstrated by highlighting a selection of verifiable success stories. In this paper, we review selected altimeter success stories that incorporate altimetry data, alone or in conjunction with numerical models or other Earth observations, to solve a key societal problem. First, we define the problem or the key challenge of each use case, and then we articulate the uptake of the successful altimeter-based solution. Our review revealed steady progress by scientific and stakeholder communities in bridging the gap between data availability and their actual uptake to address a variety of applications. Highlighting these altimeter-based success stories can serve to further promote the widespread adoption of future satellite missions such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission scheduled for launch in 2022. Knowledge of the breadth of current utility of altimeter observations can help the scientific community to demonstrate the value in continuing radar altimeter and similar missions, particularly those with expanded capabilities, such as SWOT.},

Abstract = {Since reform and opening up to outside world, ever-growing economy and development of urbanization of China have caused expansion of the urban land scale. It's necessary to grasp the information about urban spatial form change, expansion situation and expanding regularity, in order to provide the scientific basis for urban management and planning. The traditional methods, like land supply cumulative method and remote sensing, to get the urban area, existed some defects. Their results always doesn't accord with the reality, and can't reflects the actual size of the urban area. Therefore, we propose a new method, making the best use of remote sensing, the population data, road data and other social economic statistic data. Because urban boundary not only expresses a geographical concept, also a social economic systems. It's inaccurate to describe urban area with only geographic areas. We firstly use remote sensing images, demographic data, road data and other data to produce urban boundary respectively. Then we choose the weight value for each boundary, and in terms of a certain model the ultimate boundary can be obtained by a series of calculations of previous boundaries. To verify the validity of this method, we design a set of experiments and obtained the preliminary results. The results have shown that this method can extract the urban area well and conforms with both the broad and narrow sense. Compared with the traditional methods, it's more real-time, objective and ornamental.},

Abstract = {The MORERA program has recently been selected as one of the ``Missions Science and Innovation{''} from the Spanish CDTI, an innovative program targeting solutions for deep social problems through innovation. The main Spanish industry is Agriculture (11\% GDP), but this sector is threatened by climate change, as 34\% of the Spanish irrigated surface is considered out of balance. Difficulty of providing useful and fully processed information to the end-users for supporting their decisions severely affect the optimization of the resources. Well informed decisions optimize resources and costs, maximizing productivity. To solve this problem, MORERA involves in a unique project the complete value chain, from sensor to user, thanks to a solid consortium, and it is based on three pillars: Final personalized irrigation requirements that will be directly provided to the user using a mobile device. Artificial intelligence techniques will be used to combine all relevant data to build a final watering recommendation. A compact and highly specific freeform optical instrument will be used to estimate evapotranspiration data at farm level with required TIR bandwidth and spatial resolution. Since no present instrument fulfills these requirements, it will be developed in the framework of the project. The MORERA concept can be extrapolated to many remote sensing applications, and to take advantage of this, it has been conceived as a modular system, where each module may be adapted with minor impact. This first system is focused on providing precise irrigation and fertilization recommendations, as well as self-learning yield estimations.},

Abstract = {Global biophysical data are increasingly accessible due to improvements in remote sensing and open datasets. These datasets can be of particular value in remote and data-poor environments to enable estimates of water quality impacts from catchment land clearing. Given the resources required to collect field observations and calibrate detailed process-based models, global datasets are often the only sources available to parameterise simple models however the comparative use of these data sources in process-based models is relatively unexplored. This study compares the widely applied models of Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to a tropical catchment in the Solomon Islands using globally available data. These uncalibrated models are contrasted with a SWAT model calibrated with measured streamflow and turbidity in the catchment and meteorologically forced by data from a nearby weather station. These catchment models were coupled with models of sedimentation to examine deposition rates in the coastal lagoon adjacent to the catchment. Model validation using measured coastal sedimentation rates demonstrated that simpler modelling approaches (one-dimensional basin sedimentation and two-dimensional sediment extent modelling) were marginally better than more complex approaches (three-dimensional Delft3D) in data-poor conditions. However, investment in local catchment observations significantly improved the accuracy of simulation outputs. This insight can guide decisions about model complexity, data-richness and investment in local environmental monitoring in these challenging environments.},

Title = {An Overview of Flood Concepts, Challenges, and Future Directions},

Abstract = {This review provides a broad overview of the current state of flood research, current challenges, and future directions. Beginning with a discussion of flood-generating mechanisms, the review synthesizes the literature on flood forecasting, multivariate and nonstationary flood frequency analysis, urban flooding, and the remote sensing of floods. Challenges and future flood research directions are outlined and highlight emerging topics where more work is needed to help mitigate flood risks. It is anticipated that the future urban systems will likely have more significant flood risk due to the compounding effects of continued climate change and land-use intensification. The timely prediction of urban floods, quantification of the socioeconomic impacts of flooding, and developing mitigation strategies will continue to be challenging. There is a need to bridge the scales between model capabilities and end-user needs by integrating multiscale models, stakeholder input, and social and citizen science input for flood monitoring, mapping, and dissemination. Although much progress has been made in using remote sensing for flood applications, recent and upcoming Earth Observations provide excellent potential to unlock additional benefits for flood applications. The flood community can benefit from more downscaled, as well as ensemble scenarios that consider climate and land-use changes. Efforts are also needed for data assimilation approaches, especially to ingest local, citizen, and social media data. Also needed are enhanced capabilities to model compound hazards and assess as well as help reduce social vulnerability and impacts. The dynamic and complex interactions between climate, societal change, watershed processes, and human factors often confronted with deep uncertainty highlights the need for transdisciplinary research between science, policymakers, and stakeholders to reduce flood risk and social vulnerability.

Abstract = {Remote sensing from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) was expected to be an important new technology to assist farmers with precision agriculture, especially crop nutrient management. There are three advantages using UAS platforms compared to manned aircraft platforms with the same sensor for precision agriculture: (1) smaller ground sample distances, (2) incident light sensors for image calibration, and (3) canopy height models created from structure-from-motion point clouds. These developments hold promise for future data products. In order to better match vendor capabilities with farmer requirements, we classify applications into three general niches: (1) scouting for problems, (2) monitoring to prevent yield losses, and (3) planning crop management operations. The three different niches have different requirements for sensor calibration and have different costs of operation. Planning crop management operations may have the most environmental and economic benefits. However, a USDA Economic Research Report showed that only about 20\% of farmers in the USA have adopted variable rate applicators; so, most farmers in the USA may not have the technology to benefit from management plans. In the near-term, monitoring to prevent yield losses from weeds, insects, and diseases may provide the most economic and environmental benefits, but the costs for data acquisition need to be reduced.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of land use land cover (LULC) changes on carbon sequestration in the Hayat-ul-Mir subtropical scrub reserve forest, Pakistan. Supervised maximum likelihood classification of Landsat satellite imagery was done to assess spatio-temporal changes in LULC during 2007, 2013 and 2019. The CA-Markov model was used to simulate LULC of 2030. Spatial LULC data and carbon pools data was processed in Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) carbon model to investigate the effect of LULC on future carbon dynamics. The analysis revealed increase in cover of A. modesta and O. ferruginea and decrease in agriculture, built up and barren area of forest during 2007-2019 and 2030. The analysis also showed that the forest would additionally sequester 111 Mg C with an overall Net Present Value of \$4112.05 in year 2030. The analysis revealed LULC changes on 25\% area with increase and decrease in the value of ecosystem service (at some location) from carbon storage and loss as CO2 emissions respectively depending on the type of LULC converted.

Abstract = {According to the Food and Agricultural Organization the mariculture has generated interest in recent years due to its importance in obtaining foods of high nutritional value for the growing world population. In Ecuador, the aim is to promote the diversification of the aquaculture sector, so this project goals to identify potential areas for the multi-trophic cultivation of Kappaphycus alvarezii and Crassostrea gigas, in Santa Elena - Ecuador. To enhance the production of these species spatial planning is necessary, based on the biological requirements of the organisms to be cultivated, the current legal regulations and considering possible conflicts of use. Nine environmental and socio- economic criteria were identified and obtained, making use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing. Subsequently, the reclassification of these criteria was carried out based on the optimal cultivation ranges of both species, to finally continue with the Boolean superposition of layers, resulting in a map showing the areas suitable for cultivation. These results indicate that multi-criteria analysis offers an overview that is important for decision-making within integrated coastal management and spatial planning.},

Abstract = {Investments in space systems are substantial, indivisible, and irreversible, characteristics of high-risk investments. Traditional approaches to system design, acquisition, and risk mitigation are derived from a cost-centric mindset, and as such they incorporate little information about the value of the spacecraft to its stakeholders. These traditional approaches are appropriate in stable environments. However, the current technical and economic conditions are distinctly uncertain and rapidly changing. Consequently, these traditional approaches have to be revisited and adapted to the current context. We propose that in uncertain environments, decision-making with respect to design and acquisition choices should be value-based. We develop a value-centric framework, analytical tools, and an illustrative numerical example for communication satellites. Our two proposed metrics for decision-making are the system's expected value and value uncertainty. Expected value is calculated as the expected NPV of the satellite. The cash inflow is calculated as a function of the satellite loading, its transponder pricing, and market demand. The cash outflows are the various costs for owning and operating the satellite. Value uncertainty emerges due to uncertainties in the various cash flow streams, in particular because of market conditions. We propagate market uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulation, and translate it into value uncertainty for the satellite. The end result is a portfolio of Pareto-optimal satellite design alternatives. By using value and value uncertainty as decision metrics in the down-selection process, decision-makers draw on more information about the system in its environment, and in making value-based design and acquisition choices, they ultimately make more informed and better choices.

Title = {Impact assessment of a satellite data infrastructure Application to the management of forest clear-cuts in France},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an exploratory framework for assessing the economic impacts of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) based on the example of the GEOSUD SDI and clear-cutting maps related to forest management. The valuation is based on an online survey covering the Ministry of Agriculture services in charge of controlling clear-cutting operations carried out by forest operators. The approach developed crosses two complementary points of view. On the one hand, it is based on an economic logic to estimate certain effects at the scale of the value chain related to the production and the use of satellite imagery and derived thematic products and services. The main effects measured concerned the cost and productivity savings, the added value created at the scale of the value chain linked to these clear-cut maps. In total, it appears that for one euro invested in the operation of the SDI (excluding initial investment), the added value created directly and indirectly amounts to a maximum of (SIC)63 and the transaction costs avoided to (SIC)24. On the other hand, it is also part of a management logic to understand the effects of IDGS linked to innovation processes at the level of a community of practice. SDI enable coordination and pooling gains to be made in order to co-construct knowledge leading to new products and/or processes. The study showed that nearly two-thirds of the structures surveyed observed qualitative effects in terms of networking and a strengthening of skills linked to the training and support services offered by the GEOSUD platform. Qualitative effects on the properties of forest policies and more generally on territorial development dynamics are also considered.},

Title = {Fusing Social Media, Remote Sensing, and Fire Dynamics to Track Wildland-Urban Interface Fire},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wildfire is one of the main hazards affecting large areas and causes great damage all over the world, and the rapid development of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) increases the threat of wildfires that have ecological, social, and economic consequences. As one of the most widely used methods for tracking fire, remote sensing can provide valuable information about fires, but it is not always available, and needs to be supplemented by data from other sources. Social media is an emerging but underutilized data source for emergency management, contains a wealth of disaster information, and reflects the public's real-time witness and feedback to fires. In this paper, we propose a fusion framework of multi-source data analysis, including social media data and remote sensing data, cellphone signaling data, terrain data, and meteorological data to track WUI fires. Using semantic web technology, the framework has been implemented as a Knowledge Base Service and runs on top of WUIFire ontology. WUIFire ontology represents WUI fire-related knowledge and consists of three modules: system, monitoring, and spread, and tracks wildfires happening in WUIs. It provides a basis for tracking and analyzing a WUI fire by fusing multi-source data. To showcase the utility of our approach in a real-world scenario, we take the fire in the Yaji Mountain Scenic Area, Beijing, China, in 2019 as a case study. With object information identified from remote sensing, fire situation information extracted from Weibo, and fire perimeters constructed through fire spread simulation, a knowledge graph is constructed and an analysis using a semantic query is carried out to realize situational awareness and determine countermeasures. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of using a semantically improved multi-source data fusion framework for tracking WUI fire.},

Abstract = {A brief presentation of performed works on the EU project OBSERVE Strengthening and development of Earth observation activities for the environment in the Balkan area has been presented. The theme of the project (ENV. 2010.4.1.4-1) is Identification and Networking of EO activities in the Balkan area (observe-fp7. eu). The goal of the project, in which 15 institutions from 13 countries have been involved, is to collect and compile all the necessary information for delivering an integrated analysis on the current status of EO activities and networks in the Balkan area, regarding environmental monitoring, the potential benefit from the full exploitation of an integrated capacity development strategy and the prospect of creating a relevant permanent EO community in the broader area. The objective of the project is also to raise awareness and establish firm links with the regional decision making bodies on the importance of a mutual and enhanced EO application network on environmental monitoring according, to the GEO principles. Apart from the creation of stakeholder's database containing basic data on the identified stakeholders in each country, 276 of them registered in 11 countries (31 in Croatia), the Roadmap and Strategy plan, for strengthening EO capacity in the Balkans with the purpose of environmental monitoring has been developed. Also, a number of studies have been carried out: (a) National Thematic Reports on EO Capacities, (b) Spatial Information System, (c) Establishment of common standards and requirements for EO data management etc. It is concluded that the Balkan countries do not have a coherent and continuous approach towards the challenge of implementating due integrated EO applications in environmental monitoring and management.},

Abstract = {We studied the quantity and spatial and dynamic changes of land use and ecosystem service functions in Nanping City from 1995 to 2015 using of Landsat TM/ETM images in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2005, and 2015. The results show that the main land use types in the study area were forest land, cultivated land, and grassland, and the rapid growth rate of forest land was in sharp contrast with the decrease of cultivated land. In the conversion of six land use types, conversions among the forest land, cultivated land, and grassland were the most frequent. The forest was spatially schistose distribution and the grassland was clustered in the central and eastern parts, and the construction land was clustered to the central urban area, and the cultivated land was particularly broken, and the distribution pattern changes of the water area and unused land were not obvious. The dynamic changes of cultivated land, construction land, and unused land were more intense and their stability were worse, and the activity of land use in the study area was also increasing. The value of ecosystem services in Nanping was on the rise, and the contribution rate of forest ecosystem services was the highest, which accounted for more than 85\% of the whole ecosystem service function, followed by grassland and cultivated land. The contribution rate of water area and unused land decreased less, while the contribution rate of unused land was minimal. Population is one of the driving factors that affect land use changes and the value of ecosystem services in Nanping.},

Abstract = {Species distribution models are required for the research and management of biodiversity in the hyperdiverse tropical forests, but reliable and ecologically relevant digital environmental data layers are not always available. We here assess the usefulness of multispectral canopy reflectance (Landsat) relative to climate data in modelling understory plant species distributions in tropical rainforests. We used a large dataset of quantitative fern and lycophyte species inventories across lowland Amazonia as the basis for species distribution modelling (SDM). As predictors, we used CHELSA climatic variables and canopy reflectance values from a recent basin-wide composite of Landsat TM/ETM+ images both separately and in combination. We also investigated how species accumulate over sites when environmental distances were expressed in terms of climatic or surface reflectance variables. When species accumulation curves were constructed such that differences in Landsat reflectance among the selected plots were maximised, species accumulated faster than when climatic differences were maximised or plots were selected in a random order. Sixty-nine species were sufficiently frequent for species distribution modelling. For most of them, adequate SDMs were obtained whether the models were based on CHELSA data only, Landsat data only or both combined. Model performance was not influenced by species' prevalence or abundance. Adding Landsat-based environmental data layers overall improved the discriminatory capacity of SDMs compared to climate-only models, especially for soil specialist species. Our results show that canopy surface reflectance obtained by multispectral sensors can provide studies of tropical ecology, as exemplified by SDMs, much higher thematic (taxonomic) detail than is generally assumed. Furthermore, multispectral datasets complement the traditionally used climatic layers in analyses requiring information on environmental site conditions. We demonstrate the utility of freely available, global remote sensing data for biogeographical studies that can aid conservation planning and biodiversity management.},

Abstract = {The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is implemented by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) with the goal to ensure that decision in nine Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs) of Earth observations (EOs) can be informed by sustained Earth observations. Extracting actionable information from Earth observations often depends on research, and utilization of the societal benefits of EOs requires the involvement of science and research communities. Building a GEOSS responding to the needs of a wide range of users necessitates contributions from many science and technology (S\&T) communities. The success of GEOSS depends on a outreach of GEO to the relevant S\&T communities, and the outreach concept has a focus on demonstrated services for S\&T communities. The GEO Work Plan includes several Tasks focusing on outreach to S\&T communities, and most of the GEO Community of Practice have a strong S\&T component. Infrastructure serving and linking S\&T users communities and GEOSS has been developed and is integrated into a GEOSS S\&T Service Suite. The GEOSS S\&T Stakeholder Network facilitates input from S\&T communities to GEO.},

Title = {Ecological footprint and total material requirement as environmental indicators of mining activities: Case studies of copper mines},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The production of mineral resources negatively affects the natural environment, which is a topic of urgent discussion in sustainable natural resource use/management. In this study, we explored appropriate environmental indicators of mining activities that might be easy to account for and deemed suitable as a first-order estimation of overall environmental impacts. We distinguish the differential impact between operations rather than providing a strictly estimated integrated single indicator value. Considering the increasing interests in land use change and associated impacts, ecological footprint (EF) was chosen as first indicator, and Total Material Requirement (TMR) was also chosen to complement EF. Both the operational and remote-sensing based satellite data were used in this study by using three copper mines as case studies. The results propose that EF for built-up land works well by showing above the ground impacts for mining activities and TMR complements EF with its ability to reflect the underground activities.},

Abstract = {With the continuous development of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data technology, and intelligent agriculture have become hot topics in agricultural science and technology research. Machine learning is one of the core topics in artificial intelligence, and its application has penetrated every aspect of human social life. In modern agricultural intelligent management and decision making, machine learning plays an important role in crop classification, crop disease and insect pest prediction, agricultural product price prediction, and other aspects of management and decision-making processes in agriculture. To detect and recognize the latest research developing features in a quantitative and visual way, and based on machine learning methods in agricultural management, the authors of this paper used CiteSpace bibliometric methods to analyze relevant studies on the development process and hot spots. High-value references, productive authors, country and institution distributions, journal visualizations, research topics, and emerging trends were reviewed and analyzed. According to the keyword visualization and high-value references, machine learning approaches focus on sustainable agriculture, water resources, remote sensing, and machine learning methods. The research mainly focuses on six topics: learning technology, land environment, reference evapotranspiration, decision support systems for river geography, soil management, and winter wheat, while learning technology has been the most popular in recent years.},

Title = {Soil organic carbon prediction using phenological parameters and remote sensing variables generated from Sentinel-2 images},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {It is important to predict the spatial distribution of SOC accurately for migrating carbon emission and sustainable soil management. Environmental variables influence the accuracy of SOC prediction with digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches. In addition to the commonly-used natural predictors, remote sensing variables have been recently used in DSM. However, it is still challenging which variables are effective to predict SOC in farmland. Although phenological parameters have been recently used to indicate human activities that affect SOC in farmland, there are few studies that employ the phenological parameters in SOC prediction. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of SOC prediction with the phenological parameters and numerous remote sensing variables extracted from Sentinel-2 at high temporal and spatial resolutions. From 34 Sentinel-2 time series images from 2018 to 2019, 17 phenological parameters were extracted for Xuanzhou, Anhui Province using a dynamic threshold method. Furthermore, fifteen remote sensing predictors comprised of vegetation indices, bright-related indices, and moisture indices were generated from the Sentinel-2 images. The phenological parameters and remote sensing variables were combined with natural variables to predict SOC contents at the surface soil layer using random forest. The results showed that the auxiliary parameters, i.e., the phenological parameters and remote sensing predictors, enhanced the predictability of SOC with an increase in R-2 by 171\% and a decrease in RMSE by 14\%. This study also identified relatively more important auxiliary parameters for the SOC prediction: the largest data value for the fitted function during the season (a6), rate of increase at the beginning of the season (a8), large seasonal integral (a10), SATVI, and Band8. Therefore, this study verified that the phenological parameters and remote sensing predictors extracted from the Sentinel-2 EVI time series are effective for DSM in farmland.},

Abstract = {Due to economic growth and the development of urban modernization, the amount of construction waste is increasing year by year. The rapid identification of large-scale construction waste deposit is beneficial to improving urban planning and management capabilities. This article is based on the three-line array image stereo data of Resources satellite three to obtain DEM. At that time, Renzhuang Village in Pingdingshan was a test area. Based on the DEM elevation change information, the surface roughness coefficient of the structured surface was used as an irregular elevation texture feature, combined with the slope and aspect, to obtain the construction waste accumulation of other ground objects in the surrounding area. The overall recognition rate is 85.12\%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.70. It provides application value for the rapid identification of construction waste accumulation and its change information management and safety instability analysis.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Number = {420},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Aquatic macrophytes are often monitored to detect change in ecosystem function and state, as well as assessing the effectiveness of invasive aquatic plant management. This study compares seven methodologies to monitor the distribution and abundances of aquatic macrophytes. Four line transect methodologies and three spatial mapping techniques were employed in parallel over a broad turbidity gradient in two lentic habitats of south-eastern Australia. The methodologies examined included hydroacoustic surveys, on-site digitising, and digitisation of airborne remote sensing imagery. Variation in estimates of macrophyte coverage were observed between methodologies. Consistency in the collection and interpretation of data was greatest for the line transect methodologies and the digitisation of satellite imagery. Duel-frequency identification sonar proved to be an effective novel hydroacoustic technique to monitor macrophyte abundances over broad spatial scales. Single beam sonar transects was also an objective, repeatable and scalable methodology. Videography and on-site handheld PDA mapping were of limited utility due to restrictions imposed by turbidity. The utility of sidescan sonar could be improved when used in conjunction with on-site handheld PDA mapping. This study outlines important considerations when selecting a methodology to monitor macrophyte distribution and abundance. Results indicate that no one specific method can be employed across all macrophyte monitoring studies. The method or combination of methods employed during macrophyte monitoring studies is dependent upon the study objectives, budget and environmental conditions of the study site.},

Title = {Dynamic modes and ecological effects of salt field utilization in the Weifang coastal area, China: Implications for territorial spatial planning},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Harmonious coexistence between human and nature has been an important prerequisite for territorial spatial planning to construct ecological civilizations. The effective way is essential to quantify dynamic modes of land use changes and their ecological effects. Taking the coastal area of Weifang, eastern regions in China as a case study area, this paper quantified the spatiotemporal characteristics and ecosystem service value of salt field utilization using the theories and methods of geoscience analysis by using satellite imagery and land-use change survey data. The results showed that the area of salt field utilization first increased and then decreased with an upward trend in spatial separation. In the early study stage, the saline-alkali land was mainly developed into a salt field, following with the salt field into construction land, and the salt field into water. Changes in the utilization of salt fields reduced the value of ecosystem services by 3 million yuan RMB during the study period. Ecological value-added areas and ecological impaired areas were mainly located in economically developed areas such as Dajiawa Subdistrict, Yangzi Subdistrict and Yangkou Town. These results show that changes in the utilization of salt fields have different effects on ecosystem service values in different regions. It is necessary for Weifang to comprehensively control the utilization of salt fields, and to provide a reference for the preparation of territorial spatial planning.},

Abstract = {Scientists have made efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ecosystem service valuation and mapping; yet little actual implementation of new ecosystem service knowledge has been delivered in practice. We explored this gap by developing a spatially explicit and semi-qualitative evaluation approach to clarify how the spatial patterns of new town developments impact three types of water-related regulating ecosystem services, namely water flow regulation, flooding mitigation, and water quality regulation. Based on peer-reviewed publications, we identified key indicators with spatial characteristics that practitioners care about and have control of. We investigated the case of Lingang, a satellite city of Shanghai in the Yangtze River Delta, and found that (1) 85.30\% of the pre-urban East Lingang with native marshlands performed better holistically while 93.06\% of the post-urban East Lingang using the man-made lakeside model performed poorly; (2) 82.47\% of the double grids model at West Lingang performed poorly in pre-urban time, while some major waterways were improved by the Hydrological Planning; and (3) a major weakness in the planning process was the ignorance in conserving pre-urban ecological resources, preventing the provision of ecosystem services. Finally, four urban design principles of both large-scale land use considerations and finer-scale design implications were proposed.},

Abstract = {The application of satellite precipitation estimates from NASA's Global Precipitation Measure-ment (GPM) Mission for decision-making has been a focus for the mission since launch. As a result, GPM data have enabled a range of applications that address societal needs, including water resource management, crop forecasting, ecological monitoring, disaster response, public health, aviation, weather forecasting, and climate modeling, among others. GPM applications activities have continued to focus on user engagement through in person trainings and interviews, work-shops, webinars, and educational outreach activities. The goals of these efforts are to synthesize community data needs in order to effectively support and enable decision-making across agencies, academia and the global community. While these efforts have helped the GPM mission establish a large stakeholder community that encompasses federal and state partners, academic institutions, and private and nonprofit companies, there remains difficulties associated with accessing, pro-cessing, and applying the data to support or enable applications. In this article, we present GPM applications strategies and approaches used to enhance the applications value of GPM data, and most importantly, demonstrate how these efforts have and can inform different decision-making contexts. This work also provides a discussion on key lessons learned from the user community and how this information can be utilized to help better support and shape applications ap-proaches for future NASA Earth Science missions.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Change and Landscape Pattern Variation of Eco-Environmental Quality in Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration From 2001 to 2015},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {125534-125548},
Abstract = {Identifying the changes and relationships between regional eco-environment quality and landscape pattern in an urban agglomeration have a great significance in realizing sustainable development goal. However, limited research has been performed to understand the spatiotemporal change of eco-environment quality, the variation of landscape pattern, and their relationship in an urban agglomeration. This study selected the Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) urban agglomeration as the study area. A comprehensive index, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), was utilized to understand the eco-environment spatiotemporal change and landscape pattern variation at class-level and landscape-level of JJJ during 2001 similar to 2015, then, their relationship was explored. The major conclusions were as follows: (1) The average RSEI value of JJJ increased from 0.43 to 0.46, which represented that the eco-environment of JJJ had improved in the fourteen years. Among it, the improved region was mainly located in Zhangjiakou city, while the degraded region was mainly distributed in the eastern Hebei plain. (2) The landscape characteristics of entire JJJ eco-environment were becoming more aggregated, connected, diverse, and regular. However, fair, moderate, and good grades were getting more concentrated and continuous; poor grade indicated a more fragmented and disconnected trend; excellent grade displayed an expanded and concentrated situation. (3) Human factors have an increasing influence on regional eco-environment changes. (4) Fair, moderate, and good grades showed a more dominant and stronger influence on the variation of landscape pattern in JJJ. Specifically, the fair grade had a positive correlation with the variation of landscape pattern, while moderate and good grades had a negative one. All of these conclusions could be valuable information for relevant decision-makers in managing or achieving the optimal eco-environment landscape pattern.},

Title = {A hyper-temporal remote sensing protocol for high-resolution mapping of ecological sites},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Ecological site classification has emerged as a highly effective land management framework, but its utility at a regional scale has been limited due to the spatial ambiguity of ecological site locations in the U. S. or the absence of ecological site maps in other regions of the world. In response to these shortcomings, this study evaluated the use of hyper-temporal remote sensing (i. e., hundreds of images) for high spatial resolution mapping of ecological sites. We posit that hyper-temporal remote sensing can provide novel insights into the spatial variability of ecological sites by quantifying the temporal response of land surface spectral properties. This temporal response provides a spectral `fingerprint' of the soil-vegetation- climate relationship which is central to the concept of ecological sites. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to predict the spatial distribution of ecological sites in a semi-arid rangeland using a 28-year time series of normalized difference vegetation index from Landsat TM 5 data and modeled using support vector machine classification. Results from this study show that support vector machine classification using hyper-temporal remote sensing imagery was effective in modeling ecological site classes, with a 62\% correct classification. These results were compared to Gridded Soil Survey Geographic database and expert delineated maps of ecological sites which had a 51 and 89\% correct classification, respectively. An analysis of the effects of ecological state on ecological site misclassifications revealed that sites in degraded states (e. g., shrub-dominated/shrubland and bare/annuals) had a higher rate of misclassification due to their close spectral similarity with other ecological sites. This study identified three important factors that need to be addressed to improve future model predictions: 1) sampling designs need to fully represent the range of both within class (i. e., states) and between class (i. e., ecological sites) spectral variability through time, 2) field sampling protocols that accurately characterize key soil properties (e. g., texture, depth) need to be adopted, and 3) additional environmental covariates (e. g. terrain attributes) need to be evaluated that may help further differentiate sites with similar spectral signals. Finally, the proposed hyper-temporal remote sensing framework may provide a standardized approach to evaluate and test our ecological site concepts through examining differences in vegetation dynamics in response to climatic variability and other drivers of land-use change. Results from this study demonstrate the efficacy of the hyper-temporal remote sensing approach for high resolution mapping of ecological sites, (a)nd highlights its utility in terms of reduced cost and time investment relative to traditional manual mapping approaches.},

Abstract = {To properly define satellite lifetime so as to maximize economic net benefit, the lifetime optimization method is studied in this paper based on discrete cross entropy (CE) method. Firstly, the influences of lifetime on satellite system design, cost and revenue are studied and the disciplinary models are developed. Then the lifetime optimization problem is formulated, which is a typical discrete optimization problem with the discrete lifetime measured in years and the combination of the subsystem components as design variables. To efficiently solve this problem, the CE method is used as the optimization solver, and a convolution based smoothing strategy is proposed to enhance the space exploration capability and algorithm robustness. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in a 19 dimensional satellite lifetime design problem, which also verifies the importance of lifetime optimization in enhancing the satellite economic benefit.},

Abstract = {France experiences catastrophic floods on a yearly basis, with significant societal impacts. In this study, we use multiple sources (insurance datasets, scientific articles, satellite data, and grey literature) to (1) analyze modern flood disasters in the PACA Region; (2) discuss the efficiency of French public policy instruments; (3) perform a SWOT analysis of French flood risk governance (FRG); and (4) suggest improvements to the FRG framework. Despite persistent government efforts, the impacts of flood events in the region have not lessened over time. Identical losses in the same locations are observed after repeated catastrophic events. Relative exposure to flooding has increased in France, apparently due to intense urbanization of flood-prone land. We suggest that the French FRG could benefit from the following improvements: (1) regular updates of risk prevention plans and tools; (2) the adoption of a build back better logic; (3) taking undeclared damages into account in flood risk models; (4) better communication between the actors at the different steps of each cycle (preparation, control, organization, etc.); (5) better communication between those responsible for risk prevention, emergency management, and disaster recovery; (6) an approach that extends the risk analysis outside the borders of the drainage basin; and (7) increased participation in FRG from local populations.},

Abstract = {California's Central Valley grows a significant fraction of grapes used for wine production in the United States. With increasing vineyard acreage, reduced water availability in much of California, and competing water use interests, it is critical to be able to monitor regional water use and evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, but also in detail at individual field scales to improve water management within these viticulture production systems. This can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotemporal characteristics. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014. The system employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion methodology (STARFM: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model) combined with a multi-scale ET retrieval algorithm based on the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation to compute daily ET at 30 m resolution. In this system, TSEB is run using thermal band imagery from the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellites (GOES; 4 km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new Landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, similar to 16 day acquisition). Estimates of daily ET generated in two neighboring fields of Pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based flux measurements acquired in-field during most of the 2013 season with relative mean absolute errors on the order of 19-23\% (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mm d(-1)), reducing to 14-20\% at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (similar to 5 mm wk(-1)). A model overestimation of ET in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management. The results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil moisture status at field-scales over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops.

Abstract = {This work addressed the multi-objective optimization of a biogas production system considering both environmental and economic criteria. A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model was established and solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, from which the Pareto fronts, the optimal technology combinations and operation conditions were obtained and analyzed. It's found that the system is feasible in both environmental and economic considerations after optimization. The most expensive processing section is decarbonization; the most expensive equipment is anaerobic digester; the most power-consuming processing section is digestion, followed by decarbonization and waste management. The positive green degree value on the process is attributed to processing section of digestion and waste management. 3:1 chicken feces and corn straw, solar energy, pressure swing adsorption and 3:1 chicken feces and rice straw, solar energy, pressure swing adsorption are turned out to be two robust technology combinations under different prices of methane and electricity by sensitivity analysis. The optimization results provide support for optimal design and operation of biogas production system considering environmental and economic objectives.

Title = {Land Use and Land Cover Change Effects on the Value of Ecosystem Services in the Konqi River Basin, China, under Ecological Water Conveyance Conditions},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Basin ecosystems are vulnerable to natural resource depletion, ecological damage, and environmental pollution due to their fragile natural environment. Assessing the value of basin ecosystem services (ES) can facilitate informed decision making by policy makers and stakeholders in the context of competing resource use. The Konqi River Basin in China, an arid inland river basin, has suffered from degraded ecosystems due to overexploitation of soil and water resources. In response, the local government launched an ecological water conveyance (EWC) project in 2016 to enhance ecological restoration efforts. This paper analyzes and evaluates the value of ES in the Konqi River Basin based on land use and land cover (LULC) change characteristics before and after EWC in 2013 and 2020, respectively. Remote sensing data and related socioeconomic statistics data are used to assess a typical river basin from three unique locations in the Konqi River Basin, divided into upper and lower reaches. The results show that cropland and unused land are the most important land use types in the upper and lower reaches. The characteristics of ecosystem service value (ESV) changes in the study area are consistent with land use structure changes. The total ESV shows a decreasing trend in the upper reaches from 2013 to 2020, while the lower reaches show an increasing trend. The total ESV increases in the typical river reaches of the Konqi River Basin. Spatially, low-ESV areas are mainly located in ecologically fragile areas that are difficult to develop and use. The sensitivity indexes of the study area are all less than 1, making the results of this study credible. The Moran index shows a significant spatial correlation in the study area, indicating that the distribution characteristics of high-ESV areas are agglomerative. Hot spot areas in the upper reaches show an overall increasing trend, while in the lower reaches, former sub-hot spot areas transform into hot spot areas. Due to data limitations, this study is limited to demonstrating that the value of ES in the area changes due to a combination of EWC policies and other factors. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that EWC policies actively change the ESV of a typical river basin in Konqi. This study can provide a reference for evaluating ESV in inland river basins in the northwest arid region and a scientific basis for the rational development and utilization of water and soil resources in the study area, located in an arid and ecologically fragile area.},

Title = {Using Landsat 8 imagery in detecting cork oak (Quercus suber L.) woodlands: a case study in Calabria (Italy)},

Abstract = {In the Mediterranean basin, cork oak (Quercus suber L) woodlands are characteristic and widespread forestry ecosystems. Though presenting significant economic potential as a renewable resource, they are not adequately valorised, in spite of a growing market demand for cork and cork-based products, which are appreciated, today, for their use in sustainable building. In this respect, cork meets the needs of the building industry in responding to the growing demand for quality products, which are eco-and energy-friendly and hygienically safe. Moreover, European cultural and biodiversity value has been attributed to cork oak woodlands and their most significant examples have been included in the Natura 2000 framework. So far. in some countries like Italy. the territorial distribution and characterisation of cork oak woodlands have not been adequately investigated. This study provides a method for mapping the actual presence of cork oak woodlands and for assessing their potential distribution. Special attention was given to the characterisation of cork oak spectral signature. To this end, Landsat 8 satellite images, digital photointerpretation and in situ surveys were implemented. The work carried out allows assessing the effectiveness of GIS and remote sensing techniques coupled with ancillary data and tools, and their applicability for the development of a comprehensive mapping and monitoring system of cork oak woodlands in Mediterranean ecosystems. Such techniques are vital to develop a detailed management strategy and to assist restoration activities and the economic assessment of semi-natural habitats. A case study, carried out in two different locations in Calabria (Italy), is provided.},

Abstract = {In recent years the rapid development of a number of technologies used for data acquisition, processing, management, and transmission of Geospatial Information (GI), has substantially transformed how experts and common people deal with geospatial data. The capability to access geospatial information of various natures, including earth observation data, sensor data, and data stored in geospatial repositories, at increasing frequency and at relatively low cost, as well as the mass diffusion of localization technologies is in fact causing a profound technological and cultural revolution. This chapter illustrates how the new generation of geospatial technologies and Location Based Services (LBSs) can be extremely beneficial to ecosystem services and human welfare. The analysis is carried out in the context of two scenarios, selected for their significant relevance with the overall rationale of the volume, presenting the advantages brought in two different and complementary contexts such as environmental management and reduction of CO2 emissions.},

Abstract = {This research attempted to develop a damage-based crop insurance model using satellite remote sensing imagery and field surveys of flash flood regions in Bangladesh. A normalized difference water index (NDWI) was prepared from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, and inundated areas were delineated using a very high-resolution land use/land cover (LULC) map of a Survey of Bangladesh (SoB) to generate an accurate damage map for boro rice. The boro rice area damaged by flash floods in 2017 was estimated for the three most vulnerable flash flood-prone areas and sorted into high, moderate and marginal damage categories. The results of the accuracy assessment showed excellent classification performance for all classes of LULC. Analysis of the classification of the damaged area showed that the Gowainghat (44.60\%) and Kulaura (69.80\%) subdistricts were in the highest marginal damage category and that Tahirpur (52.92\%) was in the moderate damage category. The future value of expected losses was calculated to be \$536.25, \$442.00, and \$416.00 per hectare (ha) for high, moderate and marginal damage areas, respectively. Moreover, findings concerning the damaged-based crop insurance premium rate suggested that the higher the coverage levels were, the lower the insurance premium, and the lower the damaged class was, the lower the insurance premium rate. The lowest insurance premium rate was observed for areas with high coverage and moderate damage and was \$23.82/ha, and the highest insurance premium rate was observed for areas with marginal coverage and high damage and was \$39.49/ha. Evidence from the classification of damaged areas and from regression findings suggests that farmers' socioeconomic features and environmental awareness (occupation, educational level, total income, bank account ownership and awareness of climate change) are relevant to the decision to adopt a damaged-based crop insurance system. The overall results show an empirical model for flash flood occurrence over both the temporal and spatial domains, which offers an effective measure for adopting a damaged-based crop insurance model.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing image classification is an important and complex problem. Conventional remote sensing image classification methods are mostly based on Bayesian subjective probability theory, but there are many defects for its uncertainty. This paper firstly introduces evidence theory and decision tree method. Then it emphatically introduces the function of support degree that evidence theory is used on pattern recognition. Combining the D-S evidence theory with the decision tree algorithm, a D- S evidence theory decision tree method is proposed, where the support degree function is the tie. The method is used to classify the classes, such as water, urban land and green land with the exclusive spectral feature parameters as input values, and produce three classification images of support degree. Then proper threshold value is chosen and according image is handled with the method of binarization. Then overlay handling is done with these images according to the type of classifications, finally the initial result is obtained. Then further accuracy assessment will be done. If initial classification accuracy is unfit for the requirement, reclassification for images with support degree of less than threshold is conducted until final classification meets the accuracy requirements. Compared to Bayesian classification, main advantages of this method are that it can perform reclassification and reach a very high accuracy. This method is finally used to classify the land use of Yantai Economic and Technological Development Zone to four classes such as urban land, green land and water, and effectively support the classification.},

Abstract = {The past decades have witnessed rapid urbanization around the world. This is particularly evident in Zhuhai City, given its status as one of the earliest special economic zones in China. After experiencing rapid urbanization for decades, the level of ecosystem health (ESH) in Zhuhai City has become a focus of attention. Assessments of urban ESH and spatial correlations between urbanization and ESH not only reveal the states of urban ecosystems and the extent to which urbanization affected these ecosystems, but also provide new insights into sustainable eco-environmental planning and resource management. In this study, we assessed the ESH of Zhuhai City using a selected set of natural, social and economic indicators. The data used include Landsat Thematic Mapper images and socio-economic data of 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013. The results showed that the overall ESH value and ecosystem service function have been on the decline while Zhuhai City has continued to become more urbanized. The total ESH health level trended downward and the area ratio of weak and relatively weak health level increased significantly, while the areas of well and relatively well healthy state decreased since 1999. The spatial correlation analysis shows a distinct negative correlation between urbanization and ESH. The degree of negative correlation shows an upward trend with the processes of urban sprawl. The analysis results reveal the impact of urbanization on urban ESH and provide useful information for planners and environment managers to take measures to improve the health conditions of urban ecosystems.},

Title = {Monitoring the Water Stress of an Indoor Living Wall System Using the ``Triangle Method{''}},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Living walls are important vertical greening systems with modular prevegetated structures. Studies have suggested that living walls have many social benefits as an ecological engineering technique with notable potential for reconciliation ecology. Despite these benefits, there are currently no mature workflows or technologies for monitoring the health status and water stress of living wall systems. To partially fill the current knowledge gap related to water stress, we acquired thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral remote sensing data from an indoor living wall in the Cloud Forest of the Gardens by the Bay, Singapore. The surface temperature (Ts) and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were obtained from these data to construct a Ts-NDVI space for applying the ``triangle method{''}. A simple and effective algorithm was proposed to determine the dry and wet edges, the key components of the said method. The pixels associated with the dry and wet edges were then selected and highlighted to directly display the areas under water-stress conditions. Our results suggest that the proposed algorithm can provide a reasonable overview of the water-stress information of the living wall; therefore, our method can be simple and effective to monitor the health status of a living wall. Furthermore, our work confirms that the triangle method can be transferred from the outdoors to an indoor environment.},

Title = {Landfill Site Selection Using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Remote Sensing Data, and Geographic Information System Tools in Najran City, Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Many practical issues arise when dealing with solid waste management, and there are also environmental effects to be considered. Selecting landfill sites requires extra care with respect to many factors such as the environment, health hazards for people, and the cost of transportation. Furthermore, cities have their own rules, methods, and practices for managing and selecting the best locations for collecting solid waste. In this research, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was presented and used to evaluate the appropriateness of and suggest the best locations for landfill sites in Najran, KSA. Some remote sensing data and the ArcGIS software were used to prepare nine thematic layers, including drainage density, groundwater depth, land use, soil type, road network, surface elevation, surface slope, distance from residential areas, and distance from protected areas. To evaluate the layer weightings, a questionnaire with pairwise comparisons was distributed among experts and analyzed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy set technique. The one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) sensitivity test was conducted to test the sensitivity of the evaluated weightings. A landfill suitability index (LSI) map was created using raster calculator tools and divided into five classes: limited suitability (LSI value 1.39-2.49), least suitable (2.50-3.03), relatively suitable (3.04-3.48), suitable (3.49-3.91), and most suitable (3.92-4.66). According to the statistical analysis, 18.0\% and 18.2\% of the total area were within the most suitable and suitable landfill regions, while 21.2\%, 14.9\%, and 9.5\% accounted for relatively suitable, least suitable, and limited suitability areas, respectively. The employed technique and its findings can provide an appropriate guideline to assist the municipality of Najran city, regional planners, and decision-makers in selecting an optimal landfill site in the future. This study also presented some recommendations to enhance the suitability map of landfill sites in Najran city.},

Title = {Innovations in the use of data facilitating insurance as a resilience mechanism for coastal flood risk},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {661},
Pages = {598-612},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Insurance plays a crucial role in human efforts to adapt to environmental hazards. Effective insurance can serve as both a measure to distribute, and a method to communicate risk. In order for insurance to fulfil these roles successfully, policy pricing and cover choices must be risk-based and founded on accurate information. This is reliant on a robust evidence base forming the foundation of policy choices. This paper focuses on the evidence available to insurers and emergent innovation in the use of data. The main risk considered is coastal flooding, for which the insurance sector offers an option for potential adaptation, capable of increasing resilience. However, inadequate supply and analysis of data have been highlighted as factors preventing insurance from fulfilling this role. Research was undertaken to evaluate how data are currently, and could potentially, be used within risk evaluations for the insurance industry. This comprised of 50 interviews with those working and associated with the London insurance market. The research reveals new opportunities, which could facilitate improvements in risk-reflective pricing of policies. These relate to a new generation of data collection techniques and analytics, such as those associated with satellite-derived data, IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, cloud computing, and Big Data solutions. Such technologies present opportunities to reduce moral hazard through basing predictions and pricing of risk on large empirical datasets. The value of insurers' claims data is also revealed, and is shown to have the potential to refine, calibrate, and validate models and methods. The adoption of such data-driven techniques could enable insurers to re-evaluate risk ratings, and in some instances, extend coverage to locations and developments, previously rated as too high a risk to insure. Conversely, other areas may be revealed more vulnerable, which could generate negative impacts for residents in these regions, such as increased premiums. However, the enhanced risk awareness generated, by new technology, data and data analytics, could positively alter future planning, development and investment decisions. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {Alien plant species have been essential for farming and agro-forestry systems and for their supply of food, fiber, tannins, resins or wood from antiquity to the present. They also contributed to supporting functions and regulating services (water, soil, biodiversity) and to the design of landscapes with high cultural and scenic value. Some of those species were intentionally introduced, others arrived accidentally, and a small proportion escaped, naturalized and became invasive in natural ecosystems-these are known as invasive alien species (IAS). Here, invasive means that these species have some significant negative impact, either by spreading from human-controlled environments (e.g. fields, gardens) to natural ecosystems, where they can cause problems to native species, or to other production systems or urban areas, impacting on agricultural, forestry activities or human health. Socio-environmental impacts associated with plant invasions have been increasingly recognized worldwide and are expected to increase considerably under changing climate or land use. Early detection tools are key to anticipate IAS and to prevent and control their impacts. In this chapter, we focus on crop and non-crop alien plant species for which there is evidence or prediction of invasive behaviour and impacts. We provide insights on their history, patterns, risks, early detection, forecasting and management under climate change. Specifically, we start by providing a general overview on the history of alien plant species in agricultural and agroforestry systems worldwide (Sect. 1). Then, we assess patterns, risks and impacts resulting from alien plants originally cultivated and that became invasive outside cultivation areas (Sect. 2). Afterwards, we provide several considerations for managing the spread of invasive plant species in the landscape (Sect. 3). Finally, we discuss challenges of alien plant invasions for agricultural and agroforest systems, in the light of climate change (Sect. 4).},

Abstract = {With its high water potential, the Ziz basin is one of the most important basins in Morocco. This paper aims to develop a methodology for spatiotemporal monitoring of the water quality of the Hassan Addakhil dam using remote sensing techniques combined with a modeling approach. Firstly, several models were established for the different water quality parameters (nitrate, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a) by combining field and satellite data. In a second step, the calibration and validation of the selected models were performed based on the following statistical parameters: compliance index R-2, the root mean square error and p-value. Finally, the satellite data were used to carry out spatiotemporal monitoring of the water quality. The field results show excellent quality for most of the samples. In terms of the modeling approach, the selected models for the three parameters (nitrate, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a) have shown a good correlation between the measured and estimated values with compliance index values of 0.62, 0.56 and 0.58 and root mean square error values of 0.16 mg/L, 0.65 mg/L and 0.07 mu g/L for nitrate, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a, respectively. After the calibration, the validation and the selection of the models, the spatiotemporal variation of water quality was determined thanks to the multitemporal satellite data. The results show that this approach is an effective and valid methodology for the modeling and spatiotemporal mapping of water quality in the reservoir of the Hassan Addakhil dam. It can also provide valuable support for decision-makers in water quality monitoring as it can be applied to other regions with similar conditions.},

Abstract = {The use of remote sensing technology is becoming an increasingly necessary tool for planning development projects, even in developing countries such as Kenya. There is a need to use quick, accurate and convenient methods to gather information over the ever-changing environment. Remote sensing in this region can be used for surveying, vegetation monitoring in the rangelands, weather assessment and forecasting, water resources management, forest fire detection, early warning activities (drought, food, floods), migration patterns of wildlife, detection of pollution planning of infrastructure, agriculture, demographic changes, and all aspects of land use planning. Despite the great demand for remote sensing in Kenya, its use has been hampered by problems ranging from financial constraints, gaps in technology, lack of enough trained personnel, socio-political and economic constraints. These constraints need to be resolved if advances in space technology applications for peaceful activities are to benefit the people. This paper deals with identifying these constraints, their causes, and possible resolution.},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems provide key services, but human activities and natural phenomena such as coastal erosion can strongly affect them. These changes can induce severe ecological and economic damages. This study aims to evaluate temporal changes in a protected area (Regional Park of Maremma, Southern Tuscany, Italy) in terms of both ecological and economical damage associated with ecosystem services loss observed over the period 2001-2014. Studies were performed using remote sensing as well as field verification for more critical habitat types. Results show an overall reduction of the habitat in flooded areas. During the study period total Ecosystem Services Values (ESV) decreased by more than 13\% and the major contributor to that changes is loss of wetlands (net reduction of about 4.3 M US\$/y), not directly beach erosion. Although this study proposes a first order approximation in terms of ESVs of considered biomes, these values are set to increase in the near future as knowledge and technologies improve. Therefore, wetlands management plans are crucial in this context, and could have much more significant effects on ecosystem efficiency and resources for future generations than beach erosion prevention.},

Title = {Ecosystem accounting: Past scientific developments and future challenges},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To better manage our environment, systematic information is needed on the state of ecosystems and their in-teractions with society. Efforts have been undertaken to design monitoring and recording systems, notably the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). However, the diverse conceptualizations and applications on ecosystem accounting found the scientific literature have never been assessed in a systematic way. Here, a systematic literature review on ecosystem accounting, i.e. natural capital accounting approaches that focus on ecosystems, is conducted to detail the evolving trends in concepts, methodologies, and applications, and to identify main gaps and challenges for future work. Results yielded 378 scientific articles published be-tween 1990 and 2021. This literature is diverse in terms of frameworks developed, ecosystems studied, valuation methods used, and accounts produced. Among the eleven ecosystem accounting frameworks identified, the SEEA is the most widely used. This literature is moving from focusing on conceptual elements towards addressing implementation issues. It is primarily conducted in European countries, on forest ecosystems, using biophysical methods and monetary valuation methods consistent with exchange values to produce accounts. The gaps that should be the focus of future work include the issue of implementation: methodologies (artificial Intelligence technologies and economic valuation), data, for instance making better use of remote sensing images, collabo-rations, and supporting the use of ecosystem accounts in decision-making.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to examine the potential impacts of the past and future land use/cover (LUC) changes on the ecosystem services of Baguio city, the Philippines, and discuss their implications for policy development and implementation. Remote sensing-derived WC maps for 1988, 1998 and 2009, along with GEOMOD, a Geographic Information Systems-based LUC change model, and ecosystem service value (ESV) coefficients were used to facilitate the analysis. The results revealed a decrease in the ESV of Baguio for the past 21 years (1988-2009), of which a substantial amount was due to loss of forest cover. Consequently, the human-to-ESV (H-ESV) ratio has decreased over the years. The scenario-based LUC change analysis revealed that if the urban LUC change pattern continues, the total ESV and the H-ESV ratio will also continue to decrease in 2020, especially if the forest cover is not fully protected and conserved. Geospatial tools and techniques facilitate exploratory analysis critical to the understanding of the potential impacts of future LUC changes under different scenarios. Our results highlighted that under the great pressure of urbanization, there is a need to strengthen the proper implementation of policies in order to maintain and improve ecosystem services. Although there are limitations to the estimated ESVs of Baguio to be taken into account in future studies, the magnitude of the estimated changes in the LUC is substantial. Thus, it may still be possible to draw general inferences about the effect of the perceived LUC changes on the estimated ESVs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Remote sensing of hedgerows, windbreaks, and winter cover crops in California's Central Coast reveals low adoption but hotspots of use},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Non-crop vegetation, such as hedgerows and cover crops, are important on-farm diversification practices that support biodiversity and ecosystem services; however, information about their rates and patterns of adoption are scarce. We used satellite and aerial imagery coupled with machine learning classification to map the use of hedgerows/windbreaks and winter cover crops in California's Central Coast, a globally important agricultural area of intensive fresh produce production. We expected that adoption of both practices would be relatively low and unevenly distributed across the landscape, with higher levels of adoption found in marginal farmland and in less intensively cultivated areas where the pressure to remove non-crop vegetation may be lower. Our remote sensing classification revealed that only similar to 6\% of farmland had winter cover crops in 2021 and 0.26\% of farmland had hedgerows or windbreaks in 2018. Thirty-seven percent of ranch parcels had cover crops on at least 5\% of the ranch while 22\% of ranches had at least one hedgerow/windbreak. Nearly 16\% of farmland had other annual winter crops, some of which could provide services similar to cover crops; however, 60\% of farmland had bare soil over the winter study period, with the remainder of farmland classified as perennial crops or strawberries. Hotspot analysis showed significant areas of adoption of both practices in the hillier regions of all counties. Finally, qualitative interviews revealed that adoption patterns were likely driven by interrelated effects of topography, land values, and farming models, with organic, diversified farms implementing these practices in less ideal, lower-value farmland. This study demonstrates how remote sensing coupled with qualitative research can be used to map and interpret patterns of important diversification practices, with implications for tracking policy interventions and targeting resources to assist farmers motivated to expand adoption.},

Title = {Leveraging the NEON Airborne Observation Platform for socio-environmental systems research},

Abstract = {During the 21st century, human-environment interactions will increasingly expose both systems to risks, but also yield opportunities for improvement as we gain insight into these complex, coupled systems. Human-environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi-resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land-use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high-density, and high-resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio-Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross-site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio-environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data.},

Abstract = {In order to achieve sustainable cities, it is important to include within urban planning processes, the benefits provided by biophysical elements such as vegetation. Therefore, this research aims to conduct a characterization of what is here defined as Urban Fresh Islands-IFU-in the city of Santiago de Cali based on the presence of vegetation and its relationship with temperature. In addition to this, it was taken into account the perception and assessment made by the community about these spaces and their spatial distribution in the territory. Remote sensing techniques were an important tool for the development of the research. To identify the IFU areas, indicators such as NDVI and NDWI were collected and used in conjunction with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and built up area (NDBI) and 2011 Additional information was gathered by means of direct observation, surveys and qualitative research techniques in order to assess the perception and valuation of vegetation-temperature relationship in certain areas of the city.},

Title = {Economic and ecological trade-offs of coastal reclamation in the Hangzhou Bay, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to the growing demand for land resources, coastal reclamation has become a global land use practice. Although the reclamation of coastal wetlands brings substantial economic benefits, it can lead to a series of adverse ecological impacts. Considerably, economic and ecological trade-offs of reclamation activities must be analyzed to make targeted land use policy decisions. This study focuses on land reclamation on the east coast of China, taking Hangzhou Bay as a case study. Remote sensing techniques were used to detect the coastline and landscape changes in the reclaimed areas from 1985 to 2015. Subsequently, field surveys and empirical parameters were employed to evaluate the impact on coastal ecosystem services. Finally, the monetary analysis was used to evaluate the trade-offs between ecological loss and economic gain due to land reclamation. The results showed that a total of 75134.3 ha of coastal wetlands (accounting for 8.58\% of the total land area) were reclaimed from 1985 to 2015 in the Hangzhou Bay. A substantial decline in ecosystem service value (ESV) was observed with a drop from 866,400 Yuan ha(-1) in 1985 to 285,800 Yuan ha(-1) in 2015 due to the conversion of natural to artificial landscape. The total ESV loss exceeded the economic benefits throughout the study period, thus the economic benefits failed to compensate for the ESV loss. This trade-off relationship resulted from reclamation expansion on short-term economic benefits at the expense of long-term ecological value. According to these findings, we propose three main ways to achieve a ``win-win{''} situation between gains and loss of reclamation for sustainability.},

Title = {Evaluation of Remote Sensing Ecological Index Based on Soil and Water Conservation on the Effectiveness of Management of Abandoned Mine Landscaping Transformation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Abandoned mines are typical areas of soil erosion. Landscape transformation of abandoned mines is an important means to balance the dual objectives of regional ecological restoration and industrial heritage protection, but the secondary development and construction process of mining relics require long-term monitoring with objective scientific indicators and effective assessment of their management effectiveness. This paper takes Tongluo Mountain Mining Park in Chongqing as an example and uses a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on Landsat-8 image data to assess the spatial and temporal differences in the dynamic changes in the ecological and environmental quality of tertiary relic reserves with different degrees of development and protection in the park. Results showed that: (1) The effect of vegetation cover, which can significantly improve soil and water conservation capacity. (2) The RSEI is applicable to the evaluation of the effectiveness of ecological management of mines with a large amount of bare soil areas. (3) The mean value of the RSEI in the region as a whole increased by 0.090, and the mean values of the RSEI in the primary, secondary and tertiary relic reserves increased by 0.121, 0.112 and 0.006, respectively. (4) The increase in the RSEI in the study area is mainly related to the significant decrease in the dryness index (NDBSI) and the increase in the humidity index (WET). The remote sensing ecological index can objectively reflect the difference in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the ecological environment in tertiary relic protection, and this study provides a theoretical reference for the ecological assessment of secondary development-based management under difficult site conditions.},

Title = {Vulnerability assessment and management planning for the ecological environment in urban wetlands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {298},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {As a special ecosystem in cities, urban wetland parks have important environmental regulation and social service functions. This paper proposes a new methodology of urban wetland planning and management based on the vulnerability of the ecological environment. The Jixi National Wetland Park (JNWP) was taken as the research area to analyze the ecological, geological and environmental factors that affect urban wetlands. A remote sensing image, digital elevation model, and environmental quality interpolation processing were used to generate the factor layer, and a comprehensive evaluation index system was established. The fuzzy Delphi analytic hierarchy process (FDAHP) method was used to calculate the comprehensive weight of each evaluation factor. A model to evaluate the ecological environment vulnerability of the JNWP was established. Then, an improved k-means clustering algorithm was used to classify the ecological environment of the study area. The ecological environment vulnerability of the wetland was evaluated. The results showed that the vulnerability of the ecological environment in the study area could be divided into five levels, including very low, low, medium, high and very high vulnerability areas. According to the vulnerability level and the results of k-means++ cluster analysis, the JNWP is divided into five areas. The wetland buffer zone is the main factor that determines the distribution of ecological environment vulnerability in urban wetlands. However, cultivated land development and ecological environmental restoration are the main factors that determine the evolution of ecological environment vulnerability in urban wetlands. The FDAHP and geographic information systems (GIS), combined with cluster analysis, are effective methods to evaluate the vulnerability of the ecological environment of urban wetlands, which provides a scientific and accurate methodology for the management and sustainable development of urban wetlands.},

Title = {The role of protected area wetlands in waterfowl habitat conservation: Implications for protected area network design},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {176},
Pages = {144-152},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The principal goal of protected area networks is biodiversity preservation, but efficacy of such networks is directly linked to animal movement within and outside area boundaries. We examined wetland selection patterns of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during non-breeding periods from 2010 to 2012 to evaluate the utility of protected areas to migratory waterfowl in North America. We tracked 33 adult females using global positioning system (GPS) satellite transmitters and implemented a use-availability resource selection design to examine mallard use of wetlands under varying degrees of protection. Specifically, we examined effects of proximities to National Wildlife Refuges, private land, state wildlife management areas, Wetland Reserve Program easements (WRP), and waterfowl sanctuaries on mallard wetland selection. In addition, we included landscape-level variables that measured areas of sanctuary and WRP within the surrounding landscape of each used and available wetland. We developed 8 wetland selection models according to season (autumn migration, winter, spring migration), hunting season (present, absent), and time period (diurnal, nocturnal). Model averaged parameter estimates indicated wetland selection patterns varied across seasons and time periods, but ducks consistently selected wetlands with greater areas of sanctuary and WRP in the surrounding landscape. Consequently, WRP has the potential to supplement protected area networks in the midcontinent region. Additionally, seasonal variation in wetland selection patterns indicated considering the effects of habitat management and anthropogenic disturbances on migratory waterfowl during the non-breeding period is essential in designing protected area networks.

Title = {Synthesizing water quality indicators from standardized geospatial information to remedy water security challenges: A review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {119},
Pages = {220-231},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Water is vital not only for food, energy and sanitation but also for ecosystem functioning, human health, socioeconomic progress and poverty reduction. Water security exists when all people have physical and economical access to sufficient, safe, and clean water that meets basic needs. However, water security is threatened by growing human population, episodic environmental disasters, indiscriminate land management practices, contaminants, and escalation in geopolitical conflicts. < 3\% of the estimated 1.4 billion cubic kilometers of water on earth is available for consumption. Although there exist a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring the chemical, physical and biological properties of water, the information available to the public remains inconsistent and patchy. To this end, we advance a new theory of a single-value objective water quality index (WQI) that considers the interaction between the above properties, to provide concise information for source water quality surveillance and monitoring. Although geospatial technologies such as remote sensing is credited as a high frequency spatiotemporal mapping tool, exiguous information is available on its application for constructing single-value WQIs. Besides, no remote sensing device exists that directly measures water quality, which must indirectly be inferred through modeling sensed remote sensing signals with measured water properties. This review not only highlights the water security conundrum but also provides an overview of methods for integrating geolocated qualitative (e.g., management data) with quantitative (i.e., measured water constituent properties) into a WQI.},

Title = {Building Change Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery with Focal Self-Attention and Multi-Level Feature Fusion},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Accurate and intelligent building change detection greatly contributes to effective urban development, optimized resource management, and informed decision-making in domains such as urban planning, land management, and environmental monitoring. Existing methodologies face challenges in effectively integrating local and global features for accurate building change detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that uses focal self-attention to process the feature vector of input images, which uses a ``focusing{''} mechanism to guide the calculation of the self-attention mechanism. By focusing more on critical areas when processing image features in different regions, focal self-attention can better handle both local and global information, and is more flexible and adaptive than other methods, improving detection accuracy. In addition, our multi-level feature fusion module groups the features and then constructs a hierarchical residual structure to fuse the grouped features. On the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets, our proposed method achieved F1-scores of 91.62\% and 89.45\%, respectively. Compared with existing methods, ours performed better on building change detection tasks. Our method therefore provides a framework for solving problems related to building change detection, with some reference value and guiding significance.},

Abstract = {Current and planned wildfire detection systems are impressive but lack both sensitivity and rapid response times. A small telescope with modern detectors and significant computing capacity in geosynchronous orbit can detect small (12 m(2)) fires on the surface of the earth, cover most of the western United States (under conditions of moderately clear skies) every few minutes or so, and attain very good signal-to-noise ratio against Poisson fluctuations in a second. Hence, these favorable statistical significances have initiated a study of how such a satellite could operate and reject the large number of expected systematic false alarms from a number of sources. Here we present both studies of the backgrounds in Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 15 data and studies that probe the sensitivity of a fire detection satellite in geosynchronous orbit. We suggest a number of algorithms that can help reduce false alarms, and show efficacy on a few. Early detection and response would be of true value in the United States and other nations, as wildland fires continue to severely stress resource managers, policy makers, and the public, particularly in the western US. Here, we propose the framework for a geosynchronous satellite with modern imaging detectors, software, and algorithms able to detect heat from early and small fires, and yield minute-scale detection times.},

Title = {Urban land use change simulation and spatial responses of ecosystem service value under multiple scenarios: A case study of Wuhan, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simulation of changes in ecosystem service value (ESV) caused by land use change in Wuhan under multiple scenarios is of great significance for ensuring urban ecological security and enhancing regional ecosystem service values. The city of Wuhan was selected as the study area, and the changes in land use and ESV in Wuhan over the past 31 years were analyzed and calculated based on five-phase remote sensing images and statistical yearbooks for 1990, 1998, 2006, 2014 and 2021. On this basis, the CA-Markov model and the multi objective planning (MOP) model were used to simulate the land use change in the study area in 2040 under four scenarios (natural development scenario, cultivated land protection scenario, ecological protection scenario and urban develop-ment scenario), and the total ESV was estimated under each scenario. The total value of ecosystem services was estimated under each scenario, and grid tools were applied to visualize the spatial distribution and degree of aggregation of ecosystem services. The results show that: (1) The most obvious feature of land use change in Wuhan from 1990 to 2021 is the sharp reduction in arable land area and the rapid expansion of build-up land area. Over the past 31 years, the arable land area decreased by 78322.4 hm2, and the build-up land area increased by 52559.28 hm2. (2) From 1990 to 2021, Wuhan's total ESV at the five timepoints (1990, 1998, 2006, 2014, 2021) was 74.554 billion yuan, 71.512 billion yuan, 69.632 billion yuan, 73.433 billion yuan and 68.548 billion yuan, respectively. Overall, there has been a downward trend in volatility. (3) Under the four scenarios, the ESV in 2040 is projected to be 72.777 billion yuan, 70.969 billion yuan, 74.097 billion yuan or 70.620 billion yuan, respectively. Among them, the ecological protection scenario is the optimal simulation choice. (4) The cold and hot spots of ESV show an aggregated distribution over a large area, with the hot spots mainly concentrated in the central and southeastern parts of Wuhan and the cold spots mainly located in the northeastern and north-western portions of Wuhan. Simulating the future land use change trends in Wuhan and exploring the responses of ecosystem service values under various scenarios are conducive to the construction of a new pattern of urban land space development and protection and can provide a scientific basis and a reference for decision-making for comprehensively promoting the sustainable development of Wuhan and other metropolitan areas in China in the future.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {41-55},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ongoing environmental disturbances (e.g., climate variation and anthropogenic activities) alter an ecosystem gradually over time. Sudden large disturbances (e.g., typhoons and earthquakes) can have a significant and immediate impact on landscapes and ecosystem services. This study explored how precipitation variation (PV) and land use/land cover (LULC) changes caused by multiple disturbances can cumulatively impact ecosystem functioning in the Chenyulan watershed in central Taiwan. We simulated four ecosystem services (water yield production, water purification, soil conservation, carbon storage) and biodiversity using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to analyze the spatiotemporal changes and obtain information regarding changes in the ecosystem. Our results indicate that the Chi-Chi earthquake had the greatest impact on the ecosystem. Specifically, the ecosystem was altered by the earthquake and could no longer absorb disturbances of a similar magnitude as before the earthquake. By differentiating the impacts of the PV and LULC changes on ecosystem services and biodiversity, we observe that the PV had a stronger impact on water yield and soil conservation, whereas the LULC change had a stronger impact on water purification. Our results also suggest that a comprehensive ecosystem management plan should consider the cumulative and hierarchical context of disturbance regimes to prevent reductions in ecological variability and ecosystem resilience, particularly in areas that are more sensitive to large disturbances. In this way, ecosystem resilience may be maintained at a level sufficient to preserve ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services in the event of unexpected large-scale environmental disturbances.

Title = {Valuation of ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands in northwest Mexico},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, supporting diverse natural functions and providing important services to human societies. In this context, strategies have recently been developed to maintain these coastal wetlands in a sustainable way, however, wetlands are under pressure, particularly due to land use changes, because they have traditionally been treated as areas of low economic value or even as risky areas for human health. As a result, wetlands have suffered some loss and substantial habitat alteration, which are associated with high social costs. Thus, inventories are required to identify these environments and define and value their services to obtain appropriate information relevant to conservation strategies. This research introduces a spatial component for classifying wetland types and further evaluation of their ecosystem services (ES), assessing their current distribution and extent using standardized remote sensing techniques for wetland mapping. A value transfer approach was performed to generate baseline estimates of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands, validating it through a meta-analysis of a database of wetland estimates, with northwest Mexico wetlands as case study. We found that saltmarshes were the most important wetland in terms of covered area and also that socio-economic variables, such as income, are important in explaining wetland values. The results show that in 2003, a value of 1 billion USD per year was delivered to the local citizens by the surrounding wetlands provided as services and benefits. In a spatially explicit manner, this approach highlights the contribution made by wetlands to the well-being of communities. We argue that in the future design of management plans, the conservation of these environments should be a priority, regarding both, ecologically and economically views. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Value-added imagery is a useful means of communicating multispectral environmental satellite radiometer data to the human analyst. The most effective techniques strike a balance between science and art. The science side requires engineering physical algorithms capable of distilling the complex scene into a reduced set of key parameters. The artistic side involves design and construction of visually intuitive displays that maximize information content within the product image. The utility of such imagery to human analysts depends on the extent to which parameters or features of interest are conveyed unambiguously. Here, we detail and demonstrate a dynamic blended imagery technique, based on spatially variant transparency factors whose values are tied to algorithmically isolated parameters. The technique enables seamless display of multivariate information, and is applicable to any imaging system based on red-green-blue composites. We illustrate this technique in the context of GeoColor-an application of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R (GOES-R) series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) supporting operational forecasting and used widely in public communication of weather information.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture content is a key parameter in water resources management. It is important to obtain reliable soil moisture content data that being consistent in space and time for water resources management. Land surface process model and data assimilation are effective means to obtain reliable spatial and temporal continuous soil moisture content. However, the lack of real observations and dynamically updated surface parameters often greatly affect the accuracy of stimulated results of the land surface model. Based on high-resolution remote sensing data, we continuously invert vegetation coverage which is the crucial parameter of land surface process model during the study period, dynamically update it, and consider the remote sensing inversion of soil moisture content as the observation input, combined with the data assimilation algorithm to carry out model simulation and data assimilation research. We choose China's Hetao Irrigation District as the research area, use Noah LSM model and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm to build the data assimilation system, and set the land use parcels of the irrigation district as the research unit. Based on the Chinese Gaofen-1 and environmental disaster reduction satellites' remote sensing data, we retrieve the vegetation coverage fraction every ten days, and generate monthly vegetation coverage fraction data to update the Noah LSM model parameter. Meanwhile, we use the TVDI algorithm to invert the soil moisture content as the observation data in assimilation system and the simulation of the Noah LSM model. Model simulation and data assimilation experiments show that the remote sensing retrieval vegetation coverage fraction can improve the effectiveness of model simulation, which approaches to the true value, and also improves the data assimilation accuracy. The overall performance is better than that using the fixed state parameter.},

Title = {Balancing Tourism's Economic Benefit and CO2 Emissions: An Insight from Input-Output and Tourism Satellite Account Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {To balance tourism's economic benefit and environmental pollution, this paper proposes an analytical approach by using the input-output (IO) model and tourism satellite accounts (TSA). Four steps are taken: (1) the setting of system boundaries according to the combined IO and TSA database; (2) economic benefit estimation for tourism income, sectoral multipliers and inter-sector linkages; (3) environmental pollution estimation of direct and indirect CO2 emissions; and (4) a policy analysis to balance the economic benefit and CO2 emissions (in terms of reducing the CO2 emissions intensity) in tourism-related sectors. In the case of Beijing, some interesting insights can be obtained. Beijing's tourism sectors experienced a fast economic growth and a clear decrease in CO2 emissions during 2007-2012, with the former having a greater absolute change rate (particularly for the shopping and sightseeing sectors). In all tourism sectors (except for transportation), the indirect CO2 emissions were over three times greater than the direct CO2 emissions. Transportation was a leading contributor to both the economic benefit (representing 91.65\% of tourism income in 2012) and to environmental pollution (representing 38.75\% of tourism-related CO2 emissions). The detailed findings regarding the industrial and energy structures offer insightful policies for a high-benefit and low-emissions development of tourism.},

Title = {Toward a definition of Essential Mountain Climate Variables},
Journal = {ONE EARTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Pages = {805-827},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {The numerous processes implicated in the rapid and profound climate-driven changes that are underway across the world's mountains must be well monitored, understood, and-as far as possible-accurately projected. However, not only are the available environmental data upon which such activities hinge often severely limited, but interdisciplinary consensus regarding which variables should be considered observation priorities also remains elusive. Here, the concept of Essential Mountain Climate Variables (EMCVs) is introduced as a potential means of ameliorating the situation. After a review of climate-driven environmental change in mountains, a preliminary set of corresponding EMCVs is proposed. Variables pertaining to several disciplines naturally feature prominently. In addition, several are not currently considered to hold broader global relevance, which justifies our mountain-specific approach. Established and emerging possibilities to measure, generate, and apply EMCVs are then summarized. Finally, future activities toward the concept's formalization are recommended. Ultimately, the approach hopes to increase the utility of mountainous environmental data to both fundamental science and decision making related to environmental management, risk mitigation, and adaptation.},

Title = {Coral reef habitat mapping: A combination of object-based image analysis and ecological modelling},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {208},
Pages = {27-41},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite being one of the most important and well-studied coral reefs in the world, the full extent of coral habitat of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is not well mapped and there is no current and comprehensive map of the GBR's geomorphic zonation or benthic composition. This paper demonstrates an approach that integrates ecological coral habitat mapping with empirical modelling to map the geomorphic zonation and benthic composition of the ``shallow offshore reefs{''} of the GBR, using the Capricorn Bunker Group (CBG) as a case study. The approach combined environmental data sets and geo-ecological rule sets to identify geomorphic zones. The benthic composition of individual geomorphic zones was mapped for: shallow reef flat zones, using object-based image analysis with context driven rules based on coral reef ecology; and reef slope zones, using levels of wave exposure to predict the distribution of coral types. The environmental data sets used were field-based benthic composition data, Landsat 8 OLI satellite image-derived bottom reflectance, water depth and slope (15m x 15m pixel size) data, reef impact data, and modelled wave exposure. The study showed that the combination of geomorphic-ecological rules and models with remote sensing imagery provided robust mapping results over a large (similar to 2500 km(2)) reef system, of which 245 km(2) was mapped as shallow coral reefs and 88 km(2) of that was mapped as areas containing coral. Most importantly, the method produced defined the geomorphic zones and benthic composition of a study area that is significantly larger than the majority of coral reef remote sensing mapping projects previously published. With some modifications, the methods presented have the potential to be applied to the full extent of the shallow offshore reefs of the GBR, or any large reef globally. Monitoring and management of coral reefs for conservation and other purposes, at regional to global scales will benefit from the ability to produce and use this type of essential information on a regular basis.},

Abstract = {Timely crop information, i.e. well before harvesting time and at first stages of crop development, can benefit farmers and producer organizations. The current case study documents the procedure to deliver early data on planted tomato to users, showing the potential of Sentinel 2 (S2) to map tomato at the very beginning of the crop season, which is a challenging task. Using satellite data, integrated with ground and aerial data, an initial estimate of area planted with tomato and early tomato maps were generated in seven main production areas in Italy. Estimates of the amount of area planted with tomato provided similar results either when derived from field surveys or from remote-sensing-based classification. Tomato early maps showed a producer accuracy >80\% in seven cases out of nine, and a user accuracy >80\% in five cases out of nine, with differences attributed to the varying agricultural characteristics and environmental heterogeneity of the study areas. The additional use of aerial data improved producer accuracy moderately. The ability to identify abrupt growth changes, such as those caused by natural hazards, was also analysed: S2 detected significant changes in tomato growth between a hailstorm-affected area and a control area. The study suggests that S2, with enhanced spectral capabilities and open data policy, represents very valuable data, allowing crop monitoring at an early development stage.},

Abstract = {The threat of environmental degradation of the Martapura River as a result of an increase in built-up land has become a serious problem, so it is important to implement a new method using the integration of calculations of changes in built-up land and the sustainability of river area environmental management. This study aimed to calculate the change in built-up land directly integrated through Rap-RiverBuiltUp quantitative analysis on the environmental sustainability of the Martapura river area, Banjarmasin City. The research method used is the technique of spatial analysis of ETM/Landsat 8 OLI satellite landsat images and analysis of ecological, social and economic sustainability with Rap-RiverBuiltUP analysis. The results of the analysis of built-up land around the Martapura river, Banjarmasin City, have increased by 2.31\% over the last 12 years, followed by a growth in population density of f1.5\% annually. The implementation of sustainable environmental management needs to be prioritized with the efforts to periodically revise regional spatial planning regulations, especially the boundaries of built-up land to reduce the development of built-up land around the Martapura River. The sustainability status of the built-up area around the Martapura river is currently not sustainable. The ecological dimension indicates a less sustainable status, while the economic and social dimensions indicate a fairly sustainable status. Increasing the sustainability index value of the Martapura river from each dimension in the future is by making the lever factor an input for the management policy of the Martapura river, Banjarmasin City.},

Abstract = {Seawater parameters are important indicators of coastal water conditions. One of the essential parameters is the total suspended solids (TSS). This study probed how to use a low-cost 535-nm green LED to measure the TSS in marine protected areas of barangay Lo-ong, Concepcion, Iloilo, Philippines. It aims to examine the relationship of the total attenuation coefficients (TAC) to total suspended solids (TSS) values in coastal water. Sample sea waters were taken from various locations and brought to a laboratory for a filtration process known as gravimetry. Different available filter paper sizes (1.5 microns, 6 microns, 20 microns, and 50 microns) were used in the filtration process and were dried in a controlled constant temperature of 110 degrees Celsius for 24 hours using an electric oven. Dried filter papers' weights were measured using an analytical balance before using the infiltration of seawater. TAC values were also measured in different seawater samples using a prototype device made up of LED and photodiode. This study demonstrated that TAC values of green LEDs are positively correlated with TSS values (R value of 0.45). Results reveal that the moderate correlation between an LED's TAC values to TSS positively proved that a low-cost LED can be used as an alternative to the more expensive remote sensing satellite data. Findings of the study also showed that TSS values in the marine protected area under study were far below the acceptable limits for coastal waters. The performance of the LED-based measuring device can still be improved in the future by using collimating lenses and more sensitive photomultiplier tubes.},

Abstract = {When defining indicators on the environment, the use of existing initiatives should be a priority rather than redefining indicators each time. From an Information, Communication and Technology perspective, data interoperability and standardization are critical to improve data access and exchange as promoted by the Group on Earth Observations. GEOEssential is following an end-user driven approach by defining Essential Variables (EVs), as an intermediate value between environmental policy indicators and their appropriate data sources. From international to local scales, environmental policies and indicators are increasingly percolating down from the global to the local agendas. The scientific business processes for the generation of EVs and related indicators can be formalized in workflows specifying the necessary logical steps. To this aim, GEOEssential is developing a Virtual Laboratory the main objective of which is to instantiate conceptual workflows, which are stored in a dedicated knowledge base, generating executable workflows. To interpret and present the relevant outputs/results carried out by the different thematic workflows considered in GEOEssential (i.e. biodiversity, ecosystems, extractives, night light, and food-water-energy nexus), a Dashboard is built as a visual front-end. This is a valuable instrument to track progresses towards environmental policies.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Agriculture is required to produce more food while reduce water consumption at the same time. To improve the irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural production, this study proposed a fuzzy multiobjective optimal modeling approach based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global evapotranspiration products for optimizing spatial water footprint of crop planting. This study attempts to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information, and effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets, spatial water footprint, and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty. To test its feasibility, the proposed approach is employed to a typical semi-arid region in Northwest China. Three performance evaluation indicators, including synthetic degree (SD), sustainability index (SI), and approximation degree of ideal objective value (AD), are applied for measuring model performance and try to give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies. Results show that (1) the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation, and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial; (2) the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream with high precipitation, which can improve economic benefit, increase utilization rate of green water, and fairness of allocation; (3) through optimization, the average total, blue, and gray water footprint among IDs are drop while green water utilization rates is raised comparing with status quo (2014); (4) Water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy, society and environment, but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives. The proposed optimal modeling framework can help optimize the spatial water footprint of crop planting and improve irrigation water use efficiency, which can be applied to similar regions that suffer from water scarcity.},

Abstract = {Changing landscape patterns would alter ecosystem components and functions, affecting the supply of ecosystem services. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations of ecosystem services is an important basis for ecosystem management and planning decisions and is of great significance for the realization of regional sustainable development. Based on Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 in the Li River Basin, we explored the spatial and temporal variabilities of ecosystem services in the Li River Basin over the past 30 years, from both horizontal and vertical dimensions, using modified equivalence factor method and spatial autocorrelation analysis. The research findings are as follows: (1) Forestland has consistently been the dominant landscape type in the Li River Basin, with its area continuously increasing, while farmland, water bodies, and grassland have decreased, and construction land and bare land have increased. (2) The value of ecosystem services in the Li River Basin exhibited an initial increase followed by a decrease trend, with a net increase of 9.20 x 10(8) yuan. Forestland contributed the most to the value of ecosystem services. (3) Hydrological regulation and climate regulation are the dominant functions of the Li River Basin's ecosystems, accounting for over 50\% of the total contribution. (4) The value of ecosystem services per unit area increases with increasing slope and elevation. The segments with slopes ranging from 15 to 25 degrees and elevation zones between 200 and 500 m have the highest total value of ecosystem services. (5) The overall level of ecosystem services in the Li River Basin is relatively high and continues to rise, but areas with a low ecosystem service value are gradually concentrated. (6) The Moran's I values for ecosystem services in all four periods are greater than 0, indicating a significant positive spatial autocorrelation. The overall pattern of ecosystem services is relatively stable, but there are significant spatial variations, which are characterized by lower values in the central area and higher values in the surrounding areas. The research findings provide a scientific basis for watershed ecological environment construction, optimal allocation of land resources, and sustainable landscape management.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},

Abstract = {The topography and landforms of Guizhou Province in China are complicated, and the climatic conditions of heavy precipitation make landslide disasters in Guizhou Province occur frequently. To avoid damage to people's lives and economic property caused by disasters, a reliable early landslide identification method and landslide monitoring method are urgently needed. Traditional landslide identification and monitoring methods have limitations. InSAR technology has unique advantages in large-scale landslide identification and monitoring, but landslide identification results based on a single deformation value are one-sided. Therefore, this paper uses Sentinel-1A radar satellite image data and uses InSAR technology and optical remote sensing technology to carry out large-scale surface deformation monitoring and identification of dangerous deformation areas in Liupanshui City, Tongren City, Guiyang City and other regions in Guizhou Province. The potential landslide identification methods based on the time series normalized difference vegetation index and landslide development environment elements are combined to investigate hidden landslide hazards in the study area. In this paper, time series InSAR technology is used to monitor three key landslides in Jichang Town, Yujiaying and Fana, to grasp the movement status of the landslide in time. The method of landslide identification and monitoring in this paper is of great significance for disaster prevention and management in Guizhou Province.},

Abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) now form an important part of marine conservation and fisheries management; hence, there is broad interest in developing procedures that optimize their design. We used data collected over a 10-year period (2003-2012) from direct surveys and >100 adult male and female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) tracked with devices, including GPS loggers and Fastloc GPS-Argos, to consider the optimum design for a MPA at a globally important breeding area, where there is already an existing national marine park aiming to protect the population (Zakynthos, Greece). Turtles primarily used areas very close to shore (approx. 7 km in length by 1 km in width, within the <10 m iso-bath) for breeding and foraging activity at different times of the year. We calculated that this small near-shore coastal zone encompassed 72\% of all turtle GPS locations recorded in the MPA, and is therefore important for conservation management. We developed an index to evaluate the suitability of the existing and proposed conservation zones based on (1) home range area use by turtles in these zones versus (2) zone size, so that the benefit to turtles could be maximized while minimizing the negative impacts to other stakeholders (e.g., boat operators). With this evidence-based approach, we propose a modification to the existing MPA that might both enhance local economic tourism activities and better safeguard this key sea turtle breeding population. The approaches used here will have general application for the design of MPAs used by mobile species that can be tracked. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The application of Species Distribution Models (SDM) in the management of species habitat and environmental impact changes has been widely used by scientists and ecologists globally, however this study proposes a novel analytical technique involving the combination of a statistical ranking algorithm and Remote sensing GIS data (habitat and threat) to analyze the suitability hierarchy of the habitat of a signature water-bird (Larus relictus). The results indicate that about 47.63\% of the study region was suitable to accommodate L. Relictus during their breeding/resting season, while 27.08\% proved to be highly unsuitable for this species. Based on the spatial distribution of the statistical data already incorporated into the GIS environment, it was observed that regions surrounding the Bojiang Lake (especially polygons 38 and 42) dominated by low vegetation and increased amount of moisture proved to be the best region for this species. On the contrary, polygon 23, located in the southern part of the study region proved to be the worst region for this species being dominated by significantly high amount of threat factors having the highest mean normalized hierarchical value and ranking 60th out of 61 in terms of standard deviation. To distinctively capture different suitability level of the study region, we could say that the application of this technique is quite effective and beneficial. This is because, compared to other decision making tools, this technique which solely relies on remote sensing and vector data gives decision makers an option of weight application if so desired.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {301},
Pages = {1-7},
Abstract = {Despite the obvious power and advantages of the Argos system to track animals by satellite, the data generated are difficult for many biologists to exploit. A broad range of skills is required to efficiently download, collate, filter and interpret Argos data. Integration of animal movements with other physical (e.g. remote sensing imagery) and anthropogenic (e.g. fishery distributions) datasets presents additional technical and computing challenges. The Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool (STAT) is a freely available system designed for biologists who work on animal tracking; it includes a set of standardized tools and techniques for data management, analysis, and integration with environmental data. STAT logs in to the Argos computer network each day and downloads all available locations and associated data for each user. These data are parsed and stored in a relational database and automatically backed up to an offsite location. A number of data filtering options are available, including setting maximum speed, time or distance between consecutive points, Argos location class, and turning angle. A variety of environmental data layers, including bathymetry, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, ocean currents and chlorophyll, can be sampled for all locations in the STAT database and can be downloaded and incorporated into tracking maps and animations. STAT also facilitates collaboration and the sharing of animal tracking information with the wider public and funding organizations. We hope that STAT will act as a catalytic foundation, fostering collaboration among users of satellite telemetry, and ensuring maximum value from these studies.},

Abstract = {Over the course of the last decade, large populations living in vulnerable areas have led to record damages and substantial loss of life in mega-disasters ranging from the deadly Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and Haiti earthquake of 2010; the catastrophic flood damages of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Tohoku tsunami of 2011, and the astonishing extent of the environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2009. These major catastrophes have widespread and long-lasting impacts with subsequent recovery and reconstruction costing billions of euros and lasting years. While satellite imagery is used on an ad hoc basis after many disasters to support damage assessment, there is currently no standard practice or system to coordinate acquisition of data and facilitate access for early recovery planning and recovery tracking and monitoring. CEOS led the creation of a Recovery Observatory Oversight Team, which brings together major recovery stakeholders such as the UNDP and the World Bank/Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, value-adding providers and leading space agencies. The principal aims of the Observatory are to: 1. Demonstrate the utility of a wide range of earth observation data to facilitate the recovery and reconstruction phase following a major catastrophic event; 2. Provide a concrete case to focus efforts in identifying and resolving technical and organizational obstacles to facilitating the visibility and access to a relevant set of EO data; and 3. Develop dialogue and establish institutional relationships with the Recovery phase user community to best target data and information requirements; The paper presented here will describe the work conducted in preparing for the triggering of a Recovery Observatory including support to rapid assessments and Post Disaster Needs Assessments by the EO community.},

Abstract = {Assessing and modeling the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) patterns and associated ecosystem service values (ESV) has become an important global agenda for formulating sustainable land management policies. Taking the coastal region of Bangladesh (CRB) as a case study, we utilized remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze Landsat data of 1999 and 2019 to estimate the effect of LULC changes on the ESVs. The LULC classification, ESV quantification, and spatial variations were performed by semi-automated classification, per-unit value transfer, and spatial autocorrelation techniques, respectively. First, between 1999 and 2019, LULC altered dramatically (agricultural land and coastal wetlands decreased, while all other LULC types increased). Second, the total ESV decreased by 1.87\%, which was mostly attributed to a 70\% growth in both rural settlement and aquaculture/saltpan, and a 30\% decline in both agricultural land and wetlands. Third, significant spatial correlation and moderately high spatial clustering were observed, which consisted mostly of mangrove forests, waterbodies, and wetland zones. Both high-high and low-low values increased, but spatial outliers remained unchanged. Conserving agricultural land should be prioritized in future land use plans of CRB to meet the ever-increasing food demands, control natural land conversion, and make land use sustainable.},

Abstract = {Quantifying the capacity of protected area networks to shield multiple marine megafauna with diverse life histories is complicated, as many species are wide-ranging, requiring varied monitoring approaches. Yet, such information is needed to identify and assess the potential use of umbrella species and to plan how best to enhance conservation strategies. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of part of the European Natura 2000 protected area network (western Greece) for marine megafauna and whether loggerhead sea turtles are viable umbrella species in this coastal region. We systematically surveyed inside and outside coastal marine protected areas (MPAs) at a regional scale using aerial drones (18,505 animal records) and combined them with distribution data from published datasets (tracking, sightings, strandings) of sea turtles, elasmobranchs, cetaceans and pinnipeds. MPAs covered 56\% of the surveyed coastline (similar to 1500 km). There was just a 22\% overlap in the distributions of the four groups from aerial drone and other datasets, demonstrating the value of combining different approaches to improve records of coastal area use for effective management. All four taxonomic groups were more likely to be detected inside coastal MPAs than outside, confirming sufficient habitat diversity despite varied life history traits. Coastal habitats frequented by loggerhead turtles during breeding/non-breeding periods combined overlapped with 76\% of areas used by the other three groups, supporting their potential use as an umbrella species. In conclusion, this study showed that aerial drones can be readily combined with other monitoring approaches in coastal areas to enhance the management of marine megafauna in protected area networks and to identify the efficacy of umbrella species.},

However, there are already some obvious examples such as earth observation for environmental protection or disaster relief. This article will go further. It will look at issues of the protection of the earth orbit from the more and more serious issue of space debris and it will look at the European Space Agency's policy towards sustainable development. Evident issues of environmental pollution resulting from space technologies, such as launchers, will be discussed asking the question of whether space technologies can continue to benefit from exceptional treatment which was conceived for a small sector mainly for scientific purposes. Today, there is a sizable space industry in Europe and the commercialisation of its services poses this question of whether the space industry is becoming a `normal' part of European industry and therefore should adhere to normal standards of environmental protection. The article will also consider implications for the progress of the European integration process through the lens of European space policy.},

Abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for the radio frequency spectrum is transforming current radio regulations at national and international levels. Data collected with earth exploration satellites can easily become unusable due to RF interference whether it is from out-of-band or spurious emissions towards the bands used by the sensors. In 2006, the FCC auctioned 90MHz of the spectrum for 3G cellular communications with a gain for the US Treasury of \$13.7B. Only a decade later, in January 2016, merely 65MHz were auctioned for close to \$45B. The gain obtained from better weather prediction, and Earth remote-sensing studies is harder to quantify, nevertheless provides great benefit to society. This tutorial has as its primary goal to offer an introduction to the science and policies behind the field of RF Spectrum Management. Some of the economic aspects of spectrum management will also be discussed.},

Title = {Possibility of using multiscale normalized difference vegetation index data for the assessment of total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in surface water: A specific case of scale issues in remote sensing},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The degradation of watersheds creates immense pressure on water quality, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Total suspended solids (TSS) provide essential information to water environmental quality assessments. However, the calibration of direct retrieval models requires complicated preparations and further increases uncertainties. Here, we hypothesized that a common remote sensing index (NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index) could be used to estimate TSS concentrations in water due to the effects of canopy cover. To address this hypothesis, we collected 65 water samples from the Ebinur Lake Watershed, northwest China, to investigate the potential relationships between TSS concentrations and Sentinel-2-based NDVI at various scales (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 m). Subsequently, we established a classical measurement error (CME) model for the estimation of TSS concentrations. The results showed that TSS concentration is negatively related to the NDVI value at all buffer distances. The 300 m scale mean NDVI value showed the most effective explanation of the variations in TSS concentrations (R-2 = 0.83, P-value < 0.001), which indicated that the TSS concentration can be assessed by NDVI. The CME model showed that NDVI values played an important role in the assessment of TSS concentrations in surface water. Furthermore, the results of both leave-one-out cross-validation and the accuracy measure suggested that this specific method is satisfactory. Compared with previous statistical and field monitoring results, the proposed method is promising for cost-effective monitoring of TSS concentrations in water, especially in data-poor watersheds. This specific method may provide the basis for the conservation and management of nonpoint source pollution in arid regions.},

Abstract = {According to the construction and development plan of Beidou satellite navigation system, Beidou III satellite navigation system is planned to be completed around 2020 and to provide services to the world. To improve reliability, availability and service accuracy of the system, and enable the system to provide users with high precision navigation, positioning and timing services in ``Urban Canyon{''} and other special circumstances, it can be considered to establish space based pseudolite augmentation system. Like the traditional satellite navigation system, the positioning accuracy of the pseudolite augmentation system is closely related to the geometric distribution of the pseudolites. Because of its strong global optimization capability, the differential evolution algorithm (DE) is used in this paper for completing the optimization of pseudolite layout strategy. The GDOP (Geometric Dilution of Precision) value of the pseudolite system is set to the value of the objective function. At the same time, aiming at the problem that if the basic differential evolution algorithm deals with the high-dimensional function, the convergence rate will be slowed down, the ``social cognition part{''} of the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is introduced into the basic differential evolution algorithm, and then, a modified differential evolution algorithm is proposed. This algorithm firstly adds stochastic mutation operation to the basic differential evolution algorithm, to increase the diversity of the population and improve the search ability of the algorithm. At the same time, the mutation factor is dynamically adjusted so that the algorithm avoids premature convergence and has strong local search capabilities in the later period. In addition, the optimal individuals in the current population are added in the crossover operation step, and the convergence rate of the algorithm is improved. Simulation results show that compared with the basic differential evolution algorithm, the modified differential evolution algorithm has better optimization performance and convergence rate, which is helpful to find an optimal space-based pseudolite augmentation system networking layout strategy and enhance the positioning accuracy of the pseudolite augmentation system.},

Considering the change relation between gross domestic product (GDP) and ecological capital (EC) based on remote sensing estimation, we construct a new quantitative estimate model for ecological compensation, using county as study unit, and determine standard value so as to evaluate ecological compensation from 2001 to 2004 in Zhejiang Province, China. Spatial differences of the ecological compensation were significant among all the counties or districts. This model fills up the gap in the field of quantitative evaluation of regional ecological compensation and provides a feasible way to reconcile the conflicts among benefits in the economic, social, and ecological sectors.},

Title = {Sustainable low-input urban park design based on some decision-making methods},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Shortage of resources, mostly water, and lack of attention to Life Cycle Costs (LCC) have challenged urban landscape development and require methodological development for more sustainable urban landscape designs. In this research, decision-making methods, including Value Engineering (VE), Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM), and Risk Management (RM) techniques, which are essential tools for optimal use of resources, were integrated to optimize the design of a city park, especially towards economic sustainability. This research was carried out on a case study design in Mashhad, Iran, where open space was designed as a park space based on two methods. A conventional base plan was developed based on the general and standard principles of park design. In contrast, in a proposed Low-Input plan, the sustainable output indicators of economic, social, and environmental were applied to design a park with minimum cost inputs in the design and maintenance stages. The results showed that by using the VE and MCDM methods to choose sustainability indicators, the consumption of re-sources and maintenance costs used for the LCC decreased, while initial park construction costs were higher. The proposed Low-Input plan was expected to reduce costs by 62.7\% compared to the conventional base plan. Therefore, VE can balance costs and improve design quality and be a valuable tool in the design and maintenance of urban parks.},

Abstract = {Estimating precipitation over large spatial areas remains a challenging problem for hydrologists. Satellite-based remote sensing rainfall products have the advantage of large-scale synchronous coverage, but the reliability of their inversion still needs to be improved. Correcting the bias of satellite-based precipitation estimates (SPEs) is a major challenge in applications such as environmental modeling, hydrology, and water resource management. In this paper, a new bias correction method-a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model method based on rain intensity classification-is proposed to improve the accuracy of a satellite precipitation product-the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final Run (FR) product-at the daily scale in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. By comparing the effects of the proposed method with those of other existing classical correction methods, namely, quantile mapping (QM), the support vector machine (SVM) approach and direct GPR, it is found that all four methods improve the accuracy of the FR product to varying degrees. GPR based on rain intensity classification has the best effect of FR product improvement, with the CORR increasing from 0.55 to 0.59, the RMSE ranging from 14.37 to 12.79 mm/day, and the BIAS ranging from - 0.14 to 0.03 during the validation period. GPR without rain intensity classification also yields good results, with the QM and SVM methods being the least effective.},

Abstract = {Over the last several decades, remote sensing has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. The objective of this review, which summarizes the methods and the results of existing remote sensing studies, is to synthesize principle findings and assess the state of the art. We take a taxonomic approach to group studies based on location, scale, inputs, and methods, in an effort to categorize different approaches within a logical framework. We seek to evaluate the ability of remote sensing to provide synoptic and timely coverage of irrigated lands in several spectral regions. We also investigate the value of archived data that enable comparison of images through time. This overview of the studies to date indicates that remote sensing-based monitoring of irrigation is at an intermediate stage of development at local scales. For instance, there is overwhelming consensus on the efficacy of vegetation indices in identifying irrigated fields. Also, single date imagery, acquired at peak growing season, may suffice to identify irrigated lands, although to multi-date image data are necessary for improved classification and to distinguish different crop types. At local scales, the mapping of irrigated lands with remote sensing is also strongly affected by the timing of image acquisition and the number of images used. At the regional and global scales, on the other hand, remote sensing has not been fully operational, as methods that work in one place and time are not necessarily transferable to other locations and periods. Thus, at larger scales, more work is required to indentify the best spectral indices, best time periods, and best classification methods under different climatological and cultural environments. Existing studies at regional scales also establish the fact that both remote sensing and national statistical approaches require further refinement with a substantial investment of time and resources for ground-truthing. An additional challenge in mapping irrigation across large areas occurs in fragmented landscapes with small irrigated and cultivated fields, where the spatial scale of observations is pitted against the need for high frequency temporal acquisitions. Finally, this review identifies passive and active microwave observations, advanced image classification methods, and data fusion including optical and radar sensors or with information from sources with multiple spatial and temporal characteristics as key areas where additional research is needed.},

Title = {Assessment of Urban Green Space Based on Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity: A Case Study on Tongzhou District in Beijing, China},

Abstract = {Green infrastructure is one of the key components that provides critical ecosystems services in urban areas, such as regulating services (temperature regulation, noise reduction, air purification), and cultural services (recreation, aesthetic benefits), but due to rapid urbanization, many environmental impacts associated with the decline of green space have emerged and are rarely been evaluated integrally and promptly. The Chinese government is building a new city as the sub-center of the capital in Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. A series of policies have been implemented to increase the size of green urban areas. To support this land-use decision-making process and achieve a sustainable development strategy, accurate assessments of green space are required. In the current study, using land-use data and environmental parameters, we assessed the urban green space in the case study area. The bio-energy and its fluxes, landscape connectivity, as well as related ecosystem services were estimated using a novel approach, the PANDORA model. These results show that (1) in the highly urbanized area, green space is decreasing in reaction to urbanization, and landscape fragmentation is ubiquitous; (2) the river ecology network is a critical part for ecosystem services and landscape connectivity; and (3) the alternative non-green patches to be changed to urban, urban patches which can improve landscape quality the most by being changed to green, and conservation priority patches for biodiversity purposes of urban green were explicitly identified. Conclusively, our results depict the spatial distribution, fluxes, and evolution of bio-energy, as well as the conservation prioritization of green space. Our methods can be applied by urban planners and ecologists, which can help decision-makers achieve a sustainable development strategy in these rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide.},

Title = {Monitoring the effects of open-pit mining on the eco-environment using a moving window-based remote sensing ecological index},

Abstract = {Environmental problems caused by mines have been increasing. As one of the most serious types of mining damage caused to the eco-environment, open pits have been the focus of monitoring and management. Previous studies have obtained effective results when evaluating the ecological quality of a mining area by using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). However, the calculation of RSEI does not consider that the ecological environmental impact is limited under natural conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved RSEI based on a moving window model, namely the moving window-based remote sensing ecological index (MW-RSEI). This improved index is more in agreement with the First Law of Geography than RSEI. This study uses Landsat ETM/OLI/TIRS images to extract MW-RSEI information of a case area in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, central China, in 2009 and 2018. The results revealed that the average value of MW-RSEI declined from 0.668 to 0.611 from 2009 to 2018, and the main drivers of the deterioration of the eco-environment were land use/cover (LUCC) changes, most of which were derived from urban expansion and mining. The serious impact of open pits on the eco-environment in mining areas is mainly due to their low vegetation cover; therefore, some effectively managed open pits can have a positive impact on the mining environment. The use of MW-RSEI provides valuable information on the eco-environment surrounding the open pit, which can be used for the rapid and effective monitoring of the eco-environment in mining areas.},

Title = {Assessing relative differences in smoke exposure from prescribed, managed, and full suppression wildland fire},
Journal = {AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A novel approach is presented to analyze smoke exposure and provide a metric to quantify health-related impacts. Our results support the current understanding that managing low-intensity fire for ecological benefit reduces exposure when compared to a high-intensity full suppression fire in the Sierra Nevada of California. More frequent use of fire provides an opportunity to mitigate smoke exposure for both individual events and future emission scenarios. The differences in relative exposure between high-intensity, low-intensity, and prescribed burn were significant (P value <0.01). Suppressing fire not only appears to shift the health burden of the emissions to a future date but also increases the intensity and number of people exposed in a single exposure. Increased use of ecologically beneficial fire may further be optimized to reduce human exposure through advantageous use of good dispersal conditions and incorporating a mitigation strategy that includes poor dispersal when smoke is largely over wilderness or other natural areas. Accepting naturally occurring fire typical of the environmental system benefits forest health and reduces public exposure to smoke.},

Title = {Applications of Vegetative Indices from Remote Sensing to Agriculture: Past and Future},
Journal = {INVENTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Remote sensing offers the capability of observing an object without being in contact with the object. Throughout the recent history of agriculture, researchers have observed that different wavelengths of light are reflected differently by plant leaves or canopies and that these differences could be used to determine plant biophysical characteristics, e.g., leaf chlorophyll, plant biomass, leaf area, phenological development, type of plant, photosynthetic activity, or amount of ground cover. These reflectance differences could also extend to the soil to determine topsoil properties. The objective of this review is to evaluate how past research can prepare us to utilize remote sensing more effectively in future applications. To estimate plant characteristics, combinations of wavebands may be placed into a vegetative index (VI), i.e., combinations of wavebands related to a specific biophysical characteristic. These VIs can express differences in plant response to their soil, meteorological, or management environment and could then be used to determine how the crop could be managed to enhance its productivity. In the past decade, there has been an expanded use of machine learning to determine how remote sensing can be used more effectively in decision-making. The application of artificial intelligence into the dynamics of agriculture will provide new opportunities for how we can utilize the information we have available more effectively. This can lead to linkages with robotic systems capable of being directed to specific areas of a field, an orchard, a pasture, or a vineyard to correct a problem. Our challenge will be to develop and evaluate these relationships so they will provide a benefit to our food security and environmental quality.},

Abstract = {Conservation in a dynamic setting requires understanding the factors leading to landscape change. This study integrated traditional remote sensing and geographic information systems analysis techniques with a narrative policy analysis to assess the 19752004 land cover changes and their determinants in Nam Dong district (central Vietnam). Total forest cover of Nam Dong remained stable, but there were major transitions within forest and non-forest categories. Recent policy initiatives, particularly forest land allocation, have resulted in short-term benefit maximization through land speculation and illegal logging, while increased awareness of the economic potential of forests and their products have motivated people to access forests more frequently, leading to a highly dynamic landscape and increased barriers to forest conservation. This study suggests that (1) state-sponsored logging needs to be reduced, (2) forest allocation should proceed more rapidly to give farmers better incentive to improve and protect allocated forests, and (3) small-scale industry should increase. Forest conservation policy must be amended. More research is needed to link household land-use choices with policies, and determine how those choices lead to changes in the landscape.},

Title = {An improved approach for modeling spatial distribution of water use profit-A case study in Tuhai Majia Basin, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {94-99},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Water use profit (WUP) has been recognized as an important indicator of water resources management. This paper presents a set of models for evaluating the spatial distribution of economic and ecological WUP. The outputs of the models are detailed with a higher resolution than those in traditional WUP evaluation. Evapotranspiration (ET), which can be retrieved from remote sensing images, is regarded as the water consumption at the basin scale. The gridded GDP and ecosystem service value (ESV) are derived as indices of economic and ecological profits respectively. This method is applied in the Tuhai Majia Basin, North China. Agriculture is both economically and ecologically fundamental in the study area. The economic WUP of the whole basin (4.87 Yuan/m(3)) is slightly higher than the value of primary industry (3.39 Yuan/m(3)) and lower than the value of the secondary industry and tertiary industry (9.84 Yuan/m(3)). The ecological WUP of the whole basin (87.29 Yuan/m(3)) is quite close to the value of farm land. Water and wet land conservation and the development of barren land are important for ecological WUP improvement. Moreover, the dataset of WUP generated based on our method in this paper can be used for multi-scale analysis and be helpful to basin water resource management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An example involves the mental health challenges of long-duration spaceflight (such as a Mars mission), including prolonged confinement, microgravity, and different sunlight exposure lengths. Persisting on Earth are global mental health challenges stemming from disease burdens, limited interview-based diagnostic systems, trial-and-error treatment approaches, and suboptimal access. There is potential for cross-pollinating solutions between these seemingly disparate challenges using a range of emerging technologies such as sensors,'omics', and big data. In this review, we highlight the bidirectional value of mental health technology transfer aimed to address issues both on Earth and in space. METHODS: We prepared a systematic review of studies pertaining to mental health technological innovation and space medicine. RESULTS: For Earth mental health technologies translatable to long-duration space missions, we cite several example technologies, including device-based psychotherapy and social support, conversational agents `aka chatbots', and nutritional and physical activity focused mental health. Space technologies translatable to Earth mental health include remote sensing devices, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, chronotherapies, and nutritional advances. DISCUSSION: There is a rich history of space technologies informing Earth technological trends, including general health care on Earth, and vice versa. To avoid the traditional happenstance approach that results in delays, missed opportunities, and increased cost, and to improve outcomes for both Earth and space utilization of these technologies, we propose increased dialogue and training opportunities to enhance innovation and outcomes.},

Abstract = {The rapid increase in urbanization has an important effect on cropping pattern and land use/land cover (LULC) through replacing areas of vegetation with commercial and residential coverage, thereby increasing the land surface temperature (LST). The LST information is significant to understand the environmental changes, urban climatology, anthropogenic activities, and ecological interactions, etc. Using remote sensing (RS) data, the present research provides a comprehensive study of LULC and LST changes in water scarce and climate prone Southern Punjab (Multan region), Pakistan, for 30 years (from 1990 to 2020). For this research, Landsat images were processed through supervised classification with maps of the Multan region. The LULC changes showed that sugarcane and rice (decreased by 2.9 and 1.6\%, respectively) had less volatility of variation in comparison with both wheat and cotton (decreased by 5.3 and 6.6\%, respectively). The analysis of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed that the vegetation decreased in the region both in minimum value (-0.05 {[}1990] to -0.15 {[}2020]) and maximum value (0.6 {[}1990] to 0.54 {[}2020]). The results showed that the built-up area was increased 3.5\% during 1990-2020, and these were some of the major changes which increased the LST (from 27.6 to 28.5 degrees C) in the study area. The significant regression in our study clearly shows that NDVI and LST are negatively correlated with each other. The results suggested that increasing temperature in growing period had a greatest effect on all types of vegetation. Crop-based classification aids water policy managers and analysts to make a better policy with enhanced information based on the extent of the natural resources. So, the study of dynamics in major crops and surface temperature through satellite RS can play an important role in the rural development and planning for food security in the study area.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the utilizability of Photovoltaic (PV) application by qualitative and quantitative examination of hurdles on the rooftops of university buildings. The rooftops of university buildings were investigated with the help of remote sensing technique. Site surveys were also conducted to validate data. Utilizable rooftop area, available for PV application was determined by identifying restrictions, their respective coefficients and utilization factors. PV{*}SOL software was utilized to simulate the rooftop PV application on university buildings and it was found that university buildings have the potential to generate 5389.2 MWh/year with an annual specific yield of 1336.6 kWh/kWp. Environmental analysis was also conducted whose results revealed that PV utilization can save 63,727.05 tons of CO2, 1.89 tons of CH4, 0.27 tons of N2O, 970.05 tons of SO2 and 590.12 tons of NO emissions in 25 years. Economic assessment was also carried out in which levelized cost of electricity, discounted payback period, benefit to cost ratio, net present value and internal rate of return were determined as 0.05 USD/kWh, 11.17 years, 1.4, USD 2,682,508.01 and 11.81\%, respectively. This research can benefit public and private sectors to capitalize their buildings' rooftops for reducing energy and environmental challenges. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Improving the optimization solution for a semi-analytical shallow water inversion model in the presence of spectrally correlated noise},

Abstract = {In coastal regions, shallow water semi-analytical inversion algorithms may be used to derive geophysical parameters such as inherent optical properties (IOPs), water column depth, and bottom albedo coefficients by inverting sensor-derived sub-surface remote sensing reflectance, r(rs). The uncertainties of these derived geophysical parameters due to instrumental and environmental noise can be estimated numerically via the addition of spectral noise to the sensor-derived r(rs) before inversion. Repeating this process multiple times allows the calculation of the standard error and average for each derived parameter. Apart from spectral non-uniqueness, the optimization algorithm employed in the inversion must converge onto a single minimum to obtain a true representation of the uncertainty for a given set of noise-perturbed r(rs). Failure to do so inflates the uncertainty and affects the average retrieved value (accuracy). We show that the standard approach of seeding the optimization with an arbitrary, fixed initial guess, can lead to the convergence to multiple minima, each having substantially different centroids in multi-parameter solution space. We present the Update-Repeat Levenberg-Marquardt (UR-LM) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) routines that dynamically search the solution space for an optimal initial guess, that when applied to the optimization allows convergence to the best local minimum. We apply the UR-LM and LHS methods on HICO-derived and simulated r(rs) and demonstrate the improved computational efficiency, precision, and accuracy afforded from these methods compared with the standard approach. Conceptually, these methods are applicable to remote sensing based, shallow water or oceanic semi-analytical inversion algorithms requiring nonlinear least squares optimization.},

Abstract = {A fine mineral identification model using the field Hyperspectral remote sensing was proposed to solve the problem of low mineral identification accuracy. Results show that the accuracy was improved by spectral noises removal, endmember optimization and mineral absorptions enhancement. A regional endmember library was established to improve the reliability by systematically considering of the mineral assemblage relationships. A fine mineral identification system (FMIS) was developed to help geologists to quickly identify minerals and it was applied in the Xiemisitai Mountain, Xinjiang province, China in 2014 to newly find copper mineralized points. The improved model and the FMIS system are therefore not only of great significance to improve efficiency and save cost in remote sensing mineral exploration, but also of great economic value of the local economy development in the future.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-222},
Abstract = {Publicly-funded cultural institutions such as theatre companies, symphony orchestras, museums, libraries and so on are increasingly engaging with new technologies as a means of improving their operational efficiency and extending the range of ways in which they pursue their cultural missions. For example, opera companies are broadcasting performances by satellite to cinemas, and art museums are using the Internet to show virtual exhibitions. These developments have implications for funding authorities who need to update their policy approaches to encompass a range of new technological phenomena. This paper provides a framework for assessing technological innovation in cultural institutions, and discusses the ramifications of such a framework for cultural policy. The paper is illustrated using the results of a recent research project that evaluated the UK National Theatre's NT Live experiment and the Tate Gallery's use of a web-based exhibition as strategies to expand their audience reach.},

Title = {The Archaeology and Remote Sensing of Santa Elena's Four Millennia of Occupation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this study, we present the results of a comprehensive, landscape-scale remote sensing project at Santa Elena on Parris Island, South Carolina. Substantial occupation at the site extends for over 4000 years and has resulted in a complex array of features dating to different time periods. In addition, there is a 40-year history of archaeological research at the site that includes a large-scale systematic shovel test survey, large block excavations, and scattered test units. Also, modern use of the site included significant alterations to the subsurface deposits. Our goals for this present work are threefold: (1) to explicitly present a logical approach to examine sites with long-term occupations; (2) to examine changes in land use at Santa Elena and its implications for human occupation of this persistent place; and (3) to use the remote sensing program and past archaeological research to make substantive suggestions regarding future research, conservation, and management of the site. Our research provides important insight into the distribution of cultural features at this National Historic Landmark. While the majority of archaeological research at the site has focused on the Spanish period, our work suggests a complex and vast array of archaeological features that can provide insight into over 4000 years of history in the region. At a gross level, we have identified possible Late Archaic structures, Woodland houses and features, Late Prehistoric and early Historic council houses, and a suite of features related to the Spanish occupation which builds on our previous research at the site. In addition to documenting possible cultural features at the site, our work illustrates the value of multiple remote sensing techniques used in conjunction with close-interval shovel test data.},

Title = {Assessment of coastal Strandveld integrity using WorldView-2 imagery in False Bay, South Africa},

Abstract = {The coastal zone as interface between land and sea faces much pressure from human activities. These pressures make it difficult for the coastal zones to fulfil their natural functions, so threatening the state of coastal environments and making them vulnerable to coastal disasters and degradation. This study aimed to test whether high resolution remote sensing imagery can be used to assess the integrity of coastal Strandveld vegetation at the high spatial resolution required as baseline information for local environmental management. The study focused on the Cape Flats Dune Strandveld vegetation in northern False Bay near Cape Town, South Africa. The approach modifies and adopts a method developed by Liick-Vogel et al. (2013) for a remote sensing derived habitat intactness assessment for the Sandveld region at South Africa's west coast. A regression analysis was performed on the eight spectral bands of two WorldView-2 images and five image derivatives to evaluate the most suitable bands for producing an ecosystem integrity index. Based on the results, only the RED and NIR bands were required to perform a decision tree classification for the integrity classification, which significantly simplifies the application and opens the way for transfer to sensors with similar spectral bands. The overall accuracy of the results was 80.5\% with a kappa value of 0.75. This means that this approach provides results accurate enough for coastal management and conservation applications at a local scale. A further finding is the importance of seasonality to delineate natural and alien vegetation accurately. (C) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) are currently in the design phase of a program called the Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Technology (HRST) program. HRST will demonstrate the utility of a hyperspectral earth-imaging system to support Naval needs for characterization of the littoral regions of the world. One key component of the HRST program is the development of the Naval EarthMap Observer (NEMO) satellite system to provide a large hyperspectral data base. NEMO will carry the Coastal Ocean imaging Spectrometer (COIS) which will provide images of littoral regions with 210 spectral channels over a bandpass of 0.4 to 2.5 mu m Since ocean environments have reflectances typically less than 5\%, this system requires a very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). COIS will sample over a 30 km swath width with a 60 m Ground Sample Distance (GSD) with the ability to go to a 30 m GSD by utilizing the systems attitude control system to ``nod{''} (i.e., use ground motion compensation to slow down the ground track of the field of view). Also included in the payload is a co-registered 5m Panchromatic Imager (PIC) to provide simultaneous high spatial resolution imagery. A sun-synchronous circular orbit of 605 km allows continuous repeat coverage of the whole earth. One unique aspect of NEMO is an on board processing system, a feature extraction and data compression software package developed by NRL called the Optical Real-Time Spectral identification System (ORASIS). ORASIS employs a parallel, adaptive hyperspectral method for real time scene characterization, data reduction, background suppression, and target recognition. The use of ORASIS is essential for management of the massive amounts of data expected from the NEMO HSI system, and for developing Naval products under HRST. The combined HSI and panchromatic images will provide critical phenomenology to aid in the operation of Naval systems in the littoral environment. The imagery can also satisfy a number of commercial and science community requirements for moderate spatial and high spectral resolution remote sensing data over land and water. Specific areas of interest for the. Navy include bathymetry, water clarity, bottom type, atmospheric visibility, bioluminescence potential, beach characterization, underwater hazards, total column atmospheric water vapor, and detection and mapping of subvisible cirrus. These data support requirements for Joint Strike and Joint Littoral warfare, particularly for environmental characterization of the littoral ocean. Demonstrations of timely downlinks of near real-time data to the warfighter are also being formulated. The NEMO satellite is planned to launch in mid-2000 followed by an operational period of 3 to 5 years.},

Title = {Anticipating social equity impacts in REDD plus policy design: An example from the Democratic Republic of Congo},

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {Equity is a sensitive topic discussed under the REDD + mechanism. This study focuses on the impact of prevailing social and ecological conditions on the potential equity outcome of REDD + intervention at the local level. Working at a REDD + pilot project site in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we present a quantitative framework to assess contextual equity at the village level. We conducted a full community census on household characteristics and livelihood practices to evaluate current social conditions. We used participatory mapping and remote sensing analysis of a time series of very high resolution imagery over a 10-year period within the village boundaries to examine the ecological context of land use. We identify important differences between 379 households in terms of social characteristics and livelihoods practices. Social differentiation strongly relates to customary land rights as well as gender, ethnicity and origin. Using this case study, we find REDD + activities that can be implemented under the prevailing ecological conditions could impact community members differently, by reducing access to land for a segment of the population that is already under stress, and therefore have implications on equity in both space and time. We identify important risks for sectors of the population that do not have the contextual features necessary for benefitting from REDD + implementation and may be impacted, directly and indirectly, by decisions linked to benefit-sharing. We argue that such quantitative assessment is valuable to inform REDD + policy design on the way livelihood practices and social characteristics are inter linked and how they affect forest cover change. This information can be used to anticipate potential equity issues that may arise with REDD + implementation. We suggest that contextually informed definitions of the benefits and costs are critical for achieving equity in benefit-sharing. A flexible adaptive management and equity conscious approach is recommended from the policy design to implementation, by anticipating and mitigating potential risks of REDD + interventions in order to promote equitable outcomes at the local level.},

Title = {Spatial multi-criteria analysis to capture socio-economic factors in mangrove conservation},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests are among the most productive ecosystems, located in tropical and subtropical coastal waters and river estuaries. Mangroves benefit both people and the environment by providing shelter for brackish-water organisms, such as fish and shrimp. They form a green-belt area that protects land from abrasion and tsunamis, along with goods and services for people, e.g., fruit, fish and charcoal. However, unmanaged use of mangrove ecosystems has resulted in a widespread decline in their function and conflicts between users. A paucity of research on mangrove management and spatial zoning is also contributing to the decline of these ecosystems. This study develops a prioritisation process with Spatial Multi-criteria Analysis (SMCA) for social-ecological mangrove management, based on a case study in Baros, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We include social (participation and perception), demographic, economic (economic value of mangroves) and ecological criteria (water quality, mangrove density and diversity, phytoplankton diversity and density) criteria and spatial considerations informed by remote sensing imagery. We consider the three different conservation scenarios of habitat protection areas, sanctuary areas, and restricted areas to help configure management plan options. We demonstrate how SMCA can support managers and policymakers in mapping conservation areas based on complex and diverse social-ecological data. However, further discussion with stakeholders in Baros is required to validate the produced map for future use. The involvement of stakeholders and governing bodies from the beginning or within the SMCA analysis will always be crucial in community-based prioritisations.},

Abstract = {Since the State Council promulgated the ``Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Action Plan{''} and other comprehensive atmospheric control policies in 2013, the concentration of atmospheric pollutants and other important pollutants in eastern China has been effectively controlled. Along with the changes in China's energy policy and increasing energy development in the northwest region, air pollution also shows an increasing trend, but it has not been paid attention to in previous studies. Compared with ground observation, the monitoring method of satellite remote sensing has the advantages of not being restricted by area, lasting long observation time and monitoring many types of pollutants simultaneously. The spaceborne ultraviolet-visible hyperspectrometer OMI has been in orbit since 2005 and has been widely used in scientific applications such as the detection of the temporal and spatial changes of atmospheric pollution, the estimation of emission sources, and the assimilation and verification of models. USTC's tropospheric NO2 column concentration product, through the secondary calibration of the OMI original measurement spectrum and the key optimization of the gas inversion algorithm, shows a good correlation in the comparison and verification with the results of ground-based observations. Analysis of air pollution in the background of sol. Combined with USTC's OMI NO2 data product, the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of atmospheric NO2 pollution in Xinjiang, China, can be characterized. From 2007 to 2017, NO2 pollution in Xinjiang was concentrated in northern Xinjiang. Among them, the ``Urumqi-Changi-Shihezi{''} urban agglomeration ({''}Wuchangshi{''} area) had a strong correlation with the monthly change of the overall NO2 level in Xinjiang ( correlation coefficient R = 0. 942, p-value< 0. 01). The inter-annual change of NO2 in Xinjiang has obvious phase characteristics, which is consistent with the changes in relevant policies and energy industry emissions: the changing trend is not obvious from 2007 to 2010, the overall average concentration in 2014 increased by 18. 5\% compared with 2010, and the ``Wuchangshi{''} area increased by 41. 3\%, in 2017, the overall average concentration of NO2 decreased by 26. 4\% compared with 2014, and ``Wuchangshi{''} decreased by 42. 8\%. Due to the dense distribution of petrochemical enterprises and economic development zones in the ``Wuchangshi{''} area, it has become a NO2 pollution gathering area, which has a strong correlation with Urumqi and Changi NO2 changes (R = O. 982, p-value<0. 01; R = 0. 951, p-value< 0. 01). Controlled by the heating period's emissions and the special meteorological conditions, the peak of NO2 change in the ``Wuchangshi{''} area in December, and the winter pollution is particularly significant.

Title = {A multi-scale method to assess pesticide contamination risks in agricultural watersheds},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {624-639},

Abstract = {The protection of water is now a major priority for environmental managers, especially around drinking pumping stations. In view of the new challenges facing water agencies, we developed a method designed to support their public policy decision-making, at a variety of different spatial scales. In this paper, we present this new spatial method, using remote sensing and a GIS, designed to determine the contamination risk due to agricultural inputs, such as pesticides. The originality of this method lies in the use of a very detailed spatial object, the RSO (Reference Spatial Object), which can be aggregated to many working and managing scales. This has been achieved thanks to the pixel size of the remote sensing, with a grid resolution of 30 m x 30 m in our application. The method - called PHYTOPIXAL- is based on a combination of indicators relating to the environmental vulnerability of the surface water environment (slope, soil type and distance to the stream) and the agricultural pressure (land use and practices of the farmers). The combination of these indicators for each pixel provides the contamination risk. The scoring of variables was implemented according knowledge in literature and of experts. This method is used to target specific agricultural input transfer risks. The risk values are first calculated for each pixel. After this initial calculation, the data are then aggregated for decision makers, according to the most suitable levels of organisation. These data are based on an average value for the watershed areas. In this paper we detail an application of the method to an area in the hills of Southwest France. We show the pesticide contamination risk by in areas with different sized watersheds, ranging from 2 km(2) to 7000 km(2), in which stream water is collected for consumption by humans and animals. The results were recently used by the regional water agency to determine the protection zoning for a large pumping station. Measures were then proposed to farmers with a view to improving their practices. The method can be extrapolated to different other areas to preserve or restore the surface water.

Abstract = {Determining the spatiotemporal dynamics in land use and ecosystem service value (ESV) and understanding the trade-offs/synergy relationships between ecosystem services (ESs) are crucial for ecosystem management and achieving sustainable development in mining areas. However, existing research on ESV and ESs has not paid sufficient attention to the special coalfield in arid/semiarid areas. In this study, we investigated the Pingshuo mining area and used the standard equivalent factor to evaluate ESV variations resulting from the spatiotemporal changes of land use based on remote sensing and land use data (2000, 2010, and 2020). Simultaneously, the trade-offs/synergies between ESs were further explored using the ESs trade-offs/synergies degree (ESTD) model. We found that (1) the land use changed considerably in this area, which was mainly reflected in farmland decrease and built-up land increase by 3580.60 hm(2) and by 5103.44 hm(2), respectively, from 2000 to 2020. (2) ESV in our study area declined by 7116.53 x 10(4) RMB yuan over the investigated period. High ESV mainly appeared in the north/south of the study area, while the low ESV was concentrated in the middle and northeast/southeast of the mining area. (3) The interactions between paired ESs were mainly the synergies that generally appeared among eight ESs except soil conservation, while trade-offs mainly existed between soil conservation and other paired ESs in the study region. To achieve socio-economic and ecological benefits, the local government should take effective measures to improve the environment of the coalfield and reverse the falling tendency of ESV.},

Title = {Fifty years of Landsat science and impacts},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {280},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Since 1972, the Landsat program has been continually monitoring the Earth, to now provide 50 years of digital, multispectral, medium spatial resolution observations. Over this time, Landsat data were crucial for many scientific and technical advances. Prior to the Landsat program, detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth's surface were rare, and the ability to acquire and work with large datasets was limited. The early years of the Landsat program delivered a series of technological breakthroughs, pioneering new methods, and demonstrating the ability and capacity of digital satellite imagery, creating a template for other global Earth observation missions and programs. Innovations driven by the Landsat program have paved the way for subsequent science, application, and policy support activities. The economic and scientific value of the knowledge gained through the Landsat program has been long recognized, and despite periods of funding uncertainty, has resulted in the program's 50 years of continuity, as well as substantive and ongoing improvements to payload and mission performance. Free and open access to Landsat data, enacted in 2008, was unprecedented for medium spatial resolution Earth observation data and substantially increased usage and led to a proliferation of science and application opportunities. Here, we highlight key developments over the past 50 years of the Landsat program that have influenced and changed our scientific understanding of the Earth system. Major scientific and programmatic impacts have been realized in the areas of agricultural crop mapping and water use, climate change drivers and impacts, ecosystems and land cover monitoring, and mapping the changing human footprint. The introduction of Landsat collection processing, coupled with the free and open data policy, facilitated a transition in Landsat data usage away from single images and towards time series analyses over large areas and has fostered the widespread use of science-grade data. The launch of Landsat-9 on September 27, 2021, and the advanced planning of its successor mission, Landsat-Next, underscore the sustained institutional support for the program. Such support and commitment to continuity is recognition of both the historic impact the program, and the future potential to build upon Landsat's remarkable 50-year legacy.},

Abstract = {Insect pollinators provide an important ecosystem service by improving agricultural productivity. However, their populations have been declining in recent years due to excessive use of synthetic pesticides, climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Climate and LULC changes have resulted in land fragmentation and consequently pollinator habitat loss. To conserve pollinators, there is a need for sustainable agricultural practices such as integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM), which is a holistic landscape management approach that minimizes pesticides use while conserving pollinator abundance and diversity. This study aimed to use earth observation (EO) data to characterize landscape dynamics in terms of vegetation productivity to guide the implementation of IPPM interventions in an avocado production system in Murang'a (Kenya). Specifically, we utilized Sentinel-2 (S-2)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation productivity to assess IPPM implementation sites. The NDVI was calculated using multi-date S-2 data acquired during the dry and wet seasons and categorized into three vegetation productivity classes - low, medium, and high - using a K-means unsupervised clustering method. We also collected socio-economic baseline data from 410 farmers with a focus on their perception to implement one of four avocado pest management and pollination options: (1) IPPM, (2) integrated pest management (IPM), (3) pollinator supplementation (P), and (4) no intervention (control). The three landscape vegetation productivity classes were then linked with the four farmer preferences with regards to the implementation options. Criteria based on the distances among the sites for implementing the different four options were set for farmer selection and the experiment was replicated three times in each vegetation productivity class (i.e. in total 12 farmers in each class). The results showed that the Kmeans method was successful in characterizing the landscape vegetation productivity with an overall accuracy of 86.2\%. One the other hand, we successfully selected the 36 (12 in each of the 3 vegetation productivity classes) out of 410 farmers who met our distance-based criteria and participated in the implementation of one of the four technology options (i.e. IPPM, IPM, P, and control). In conclusion, NDVI proved to be a vital proxy for assessing the landscape dynamics as it provided a robust view of vegetation productivity patterns, which enabled a wellrepresentative distribution of the four pest management and pollination options across the landscape. Overall, the study shows the utility of integrating EO and socio-economic data in selecting sites for implementing agrotechnologies at a landscape scale.},

Abstract = {Pacific halibut is a large-bodied demersal fish species known to undertake large-scale winter spawning migrations. We characterized annual movement patterns of Pacific halibut relative to a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska using electronic tags. In the summer of 2013, we deployed 25 Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags (PSATs) on halibut to determine seasonal movement patterns, where residency within the MPA was inferred by comparing PSAT depth and temperature records to stationary archival tag data and oceanographic survey data. To characterize within-summer movement patterns, 15 halibut tagged with PSATs were double-tagged with acoustic transmitters and actively tracked during the summers of 2013 and 2014. Home range behaviour and interannual site fidelity at spatial scales<5 km were observed for the majority of tagged fish. A small proportion (6/21 fish with PSAT data) departed the MPA on winter migrations during December 2013. A majority (4/6) of migratory fish returned to the MPA after an average of 57 d (s.d. 22 d) spent outside of the MPA. Migration timing generally coincided with existing winter commercial fishery closures. The annual movement patterns of tagged halibut relative to MPA boundaries and winter commercial fisheries closures suggest that the Glacier Bay MPA could serve as a year-round refuge from commercial harvest for both residential and migratory halibut. If halibut behaviour is similar in other areas, protected areas may provide some utility for management despite the migratory nature of halibut.},

Abstract = {The assessment of ecological vulnerability plays an important role in the protection and management of scenic tourism sites. In this study, using remote sensing image data in the same month of 2000 and 2017, ecological vulnerability in the Tianchi Scenic Area (TSA) was analyzed by calculating the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), and the influencing factors of ecological vulnerability were detected using the geographical detector model. From 2000 to 2017, the values of wetness, dryness, and temperature in the study area increased, and the value of greenness and RSEI decreased. Spatial correlations of the RSEI were significant, showing strong spatial agglomeration and alternating cold spots-hot spots-cold spots-hot spots from north to south. The impact factors of land use type, temperature, and precipitation showed greater contribution to ecological vulnerability. In addition, the local government implemented policies such as prohibition of mining, grazing prohibition, and landscape protection, which decreased ecological vulnerability in the study area. This study provides a reference for the formulation of ecological vulnerability protection measures in the TSA and theoretical basis for defining the monitoring indicators for heritage sites around the world.},

Abstract = {Tourism development may result in negative impacts on natural resources owing to overuse and mismanagement. However, tourism may also play positive roles in natural resource conservation, which has rarely been verified in practice, although some researchers have demonstrated this in theory. In this article, taking the Jiuzhaigou Biosphere Reserve as a case study area, we conducted an analysis for the environmental impacts from tourism development based on social survey and interpretation of remote sensing images. The results show that the natural environment was not degraded and some indicators are even improving because all the residents have participated in tourism and given up farming and hunting. It is concluded that it is possible to use tourism as a way to balance natural resource conservation and economic development under the preconditions of making effective policies to encourage and help local people participate in tourism business and to benefit from it.},

Abstract = {Tourism is one of the important economic sectors, which is not flourishing as desired due to acute water shortage and other facilities. Proper management of water resources both on surface and underground is essential in areas important for tourism for the development of that industry. Therefore, an effort has been made to address the problem encountered by assessment, exploration and management of water resources using integrated remote sensing based techniques in a prominent pilgrim centre, Vemulawada in Karimnagar district, Andhra Pradesh. High-resolution IRS-IC merged (PAN+ LISS-III) satellite data is used and hydrogeomorphological /ground water prospects map is prepared by visual interpretation techniques. Ground truth information is integrated and final map is prepared to aid in ground water exploration. The entire study area is occupied by pink and grey granites of Archaean age intersected by dolerite dykes. On either sides of Maneru River and Mula vagu, the flood plain consists of unconsolidated sediments like sand, silt and clay. Valley fill along local streams comprises of cobbles, pebbles, gravel, sand and silt of recent age. The water demand vis-a-vis water resources availability is evaluated based on hydrogeological set up and field investigations. Both long and short term solutions are given for water resources development at Vemulawada. As a part of the crisis management, (short term measures) ten bore wells are dug in a valley fill near Vemulawada based on recommendations followed by vertical electrical soundings. The wells have yielded a cumulative discharge of 1300 LPM. With the help of remote sensing technology such value additions can be made to enhance the tourism sector in India.},

Abstract = {Natural resource management (NRM) is becoming increasingly important at all scales, local, regional. national and global, because of an increasing human population and increasing per capita use of resources and space. Conflicts are intensifying between different interest groups. Production and conservation aspects are particularly debated because conservation often conflicts with economic and social sustainability. There is public demand for objective decision based NRM but limitations are all pervasive due to the spatial and temporal complexity and interdisciplinary nature. This special issue explores the use of spatial data and models to overcome some limitations of NRM decision making. The papers in this issue show modern approaches of natural resources management with a particular focus on spatial data collection, analysis and the development of spatial indicators. This issue presents a balanced mix of review and research papers that give examples of how to find or improve the spatial information base for evidence-based decision making. This overview makes the argument that understanding complex spatial pattern and processes, and the development of spatial indicators, is an essential aspect of evidence-based NRM. If spatial and temporal patterns are complex, ecological evidence from field data or experiments may have limited value for NRM and observational study designs become more appropriate for understanding complex spatial pattern and processes. Data quality should be documented as a combination of accuracy and spatio-temporal representativeness in order to be useful in the NRM decision process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {National wetland mapping using remote-sensing-derived environmental variables, archive field data, and artificial intelligence},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While wetland ecosystem services are widely recognized, the lack of fine-scale national in-ventories prevents successful implementation of conservation policies. Wetlands are difficult to map due to their complex fine-grained spatial pattern and fuzzy boundaries. However, the increasing amount of open high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data and accurately georefer-enced field data archives, as well as progress in artificial intelligence (AI), provide opportunities for fine-scale national wetland mapping. The objective of this study was to map wetlands over mainland France (ca. 550,000 km2) by applying AI to environmental variables derived from remote sensing and archive field data. A random forest model was calibrated using spatial cross-validation according to the precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) index using ca. 135,000 soil or flora plots from archive databases, as well as 5 m topographical variables derived from an airborne DTM and a geological map. The model was validated using an experimentally designed sampling strategy with ca. 3000 plots collected during a ground survey in 2021 along non-wetland/wetland transects. Map accuracy was then compared to those of nine existing wetland maps with global, European, or national coverage. The model-derived suitability map (PR-AUC 0.76) highlights the gradual boundaries and fine-grained pattern of wetlands. The bi-nary map is significantly more accurate (F1-score 0.75, overall accuracy 0.67) than existing wetland maps. The approach and end-results are of important value for spatial planning and environmental management since the high-resolution suitability and binary maps enable more targeted conservation measures to support biodiversity conservation, water resources mainte-nance, and carbon storage.},

Title = {Improved CNN-based CatBoost model for license plate remote sensing image classification},
Journal = {SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {213},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought profound technical changes to many traditional industries, among which intelligent transportation has become a hot spot for development in the traditional transportation field. Remote sensing license plate image recognition technology is extensively emphasized in such domains as intelligent transportation and intelligent vehicle management. However, in the practical traffic environment, low visibility scenes caused by complex environmental factors such as rain, snow, haze and cloudy days influence the recognition and classification of license plates, while the distortion of license plate images that may be caused by irregular movements of vehicles bring challenges to license plate recognition classification. The CNN-CatBoost model proposed in this paper divides the license plate recognition classification into two stages. The first stage uses the excellent performance of convolutional neural network in processing image data to extract various license plate image features; the second stage uses the CatBoost module to further process the image feature data and finally obtain the remote sensing license plate information. The model achieves outstanding results in the experiments and has practical application value. Through comparison with other network models, the CNN-CatBoost model proposed in this paper has superior performance.},

Title = {Collaboration analysis for a three-tier sustainable logistics network considering 3PL using BCVR technique},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 22},
Abstract = {Logistics networks are significant for successful implementation of supply chain networks. Different configurations of logistics network exist regarding application areas and industrial requirements. One important consideration currently attracted the attention of researchers is sustainability focusing on economic, social and environmental factors. When the players of logistics network rises, the need for splitting functions among elements of the logistics network also increases. Therefore, in this paper a three-tier logistics network including supplier, producer and consumer is configured. Transportation is outsourced to a third-party logistics partner. Main factors of sustainability and their corresponding indices are collected and integrated to the tiers of the proposed logistics network. Collaboration is considered as a new concept to be embedded on the sustainable logistics network. Collaboration parameters are analyzed in a cubic space with logistics tiers and sustainability indices. Benefit-Cost-Value-Risk technique is developed for the computation purposes. The output is the sustainable value of the logistics network and significance score of collaboration parameters. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the impacts of collaboration and sustainability using sustainable value, significance of collaboration parameters on sustainability indices using significance score, and multi-aspect analysis in cubic space based on scenario planning. The numerical study emphasizes the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Also, comparative studies with the conventional multi-attribute decision-making approaches indicate the efficiency of the newly developed technique of this paper.},

Abstract = {To study the impact of the value of ecosystem services which brought by area land use change and bring them into the regional environment and economy integrated accounting system will have great significance for regional land development and ecological environment construction. This article take the administrative regions of Heilongjiang Province as study area and divided the land ecological assets of this area into eight categories, namely farmland, garden-plot, woodland, grassland, construction land, waters, wetland and unutilized land. To obtain and analysis three remote-sensing data in 1999, 2003, 2007 with the support of GIS/RS and use Costanza as well as other calculate methods can evaluate the value of ecosystem services, combined the average value of ecosystem services improved by Xiegaodi etc. and estimate the change of the value of ecosystem services caused by land-use change in Heilongjiang Province over the past decades. The results showed that from 1999 to 2007, Heilongjiang Provincial farmland, wetland and grassland area had decreased and waters, woodland, garden-plot, construction land and other unutilized land had increased. The provincial total eco-system value had increased. There are certain increased differences in the individual value of ecosystem services, in which water conservation and waste management were the biggest increase in the value of individual services.},

Abstract = {For developing countries, which plan to develop and produce national satellites as a strategic opportunity to become one of the leading countries in space competition, one of the most important investment areas is to set and successfully operate an ``Assembly, Integration and Test Center{''} (AIT). From AIT center point of view, it is critical to choose the right time for starting up the AIT facility work. There is great benefit of planning AIT facility in parallel with the planning of ``national satellite projects{''} together with the characteristics, types and specifications of these satellites. Almost all assembly work, qualification tests for the satellite subsystems and the satellite itself and acceptance of the satellite shall be done within the AIT facility. Qualification and acceptance tests have some major differences in terms of test types or test conditions (e.g. test times, test cycles, test parameters, etc.) These test conditions and related parameters are chosen taking into consideration the space environmental conditions of the satellite in the orbit. Every orbit has different environmental conditions. Environmental conditions for the satellite orbit in outer space are generally parameters of the orbit altitude, satellite position and local time and some other stochastic events. Due to their impact on satellite design, manufacturing process and whole useful life, detailed environmental effect analysis must be performed on one or more satellite models. In this paper, space environmental effects on satellites with required test devices are explained, and the works needed to establish a national AIT center is defined in the conclusion part.},

Title = {The Role of African Emerging Space Agencies in Earth Observation Capacity Building for Facilitating the Implementation and Monitoring of the African Development Agenda: The Case of African Earth Observation Program},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},

Abstract = {AU-Agenda 2063 was adopted at the 24th Ordinary Session of the African Heads of State and Government in 2015 as the blueprint for the future development of the continent. Built upon the continent's past experiences, challenges, and successes, AU-Agenda 2063 comprehensively describes the strategic path for Africa's future development in the next 50 years. Thus, the monitoring of its implementation in various African states is critical for ensuring sustainable development and track progress. However, the higher cost of collecting data for accurately and reliably monitoring the implementation of Agenda 2063 may hinder the progress towards achieving these goals. Satellite Earth observation provides ample data, and thus has provided opportunities for the development of novel products and services with the potential to support implementation, monitoring and reporting for AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. However, it has been limitedly exploited in Africa, as evidenced by lower research outputs and investments. This calls for increased capacity building in the use of available EO data and products for various users including decision makers to advance national, regional and continental priorities. The use of such data products is often hampered by the capability to understand the products and thus their value for addressing socio-economic challenges. This paper discusses the potential of Earth observation capacity building for supporting the implementation, monitoring of, and reporting towards achieving AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. Specifically, this paper identifies existing capacity building resources, including the role of open and free Earth observation data, open-source software, and product dissemination platforms that can be leveraged for supporting national development, service delivery and the achievement of AU-Agenda 2063 targets. Furthermore, the paper recognizes the importance of bilateral and multilateral partnerships in leveraging existing know-how, technology and other resources for advancing strategic goals of African emerging space agencies and promoting sustainable development, with examples from South African National Space Agency (SANSA). Then, the challenges and opportunities for capacity building and the wide adoption of EO in Africa are discussed in the context of AU-Agenda 2063. The paper thus concludes that EO capacity building is essential to address the skills and data gaps and increase the use of EO-based solutions for decision making in various sectors, critical for achieving AU-A2063.},

Title = {THE ``CARTA DELLA NATURA{''} MAPPING PROJECT IN THE SUPRAMONTE AREA (CENTRAL-EAST SARDINIA)},
Journal = {ANNALI DI BOTANICA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {1-7},
Abstract = {Since 1991, the Italian framework law on protected areas, has been calling for the editing of a national Nature Map, an instrument for the assessment of the state of the environment in Italy. The methodology applied in Sardinia is comparable with those applied in the other regions of Italy, with the necessary modifications, generalizations and integrations. Satellite imagery represents the fundamental informative layer to provide a synoptic view of the whole territory. In a second proceeding step, supervised classification is thematically enhanced by using logical niche models of species and habitats derived from assessed relationships between species-habitats known distributions patterns and available predictors, i.e. GIS thematic layers. This has resulted in the production of a habitat map with 24 habitat and land use classes. The environmental assessment procedure delivered four maps, the ecological value, the environmental sensitivity, the anthropic pressure and the land vulnerability (fragility). A reduction from 70 to 24 habitat/land use types, is coherent with the aims of the projects and planned deliverables. These 24 classes have been detected with semi-automatic procedures and with a high level of reliability. It is a reasonable compromise between thematic resolution and the possibility to record a synoptic view of the whole land in an acceptable lap of time. Various stakeholders will benefit from knowing the current condition of habitats distribution. Described deliverables are powerful tools for monitoring at regional level future land-use and habitat changes on a solid quantitative basis, for environmental conservation and habitat management.},

Title = {Urban transport systems in Latin America and the Caribbean: lessons and challenges},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the transportation challenges that urban areas in Latin America and the Caribbean face and reviews the causal evidence on the impact brought by different urban transport system interventions implemented around the world. The objective is to highlight the main lessons learned and identify knowledge gaps to guide the design and evaluation of future transport investments. The review highlights that causal studies have been concentrated in certain areas and that an important number have been carried out in developed countries. Empirical challenges due to the non-random placement of these interventions and their possible effects over the entire transport network might explain the reduced amount of causal evaluations. A large part of the literature has focused on the impact of transport systems on housing values, finding overall increases in prices and rents, but with results highly dependent on the quality and perceived permanency of the system. Few studies have explored socioeconomic effects, and those available have emphasized employment access. There are almost no studies exploring displacement effects, which should be further examined to better understand the social inclusion role of transport systems. New avenues of research are emerging that exploit non-traditional sources of data, such as big data and satellite information. Moreover, studies looking at ways to improve the operational efficiency of systems and those seeking to promote behavioral changes in transport users offer great potential to generate learning that is useful for the public and private actors involved.},

Abstract = {Estimating forest structural attributes is one of the essential forestry-related remote sensing applications. The methods applied so far typically concentrate on the structure of the overstorey. For various conservation and management applications, however, information on lower layers is also of great interest. Detecting understorey cover by remote sensing is challenging, as passive sensors do not penetrate to the forest ground layer. An alternative to these is 3D metrics from active light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Here, we evaluate this technique for describing the vegetation density of multiple stand layers within the temperate stands of a large protected area in southeastern Germany. We combined LiDAR metrics and information on forest habitat types with regression models to investigate LiDAR metrics that are significantly correlated with vegetation density. The top canopy and the herbal layer showed strong correlations with the applied LiDAR metrics, whereas the predictive power was lower for the intermediate stand layers. Moreover, our results suggest that the relationship between LiDAR predictors and vegetation density depends on the forest type. A comparison of the regression models with random forest predictions showed no major improvement in predictive error. In conclusion, this study highlights the value of the LiDAR metrics for characterizing the structural properties of lower forest layers, which has implications for wildlife and forest management applications, especially in protected areas.},

Title = {Assessing Effect of Targeting Reduction of PM2.5 Concentration on Human Exposure and Health Burden in Hong Kong Using Satellite Observation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Targeting reduction of PM2.5 concentration lessens population exposure level and health burden more effectively than uniform reduction does. Quantitative assessment of effect of the targeting reduction is limited because of the lack of spatially explicit PM2.5 data. This study aimed to investigate extent of exposure and health benefits resulting from the targeting reduction of PM2.5 concentration. We took advantage of satellite observations to characterize spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration at a resolution of 1 km. Using Hong Kong of China as the study region (804 satellite's pixels covering its residential areas), human exposure level (c) and premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 (Mort) for 2015 were estimated to be 25.9 g/m(3) and 4112 people per year, respectively. We then performed 804 diagnostic tests that reduced PM2.5 concentrations by -1 g/m(3) in different areas and a reference test that uniformly spread the -1 g/m(3). We used a benefit rate from targeting reduction (BRT), which represented a ratio of declines in c (or Mort) with and without the targeting reduction, to quantify the extent of benefits. The diagnostic tests estimated the BRT levels for both human exposure and premature mortality to be 4.3 over Hong Kong. It indicates that the declines in human exposure and premature mortality quadrupled with a targeting reduction of PM2.5 concentration over Hong Kong. The BRT values for districts of Hong Kong could be as high as 5.6 and they were positively correlated to their spatial variabilities in population density. Our results underscore the substantial exposure and health benefits from the targeting reduction of PM2.5 concentration. To better protect public health in Hong Kong, super-regional and regional cooperation are essential. Meanwhile, local environmental policy is suggested to aim at reducing anthropogenic emissions from mobile and area (e.g., residential) sources in central and northwestern areas.},

Title = {Flood Hazard Mapping and Assessment on the Angkor World Heritage Site, Cambodia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {World Heritage sites in general are exposed to the impacts of natural hazards, which threaten their integrity and may compromise their value. Floods are a severe threat to the Angkor World Heritage site. Studies of regional floods and flood hazard zoning have played an increasingly important role in ensuring sustainability of the Angkor site. This study developed a flood hazard index (FHI) model based on a geographic information system (GIS) and used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to extract historical floods at Angkor from 2007 to 2013. Four indices (flood affected frequency, absolute elevation, elevation standard deviation, drainage density) were used to identify flood-prone areas. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Delphi method were employed to determine the weight of each index. The weighted indices were then used to develop a distribution map of flood hazards at Angkor. The results show that 9 monuments are at risk by potential floods among the 52 components of the Angkor monuments. The high hazard and moderate-to-high hazard areas in the core zone are mainly located surrounding the West Baray but will not bring direct risk impact on the monuments located in the core archaeological zone. The moderate hazard areas are located on both sides of the Siem Reap and Roluos rivers and in the flooded area of the Tonle Sap Lake in the core archaeological zone. These areas cover 19.4 km(2), accounting for 9.13\% of the total area of the core zone. This moderate hazard zone poses a greater flood threat to the core zone and must be given higher attention. The buffer zone is a small area with fewer sites. As such, flooding has a low impact on the buffer zone. The methods used in this study can be applied to flood hazard assessments of other heritage sites in Southeast Asia.},

Abstract = {The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) provides a framework to integrate environmental data with existing and new technologies resulting in information that will improve our use and management of oceanic and coastal areas. The coastal zone is a dynamic biological, chemical, physical, and geological environment that is rich with opportunities for commerce and in need of well thought out resource management and conservation. In order to maintain responsible stewardship of this delicate environment while sharing coastal resources for economic benefit, we must have a means to measure, monitor, and characterize processes, parameters, and habitats accurately, in a timely fashion, and cost-effectively. While in situ observations and measurements provide the most precise and accurate means of data collection, this method is limited by its coarse spatial and/or temporal resolution and the potentially high cost of increasing fidelity. Satellite remote sensing provides a means of collecting large geographic views of data, but the information available from satellites can be constrained by (1) the spatial and spectral resolution of the sensor, (2) atmospheric absorption and other effects, (3) data refresh time of sensor platforms, and (4) cost. Airborne remote sensing provides a mechanism for overcoming shortcomings of space-borne sensors but typically at a high cost and with restrictions on flight regulations and endurance. In some types of operations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are less expensive and more flexible to operate than manned aircraft and continuing developments in the field are increasing the operational capabilities of these platforms and the variety of available sensors for data collection. Employment of UAV platforms and associated sensors, coordinated with in situ and other remote sensors, provides a powerful tool in characterizing the coastal ocean for habitat monitoring, hazard response and mitigation, resource management, and commercial use. UAV can be a critically important element of the national coastal component of IOOS.},

Abstract = {Information on the spatial pattern of African animal trypanosomosis forms a prerequisite for rational disease management, but few data exist for any country in the continent. The present study describes a raster or grid-based Geographic Information System for Togo, a country representative of subhumid West Africa, with data layers on tsetse, trypanosomosis, animal production, agriculture and land use. The paper shows how trypanosomosis prevalence and packed cell volume (PCV) map displays may be predicted from correlations between representative field data and environmental and satellite data acquired from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Meteosat platforms. Discriminant analytical methods were used to assess the relationship between the amount of field data used and the accuracy of the predictions obtained. The accuracy of satellite derived predictions decreases from tsetse abundance to trypanosomosis prevalence to PCV value. The predictions improve when eco-climatic and epidemiological predictors are combined. In Togo, and probably elsewhere, the patterns of trypanosomosis prevalence and PCV are much influenced by animal husbandry and other anthropogenic factors. Additional predictor variables, incorporating these influences might therefore further improve the models.},

Title = {Multi-scale evaluation of ecological restoration effects in the riparian zone using Landsat series images from 1980 to 2019},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Quantitative evaluation of ecological restoration effects (EREs) is essential to provide operational feedback and implement adaptive management for future riparian restoration. This manuscript aims to develop a multi-scale evaluation method of EREs based on remote sensing observations, which uses the composite index of physical structural integrity (PSI) to indicate riparian condition. The riparian EREs were quantitatively assessed by comparing the post-restoration PSI values with the ecological reference status derived from pre-restoration surveys. In addition, ecological partitioning was adopted to identify the vulnerable riparian areas and explore the influence indicators of ecological restoration. In this paper, we used the case study of the Liaohe River, the first protected area aimed to recover the riparian ecosystem in China, to evaluate the riparian EREs at three spatial scales using Landsat time series images from 1980 to 2019. Results indicated that: (1) the pre-restoration riparian ecosystem exhibited an clear degradation trend and ecological conservation was urgent; (2) riparian restoration is a continuous and heterogeneous ecological process, the project had not yet met its objectives in 2016 with a low ERE value of 49.1 (Poor), while achieved a significant success in 2019 with the ERE value of 68.8 (Very good); (3) the limited restoration partitions with a ERE value below 60 accounted for 42.8\% of riparian zones, which were the fragile riparian ecosystems and mainly distributed in reach D and F; and (4) the dominant factors for riparian restoration were canopy coverage, human disturbance and natural vegetation percent. This study is expected to provide a practical and feasible approach for evaluating the riparian EREs and supporting the future river management, in particular for rivers lack of long-term monitoring data.},

Title = {Assessing wetland degradation and loss of ecosystem services in the Niger Delta, Nigeria},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {828-836},
Abstract = {The Niger Delta, being the most extensive freshwater wetland and aquatic ecosystem in West Africa, provides numerous services both to local people and to the West African economy. Ongoing environmental pressure exerted by large-scale oil extraction and illegal timber logging, however, are suspected to have had a substantial impact on the Delta's ecosystems over the last decades. Knowledge on impact of these activities on the region's wetlands now or in the past is scarce and patchy. To address this lack of knowledge, this study assesses spatiotemporal changes in two wetlands in the region by using satellite data from 1984 to 2011 and GIS methods. The results show that both wetlands have experienced substantial degradation, particularly with respect to the area of forest lost. Although comprehensive environmental protection laws were introduced in 1988, ecosystem services of up to US\$ 65 million in value were lost over the study period. The introduction of new legislation in 2007, however, is potentially a first step towards a more `wise use' of wetlands in Nigeria.},

Note = {IEEE Aerospace Conference, Big Sky, MT, MAR 07-14, 2015},
Abstract = {In this paper, we extend prior work on Product Line reuse and platform design optimization to develop a framework for making reuse decisions while factoring in robustness to market uncertainty. We explore Product Line strategies for a portfolio of two communication satellite platforms that focused on optimizing investment decisions involving varying degrees of payload capability as a function of platform technology. Parametric models for satellite platform cost and mass, and the corresponding impact on available payload capacity were developed for three platform reuse strategies. First, the power subsystem capability was scaled as a function of payload power. Second, each platform in the portfolio utilized an enveloping power subsystem configuration to meet their full range of power levels. Third, the power subsystem was scaled using improved technology (i.e. more efficient solar cells), requiring additional upfront investment. Net present value (NPV) analysis was used to compare the economic performance, from the satellite manufacturer's perspective, of each strategy in the presence of market uncertainty. The results show that NPV improves when optimizing hardware for narrower power ranges, compared with deploying enveloping designs. Despite the higher development costs, the use of improved technology was shown to further improve economic value across the product portfolio.},

Abstract = {In recent years, thematic exchange-traded funds (ETF) have increased in economic significance. Investors in thematic ETFs have more than just financial objectives and gain a non-monetary added value from a thematic portion in their portfolios. Therefore, traditional portfolio optimization models which target only financial criteria cannot suit these investors' needs anymore. Nevertheless, to account for their thematic interests, investors adapt a core satellite strategy in which conventional core portfolios and thematic satellite portfolios are combined. Thus, these portfolios are separately optimized without further considering inter-portfolio correlation effects. Since modern portfolio theory has originally been established to, inter alia, optimize these correlation effects, portfolios can only be efficient by chance. Therefore, this study targets the correlation effects between conventional and thematic portfolios and uses a tri-criterion thematic portfolio optimization model as an overall framework. Throughout a two-part analysis with tradable ETFs and a simulation with 250,000 draws and 1,750,000 portfolio optimizations performed, the status quo is compared to the tri-criterion model. Quantifying the suboptimality, simulation results show a mean portfolio improvement of 6.23\% measured as relative yield enhancement. Further, our analysis concludes that the more narrowly a theme is defined and the more particular it is, relative yield enhancements can increase up to 46.88\%.},

Abstract = {Seagrasses are a fundamental component of nearshore marine habitats, and as such, concerted effort has been put into developing remote sensing methods to assess the spatial coverage of these important habitats. However, in small coastal bays, traditional aerial or satellite remote sensing can be cost-prohibitive or lack sufficient spatial resolution to detect the small, fringing, and often patchy eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows. This paper presents a method for collection and processing of unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery used to map eelgrass at three small coastal estuaries in the Salish Sea of British Columbia. A low-cost, consumer-grade UAS platform equipped with a GoPro Hero 3+ was used to acquire images with a ground resolution of 2 cm, which were postprocessed using structure-from-motion techniques into georeferenced orthomosaics. A manual classification approach incorporating segmented image objects was used to classify eelgrass on a presence or absence basis, resulting in overall mapping accuracies of 96.3\%, 86.5\%, and 89.7\%, as determined by field validation using kayak videography. The major benefit of this method was fine spatial resolution that allowed for textural discrimination between spectrally similar species. However, eelgrass detection and overall accuracy was found to be highly influenced by the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition.},

Abstract = {Today's 72-hour weather forecast is as accurate, globally, as the 24-hour forecast of the 1980s. The recent improvement in accuracy, for the southern hemisphere in particular, is remarkable. This achievement came about through scientific understanding of dynamical and physical processes in the atmosphere coupled with new and enhanced modelling techniques, increased availability of remote-sensing data from weather satellites, and progress in data assimilation techniques that incorporate weather observations into numerical prediction models. The great advances in computing power have also contributed significantly to the forecaster's performance. Further improvements in the accuracy and reliability of climate and weather forecasts are to be expected as a result of superior data observation and assimilation techniques and modelling. The challenge to the forecaster is to provide user-specific risk-management information on various time scales, so that the users of this information can realize the social and economic value of advanced weather and environmental predictions more fully.},

Farmers' selection of crop species, crop planting strategy, and agricultural planting layout according to the market price is important in securing their revenue. In this study, we used a web crawler program to obtain a large amount of data on agricultural product prices from the Internet. Then, the price fluctuation trend of the main economic crops was analyzed by using the K-means clustering method. The net investment yield and the Sharpe ratio were used to compare the economic benefits and investment risks of 10 crops and five cultivation strategies in Mile. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparative advantage index, which integrates the net investment yield, Sharpe ratio, scale advantage index, productivity advantage index, and ecological suitability advantage index, was adopted to comprehensively measure the advantages of crop cultivation. Finally, we propose a spatial-temporal big data analysis model based on the cuckoo search algorithm to optimize the spatial layout of the main crops in Mile in 2017. Based on the comparative analysis of the remote sensing monitoring results and the spatial optimization layout results of the main crops in 2017, several suggestions were given. The results based on agricultural big data analysis, such as crop selection cluster analysis, economic benefit analysis, and crop planting layout optimization, can give suggests to farmers plant suitable crops on right lands, in right time. Thus, it can help farmers stabilize their revenue and minimize the risk by choosing the right crops and planting strategy in accordance with the local conditions.},

Abstract = {Forest degradation is an environmental problem that falls in the domains of different disciplines. Therefore, it is necessary to tackle this issue from a multidisciplinary perspective to support the design of appropriate forest monitoring systems and policies. The overall goal of this study was to combine remote sensing (RS) and ecosystem services (ES) data to better understand how the demand for ES is related to forest degradation. The study area was the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve located in central-northern Ecuador. First, participatory mapping (208 respondents) was employed to identify the demand and location for five predefined ES categories in tropical forest. Next, RS data were used to delineate degraded forest areas based on an empirically derived canopy cover value of 30-86\%. The results show that the majority of ES locations was situated in areas with a canopy cover higher than 90\%, which corresponds to undisturbed forest, while in degraded forest there were fewer ES locations. Considering the land-use pattern in the study area, there is a great danger that the undisturbed forest encountered at the time of the study will be degraded in future if uncontrolled forest use continues. The results of this study will be useful to local authorities for developing specific forest management strategies, and the methodology can support national and subnational forest monitoring systems.},

Abstract = {At present, the dynamic change monitoring of urban ecological environment has became an important guarantee measure for urban management, planning and construction. In this paper, taking Nanchang city as a case study, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) which is based on the natural factors is used to study the changes of the urban ecological environment. The Landsat images in the three different time periods of 1996, 2005, and 2013 in Nanchang were selected. To extract the four factors of green level, moisture, dryness and heat respectively as sub-indexs of the ecological assessment, in which the single window algorithm was used to calculate the heat. Based on the four factors, the RSEI in each year was finally calculated. The results show that the ecological environment in Nanchang deteriorated in the past 17 years, the value of the RSEI has decreased from 0.385 in 1996 to 0.267 in 2005, falling by 30.65\%, but the ecological environment has improved in the later period, with the value of RSEI value rising to 0.413, increased by 54.68\% compared with the results in 2005. It is indicates that the urban ecological environment of Nanchang has been significantly improved after some effective measures such as urban greening, pollution control, environmental protection were taken.},

Abstract = {In many parts of the world, ecosystems change compromises the supply of ecosystem services (ES). Better ecosystem management requires detailed and structured information. Ecosystem accounting has been developed as an information system for ecosystems, using concepts and valuation approaches that are aligned with the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SNA is used to store and analyse economic data, and the alignment of ecosystem accounts with the SNA facilitates the integrated analysis of economic and ecological aspects of ecosystem use. Ecosystem accounting requires detailed spatial information at aggregated scales. The objective of this paper is to explore how remote sensing images can be used to analyse ecosystems using an accounting approach in the Orinoco river basin. We assessed ecosystem assets in terms of extent, condition and capacity to supply ES. We focus on four specific ES: grasslands grazed by cattle, timber and oil palm harvest, and carbon sequestration. We link ES with six ecosystem assets; savannahs, woody grasslands, mixed agro-ecosystems, very dense forests, dense forest and oil palm plantations. We used remote sensing vegetation, surface temperature and productivity indexes to measure ecosystem assets. We found that remote sensing is a powerful tool to estimate ecosystem extent. The enhanced vegetation index can be used to assess ecosystems condition, and net primary productivity can be used for the assessment of ecosystem assets capacity to supply ES. Integrating remote sensing and ecological information facilitates efficient monitoring of ecosystem assets, in particular in data poor contexts.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate stand-alone and combined Pleiades high-resolution passive optical and ALOS PALSAR active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in subtropical mountainous Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii) forest in Murree Forest Division, Punjab, Pakistan. Spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, etc.) and sigma nought HV-polarization backscatter dB values are derived from processing optical and SAR datasets, respectively, and modeled against field-measured AGB values through various regression models (linear, nonlinear, multi-linear). For combination of multiple spectral indices, NDVI, TNDVI, and MSAVI2 performed the best with modelR(2)/RMSE values of 0.86/47.3 tons/ha. AGB modeling with SAR sigma nought dB values gives low modelR(2)value of 0.39. The multi-linear combination of SAR sigma nought dB values with spectral indices exhibits more variability as compared with the combined spectral indices model. The Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) results follow closely the behavior of the model statistics. SAR data reaches AGB saturation at around 120-140 tons/ha, with the region of high sensitivity around 50-130 tons/ha; the SAR-derived AGB results show clear underestimation at higher AGB values. The models involving only spectral indices underestimate AGB at low values (< 60 tons/ha). This study presents biomass estimation maps of the Chir Pine forest in the study area and also the suitability of optical and SAR satellite imagery for estimating various biomass ranges. The results of this work can be utilized towards environmental monitoring and policy-level applications, including forest ecosystem management, environmental impact assessment, and performance-based REDD+ payment distribution.},

Abstract = {Protection of natural and cultural heritage is encompassed by the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and is among the innovative applications and services of the European Union's Earth Observation programme Copernicus. We are currently witnessing an increasing exploitation of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) methods to assess geohazards affecting cultural heritage. This paper offers the first data mining exercise to identify InSAR geoinformation that is digitally available and/or published and that spatially includes one or more cultural, natural and mixed UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS). The exercise focused on the 45 countries of geographical Europe, Turkey, Israel and the Russian Federation, and their 445 WHS of Outstanding Universal Value. We built a database of academic and grey literature collated via a Boolean search of the ISI Web of Science catalogue and systematic skim-reading to a total number of 280 publications as of the end of 2016. Over 460 InSAR open access digital datasets were also analysed. We found clusters of WHS covered by InSAR data in Italy, the Netherlands, western Germany, eastern Spain, Greece and the UK that match with the geographic distribution of InSAR expertise and geohazard hotspots. The existing stock of InSAR geoinformation already provides an overall WHS coverage of 36\%, with similar proportion of available data for `urban' (40\%) and `rural' (34\%) WHS. The sites with the highest number of publications are historic city centres (e.g. Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Lisbon, Paris, Rome), as well as Permanent Geohazard Supersites (e.g. Mt. Etna, Naples, Istanbul), where the impact of natural and/or anthropogenic processes is well known. First generation SAR data (mainly ERS-1/2) predominate in the literature with over 15 new publications/year since 2002, whilst second and third generation data show less pronounced rates since 2007 and 2014, respectively. The current engagement level of end-users appears still limited (less than 1\% of publications involve heritage stakeholders), and a shared guidance on the use of InSAR for heritage practitioners does not exist yet. Towards the development of Copernicus' services and applications in support of cultural heritage preservation and management, our analysis contributes to: outline the existing capabilities; focus on requirements for bespoke InSAR-derived products and services; and consider possible implementation scenarios both in emergency and ordinary circumstances.},

Title = {Remote sensing-based spatiotemporal variation and driving factor assessment of chlorophyll-a concentrations in China's Pearl River Estuary},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities have severely challenged the water quality of China's Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Further investigations into long-term water quality variation and associated driving mechanisms are therefore necessary to support the sustainable development of the PRE's Greater Bay Area (GBA). This study used remote sensing retrieval to address long-term spatiotemporal chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) variation characteristics in the PRE and the relationship between Chl-a concentrations and socioeconomic/environmental indicators. Three decades of Landsat satellite images and measured data were collected, and a two-band global algorithm was used to retrieve Chl-a concentration data. Results reveal significant spatiotemporal variability in Chl-a concentrations. The space-averaged Chl-a concentration exhibited a slight downward trend during the past three decades, and the multi-year mean value was 5.20 mg/L. Changes to environmental protection policies in recent years have improved overall PRE water quality. The western section of the PRE had the highest Chl-a concentration (i.e., 5.92 mg/L average) while the eastern section had the lowest (i.e., 3.98 mg/L average). This discrepancy was likely caused by the western section's more intensive industrial activities, resulting in a higher overall wastewater discharge volume. Affected by climatic conditions, winter Chl-a concentrations were evenly distributed while summer concentrations were significantly higher. Additionally, Chl- a concentrations significantly and positively correlated with total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and the biotic oxygen demand (BOD5). Chl-a concentrations also correlated with external factors (i.e., climate and anthropogenic activities). Among these factors, industrial wastewater discharge and the proportion of primary industries in coastal cities significantly and positively correlated with water quality. This study is intended to help direct water quality improvement management and urban sustainable development in the GBA.},

Abstract = {The Italian Space Agency (ASI) promotes the use of space assets to address not only scientific research questions, but also civilian applications and to the social-economic benefit of citizens. In the current scenario, when efforts are made to achieve the United Nations' 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the COSMO-SkyMed data exploitation initiatives launched by ASI - ``Open Call for Science{''} and ``Open Call for National Industry/Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs){''} - show increasing statistics proving that users are exploring how this state-of-the-art space technology can be used to address several applications feeding into SDGs. A selection of the successful experiences is discussed in relation to infrastructure monitoring, environmental assessment, understanding of and mitigation to natural hazards and climate change. The ASI's initiatives also helped companies to develop new businesses and cooperate with local administrations to address sustainability and land management issues.},

Title = {Towards a better understanding of grass bed dynamics using remote sensing at high spatial and temporal resolutions},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {251},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Wetlands conservation and resilience capacities are key issues in many places over the globe. Understanding these issues will benefit from a precise knowledge of seagrass species occupancy and coverage over time and over space. Such information can be obtained from remote sensing images and their classification thanks to a vegetation index, to be used in a complementary manner to field work inventories. Sentinel-2 data, which are available with a frequent revisit time (<5 days) and a high spatial resolution (10m pixel size) can be used to map grassbeds at the surface or slightly below the surface of permanent lagoons, hence enabling the characterization of its seasonal dynamics, which was not possible with previous remote-sensing tools. We have proved the feasibility of such a method in the natural reserve of the Bagnas (Herault, France) where Stuckenia pectinata coverage can be tracked over a full year thanks to Sentinel-2 images and field work. Inter-annual dynamics (seasonal growth and senescence) can be mapped over time with 10m resolution and will be extended to pluriannual studies thanks to the long-term objective of the Sentinel-2 mission. This opens the way to a concerted management of natural reserves based on data analysis and field knowledge, a better understanding of seagrass coverage with fluctuating environmental conditions, and predictive mechanistic and/or stochastic models of future qualitative trends.},

Title = {Effects of of China's pilot low-carbon city policy on carbon emission reduction: A quasi-natural experiment based on satellite data},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {175},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Economic development has brought about global greenhouse gas emissions and thus global climate change, which is a common challenge for all mankind that urgently needs to be addressed. As the focal points of national economic development, cities have major responsibilities with regard to low-carbon development and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Countries around the world are actively exploring low-carbon development. In response to climate change, China has actively explored and adopted pilot policies for low-carbon cities, to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. In this study, we used a differences-in-differences approach to explore the effects of emission reduction and conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the pilot cities. The empirical results showed that pilot cities reduced carbon emissions annually by approximately 2.72\%. Additionally, the associated gross domestic product loss from 2013 to 2017 was approximately 1.19 trillion yuan. Mechanism analysis elucidated that pilot cities reduced emissions by adjusting their industrial structure, promoting technological innovation of enterprises to increase their total-factor productivity, and stimulating research and development of low-carbon technologies. The results of this study provide examples, supported by data, for the government to further promote the low-carbon city construction policy.},

Title = {Sea Surface-Visible Aquaculture Spatial-Temporal Distribution Remote Sensing: A Case Study in Liaoning Province, China from 2000 to 2018},

Abstract = {Aquaculture plays an important role in providing food and reducing poverty but it affects environmental change and coastal ecosystems. Remote sensing is a technology that is helpful in the spatial-temporal dynamic monitoring of aquaculture, coastal management, and environmental monitoring. Most research focuses on inland and coastal areas, and little attention is paid to the extensive distribution of marine aquaculture. As an example, we use the freely available Landsat data of the developed marine aquaculture Liaoning Province of China and use the object-oriented automatic extraction method to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution information of marine aquaculture from 2000 to 2018. The accuracy evaluation from the randomly distributed sample points in high-resolution remote sensing images shows that the extraction accuracy for all of the five individual years of aquaculture area was higher than 82\%. The results showed that (1) in the past 19 years, the area of marine aquaculture in Liaoning Province showed an increasing trend, which increased from 35.41 km(2) in 2000 to 201.83 km(2) in 2018, approximately 5.7 times increase in total area, but the growth rate decreased slightly due to government policy and the environmental quality of the sea area. (2) The centroid of offshore aquaculture in Liaoning Province shows a migration pattern to the northeast, in general, extending from the Dalian Bay sea area to the eastern sea area of the Dalian Chengshantou National Nature Reserve of Coastal Landform in the northeastern direction, and the migration distance reached 48.78 km. Moreover, the migration distance between 2005 and 2010 was the largest of all of the periods, reaching 35.43 km. The new marine aquaculture areas are mainly concentrated in the eastern direction of Xiaoyao Bay, the Changshan Islands, and Guanglu Island in Changhai County. (3) The landscape pattern of marine aquaculture in Liaoning Province is split, large-scale aquaculture and small-scale aquaculture are symbiotic, and landscape ecological activities are active. For local managers, this study can provide valuable supporting data for the assessment of marine aquaculture yield in this region, comprehensive control and management of the marine environment, and stability of the marine ecosystem. For other countries or regions, this work provides a great reference value for monitoring the dynamic spatial distribution of marine aquaculture.},

Abstract = {GEONETCast, a near real-time global environmental information-delivery system by which in situ, airborne, and space-based observations, products, and services are transmitted to users through communication satellites, was accepted as a GEO initiative by the second GEO Plenary. GEONETCast is an interconnected global network of regional dissemination systems that are each focused on a specific geographic region under the respective satellites' footprints. Data from each region can be disseminated outside the originating region through data-exchange links between regions, such as through dedicated lines, overlapping satellite footprints, or use of the Internet or other existing networks. The regional components include one or more data collection, management, and dissemination hubs that receive, process, prioritize, and schedule the incoming data streams or products originating within the particular region. These GEONETCast Network Centres (GNCs) forward the prioritized data stream to the uplink ground station, which receives it, wraps it in a DVB-S dissemination protocol, and uplinks it to a communication satellite for dissemination at Ku- or C-band frequency. The data GEONETCast delivers is specifically targeted to address nine society benefit areas such as natural and human-induced hazards, environment and health, environmental-related energy issues, climate change, water management, weather, ecosystem management, sustainable agriculture, and desertification and biodiversity, with the aim of reaching a global coverage and allow the reception of this data at very low cost (basic reception station below \$US2000) by nearly anyone on the planet. GEONETCast is a prominent case in which typical obstacles such as interoperability of existing systems and components reuse of existing infrastructure and interfacing with newly developed components have been resolved successfully.},

Journal = {TRANSPORT REVIEWS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {389-415},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It is European Commission policy to charge modes of transport according to the marginal social cost of their use of the infrastructure, including environmental costs. However, progress in implementing this process has been slow, partly because of the difficulty of measuring and valuing these costs. This need has led to a great deal of research in this area in recent years. The paper presents the results of some of this research, and in particular of the European Commission-funded Unification of Accounts and Marginal Costs for Transport Efficiency (UNITE) project. UNITE used the Impact Pathway Approach developed in the ExternE project series to provide a bottom-up methodology for the estimation and valuation of marginal social costs of transport, taking into account the diversity of circumstances in terms of location (e. g. population density, and speed and direction of winds) and time of day. The paper first explains the approach used for the measurement and valuation of environmental costs and then presents results on both total and marginal costs. It then discusses the results of a parallel project using the same methodology that estimated the marginal social cost of road use at a very disaggregate level for different vehicle types, locations, types of road and times of day for Great Britain. The results show that off the main network and outside the conurbations, private cars are currently overcharged, but elsewhere they are charged too little, particularly in the main conurbations. Buses, and even more so heavy goods vehicles, are undercharged to a greater extent. Only a kilometre-based charging system capable of charging at different rates by vehicle type, type and location of road, and time of day is capable of reflecting all these differences; due to the development of global positioning satellite (GPS) technology, such systems are now becoming available.},

Abstract = {The displacement between the intentions of the decision making process and the continuous changes that territories undergo, both planned and unforeseen, calls for an unused ``territorial consistency{''} of planning. Thus, it requires widening its capacity in taking into consideration the whole decision making means overlaying on concerned territories. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) can be a reliable support to this shift. Through the case study of joint SEA of the EU funded Regional Operational Programmes 2014-2020 in Lombardy Region (IT), the contribution argues the potential role of an assessment approach based on a wide, shared and territorial based sustainability framework, drawn in order to properly face dynamic spatial scenarios. It is shaped to accompany the decision-making process and ensure a long-term link between spatial changes and single planning or programming activity. To outline spatial scenarios, all factors are supposed to determine the actual spatial dynamics and thus are considered and conceived as directly impacting the resilience and the vulnerability of territorial systems. This space-based approach results in acknowledgment of the value of Peri-Urban areas in terms of ecosystem services provided to urban areas as well as environmental, social and cultural relevance per se. While the urgent need for such a role to be recognized is apparent, the lack of ad hoc policies in Italy stands evident, also due to an unwillingness to integrate sectorial courses of action within a territorial focus. The proposed case study delivers specific sustainability conditions for the implementation phase, in order to bridge single provisions on Peri-Urban areas.},

Title = {Lockdowns Save People from Air Pollution: Evidence from Daily Global Tropospheric NO2 Satellite Data},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Motivated by the global fear of the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, we investigated whether lockdowns save people from air pollution, notably from Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Using daily satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), we first found that the global NO2 tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) decreased by 16.5\% after the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Then, we calculated the global health benefits, as the monetized value of life, using the value of a statistical life (VSL). The total global health benefits were approximately 8.73 trillion USD, accounting for 10\% of the global GDP; such benefits would be the largest in China, followed by the United States, Japan and Germany. Our results suggest that lockdowns may bring benefits to countries that policy interventions cannot easily bring, thus highlighting the importance of social distancing.},

Abstract = {Decision-makers in climate risk management often face problems of how to reconcile diverse and conflicting sources of information about weather and its impact on human activity, such as when they are determining a quantitative threshold for when to act on satellite data. For this class of problems, it is important to quantitatively assess how severe a year was relative to other years, accounting for both the level of uncertainty among weather indicators and those indicators' relationship to humanitarian consequences. We frame this assessment as the task of constructing a probability distribution for the relative severity of each year, incorporating both observational data\}such as satellite measurements\}and prior information on human impact\}such as farmers' reports\}the latter of which may be incompletely measured or partially ordered. We present a simple, extensible statistical method to fit a probability distribution of relative severity to any ordinal data, using the principle of maximum entropy. We demonstrate the utility of the method through application to a weather index insurance project in Malawi, in which the model allows us to quantify the likelihood that satellites would correctly identify damaging drought events as reported by farmers, while accounting for uncertainty both within a set of commonly used satellite indicators and between those indicators and farmers' ranking of the worst drought years. This approach has immediate utility in the design of weather-index insurance schemes and forecast-based action programs, such as assessing their degree of basis risk or determining the probable needs for postseason food assistance.},

Abstract = {Agriculture faces the challenge of providing food, fibre and energy from limited land resources to satisfy the changing needs of a growing world population. Global megatrends, e.g., climate change, influence environmental production factors; production and consumption thus must be continuously adjusted to maintain the producer-consumer-equilibrium in the global food system. While, in some parts of the world, smallholder farming still is the dominant form of agricultural production, the use of digital information for the highly efficient cultivation of large areas has become part of agricultural practice in developed countries. Thereby, the use of satellite data to support site-specific management is a major trend. Although the most prominent use of satellite technology in farming still is navigation, Earth Observation is increasingly applied. Some operational services have been established, which provide farmers with decision-supporting spatial information. These services have mostly been boosted by the increased availability of multispectral imagery from NASA and ESA, such as the Landsat or Copernicus programs, respectively. Using multispectral data has arrived in the agricultural commodity chain. Compared to multispectral data, spectrally continuous narrow-band sampling, often referred to as hyperspectral sensing, can potentially provide additional information and/or increased sampling accuracy. However, due to the lack of hyperspectral satellite systems with high spatial resolution, these advantages mostly are not yet used in practical farming. This paper summarizes where hyperspectral data provide additional value and information in an agricultural context. It lists the variables of interest and highlights the contribution of hyperspectral sensing for information-driven agriculture, preparing the application of future operational spaceborne hyperspectral missions.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Land administration constitutes the socio-technical systems that govern land tenure, use, value and development within a jurisdiction. The land parcel is the fundamental unit of analysis. Each parcel has identifiable boundaries, associated rights, and linked parties. Spatial information is fundamental. It represents the boundaries between land parcels and is embedded in cadastral sketches, plans, maps and databases. The boundaries are expressed in these records using mathematical or graphical descriptions. They are also expressed physically with monuments or natural features. Ideally, the recorded and physical expressions should align, however, in practice, this may not occur. This means some boundaries may be physically invisible, lacking accurate documentation, or potentially both. Emerging remote sensing tools and techniques offers great potential. Historically, the measurements used to produce recorded boundary representations were generated from ground-based surveying techniques. The approach was, and remains, entirely appropriate in many circumstances, although it can be timely, costly, and may only capture very limited contextual boundary information. Meanwhile, advances in remote sensing and photogrammetry offer improved measurement speeds, reduced costs, higher image resolutions, and enhanced sampling granularity. Applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), laser scanning, both airborne and terrestrial (LiDAR), radar interferometry, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques, all provide examples. Coupled with emergent societal challenges relating to poverty reduction, rapid urbanisation, vertical development, and complex infrastructure management, the contemporary motivation to use these new techniques is high. Fundamentally, they enable more rapid, cost-effective, and tailored approaches to 2D and 3D land data creation, analysis, and maintenance. This Special Issue hosts papers focusing on this intersection of emergent remote sensing tools and techniques, applied to domain of land administration.},

Title = {The Environmental Niche of the Tuna Purse Seine Fleet in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Based on Different Fisheries Data},
Journal = {FISHES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the spatial pattern of human fishing activity is very important for fisheries resource monitoring and spatial management. The environmental preferences of tropical tuna purse seine fleet in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) were constructed and compared at different spatial scales based on the fishing effort (FE) data from the available automatic identification system (AIS) and commercial fishery data compiled from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods. The MaxEnt models were fitted with FE and commercial fishery data and remote sensing environmental data. Our results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) value each month based on the commercial fishery data (1 degrees) and FE at 0.25 degrees and 0.5 degrees spatial scales was greater than 0.8. The AUC values each month based on the FE data at a 1 degrees scale ranged from 0.775 to 0.829. The AUC values based on commercial fishing data at the 1 degrees scale were comparable to the model results based on FE data at the 0.5 degrees scale and inferior to the model results based on FE data at the 0.25 degrees scales. Overall, the sea surface temperature (SST), temperature at 100 metres (T100), oxygen concentration at 100 metres (O100) and total primary production (PP) had the greatest influence on the distribution of the purse seine tuna fleet. The oxygen concentration at 200 metres (O200), distance to shore (DSH), dissolved oxygen (Dox), EKE, mixed layer depth (Mld), sea surface salinity (SSS), salinity at 100 metres (S100) and salinity at 200 metres (S200) had moderate influences, and other environmental variables had little influence. The suitable habitat areas varied in response to environmental conditions. The purse seine tuna fleet was mostly present at locations where the SST, T100, O100, O200 and PP were 28-30 degrees C, 27-29 degrees C, 150-200 mmol/m(3) and 5-10 mg/m(-3), respectively. The MaxEnt models enable the integration of AIS data and high-resolution environmental data from satellite remote sensing to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of the tuna purse seine fishery and the influence of environmental variables on the distribution, and can provide forecasts for fishing ground distributions based on future remote sensing environmental data.},

Title = {Opportunity Costs of Forest Conservation in Nepal},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Forest biomass may vary by species composition, location, management regimes, and management interventions. To assess the variation in biomass production by management regimes, we conducted a study in three physiographic regions (mid-hills, Siwaliks and Terai) of Nepal with four different management regimes (community forest, collaborative forest, protected area, and protected forest). As community forest is the dominant forest management regime in Nepal, it was studied in all physiographic regions whereas the other two regimes were drawn only from the Terai. We interviewed a total of 1,115 forest user households, which was supplemented by high-resolution satellite image analysis and forest inventory to estimate the costs and benefits of forest management and calculate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our estimates suggest that the opportunity cost of conserving forest in Nepal ranged from USD 654/ha in collaborative forest to USD 3,663/ha in protected forest in 2015. The associated opportunity cost of carbon sequestration was between USD 1.11 and USD 3.56 per tCO(2). Of the forest management practices adopted, the silviculture-based intensive forest management practice had a far lower cost of forest conservation compared to the other forest management regimes. We found that such a practice is more beneficial to the forest-dependent communities as it allows them to collect the non-timber forest products that are necessary for their daily needs.},

Abstract = {Spatial ecology focuses on the role of space and time in ecological processes and events from a local to a global scale and is particularly relevant in developing environmental policy and (mandated) monitoring goals. In other words, spatial ecology is where geography and ecology intersect, and high-quality geospatial data and analysis tools are required to address emerging issues in spatial ecology. In this commentary and review for the International Journal of GIS Special Issue on Spatial Ecology, we highlight selected current research priorities in spatial ecology and describe geospatial data and methods for addressing these tasks. Geoinformation research themes are identified in population ecology, community and landscape ecology, and ecosystem ecology, and these themes are further linked to the assessment of ecosystem services. Methods in spatial ecology benefit from explicit consideration of spatial autocorrelation, and applications discussed in this review include species distribution modeling, remote sensing of community and ecosystem properties, and models of climate change. The linkages of the Special Issue papers to these emerging issues are described.},

Title = {Forest cover loss in Paraguay and perception of ecosystem services: A case study of the Upper Parana Forest},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {200-212},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (BAAPA) in Paraguay is one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world. Relentless agricultural encroachment has left less than 10\% of its original cover intact. Many strategies and programs have been initiated, such as Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes, to halt forest cover loss. While the approach of ecosystem services (ES) has been continuously applied by policy makers, it has not been perceived strongly by the direct users of the forest. This study provides a comprehensive understanding on how landowners in the BAAPA perceive and benefits from ES derived from the forest and examines the influence of farmers on forest conservation. The results were obtained from an extensive household survey performed in the BAAPA region. An understanding of the high ecological value of the forest is common to all farmers. A strong dependency on forest-related products was observed for small and medium landowners whereas large-scale farmers considered the forest's main value to be mostly recreational and cultural. PES appears to be well accepted by forest owners, but it must receive stronger promotion. Understanding the importance of ecosystem services is a valuable contribution toward to conserving natural resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Analysis of MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Data in the Philippines from 2010 to 2020},

Abstract = {Satellite remote sensing for air quality assessment provides information over a large spatial coverage and time period that shows the trends and effects of anthropogenic activities. Using data collected from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite from the years 2010 to 2020, the spatiotemporal variations to aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Koronadal City and Quezon City were studied. Validation showed a strong relationship between the MODIS AOD values and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD values (R-2 = 0.83) and a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.26. Annual variation in the AOD of the two study areas showed a peak AOD value in 2015 due to an immense biomass burning in Indonesia and a low AOD value in 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Koronadal City experienced a high AOD value during the fall season due to aerosols from biomass burning in Indonesia that were carried by the southwest monsoon. Quezon City experienced a high AOD value during spring from increased local sources, as well as long-range transport pollutants from East Asia that were carried by northeasterly winds. Overall, this study provides an understanding of the spatiotemporal variations in aerosols in the Philippines, which could be used in environmental management, air quality regulations, and health assessment studies. This shows the urgency of monitoring and mitigating poor air quality in the Philippines.},

Abstract = {In Germany, 6-8 million woman and men suffer urinary incontinence, which represents 12.5 \% of the population. It is estimated that by the middle of this century, it will increase to almost 30 \%. The primary reason will be primarily related to the aging population but also to patient awareness and seeking a solution. In addition to the cost which is covered by the health insurance, the patient will spend more than half a billion euro/year out-of-pocket, not to mention the social stigma associated with urinary incontinence. The current common treatment options are symptomatic but do not restore functionality. One option might be tissue engineering or stem cell therapy. This article describes the likelihood that this therapy will change the approach in treating stress urinary incontinence. Boundaries and legal aspects are highlighted as well as approximated cost. These treatment costs might be currently higher than the standard treatment options, but the investment to reduce these costs are paid indirectly by society.},

Title = {Mapping Opencast Iron Mine and Mine Solid Waste Based on a New Spectral Index From Medium Spatial Resolution Satellite Data},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {7788-7798},
Abstract = {Opencast iron mine and mine solid waste (OIM-MSW) are closely associated with a wide range of environmental issues, such as destroying soil structure, affecting air quality, and damaging biodiversity. Therefore, accurately grasping the distribution of OIM-MSW is of great significance to monitoring and managing environmental conditions. In order to reduce the impact of background features on the identification of OIM-MSW, we constructed an index based on medium spatial resolution satellite data, and proposed a semiautomatic method to determine the threshold value of the index. Experimental results indicated that: 1) The proposed index (OIM-MSWI) can effectively identify the OIM-MSW of which the OA (overall accuracy) and K (kappa coefficient) value are 0.98 and 0.75, respectively. 2) The index owns satisfying performance in identifying OIM-MSW in different months, and its recognition ability in plant growing season is better than that in the nonplant growing season. 3) Both Landsat 8 images and Sentinel 2 images have the potential to identify OIM-MSW via the proposed index, but the recognition accuracy of Landsat 8 images (OA = 0.98, K = 0.75) is slightly better than Sentinel 2 images (OA = 0.96, K = 0.64). (4) OIM-MSWI is effective in different climatic conditions, with OA and K of 0.98, 0.75 and 0.97, 0.63 in the cases of semiarid and humid zones, respectively. In conclusion, OIM-MSWI is a simple and effective index for identifying OIM-MSW, and can provide support for OIM-MSW monitoring and management.},

Abstract = {The state of Rhode Island (RI) has established its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals, which require rapidly acquired and updatable science-based data to make these goals enforceable and effective. The combination of remote sensing and soil information data can estimate the past and model future GHG emissions because of conversion of ``low disturbance{''} land covers (e.g., evergreen forest, hay/pasture) to ``high disturbance{''} land covers (e.g., low-, medium-, and high-intensity developed land). These modeled future emissions can be used as a predevelopment potential GHG emissions information disclosure. This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for RI by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. Obtained results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions and show their patterns which are often associated with existing urban developments. These remote sensing tools could be used by the state of RI to both understand the nature of land cover change and likely GHG emissions from soil and to institute mandatory or voluntary predevelopment assessments and potential GHG emissions disclosures as a part of a climate mitigation policy.},

Abstract = {In order to solve the problem B of the 2016 Mathematical Contest in Modeling(MCM), I study the decision problem of cleaning up the space debris. To determine whether a viable commercial opportunity exits, I establish models as follows: First, I study the present situation of debris and the methods of cleaning up, among which the ground-based laser and the space-based laser technology are greatly used. In which, the method of combining the ground-based laser with the space-based laser to get the best strategies is proposed creatively. Then, I study the method of using satellite collector. According to the optimal energy and time model by using genetic algorithm we can calculate the optimal energy and time, with the practical restriction and the requirement. In addition, on the basis of the above models, I set a time-depended analytical decision model based on the empirical tractable formulas that includes the cost, benefit, and the risk factors to judge the economic feasibility of cleaning the debris qualitatively. In this model I introduce the commercial attraction coefficient a to assess whether the commercial opportunity exists.},

Abstract = {Cultivated land resources are important natural resource assets that are related to food security and sustainable development. Due to the many restrictive factors of the karst landform on agricultural production, the quantity and quality of cultivated land in the karst mountainous areas in Southwest China are poor. Reclaiming cultivated land to develop economy or to avoid transitional reclamation to protect ecology is an important proposition in this area. Analyzing changes in the physical and monetary value of cropland resources can help us to formulate more reasonable policies for the development and utilization of cultivated land resources, and to achieve a win-win scenario for economic development and ecological protection. Using multi-source remote sensing data and 20-year landcover data obtained by the GEE platform, this paper evaluated the cropland resources of the karst mountain areas of China at the pixel level. It was found that under the apparent outflow of the physical account of the cultivated land resources, the monetary value still maintained growth, proving that the current cultivated land-use policy in Guizhou Province has significantly improved the value of local cultivated land resources.},

Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) technologies are rapidly developing, lowering cost, and technology barriers for their use in numerous applications. This review and commentary summarizes relevant literature in allied fields and evaluates potential application and utility of UAS technology in the discipline of occupational hygiene. Disciplines closely related to occupational hygiene are moving to investigate potential uses-and in some cases-already employing this technology for research or commercial purposes. The literature was reviewed to formulate a cross-sectional picture of how UAS technology is being used in these closely allied disciplines which could inform or guide potential use in occupational hygiene. Discussed are UAS applications in environmental monitoring, emergency response, epidemiology, safety, and process optimization. A rapidly developing state of the art indicates that there is potential utility for this technology in occupational hygiene. Benefits may include cost savings, time savings, and averting hazardous environments via remote sensing. The occupational hygiene community can look to allied fields to garner lessons and possible applications to their own practice.},

Abstract = {National parks and protected areas represent one of the best ways to safeguard nature and preserve biodiversity, especially endemic and endangered species. Currently, more than 110 countries have some form of protected areas within their borders. North Korea's comprehensive network of national parks and protected areas are rich in biodiversity and ecological value; however, contemporary research on the integrity of North Korea's protected lands is incomplete. In this paper, we utilize a remote sensing approach to explore North Korea's protected area system and investigate the current state of biodiversity conservation. We find that several key biodiversity areas have experienced severe tree loss and habitat fragmentation since 2000, indicating that the effectiveness of national park governance and management toward guarding against biodiversity loss is inadequate. To address the issue of biodiversity conservation, we recommend pathways for international cooperation aimed at enhancing conservation efforts and comment on the steps North Korea can take to achieve the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Targets and Sustainable Development Goals.

Abstract = {Uncertainty is ubiquitous in natural resource systems, science and management. Sample data are obtained in order to reduce uncertainty, thereby increasing knowledge and improving resource management, but sampling always comes at a cost of some sort. Is that cost worthwhile? Analysis of the value of sample information (VSI) addresses this question. In this paper we develop the valuation of sample information in terms of five elements: (a) asystemwhose attributes are the focus of analysis; (b) a range of managementactionsthat affect the system's status; (c)uncertaintyabout system status or structure, as characterized by initial (prior) probabilities of possible system states or structures; (d) anexperimentor other information source that produces new data points and updated (posterior) probabilities; and (e) avalue measurethat is a function of the management action taken, conditional on either the system state or structure. We describe five scenarios for analysing theVSIunder uncertainty about system structure and state. Scenarios 1-3 comprise analyses of conditional, expected and optimal expected values of sample information. They focus primarily on choice of management adaptations with new information. Scenarios 4 and 5 involve pre-selected management actions, and are useful for comparing designs of data collection rather than for choosing a management action. These last scenarios expand the framework forVSIto include actions that have been selected independently of the updating of uncertainty. We discuss other extensions ofVSIanalysis, which include spatial applications, hybrid scenarios, applications involving dynamic systems, and a focus on costs rather than net benefits. Value of sample information analysis holds promise in emerging areas of ecology such as ecological forecasting and the use of remote sensing in conservation, where potential new data from models and satellites can be evaluated in advance, thereby allowing more efficient prioritization of scientific efforts. More generally,VSIcan contribute to better ecological understanding and more effective management in a wide range of ecological situations.},

Abstract = {Natural and semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes are likely to come under increasing pressure with the global population set to exceed 9 billion by 2050. These non-cropped habitats are primarily made up of trees, hedgerows and grassy margins and their amount, quality and spatial configuration can have strong implications for the delivery and sustainability of various ecosystem services. In this study high spatial resolution (0.5 m) colour infrared aerial photography (CIR) was used in object based image analysis for the classification of non-cropped habitat in a 10,029 ha area of southeast England. Three classification scenarios were devised using 4 and 9 class scenarios. The machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF) was used to reduce the number of variables used for each classification scenario by 25.5 \% +/- 2.7\%. Proportion of votes from the 4 class hierarchy was made available to the 9 class scenarios and where the highest ranked variables in all cases. This approach allowed for misclassified parent objects to be correctly classified at a lower level. A single object hierarchy with 4 class proportion of votes produced the best result (kappa 0.909). Validation of the optimum training sample size in RF showed no significant difference between mean internal out-of-bag error and external validation. As an example of the utility of this data, we assessed habitat suitability for a declining farmland bird, the yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella), which requires hedgerows associated with grassy margins. We found that similar to 22\% of hedgerows were within 200 m of margins with an area >183.31 m(2). The results from this analysis can form a key information source at the environmental and policy level in landscape optimisation for food production and ecosystem service sustainability.

Abstract = {Motivated by the growth of the commercial space economy and renewed focus on the disaggregation of military space systems, this work develops a method for conceptual design of federated satellite systems as a collaborative system of systems (SOS). Objectives seek to improve the likelihood of successful SOS formation and pursue constituent system utility robustness. The proposed metaheuristic optimization trade-space exploration method accounts for technical and economic design variables and multi-decision-maker strategy dynamics. Constituent system designs are ranked on their simulated net present value. A game-theoretic measure of risk dominance is used in concert with the net present value to assess the robustness and utility of candidate SOS designs. The method is validated with a notional application case that assesses potential collaboration between Earth-observing and telecommunications systems. The proposed methodology reduces the threshold probability of partner collaboration for which SOS participation is economically rational by up to 18\% for the most efficient designs as compared to a typical conceptual design method, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful SOS formation. The results highlight the importance of accounting for strategy dynamics when designing systems for collaboration.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems provide a variety of services that are important for human well-being. The estimation of different ecosystem services is necessary to support decision-making processes at different levels in the landscapes. The dynamics of land use, based on LANDSAT satellite images from the years 1978, 1986, 1998 and 2011 in La Via Lactea (Nicaragua), was analyzed to estimate its impact on four ecosystem services (habitat for species, carbon stock, greenhouse gas regulation and food production). The valuation of ecosystem services was carried out through a land-use change analysis, while the estimation of conservation value coefficients was estimated for the study area using information collected in the field. It was estimated that forest cover was reduced by 93\% between 1978 and 2011, whereas pasture areas increased considerably (133,304 ha) in the same period. These changes have caused a reduction of forest cover for cattle production, resulting in a loss in the quality and provision of ecosystem services. The conversion of forests to pastures caused a reduction of ecosystem services such as habitat for species and carbon stock, while milk production and greenhouse gas emissions have increased, which is related to grassland management. Between 1978 and 2011, support and regulation services had decreased by \$15.6 and \$4.4 million USD, respectively, whereas provisioning services have increased by \$14.9 million USD. Recovery of pastures through silvopastoral systems is an alternative that would improve the provision of ecosystem services and the promotion of sustainable livestock to improve landscape conservation.},

Abstract = {The ocean surface is organized into regions with distinct properties reflecting the complexity of interactions between environmental forcing and biological responses. The delineation of these functional units, each with unique, homogeneous properties and underlying ecosystem structure and dynamics, can be defined as ocean surface partitioning. The main purposes and applications of ocean partitioning include the evaluation of particular marine environments; generation of more accurate satellite ocean colour products; assimilation of data into biogeochemical and climate models; and establishment of ecosystem-based management practices. This paper reviews the diverse approaches implemented for ocean surface partition into functional units, using ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) data, including their purposes, criteria, methods and scales. OCRS offers a synoptic, high spatial-temporal resolution, multi-decadal coverage of bio-optical properties, relevant to the applications and value of ocean surface partitioning. In combination with other biotic and/or abiotic data, OCRS-derived data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, optical properties) provide a broad and varied source of information that can be analysed using different delineation methods derived from subjective, expert-based to unsupervised learning approaches (e.g., cluster, fuzzy and empirical orthogonal function analyses). Partition schemes are applied at global to mesoscale spatial coverage, with static (time-invariant) or dynamic (time-varying) representations. A case study, the highly heterogeneous area off SW Iberian Peninsula (NE Atlantic), illustrates how the selection of spatial coverage and temporal representation affects the discrimination of distinct environmental drivers of phytoplankton variability. Advances in operational oceanography and in the subject area of satellite ocean colour, including development of new sensors, algorithms and products, are among the potential benefits from extended use, scope and applications of ocean surface partitioning using OCRS.

Title = {Integrating remote sensing and life cycle assessment to quantify the environmental impacts of copper-silver-gold mining: A case study from Laos},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {154},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Environmental impacts from the mining is so diverse in nature that it requires different tools to quantify. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one of the popular tools that can assess the impact of mining activities. Remote sensing (RS) based imagery analysis helps to explore the change in earth surface by providing long-term historical data which is very useful for mining induced environmental impact assessment. Therefore, we used the knowledge of RS based image analysis to analyze the direct footprint of mining that is the land use change. Besides, we also used LCA to quantify the environmental impacts focusing mainly on Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Gross Energy Requirement (GER). The case study site was a copper-gold-silver mine located in Laos, called Phu Kham mine. The RS based image analysis suggests that the land use change due to mining during 2007-2018 was approximately 3.98 km(2) whereas the overall intensity of land use change in the same period was about 0.0052515 m(2)/kg of concentrate. We also analyzed the indirect CO2 emission from vegetation lost by mining. The GER of the mine showed average value for an open-pit copper mine though the CO2 emission was lower mainly due to the use of hydroelectricity. We also tried to quantify the productivity of the mine site. The findings from this study was also compared with existing literature. Though the impact of the mine was lower, there is room for improvement. We have tried to provide a few directions for that as well.},

Abstract = {Urbanization has substantially changed landscape patterns and seriously disturbed the structure and function of the ecosystems. However, the spatial characteristics and relationships between landscape patterns and ecosystem service values (ESVs) along the urban-rural gradient remain unclear. Based on high-resolution images, this study used concentric buffer zones to explore the characteristics and relationship between landscape pattern indexes (LPIs) and ESVs in the rural-urban gradient to reveal the impact of urban development on urban ecosystems. The results showed that the landscape heterogeneity was high in the urban fringe 18-20 km from the urban center. The PD, ED, LSI, SHAPE\_MN, DIVISION, SPLIT, and SHIDI variables had the lowest values in the urban center, while CONTAG and AI had the high values in the urban. Water bodies and forest land are the main land use/land cover (LULC) types that provide ecosystem services. The total ESV of Kunshan city totaled 5597.31 x 10(6) CNY in 2018. The average ESV increased from 2.42 x 10(6) CNY to 9.92 x 10(6) CNY along the urban-rural gradient, which indicated that natural landscapes had higher ESVs. ED and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) had positive effects on ESV, while Largest Patch Index (LPI), Contagion (CONTAG), Proportion of Like Adjacencies (PLADJ), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), and Aggregation Index (AI) had negative effects on ESV. The results of the regression model indicated there were quantitative relationships between ESVs and LPIs, which revealed how landscape pattern affected ESVs. The study can provide a scientific reference for the optimization of urban landscape patterns and urban and rural sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Achieving sustainable development is an issue of global concern. Accounting for the gross ecosystem product (GEP) value can specifically quantify the value of ecosystems for people, which is conducive to the formulation of sustainable eco-management decisions. Multi-source data, including remote sensing images, geospatial data, and statistical bulletin information, were used to quantify the GEP value of material products, regulating services, and cultural services for Fujian Province, China, during 2000-2020. On this basis, the spatio-temporal characteristics of GEP and the coupling relationship between GEP and GDP were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) the value of GEP in Fujian Province increased by 27.9\% from CNY 3589.04 billion in 2000 to CNY 4590.25 billion in 2020. Among the service values, the contribution rate of regulating services to GEP was always the highest during the study period. (2) The spatial distribution pattern of GEP in Fujian Province was higher in the west and lower in the east. Comparing prefecture-level cities, Nanping maintained its GEP at the maximum value level over the past 21 years, while Xiamen and Putian maintained their GEP at the minimum value level. (3) GDP grew faster relative to GEP over the past 21 years, and the difference between GEP and GDP decreased. GEP had a long-term positive effect on GDP, while GDP had a smaller effect on GEP in the short term. The research was not only enriched in relation to GEP accounting, but also the policy recommendations for improving the mechanisms related to the optimization of sustainable development goals have some practical significance.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal variations of ecosystem service values in response to land use/cover change in Luoyang city},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Land-use/cover change (LUCC) caused by human activities is an important factor in changes in global ecosystems; however, the impact of LUCC on ecosystem service value (ESV) has never been previously assessed in Luoyang City, China. This paper explores spatial and temporal evolution patterns of land use pattern change, ESV change and response to LUCC in Luoyang City from 2010 to 2019 through GIS and remote sensing techniques, and employing transfer matrix, ESV spatial autocorrelation analysis and elastic coefficient change. During the study period: 1) Between 2010 and 2019, land-use changes in Luoyang City showed a trend of ``two increases and four decreases, `` specifically, built-up land and forest areas increased, while the extent of cropland, grassland, water, and unused land areas decreased. 2) The recorded land-use conversion in Luoyang City is complex, with forest and cropland land uses increasing and decreasing fastest, respectively, with the proportion of forest increasing by 10.19\% and cropland decreasing by 3.37\% - the reason for this change is the transition from cropland and grassland to forest and occupation of cropland by built-up land. 3) The ESV change in Luoyang City was U-shaped, with the total ESV increasing 1.96\% from yen 44.78 billion to yen 45.66 billion; additionally, the ESV provided by forest areas increased by 23.83\%. 4) From 2010 to 2019, Luoyang's hydrological regulation, climate regulation and soil and water conservation contributed the most to Luoyang's ESV, accounting for 63.89\% of the total ESV in 2019. 5) The overall ESVs of the townships in Luoyang City have obvious clustering and are not completely randomly spatially distributed. With the optimization of land-use allocation, the ESV high-high clusters have expanded. 6) The overall elasticity coefficient is high in Luoyang City and ESV responds intensely to LUCC, with the most significant response shown by the forests of Luolong District. The findings of this survey are practical for helping Luoyang City to optimize land resource usage scientifically.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion is a serious threat to agricultural and water resources projects. The environmental problems are also enhanced due to sever soil erosion at the catchment as well as the agricultural lands. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are efficient tools for assessment and management of soil erosion for larger catchments. In this study, Morgan approach was integrated with GIS and RS for estimation of soil loss of Soan river basin. The GIS maps were generated for the rainfall intensity, kinetic energy, overland flow and soil erosion. The results showed that annual average soil loss for Soan river basin was 3541 tons km(-2) year The barren land had the highest value of soil loss i.e. 6341 tons km(-2) year(-1) whereas the cropped land had the lowest soil loss of 1876 tons km(-2) year(-1)},

Abstract = {Seagrasses are marine flowering plants, which form extensive meadows in intertidal and shallow water marine environments. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services, which directly or indirectly benefit humans and can be grouped into four broad categories: provisioning (e.g. food production); regulating (e.g. carbon sequestration); supporting (e.g. primary production); and cultural (e.g. recreational, and eco-tourism). This study provides a review of publications focusing on seagrass ecosystem services provision to identify knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the use of these habitats as nature-based solutions to societal challenges, such as climate change. Results showed that some ecosystem services, namely food provision, carbon sequestration, and maintenance of biodiversity/nursery habitats receive a higher level of focus and attention than others, such as regulation of diseases and social relations, which are rarely, if ever, included in studies. It is clear that in order to fully comprehend the nature-based solution potential held by seagrass ecosystems, studies need to consider ecosystem services as a whole, and also combine and share results across global regions, to better understand the potential impacts of degradation and loss of these ecosystems worldwide. Suggestions include applying novel technologies such as remote sensing and ecological niche modelling to address some of the main gaps in seagrass research, like meadow extent and connectivity within landscapes, to better incorporate preservation of seagrass ecosystems in marine management plans.},

Title = {Disaggregating County-Level Census Data for Population Mapping Using Residential Geo-Objects With Multisource Geo-Spatial Data},

Abstract = {Accurate spatialization of socioeconomic data is conducive to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of human social development status and, thus, effectively support future scientific decision-making. This study focuses on population mapping, which is a classical spatialization of macroeconomic data of the social economy. Traditional population mapping based on rough grids or administrative divisions such as townships often has deficiencies in the accuracy of spatial pattern and prediction. In this article, hence, we employ residential geo-objects as basic mapping units and formalize the problem as a spatial prediction process using machine-learning (ML) methods with high-spatial-resolution (HSR) satellite remote sensing images and multisource geospatial data. The indicators of population spatial density, including residential geo-objects' area, building existence index, terrain slope, night light intensity, density of point of interest (POI) and road network from Internet electronic maps, and locational factors such as the distances from road and river, are jointly applied to establish the relationship between these multivariable factors and quantitative index of population density using ML algorithms such as Random Forests and XGBoost. The predicated values of population density from the mined nonlinear regression relation are further used to calculate the weights of disaggregation of each unit, and then the population quantity distribution at the scale of residential geo-objects is obtained under the control of the total amount of population statistics. Experiments with a county area show that the methodology has the ability to achieve better results than the traditional deterministic methods by reproducing a more accurate and finer geographic population distribution pattern. Meanwhile, it is found that the optimization of mapping results may benefit from the multisources geospatial data, and thus the methodological framework can be recommended to be extended to other spatialization areas of socioeconomic data.},

Title = {Evaluating Seasonal Wildfire Susceptibility and Wildfire Threats to Local Ecosystems in the Largest Forested Area of China},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The frequent occurrence of wildfires presents a serious threat to human livelihoods and local ecosystems. The use of machine learning (ML) methods to assess wildfire susceptibility can provide decision support for disaster prevention. However, most current ML-based wildfire susceptibility assessments overly focus on spatially evaluating the disaster threat, while ignoring the potential threats of wildfires to local ecosystems. This situation makes it difficult to determine seasonal variations in wildfire susceptibility and limits the value of assessment results. We present a framework to assess wildfire susceptibility and wildfire threats seasonally to local ecosystems. The ecosystem service value (ESV) was used as a proxy for the economic value of an ecosystem, the random forest algorithm was used to evaluate wildfire susceptibility, and the Daxinganling region, the largest forested area in China, was selected as the study area, and the dynamic equivalent coefficient factor method was used to calculate the ESV of each cell. Our main findings were as follows: (a) wildfire susceptibility exhibited obvious disparities in terms of spatial distribution across the four seasons; (b) each ecosystem in the study area faced a different magnitude of wildfire disturbance; and (c) the expected ESV loss (USD 10.8 billion) due to wildfires was much higher than the region's total GDP (USD 2 billion) in 2019. This study was repeatable, and all data required were obtained freely. The methodologies used can be applied directly to other regions. Our study will be of particular interest to developing counties where intensive wildfire monitoring is limited.},

Abstract = {Satellite precipitation products, as all quantitative estimates, come with some inherent degree of uncertainty. To associate a quantitative value of the uncertainty to each individual estimate, error modeling is necessary. Most of the error models proposed so far compute the uncertainty as a function of precipitation intensity only, and only at one specific spatiotemporal scale. We propose a spectral error model that accounts for the neighboring space-time dynamics of precipitation into the uncertainty quantification. Systematic distortions of the precipitation signal and random errors are characterized distinctively in every frequency-wavenumber band in the Fourier domain, to accurately characterize error across scales. The systematic distortions are represented as a deterministic space-time linear filtering term. The random errors are represented as a nonstationary additive noise. The spectral error model is applied to the IMERG multisatellite precipitation product, and its parameters are estimated empirically through a system identification approach using the GV-MRMS gauge-radar measurements as reference ({''}truth{''}) over the eastern United States. The filtering term is found to be essentially low-pass (attenuating the fine-scale variability). While traditional error models attribute most of the error variance to random errors, it is found here that the systematic filtering term explains 48\% of the error variance at the native resolution of IMERG. This fact confirms that, at high resolution, filtering effects in satellite precipitation products cannot be ignored, and that the error cannot be represented as a purely random additive or multiplicative term. An important consequence is that precipitation estimates derived from different sources shall not be expected to automatically have statistically independent errors. Significance StatementSatellite precipitation products are nowadays widely used for climate and environmental research, water management, risk analysis, and decision support at the local, regional, and global scales. For all these applications, knowledge about the accuracy of the products is critical for their usability. However, products are not systematically provided with a quantitative measure of the uncertainty associated with each individual estimate. Various parametric error models have been proposed for uncertainty quantification, mostly assuming that the uncertainty is only a function of the precipitation intensity at the pixel and time of interest. By projecting satellite precipitation fields and their retrieval errors into the Fourier frequency-wavenumber domain, we show that we can explicitly take into account the neighboring space-time multiscale dynamics of precipitation and compute a scale-dependent uncertainty.},

Title = {Using high-spatiotemporal thermal satellite ET retrievals to monitor water use over California vineyards of different climate, vine variety and trellis design},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Mapping the spatial variability of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) across vineyards is useful for optimizing irrigation scheduling and efficiency, leading to conservation of water resources and more sustainable wine grape production. To support efficient irrigation strategies, we investigate the utility of thermal infrared-based ETa maps over a range of vineyards located throughout California, each representing a unique local climate, trellis design, grape variety, row orientation and management practice. ETa maps are derived by combining the Disaggregated Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI/DisALEXI) surface energy balance model and the Spatial Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to generate ETa estimates at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolution. Model output is evaluated for years 2017 and 2018 over vineyard sites located in Sonoma, Sacramento, and Madera counties in California that are being monitored as part of the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). Overall, modeled daily ET estimates compare well with flux tower observations, with average root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 0.88 mm day(-1), 0.70 mm day(-1), and 0.17 mm day(-1) respectively, over all four individual vineyard locations, aligning with past GRAPEX studies. Despite general agreement, record wildfires in northern California during 2018 likely resulted in positive model bias, while misrepresentation of leaf area index within a double-trellis designed canopy at the southern-most vineyard resulted in negative model bias. Spatial analysis of monthly total ET highlights the advantages of utilizing a satellite-based approach to characterize the variability in water use within and surrounding the targeted vineyards. A reliable spatial ET product at scale has the potential to improve water allocation and conservation efforts by identifying areas of uneven water use due to variations in soil texture and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors.},

Title = {Using satellite remote sensing to improve the prediction of scallop condition in their natural environment: Case study for Georges Bank, Canada},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {254},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The continuous, synoptical and high spatio-temporal resolution of thermal and visible satellite observations constitute an asset when characterizing and monitoring biogeochemical cycles in the oceans. In particular, they provide a unique insight into the hydrodynamics of the surface ocean and phytoplankton phenology. This information can be combined with in-situ observations of higher trophic levels to understand the functioning of the marine ecosystem, with potential use for fisheries and aquaculture. In the Gulf of Maine, off the eastern seaboard of North America, Georges Bank is one of the world's most productive natural sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fisheries, which sustains economically valuable fisheries in Canada and the US. In Canada, the relationship between the scallop meat weight and its shell height (known as scallop condition) is used to obtain biomass estimates for stock assessment and thereby influences the fishing quotas. On Georges Bank, for a 100 mm shell height scallop, scallop condition has varied significantly interannually between 10.2 g and 19.5 g. Establishing a relationship between environmental factors and scallop condition would improve the forecasting of scallop biomass and reduce the uncertainty when determining the total allowable catch for the subsequent fishing season. In this study, satellite remote-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chia) coupled with in-situ measurements of scallop condition (SC) on Georges Bank were used to assess the relationship between SC and satellite-derived environmental conditions between 1985 and 2019 for SST and between 1998 and 2019 for Chla. The inter-annual variation of SC in May was found to be positively correlated (p-value <0.001) with the variation in SST in winter-spring months of the current and previous year of the SC survey. An empirical linear model for the estimation of SC was developed and validated using two independent datasets of satellite SST (r(2) = 0.64, MAPD = 7\%). Another model using cumulative SST in the previous year only was also provided (r(2) = 0.58, MAPD = 7.7\%), which could serve as an alternative choice when the SST products in the current year are not yet available for use. There was a weak relationship observed between SC and Chla; this is likely due to the influence of water-column vertical mixing on transport of phytoplankton to the benthic zone where the sea scallop resides. Our study indicates that a cost-effective satellite-derived SST product can be used to improve predictions of SC and provide useful information and decision support tools for managing scallop stocks.},

Abstract = {A number of decision support tools used in agriculture for the management of crops production are based on GIS or remote sensing data interfaced with agronomic models {[}1]. One of their fundamental advantages is to take into account the geographic heterogeneity of the environmental growth conditions. The total available water capacity of the soil (TAWC) is one of the determining factors in the crop growth. It depends on the soil depth and soil physical characteristics: the soil water content at permanent wilting point and at field capacity. The computation of this parameter from laboratory and/or field measurements for large regions is often far beyond the means of agricultural sector stakeholders in emerging countries. We developed a simple and robust technique to estimate this parameter from optical satellite images and a dynamic semi-mechanistic crop growth model. The methodology is based on the inversion of sugarcane crop growth simulations made with the MOSICAS model and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values extracted from SPOT images. We applied the technique on a sugarcane-growing area of Reunion Island, a volcanic island located in the Indian Ocean with semi-tropical climate. We selected the sugarcane fields of a large farm on the north coast, ranging from 30m to 200m of altitude and resting on brown-reddish ferralitic soils and andic soils with different depths. We collected the farming data of these fields in 2000, 2007 and 2008, corresponding to: 1-available satellites images for this area and 2-relatively dry years so that the crop growth strongly depends on the soil water retention capacity. We chose the period of the images so that the vegetation is at its full development. We configured each of the fields in the MOSICAS model (planting dates, weather data, inter-row spacing, etc.) and simulated the radiation interception efficiency (IE) of the crop at the dates of the images. We iterated the computations for different TAWC values input in the model, ranging from 50 to 200mm, for each field, in order to establish charts of IE-TAWC relations. The satellite images provided NDVI values translated into IE values via a linear empirical equation, for each of the fields. The TAWC value for each field was obtained by direct reading on the corresponding chart. The results show a good agreement with bibliographic values on one hand and between-year TAWC values on the other hand. Moreover they show no influence of the sugarcane variety. This methodology can thus be considered as a very robust and cheap TAWC estimation technique, suitable for large agricultural areas, provided that 1 - a crop growth model is available for the cultivated crop in the area, 2 - production and remote sensing data are available for a couple of years. It would be interesting to test and generalize this technique with other crop models.},

Title = {The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions ``on the ground{''} more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) from applying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.},

Abstract = {Flooding is the most dangerous of all environmental hazards and leads to significant impacts both on the environment and on human life. Environmental protection and water management can be achieved by modeling flood susceptibility, to inform strategy that will reduce flood damage. The aim of this study is to develop novel hybrid models based on a radial basis functions neural network (RBFNN), arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and ant lion optimizer (ALO), to build flood susceptibility maps in the Quang Tri province of Vietnam. The obtained models were trained and validated using 1511 flood points and 14 conditioning factors. Various statistical indices were used to assess the performance of the models, namely root mean square error, receiver operation characteristics (ROC), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The comparison analysis highlights that the RBFNN-ABC model was better than other models with an AUC of 0.98, followed by RBFNN-AOA, support vector machine, and random forest, all with an AUC value of 0.96, and finally RBFNN-ALO, with an AUC of 0.95. From the flood susceptibility map, it can be seen that the eastern areas of the study area have high and very high flood susceptibility, that requires local government attention. The approach and results of this study can support national and local authorities, decision-makers, and other planners in the construction of appropriate strategies to reduce potential damage in the future.},

Abstract = {With the increasing demand for geostationary satellites services, all efforts are being made to minimize the cost of the entire geo-satellite system. On-orbit refuelling of geo-satellites is one of the ways to achieve this. In this regard a geo-refuelling system utilising multiple refueller satellites for on-orbit refuelling using current capabilities of satellites and launchers of ISRO is configured. For this initially an economic feasibility study was carried out based on unit telecommunication cost of refuelled and conventional geo satellites. The study was able to identify the main parameters of a regularly refuelled geo-satellite fleet which dictate its economic feasibility. For a geo-satellite fleet with refuelling, various fleet combinations are possible with the four different categories of satellites viz, I1k, I2k, I3k, I4k and with multiple refuellers. All such possible combinations of refuellers and refuelled satellites are explored and combinations which provide desirable profitability are narrowed down for further selection. Two notional mission scenarios are identified and suitable satellite categories and combinations for each scenario is identified which provide economic viability.},

Title = {Underground Water Level Prediction in Remote Sensing Images Using Improved Hydro Index Value with Ensemble Classifier},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The economic sustainability of aquifers across the world relies on accurate and rapid estimates of groundwater storage changes, but this becomes difficult due to the absence of in-situ groundwater surveys in most areas. By closing the water balance, hydrologic remote sensing measures offer a possible method for quantifying changes in groundwater storage. However, it is uncertain to what extent remote sensing data can provide an accurate assessment of these changes. Therefore, a new framework is implemented in this work for predicting the underground water level using remote sensing images. Generally, the water level is defined into five levels: Critical, Overexploited, Safe, Saline, and Semi-critical, based on water quantity. In this manuscript, the remote sensing images were acquired from remote sensing images. At first, Wiener filtering was employed for preprocessing. Secondly, the Vegetation Indexes (VI) (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Infrared index (IRI), Radar Vegetation Index (RVI)), and statistical features (entropy, Root Mean Square (RMS), Skewness, and Kurtosis) were extracted from the preprocessed remote sensing images. Then, the extracted features were combined as a novel hydro index, which was fed to the Ensemble Classifier (EC): Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models for underground water level prediction in the remote sensing images. The obtained results prove the efficacy of the proposed framework by using different performance measures. The results shows that the False Positive Rate (FPR) of the proposed EC model is 0.0083, which is better than that of existing methods. On the other hand, the proposed EC model has a high accuracy of 0.90, which is superior to the existing traditional models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU).},

Abstract = {Soil erosion constitute a major threat to human lives and assets worldwide, as well as a major environmental disturbance. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with Geographical Information System (GIS) has been the most widely used model in predicting and mapping soil erosion loss. Remote sensing has particular utility for soil loss model applications, providing observations on several key aspects of Land use and Land cover (LULC) linked to the cover-management factor C of the RUSLE, over wide areas and in consistent and repeatable measurements. A free and open source GIS application coupled with remote sensing data was developed under QGIS software allowing to improve the C factor functionality: (i) automatically download satellite images; (ii) clip with the study case and; (ii) perform a supervised or unsupervised classification, in order to obtain the land cover classification and produce the final C map. One of the most efficient supervised classification algorithms is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Random Forest (RF) is also an easy-to-use machine learning algorithm for supervised classification. The automation of this functionality was based in the R and SAGA software, both integrated in QGIS. To perform the supervised classification, SVM and RF methods were incorporated. The overall accuracy and Kappa values are also automatically obtained by the R script and GRASS algorithms, which allows to evaluate the result obtained. To perform the unsupervised classification K-means algorithm from SAGA was used. This updating in RUSLE application improve the results obtained for C factor and help us to obtain a most accurate estimation of RUSLE erosion risk map. The application was tested using Sentinel 2A images in two different periods, after and before the forest fire event in Coimbra region, Portugal. In the end, the three resulted maps from SVM, RF and K-means classification were compared.},

Title = {The value of hydrologic information for watershed management programs: The case of Camboriu, Brazil},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {705},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Investments in watershed services programs hold the promise to protect and restore ecosystems and water resources. The design and implementation of such programs is often accompanied by hydrologic modeling and monitoring, although the role of hydrologic information in meeting the needs of program managers remains undear. In the Camboriit watershed, Brazil, we explored the value of hydrologic modeling and monitoring with respect to two dimensions: scientific credibility and use of generated knowledge in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the watershed management program. We used a combination of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and hydrologic modeling under various levels of data availability to examine when improved models and data availability might build credibility and provide more useful information for decision makers. We found that hydrologic information was not actually used for the detailed design, but rather contributed to broad-scale support of the program by increasing scientific credibility. Model sophistication and data availability improved the credibility of hydrologic information but did not affect actual decisions related to program design. Hydrologic monitoring data were critical for model calibration, and high-resolution land use and land cover data, obtained via remote sensing, affected some model outputs which were not used to design the program. Our study suggests that identifying how hydrologic data will inform decision making should guide the level of effort used in hydrologic modeling and monitoring. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {Mapping Aquaculture Ponds for the Coastal Zone of Asia with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Asia dominates the world's aquaculture sector, generating almost 90 percent of its total annual global production. Fish, shrimp, and mollusks are mainly farmed in land-based pond aquaculture systems and serve as a primary protein source for millions of people. The total production and area occupied for pond aquaculture has expanded rapidly in coastal regions in Asia since the early 1990s. The growth of aquaculture was mainly boosted by an increasing demand for fish and seafood from a growing world population. The aquaculture sector generates income and employment, contributes to food security, and has become a billion-dollar industry with high socio-economic value, but has also led to severe environmental degradation. In this regard, geospatial information on aquaculture can support the management of this growing food sector for the sustainable development of coastal ecosystems, resources, and human health. With free and open access to the rapidly growing volume of data from the Copernicus Sentinel missions as well as machine learning algorithms and cloud computing services, we extracted coastal aquaculture at a continental scale. We present a multi-sensor approach that utilizes Earth observation time series data for the mapping of pond aquaculture within the entire Asian coastal zone, defined as the onshore area up to 200 km from the coastline. In this research, we developed an object-based framework to detect and extract aquaculture at a single-pond level based on temporal features derived from high-spatial-resolution SAR and optical satellite data acquired from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. In a second step, we performed spatial and statistical data analyses of the Earth-observation-derived aquaculture dataset to investigate spatial distribution and identify production hotspots at various administrative units at regional, national, and sub-national scale.},

Abstract = {Rainwater harvesting (RWH) structure is considered as the best solution to conserve water for arid regions. The selection of RWH location is based on several key determinants such as hydrology, environment, topography, and socio-economic. This study proposed a robust methodology to identify and select the location of RWH using geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) with multi-criteria decision techniques in areas where data are scarce. Several thematic maps were extracted such as vegetation cover, soil group, slope, land use, and digital elevation (DEM). The RWH sites were ranked based on four major indexes: evaporation, cost-benefit, sediment, and hydrological index. Sensitivity analysis shows that the variance inverse (VI) and rank order method (ROM) considered all indices that effect ranking as compared to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-AHP. Sensitivity analysis also proved that the proposed method is suitable to be used for RWH site selection in arid regions.},

Title = {Convolutional Neural Network Maps Plant Communities in Semi-Natural Grasslands Using Multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Semi-natural grasslands (SNGs) are an essential part of European cultural landscapes. They are an important habitat for many animal and plant species and offer a variety of ecological functions. Diverse plant communities have evolved over time depending on environmental and management factors in grasslands. These different plant communities offer multiple ecosystem services and also have an effect on the forage value of fodder for domestic livestock. However, with increasing intensification in agriculture and the loss of SNGs, the biodiversity of grasslands continues to decline. In this paper, we present a method to spatially classify plant communities in grasslands in order to identify and map plant communities and weed species that occur in a semi-natural meadow. For this, high-resolution multispectral remote sensing data were captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in regular intervals and classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). As the study area, a heterogeneous semi-natural hay meadow with first- and second-growth vegetation was chosen. Botanical releves of fixed plots were used as ground truth and independent test data. Accuracies up to 88\% on these independent test data were achieved, showing the great potential of the usage of CNNs for plant community mapping in high-resolution UAV data for ecological and agricultural applications.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mangroves provide numerous ecosystem services to humanity and yet remain some of the most undervalued and poorly treated ecosystems in the world. Mangroves are distributed in the land-sea interphase of tropical and subtropical coasts in 123 countries. Up until two decades ago, scholars have focused on the provisioning, supporting, and cultural services associated with mangroves, but recent efforts have pivoted towards mangroves role in regulating the global carbon cycle. Today, it is established that mangroves sequester 50 times more carbon than tropical forests, with strong indications that mangroves are the missing carbon sink. Despite their importance, mangroves remain under threat from human activities, and action is required to protect them. This paper provides an overview of the importance of mangroves to humanity, their role in carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, and highlights the threats they continue to face across their range.},

Title = {Application of fuzzy models for the monitoring of ecologically sensitive ecosystems in a dynamic semi-arid landscape from satellite imagery},
Journal = {ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {5-19},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better understand landscape dynamics in arid and semiarid environments. Land degradation has recently become an important issue for land management in western China. The oasis ecosystem is especially sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as abnormal/extreme precipitation events, variations in the water supply from the upper watersheds, fluctuations in temperature, etc. Satellite remote sensing of terrestrial ecosystems can provide us with the temporal dynamics and spatial distributions of green cover over large areas of landscape. Seasonal green cover data are especially important in assessing landscape health (e.g. desertification, rate of urban sprawl, natural disturbances) in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, green cover data are derived from vegetation indices retrieved from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MOD'S) sensors onboard the satellite Terra. Design/methodology/approach - Satellite images recorded during the period from April 2000 to December 2005 are analyzed and the spatial distribution and temporal changes of the Ejin Oasis quantified. Findings - This study shows that it is possible to derive important parameters linked to landscape sensitivity from MODIS and the derived imagery, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data. Such a MODIS-based time-series monitoring system is particularly useful in arid and semi-arid environments. The results of landscape sensitivity analysis prove the effectiveness of the method in assessing landscape sensitivity from the years 2001-2005. Practical implications - The novel strategy used in this investigation is based on the T-S fuzzy model, which is in turn based on fuzzy theory and fuzzy operations. Originality/value - Simulation results based on fuzzy models will help to improve the monitoring techniques used to evaluate land degradation and to estimate the newest tendency in landscape green cover dynamics in the Ejin Oasis.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To evaluate the status of biodiversity and to determine how current conservation efforts can be improved, biodiversity monitoring is crucial. An important aspect of data quality lies in its spatial resolution. It is unclear how finer scale land cover and land value information might further benefit biodiversity conservation. This paper aimed to assess the impacts of scale by modelling the conservation of endangered European wetland species and their corresponding habitats. Fine-scale datasets were derived by integrating existing geographical, biophysical and economic data. A habitat allocation model, based on principles from systematic conservation planning and economic theory, was developed to estimate area requirements and opportunity costs of habitat protection in Europe. Coarse-scale and fine-scale simulations were compared by inputting both resolutions into the model. Habitat locations were restricted either only by historical species occurrence data at UTM 50 resolution or additionally by explicit wetland data at 1-km(2) resolution. Coarse country-average land rents were contrasted with spatially detailed land rent estimates at a 5' resolution. Costs of habitat protection and area requirements for reserves may be severely underestimated when conservation planning relies only on coarse-scale data, which may result in notable shortcomings in conservation target achievement. Improvements in conservation benefits far outweigh the additional costs of acquiring fine-scale data.},

Abstract = {One of the major accompaniments of the globalization is the rapid growth of urban areas. Whereas at the end of the 1970th only 38\% of people lived in cities, this number increased up to 50\% in 2008. In 2030 two third of all people worldwide are expected to live in cities (United Nations, 2008). Urban sprawl is a major environmental concern affecting these cities and urban regions across different continents. Besides a quantitative reduction of land consumption, sustainable handling of the limited resource land and smart growth are acknowledged as key tasks for urban planning (Patacchini and Zenou, 2009, Siedentop, 2005). Coping with these tasks requires precise and adaptive planning instruments. The study is part of the GAUS-project (Gaining additional urban space (GAUS) - Detection and valuation of potential areas for inner urban development with remote sensing and GIS). This study is dedicated to the development of a Multi-criteria Decision Support System (MDSS) as a tool for supporting the municipal management authorities with regard to urban consolidation and smart growth. The presented classification framework aims at feeding the MDSS with up-to-date land use and land cover (LULC) information. This work deals with the strategy and workflow (data, preprocessing, classification processes, accuracy assessment) towards a semi-automated LULC classification of urban areas, following an object-oriented approach. Furthermore, an overall goal of this work is to figure out generic methods and strategies towards LULC classification with very high resolution (VHR) optical data to ensure robustness and transferability, which are crucial preconditions in order to automate processes. Different QuickBird and Ikonos scenes of the Ruhr Area (Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany) and Berlin (Germany) allow to consider potential variabilities of the input data (spatial resolution, seasonal effects, plurality of LULC occurances) when developing the framework for the classification.},

Abstract = {The global ecosystem has been significantly disrupted on various spatiotemporal scales over the last three decades due to human activities. Geospatial technology can quickly, effectively, and quantitatively to evaluate the spatiotemporal change of eco-environmental quality (EEQ). The present study is focused on novel approach of Remote Sensing based Ecological Index (RSEI), using Landsat Imagery data to assess environmental conditions and changes pattern. Four ecological indicators were prepared in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 of Kolkata urban agglomeration (KUA) to evaluate the ecological environmental condition. The principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial autocorrelation analysis can relate all indicators with each other's and RSEI. Out study indicated, greenness and wetness have a positive effect on EEQ of the province, but both dryness and heat have a negative effect. However, it should be noted that greenness has a greater impact on the eco-environment than the other three indicators. Based on the RSEI values, we have categorized the environmental standards of the study area into four groups-very good (0.81-1.00), good (0.61-0.80), acceptable (0.41-0.60), poor (0.21-0.40), and very poor (0.00-0.20), where high values indicate that environmental quality is stable and healthy for living organisms and low values indicate relatively unstable and threatening conditions of the environment. The status of RSEI showed that 9.02\%, 12.29\%, 12.79\% and 37.23\% of an area was under poor to very poor condition in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. Good to very good condition of RSEI values was increased from 19.12\% to 34.074\% during 1990 to 2010, but declined of RSEI value 9.47\% during 2010 to 2020 due to urban expansion. Here, Moran's I values fund that 0.265, 0.543, 0.396 and 0.367 in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. The result of Moran's I values indicate that clustering nature. The present study can helpful for the decision making of ecological management guided by planners and policy makers.},

Abstract = {Urban estuaries are dynamic environments that hold high ecological and economic value. Yet, their optical complexity hinders accurate satellite retrievals of important biogeochemical variables, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) biomass. Approaches based on a limited number of satellite spectral bands often fail to capture seasonal transitions and sharp spatial gradients in estuarine Chl-a concentrations, inhibiting integration of satellite data into water quality monitoring and conservation programs. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the wide range of spectral information captured by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) to retrieve estuarine Chl-a. To validate our approach, we used measurements in Long Island Sound (LIS), a highly urbanized estuary increasingly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors and climate change. Hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and Chl-a data representing the spatiotemporal diversity of LIS were used to assess the ideal atmospheric correction approach for OLCI and develop a multi-spectral multiple linear regression (MS-MLR) Chl-a algorithm. POLYMER derived Rrs proved to be the preferred atmospheric correction approach. Evaluation of MS-MLR performance in retrieving Chl-a with in situ Rrs showed good agreement with field measurements. Application to OLCI-retrieved Rrs showed significant improvement (20\%-30\%) in common error metrics relative to other algorithms assessed. The MS-MLR approach successfully captured seasonal cycles and spatial gradients in Chl-a concentration. Application of this method to urban estuaries and coasts enables accurate, high resolution Chl-a observations at the ecosystem scale and across a range of conditions, as needed for conservation and ecosystem management efforts.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to develop a model for the real-time estimation of local level income data by combining machine learning, Earth Observation, and Geographic Information System. More exactly, we estimated the income per capita by help of a machine learning model for 46 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, based on the National Polar-orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) nighttime satellite images from 2012-2018. For the automation of calculation, a new ModelBuilder type tool was developed within the ArcGIS software called EO-Incity (Earth Observation-Income city). The sum of light (SOL) data extracted by means of the EO-Incity tool and the observed income data were integrated in an algorithm within the MATLAB software in order to calculate a transfer equation and the average error. The results achieved were subsequently reintegrated in EO-Incity and used for the estimation of the income value at local level. The regression analyses highlighted a stable and strong relationship between SOL and income for the analyzed cities. The EO-Incity tool and the machine learning model proved to be efficient in the real-time estimation of the income at local level. When integrated in the information systems specific for smart cities, they can serve as a support for decision-making in order to fight poverty and reduce social inequalities.},

Title = {Where and why to conserve grasslands socio-ecosystems? A spatially explicit participative approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Grasslands of southern South America are being replaced by annual crops and forest plantations. The environmental and social consequences of this expansion generate the need for its regulation. If a conservation policy were established, it would be critical to define which areas would have priority for conservation. Multi-criteria analysis techniques are useful tools in territorial planning processes since they allow incorporating diverse and even opposing opinions and objectives. We present a methodological approach to define the Grasslands' Conservation Value (GCV) from a spatially explicit territorial diagnosis, based on multiple criteria and incorporating explicitly and quantitatively the valuations and opinions of stakeholders. The study was developed as part of the strategy of a public inter-institutional entity to contribute in defining grasslands conservation policies. The methodological approach included workshops in which the definitions of the conservation criteria and their weighting were agreed upon. Definitions were based on a multidimensional technical characterization of the territory through indicators, for which the information used was compiled, analyzed, shared, and synthesized. Based on multi-criteria analysis, each of 12 stakeholders' groups representatives established the individual weighting of the criteria for determining the GCV and then, established a consensus weighting. The GCV was mapped by integrating territorial diagnosis of these criteria with the weightings carried out by the stakeholders. The degree of agreement among stakeholders in the differential valuation of the ecological criteria was high for 8 of the 12 stakeholders (Pearson's correlation coefficients > 0.92), showing a high agreement between their opinions and those resulting from the group consensus. In all cases, the agreement about the spatial variation of conservation value was higher than on the criteria weights (Pearson's correlation coefficients >= 0.92 for 10 stakeholders). Furthermore, the sites with lower values in the consensus map corresponded mostly to those sites with lower agreement among stakeholders. The proposed methodology allowed the incorporation of different perceptions not only in the definition of conservation criteria but also in their prioritization, in a transparent and auditable process. This could contribute to the implementation of future regulations that restrict the replacement of grasslands, increasing the legitimacy of territorial planning processes.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years the mining industry has been a leader in the conception and application of advanced technologies. New thinking about earth tectonics as well as advances in geophysics, geochemistry, remote sensing, data processing and communications permit more effective and accurate geological exploration. Mechanization, more durable materials and more powerful explosives, as well as computer aided mine design and management have led to substantial gains in productivity. Minerals processing has similarly seen significant technological advances including solvent extraction, electro-winning of metal ores, bath smelting techniques, cyanide leach to produce gold, and bioleaching of sulphide and refractory ores. New technologies have dramatically improved mine health and safety as well as making possible control of water and air pollution. Improved communication and transport have stimulated competition and fostered the internationalization of mineral commodity prices. As these technologies are essentially market driven, developing countries should continue current efforts towards economic liberalization. Promoting investment in mining entails lifting many of the restrictions and taxes that can hinder efficient exploration and development. We examine some developments that have greatly increased the efficiency of exploration, mining and marketing. To obtain maximum benefit from many of these technologies requires governments to adopt a wide range of new policies which are examined in some detail.},

Abstract = {Urban quality of life (UQoL) study is very important for many applications such as services distribution, urban planning, and socioeconomic analysis. The objective of this study is to create an urban quality of life index map for Al Ain city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The research aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals number ten (reduce inequalities) and eleven (sustainable cities and communities). In this study, remote sensing images and GIS vector datasets were used to extract biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators. The biophysical indicators are normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), land surface temperature (LST), slope, and land use land cover (LULC). In addition, infrastructure facility indicators such as distances to main roads, parks, schools, and hospitals were obtained. Additional infrastructure facility variables namely built-up to green area and build-up to bare soil area ratio were extracted from the LULC map. Machine learning was used to classify satellite images and generate LULC map. Random Forest (RF) was found as the best machine learning classifier for this study. The overall classification and Kappa hat accuracy was 95.3 and 0.92, respectively. Both biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators were integrated using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA analysis identified four components that explain 75\% of the variance among the indicators. The four factors were interpreted as the effect of LULC, infrastructure facility, ecological, and slope. Finally, the components were assigned weights based on the percentage of variance they explained and developed the UQoL map. Overall, the result showed that greenness has a greater effect on the spatial pattern of UQoL in Al Ain city. The study could be of a value to policy makers in urban planning and socioeconomic departments.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of infrastructure on economic development in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach A panel data analysis approach is utilised to evaluate the influence of various types of infrastructure on economic development in Vietnam over the period 2003-2013. Specifically, this study uses spatial night-light data taken from NASA's satellite as an alternative proxy for economic development. Findings The analyses indicate that infrastructure enhancement consistently exerts a positive effect on the economy. Upon further investigations of the channels through which infrastructure could affect economic development, the empirical results reveal, in addition, that the developmental impact of infrastructure tends to be stronger if more rigorous government supervision and oversight of the construction and delivery of infrastructure projects are in place to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the private sector's investment in infrastructure facilities. Finally, the interaction of infrastructure with human capital appears to exert an especially important influence upon economic development. Originality/value This study contributes to the debate over whether infrastructure has a real developmental effect in developing countries. Some important policy implications are then drawn from the empirical analysis. As a result, this paper will be of value to other researchers, economists, business leaders and policy-makers attempting to understand the economic benefit of infrastructure development.},

Abstract = {Grassland vegetation growth directly reflects plant growth conditions, and growth processes are an important component of ecological status assessments of grasslands and can provide timely guidance for agricultural production. In this study, the Xilingol Grassland in Inner Mongolia was used as the study area, and a monitoring indicator system for the remote sensing of grassland vegetation growth was established based on 16 days of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and ground sampling data, which were used to assess the suitability of the indicator system. A monitoring indicator system for the remote sensing of grassland vegetation that included the modified growth index (MGI)-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), MGI-enhanced vegetation index (EVI), growth index (GI)-NDVI, and GI-EVI was established by using the year 2000 as the base year, two vegetation indices and difference and normalized difference methods. A model for estimating the ground growth (g) was then constructed by using expert opinion scoring and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the weights of vegetation coverage (c), height (h), and yield (y) in the ground plots, with the model calculated as follows: g=0.2543c+0.1848h+0.5609y. Additionally, the ground growth value was calculated according to the ground growth model, and the values obtained from the remote-sensing indicators in the corresponding region were subjected to a correlation analysis based on this partition. The remote-sensing growth indices suitable for temperate steppe, meadow steppe, and desert steppe regions were GI-EVI, MGI-NDVI, and GI-NDVI, respectively. Finally, vegetation growth in the Xilingol Grassland was evaluated using the optimal remote-sensing GI for each area, and the results indicated that the areas with the greatest growth improvement occurred in the temperate steppe region followed by the meadow steppe region, whereas vegetation growth improvement was insignificant in the desert steppe region. The results of this study have important significance for the economic development and ecological environmental improvement of pastoral and semi-pastoral regions and can be used to determine the optimal use and scientific management of grasslands.},

Abstract = {China's economic and social development is severely restricted by regional water deficiency, and the determination of water deficiency level in different regions is an important basis of water resource management. In this study, we zoned 32 provinces of China into five surface water deficiency levels based on surface water deficit index derived from the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-2C images. The result shows that China is facing serious water shortage crisis with only 15.44\% of total area without water deficiency, which is located in the south and southeast coast. More than 60\% of total area of China suffered from severe or extremely water deficiency, which are mainly distributed in western and northern regions. Jingjinji area (namely Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province), which is a special region with high amount of gross domestic product and relative abundant water resources, is suffering from severe water deficiency. It revealed that water resources were interacted with regional development and water management should consider local conditions. To Jingjinji area, water management should focus on adjustment of industrial structure, urban expansion control and scientific water resources allocation. In general, the surface water deficit index based water deficiency zoning will be of significant value to be applied in water resources management at regional scales.},

Abstract = {The present study has tried to develop ecological insecurity model (EIM) in the growing stone quarrying and crushing dominated areas using robust machine learning techniques and attempted to link it with ecosystem service value (ESV). Satellite image-based landscape metrics have been used for developing machine learning-oriented EIM, and the global coefficient of Costanza et al. (Glob Environ Change 26:152-158, 2014) has been used for computing ESV. Field parameter-based ecological insecurity index (EII) has been developed for validating the EIMs along with the statistical methods. Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) revealed that 21.88 to 60.79\% area has predicted as highly ecologically insecure in all the selected four stone quarrying and crushing dominated clusters and this is has inflated from 2000 to 2020. All the applied models are acceptable in terms of their performances, but the RF model is found to be the best representative in relation to EII. It causes considerable loss of ESV which ranges from 160,845.18 US\$ to 757,445.17 US\$ in all the clusters from 2000 to 2020. The findings of the study are useful for ecological management in this area. It further recommends applying such an approach in such similar fields to establish the general finding and provides knowledge to the state of arts.},

Abstract = {As shown in the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), as well as in Chapter 12 of Agenda 21, desertification is one of the world's most serious environmental problems, threatening the earth's fertility and population food security. Desertification is spreading due to climatic causes and human activities.. both those performed in a single area and those performed all over the world (climate change). Some measures can only be taken at a general level, but others have to be taken at regional, national or local level. Combating desertification and the tasks to mitigate the effect of droughts requires an integrated treatment of the physical. biological and socio-economic aspects. Understanding natural, social, cultural, economic and political features of local and national environments, in particular their dynamics and interactions, is considered as one of the basic principles of the Convention to Combat Desertification. Improvement of the knowledge base is widely considered as a necessary first step for addressing the relevant problems and developing appropriate solutions. Many research and data-collection activities are being implemented worldwide, mainly to better understand the state of the natural resources in dry lands areas. Such dry lands cover 40\% of the world's land surface, and are the habitat and source of livelihood for more than one billion people. Of the 5,200 million hectares of dry lands used for agriculture, more than 70\% are suffering from degradation. Africa, Asia, and Latin America are particularly under threat, but some 30 million hectares of European territory, especially those bordering the Mediterranean, are also potentially affected, threatening the livelihoods of over than 16.5 million people. The mind of partnership as inspired by the UNCCD requires flexibility and simplicity in information circulation to all levels of decision: from local to international, and vice versa. The assessment of the current status of desertification in a country is a crucial first step for understanding and correcting the problem. National assessment maps are needed for planners and decision-makers to establish priorities for combating desertification. Considered the cost of the environmental damage caused by land degradation and considered the absence of reliable information, sustainable decisions can hardly be made. Dry land desertification can be remedied or even reversed, if updated information is provided on affected areas; especially concerning land use detection. Satellite images can highlight relevant land use change along with increased surface reflectivity, temperature, dryness and dustiness; infrared sensors can detect vegetation stress due to environmental shifts. This satellite data, if combined with in-situ information, processing tools, models, databases management and geo-information systems (GIS), can create standardized and comparable geo-information products, which can also be used to satisfy UNCCD reporting requirements. Advanced technologies for helping desertification assessment and monitoring, can be of great value: computers, satellite images, GIS and databases management systems have revolutionized natural resource data collection methods. However, these tools do not substitute field studies. Another problem related to gathering data on and lands is the diversity of sources, which influences negatively, and sometimes crucially, the GIS and databases quality. As result, the quality of products used in making decisions, can be more or less useful or erroneous. Therefore a quality control of the natural resources management databases in the and regions becomes a necessity.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Adriatic coast of Northeast Italy is one of the representative areas holding high ecological value in the Mediterranean. In this research, we have monitored the environmental change of coastal wetland in ten studied sites that covered all the Ramsar sites and most of the natural reserves in Northeast Italy from 1984 to 2016. The results show that the coastal wetland environment has been changing associated with a multitude of influential factors, including economic development, reserve initiatives, and sea-level rise, which have been quantitively analyzed for each of the studied wetland sites. The results of the analysis confirm that (1) with robust reservation policy, the landuse of the coastal wetland sites remained generally stable despite the continuous anthropogenic disturbance; (2) wetlands located in the insular area with low elevation are subject to more severe impact from sea-level rise inundation; (3) the continental coastal wetlands in reserve area show the polarization phenomenon which is strengthened by strict reservation policy and contiguous aggressive anthropogenic activities. To protect the insular coastal wetlands and reduce the polarization effects on continental coastal wetlands, more efficient measures should be taken to strengthen and implement the existing reservation directives and regulations actively.},

Abstract = {Purpose The most common methodology to estimate erosivity is using rainfall data obtained from rain monitoring stations. However, the quality of this estimation may be compromised due to low density, operational problems and maintenance cost of rainfall monitoring stations, common problem encountered in developing countries such as Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of pluviometric data obtained by TRMM satellite images for the spatiotemporal characterization of erosivity in the state of Espirito Santo (Brazil). Design/methodology/approach For this, rainfall data and annual and monthly erosivities of 71 rainfall stations were statistically compared with those from TRMM images. Findings For this, rainfall data and annual and monthly erosivities of 71 rainfall stations were statistically compared with those from TRMM images. The estimate proved that TRMM is efficient since the NSE values were higher than 0.70 and the coefficient of determination was higher than 0.77 for monthly and annual erosivities, but in most months and yearly, erosivity was overestimated. Practical implications The use of satellite images to estimate rainfall allowed the spatial representation over time (months) of the oscillating degree of erosivity in the state of Espirito Santo (Brazil). The spatialization may provide an identification of areas and periods in which are essential for the implementation of land use management in order to minimize environmental problems related to soil loss. Originality/value The technique applied may be an alternative to overcome common problems on rainfall monitoring station, such as low density, low data reliability, high manutention and maintenance cost and operational problems.},

Title = {Evaluation of Economic Linkage between Urban Built-Up Areas in a Mid-Sized City of Uyo (Nigeria)},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban growth has transformed many mid-sized cities into metropolitan areas. One of the effects of this growth is a change in urban growth patterns, which are directly linked with household income. Hence, this paper aims to assess the effect of different economic variables that trigger urban built-up patterns, using economic indicators such as city administrative taxes, a socio-economic survey of living standards, household income and satellite data. The regression model was used and adapted, and a case study is presented for the mid-sized city of Uyo in southeastern Nigeria. The result shows sparse built-up growth patterns with numerous adverse effects. Although, there is awareness of the impact of unregulated sparse built-up growth patterns in the literature, little attention has been given to this growth pattern in Africa. The results also show that increases in federal allocation (27\%), investment tax (22\%), direct tax (52\%) and indirect tax (26\%) have led to urban expansion into vegetative land and have a causal correlation with different built-up areas. Hence, medium and high-income earners migrate to suburban areas for bigger living space and a lack of basic social amenities affects the land value in suburban areas. They also assist in the provision of social amenities in the neighborhood.},

Title = {Integration of RUSLE Model, Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Assessing Soil Erosion Hazards in Arid Zones},

Abstract = {Soil erosion constitutes one of the main environmental and food security threats, derived from the loss of its productive capacity. With the help of remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and a revised version of the universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), this research has mostly focused on measuring the potential soil erosion hazard and soil water conservation ratio (SWCR) in the El-Minia region of Egypt. Based on the integration of S2A images and the digital elevation model (DEM), geomorphological units of the study area were identified. The RUSLE model includes parameters that allow for mapping soil erosion, such as rain erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, soil cover and management, and soil conservation practices. The outcomes revealed that the classes of annual erosion rates of the study area are those of ``slight erosion{''}, ``low erosion{''}, ``moderate erosion{''} and ``moderately high erosion{''}, which represent percentages of 29\%, 18\%, 33\% and 20\%, respectively, of the total area. The rate of erosion decreases from east to west. The main erosion factors in the research area are the low vegetation cover and the high slope values. This study highlights the utility of combining the classic RUSLE equation with techniques such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) as a basis for assessing current erosion conditions in arid environments and, specifically, for the application of soil management patterns aimed at increasing soil organic matter and any other soil conservation actions. The findings of this study can be used by policymakers to implement soil conservation measures if development projects are to proceed in areas with a high risk of soil erosion. The approach described here is therefore adaptable to similar environments in arid regions.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world and any alterations might lead to changes in their bio-physical, socio-economic and climatic conditions. Wetland dynamics as an index of land use change were studied. Satellite remote sensing was utilized to understand the periodic and seasonal dynamics of Samaspur wetlands using Landsat and RESOURCESAT-1 temporal data. Index-based (i.e., Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) classification resulted in meaningful discrimination of wetland classes. Results indicate (i) effective water spread areas have increased to optimum capacity at 1990 due to the influence of Sharda canal, (ii) expansion of the agricultural area has led to reduction of the wetland buffer area, and (iii) increase in vegetation biomass due to pesticide-fertilizer runoff and sedimentation load. We also reiterate (i) free availability of the Landsat satellite data in public domain facilitating such monitoring studies and (ii) availability and utility of SWIR band information in wetland classification exercise. The study concludes that policy-driven measures have both long and short term impacts on land use and its natural wetland ecosystems; and the characterizing the later serves as indictor of the former and perhaps vice versa.},

Title = {Robust geographical detector},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Geographical detector (GD) is a method to measure spatial associations using a power of determinant (PD) value that compares the variance of data within spatial zones and in the whole study area. Recent studies have implemented GD in diverse fields, such as environmental and socio-economic issues. Spatial data discretization is an essential stage for determining zones using explanatory variables. However, the spatial data discretization process has been sensitive to the GD results. To address this issue, this article proposes a Robust Geographical Detector (RGD) to overcome the limitations of the sensitivity in spatial data discretization and estimate robust PD values of explanatory variables using a B-value. The RGD determines spatial zones with numerical interval breaks using an optimization algorithm of variance-based change point detection. In this study, RGD is implemented in a nationwide case study exploring potential factors of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) density in industrial regions across Australia, where data on both NO2 and potential factors are sourced from satellite images and remote sensing products using Google Earth Engine. Results show that RGD can effectively explore the maximum PD values of spatial associations between response and explanatory variables due to the optimization algorithm-based spatial zones. In addition, RGD-based PD values are generally higher, more robust, and more stable than GD-based PD values since RGD can guarantee the increment of PD values with the increase of interval numbers, which is a challenge in previous GD models. Finally, RGD could provide a more reliable interpretation of PD as RGD finds optimal intervals-based spatial zones determined by potential factors. This study demonstrates that the developed RGD model can provide robust and reliable solutions to explore spatial associations and identify geographical factors.},

Title = {Exploring the potential role of environmental and multi-source satellite data in crop yield prediction across Northeast China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {815},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Developing an accurate crop yield predicting system at a large scale is of paramount importance for agricultural resource management and global food security. Earth observation provides a unique source of information to monitor crops from a diversity of spectral ranges. However, the integrated use of these data and their values in crop yield prediction is still understudied. Here we proposed the combination of environmental data (climate, soil, geography, and topography) with multiple satellite data (optical-based vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature (LST), and microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)) into the framework to estimate crop yield for maize, rice, and soybean in northeast China, and their unique value and relative influence on yield prediction was assessed. Two linear regression methods, three machine learning (ML) methods, and one ML ensemble model were adopted to build yield prediction models. Results showed that the individual ML methods outperformed the linear regression methods, the ML ensemble model further improved the single ML models. Moreover, models with more inputs achieved better performance, the combination of satellite data with environmental data, which explained 72\%, 69\%, and 57\% of maize, rice, and soybean yield variability, respectively, demonstrated higher yield prediction performance than individual inputs. While satellite data contributed to crop yield prediction mainly at the early-peak of the growing season, climate data offered extra information mainly at the peak-late season. We also found that the combined use of EVI, LST and SIF has improved the model accuracy compared to the benchmark EVI model. However, the optical-based vegetation indices shared similar information and did not provide much extra information beyond EVI. The within-season yield forecasting showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at two to three months prior to harvest. Geography, topography, VOD, EVI, soil hydraulic and nutrient parameters are more important for crop yield prediction.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Swordfish, Xiphias gladius (Linnaeus, 1758), is a commercially important species that is widely distributed throughout three oceans. This species inhabits oceanic waters with preferred environmental ranges and migrates vertically to the surface layer for feeding. However, the spatial distribution pattern and habitat preferences of swordfish have been rarely studied in the Pacific Ocean due to the wide geographic range of this species. This study examined the spatial distribution and preferred ranges of environmental variables for swordfish using two approaches, generalized additive models and habitat suitability index methods, with different spatio-temporal data resolution scales. Results indicated that sea surface temperature is the most important factor determining swordfish spatial distribution. Habitat spatial pattern and preferred environmental ranges, estimated using various modeling approaches, were robust relative to the spatio-temporal data resolution scales. The models were validated by examining the consistency between predictions and untrained actual observations, which all predicted a high relative density of swordfish in the tropical waters of the central Pacific Ocean, with no obvious seasonal movement. Results from this study, based on fishery and remote sensing data with wide spatial coverage, could benefit the conservation and management of fisheries for highly migratory species such as swordfish and tuna.},

Abstract = {Ecological indicators have widespread appeal to scientists, environmental managers, and the general public. Remote sensing is unique in its capability to record variety of spatio-temporal information on land surface with complete coverage, especially with regard to larger spatial scales, which has been proven to be an effective data source to create indicators to rapidly identify regional eco-environment. In this paper, a new index, remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) framework, was applied to assess regional ecological changes in Fuzhou City of Fujian Province, southeastern China, using Landsat ETM+/OLI/TIRS images. Taking the advantages of being totally free of artificial interference in the calculation using principal components analysis (PCA) to assign weights of each variable, the RSEI can assess the regional ecological status more objectively and easily. The effectivity of the new index was validated by four approaches, including point-based, classification-based, correlation-based, and urban-rural-gradient-based comparisons. The case study showed that Fuzhou has witnessed ecological improvement during the study period, with the value of RSEI increasing from 0.663 in 2000 to 0.675 in 2016. Spatial variation analysis showed that the poor level of RSEI distributed mostly in the central urban areas, and the ecological degradation was attributed to the fast expansion of the built-up area, characterized by increasing greatly in the value of the normalized differential built up and soil index (NDBSI) in such areas.},

Abstract = {Aiming at developing real time water balance modelling for irrigation scheduling, this study assesses the accuracy of the soil water balance model CRITERIA, developed by the hydro-meteorological service of the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy). The model consists of (i) an algorithm for coupling the surface flow components (i.e. Richards equation), and (ii) various Modules which may be applicable to different topographical and environmental conditions. In this study, CRITERIA was applied to simulate the soil water balance for an orange orchard in semi-arid Mediterranean conditions (Eastern Sicily, insular Italy) during the cropping season 2011. The model was implemented by varying the evapotranspiration rates (ET) as input; ET fluxes were estimated by using satellite-based approach and the Penman-Monteith expression for reference rates, or were directly measured by the eddy covariance technique and the sap flow heat pulse Method for transpiration. Model outputs, in term of soil moisture, were validated with direct measures of volumetric soil water content obtained by time domain reflectrometry (TDR) probes. Results of the study proved the reliability of CRITERIA to reproduce the soil moisture profile at the experimental site. The model performance was significantly high when direct measurements of crop water demand were included as input for model application. The satellite-based approach provided reliable crop evapotranspiration estimates, confirming the utility of the remote sensing techniques as support for water management in agriculture.

Title = {Factors of ecosystem service values in a fast-developing region in China: Insights from the joint impacts of human activities and natural conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal variety and influencing mechanisms of ecosystem service value (ESV) can provide a scientific guide for the regional ecological management and sustainable development. However, the joint effect of factors influencing ESV is ignored, which is an important way for influencing factors to work in the complex and frequently interacting ecosystem. In this study, we used remote sensing data, grid statistics data, and machine learning methods to reveal the spatiotemporal variation of ESV and to explore the combined effects of influencing factors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2000 to 2015. The specific results were as follows. (1) The total ESV in the GBA decreased by 13.11 billion yuan with the rate of decline slowing over the study period, and the regulating service suffered the most damage. (2) The spatial distribution of ESV has an outer high and inner low circle structure. Compared with that of the west bank of the Pearl River estuary, ESV of the east bank is relatively lower. (3) The three kinds of combination of factors had different impacts on ecosystem services. The effect of land-use integrity on ecosystem services is opposite between natural ecosystem and urban ecosystem. (2)When regional population density is under a certain threshold (669 people/km(2)), social economies and ecosystems may develop together. (3)The mismatched hydrothermal conditions can lead to a decrease in ESV. The findings of our study are conducive to identifying the current situation of ecosystem services and promoting the ecological civilization construction in the GBA, and bring a new insight and perspective on the influencing mechanisms of ESV.

Title = {Changes in and driving forces of ecosystem services in tropical southwestern China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Tropical forests provide important ecosystem services and biodiversity for the world. With human activities and economic growth, tropical forests are becoming the primary sources of new plantations, making tropical regions hotspots of ecosystem service degenerations and biodiversity losses. Understanding the driving forces of ecological consequences is the key to local sustainable development and human well-being improvements. Therefore, we spatially quantified the changes in ecosystem services in tropical China in the past twenty years by remote sensing and InVEST model. The driving forces were further investigated by using Geodetector. We found that: 1) in the past twenty years, the area of evergreen broad-leaved forests, coniferous forests, and rubber forests have increased by 13.01\%, 43.39\%, and 101.23\%, respectively. The shrublands and agricultural lands are the major contributors to these increased areas; 2) with the area increasing of forests, carbon storage and soil retention have increased by 9.40\% and 0.30\%, while nitrogen export and water yield have decreased by 43.30\%, and 12.27\%. This pattern of increase in carbon storage and soil retention was found in the highlands, while not in the lowlands, where large areas of evergreen broad-leaved forests have been converted to rubber forests; 3) NDVI was highly correlated to the carbon storage (q value = 0.201) and nitrogen export (q value = 0.109), while slope and precipitation mainly affected the soil retention (q value = 0.253) and water yield (q value = 0.073), respectively. This study provides a reference for ecological protection and management in tropical China.},

Title = {Reconstruction of sea-land interactions between terrestrial vegetation cover and water quality constituents in the Mattapoisett Harbor area during the 1991 Hurricane Bob event},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Hurricane Bob passed over the New England region in August 1991, causing significant damage to life, property, and the `environment, making it one of the costliest hurricanes in New England history. The environmental impact of a hurricane of this magnitude warrants careful assessment to devise preventive measures and mitigation strategies to bolster water resources management programs against future events. In this paper, we show the reconstructed simultaneous impacts of Hurricane Bob on the vegetative cover of the Mattapoisett river watershed and the water quality of the Mattapoisett Harbor with the aid of remote sensing for earth observations. The water quality impacts, especially in terms of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), can be identified from variations of SSS and TOC near coastal estuaries due to the influx of freshwater from the coastal Mattapoisett River to the continent-ocean transition between natural tides and bay waves. Using the Landsat satellite images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and water quality constitutes (TOC and SSS) were reconstructed and retrieved for the assessment of the sea-land interactions during the Hurricane Bob event in 1991. Results indicate phenomenal interactive patterns between the harbor and the coastal watershed, as well as the riverine system. TOC and NDVI, especially in the upper watershed region, can be strongly correlated with hurricane impacts according to the singular value decomposition analysis.},

Abstract = {Numerous initiatives and programmes were introduced to enable biodiversity conservation, and community involvement was among these propositions. In line with such initiatives, several frameworks were thus developed to ensure the sustainable implementation and realisation of such programmes. This saw the establishment of the Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM). As such, numerous calls were made to explore community involvement strategies and associated socio-economic impacts in nature conservation. Most studies and reports emanating from such calls demonstrate cases of failure ofinter aliaincluding poaching. This work, therefore, provides a detailed synthesis of the implications of involving local communities in conservation in protected areas (PAs) and further examines how spatial explicit methodologies can be adopted in enhancing nature conservation. Overall, the study has shown that community attitudes and perceptions towards nature conservation in PAs point towards the failure of the CBNRM approach. Weak, conflicted and sometimes corrupt governance and poor institutional arrangements seem to have contributed towards its failure. Overall, the review further indicates that most studies on community involvement in nature conservation have not fully considered the spatial dimension, and this has hampered holistic and effective monitoring and assessment of biodiversity in PAs to ensure sustainable management and the possible implications of such an approach towards conservation. This work, therefore, recommends a shift towards collaborative modelling, transdisciplinary monitoring and assessment approaches to improve biodiversity conservation as well as to determine the success and limitations of the CBNRM approach in Africa and the world over.},

Pages = {355-386},
Abstract = {Geospatial technology is an essential component of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, as environmental resources are directly affected by changes in the shape and extent of the proposed disturbance. With the use of spatial techniques like remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems, and Global Positioning Systems, EIA has enhanced substantial viewing, movement, query, and even map-making capabilities. However, one of the main challenges is to have access to the most up-to-date and accurate geospatial data and interpretations. With an emphasis on using geospatial data in particular, the value of the information resource is far higher than is generally available with text and numeric information. This paper focuses on discussing the application of geospatial tools in environmental monitoring and the effective analysis of the natural resources for developmental planning, policy formulation, and decision-making. Several specific relevant applications of geospatial tools to integrate EIA are presented in the context of an Indian scenario. Applications have included monitoring of natural resources (air, water, land, etc.), ground-level ozone, soil erosion, study of sea-level rise due to global warming, change-detection studies, delineation of ecologically sensitive areas using digital-image analysis and Geographic Information Systems. This study focuses on the possibility of using a proposed spatial-decision-support system to conduct EIA, which should make it possible to upload, evaluate, maintain, and report field and analytical data that have been stored in a variety of formats.},

Abstract = {Wetlands are among Earth's most dynamic, diverse and varied habitats as the balance between land and water surfaces provide shelter to a unique mixture of plant and animal species. This study explores the changes in two Mediterranean wetland delta environments formed by the Axios and Aliakmonas rivers located in Greece, over a 25-year period (1984-2009). Direct photo-interpretation of four Landsat TM images acquired during the study period was performed. Furthermore, a sophisticated, semi-automatic image classification method based on support vector machines (SVMs) was developed to streamline the mapping process. Deposition and erosion magnitudes at different temporal scales during the study period were quantified using both approaches based on coastline surface area changes. Analysis using both methods was conducted in a geographical information systems (GIS) environment. Direct photo-interpretation, which formed our reference dataset, showed noticeable changes in the coastline deltas of both study areas, with erosion occurring mostly in the earlier periods (1990-2003) in both river deltas followed by deposition in more recent years (2003-2009), but at different magnitudes. Spatial patterns of coastline changes predicted from the SVMs showed similar trends. In absolute terms SVMs predictions of sediment erosion and deposition in the studied area were different in the order of 5-20\% in comparison to photo-interpretation, evidencing the potential capability of this method in coastline changes monitoring. One of the main contributions of our work lies to the use of the SVMs classifier in coastal mapping of changes, since to our knowledge use of this technique has been under-explored in this application domain. Furthermore, this study provides important contribution to the understanding of Mediterranean river delta dynamics and their behaviours, and corroborates the usefulness of EO technology and GIS as an effective tool in policy decision making and successful landscape management. The latter is of considerable scientific and practical value to the wider community of interested users, given the continued open access to observations from this satellite radiometer globally.

Title = {Sustainable management of sweet potatoes: A review on practices, strategies, and opportunities in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, energy security, and quality of life},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {210},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {CONTEXT: Sweet potatoes are sources of staple food for human nutrition and welfare. Hence, they can assist in developing food security in vulnerable communities. Equally significant, they offer industries suitable feedstocks to fabricate biofuels.OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the literature to establish practices, strategies, and opportunities in producing them for nutrition-sensitive agriculture, energy security, and quality of life.METHODS: We defined Web of ScienceTM and Science Direct \& REG; as databases to select scholarly items to develop our driving bibliographic collection. We combined keywords and Boolean operators into search-engining strings, such as ALL = {[}{''}sweet potato{''} AND ({''}fertilization{''} OR ``irrigation{''} OR ``pest control{''} OR ``breeding{''})], to strike them. We limited our search to peer-reviewed papers to address a methodologically sound approach. We assessed them for consistency and eligibility by reviewing titles, highlights, abstracts, keywords, methods, conclusions, and declarations (i.e., financial support and acknowledgment). We conducted our review independently. Nevertheless, we discussed them collectively to handle divergent opinions and intellectual conflicts.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We obtained sufficient and significant bibliometric data to elaborate on trending topics, such as nutrition-sensitive agriculture, food-fuel divide, and remote sensing for site-specific monitoring and intervention. Genotypes containing higher quantities of carotenoids and anthocyanins can contribute to human nutrition and welfare. They assist individuals in producing vitamin A and antioxidants, preventing xerophthalmia and malignant tumors. Some others are multi-objective, offering resources for consumption and processing into bioethanol. Hence, they can decrease conflicts in selecting edible tubers for bioenergy produc-tion. Genetic breeding can allow their cultivation in challenging environments, such as drylands, as it improves their response to fertilization and irrigation. Exploiting locally available fertilizers, controlling economically relevant pests biologically and culturally, and selecting healthy propagative material (i.e., vines) can further contribute to their cost-effectiveness, environmental footprint, and longevity. Equally significant, producers can benefit from high-resolution remote sensing data to monitor, map, and intervene in their fields early and pre-cisely, avoiding risky seasons. SIGNIFICANCE: Our review stresses the sustainable production of sweet potatoes as specialty crops for sus-tainable development. Hence, its ramifications offer stakeholders, such as producers, researchers, and policy -makers, catalytic, actionable knowledge to address pressing economic, environmental, and social issues. They can consider them in elaborating on physically and financially accessible diets and equitable, responsive rural arrangements for people in vulnerable regions. It can assist in mitigating hunger and malnutrition while creating opportunities and possibilities for farmers and consumers to produce and afford health-promoting, nutrient -dense tuberous roots.},

Title = {Statistical methods for analysis of seasonal modifications in the salt marshes of the Venice lagoon},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {323-338},
Abstract = {Purpose - To define synthetic indices of changes of vegetation coverage on salt marshes of the Venice lagoon that might be used to model changes of the entire basin. Design/methodology/approach - Remote sensing data from the satellite sensor QuickBird were processed to retrieve vegetation coverage in different seasons, i.e. different phenological stages of the halophytic vegetation. These changes have been described by means of landscape metrics (LSM's) and statistical moments. Findings - LSM's selected have been useful to describe the dominant shapes of vegetation coverage, while the low variations occurred were only partially explained. The first four statistical moments have been only partially functional to the description of temporal variation of the patches. Practical implications - These indicators, whose performances have been evaluated by the present work, could be used to detect larger variations on longer period and on wider spatial scale. In this way it could also be possible to easily detect the effects of changes on the hydrodynamic regime that may occur in relation with new projected interventions on the Venice lagoon. Originality/value - This approach has never been applied to salt marshes of the Venice lagoon. The remote sensing data, in particular LSM's and statistical moments applied together, might be valuable tools to detect shape changes in the delicate environment of salt marshes and suggest possible remedies for problems of managing the Venice lagoon.},

Title = {Evaluating capital assets in governing protected area co-management in the Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {16-28},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Co-management in the Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary was evaluated to assess how fairly capital assets were considered in the beneficiary selection, and to what extent it affected vegetation cover. A semi-structured questionnaire survey was employed to collect necessary information along with satellite images. The study revealed that many variables of social capital and a few variables of natural and financial capital played a significant role in the participant selection process. Analysis of dependency showed that the participants did not rely significantly on the forest both in terms of resource collection and their monetary value implying that the most dependent people were not adequately represented in the co-management team. The dominance of local leaders suppressed the voices of others in the management venture. An increase in forest vegetation cover was observed during the project period, although shortly after the end of co-management projects a slight deterioration of forest cover was noted. The findings of the study can serve as a guide in the future application of community forestry programmes in protected areas of Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world within similar socio-physiographic settings.},

Abstract = {The RadarLink project proposes to develop an optimal system architecture, which will implement and demonstrate a data communication service tailored to meet the needs of Canada's Earth observation community. RadarLink will use the resulting real time stream of data to promote the development of three marine surveillance and monitoring applications which have identified commercial and social benefit. CORETEC Incorporated has been selected to participate in this project and will use RADARSAT data to augment existing methods of ice reconnaissance and weather observation. CORETEC's RadarLink application will operate as a comprehensive marine ice management system providing detailed site-specific now-cast and forecast information about ice and iceberg movements. This system requires site specific, real time information detailing ice and environmental conditions. Once this information is received it can be incorporated into the ice management system where sophisticated algorithms provide prediction and forecasting information concerning ice edge, individual icebergs, and iceberg ensemble drift. The developed system will be used in a pilot project to be carried out in connection with the towing operations of the Hibernia platform. The proposed system consists of four subsystems; a data acquisition system, an iceberg system, an iceedge system, and an ensemble system. This paper describes the system development including a functional requirement specification, a detailed system specification, and system implementation. There are three main models to be incorporated in CORETEC's RadarLink application: 1. ICEBERG - A model which can be used to predict the future trajectory of an approach iceberg up to 48 hours in advance. 2. ICEEDGE - A model which can be used to predict the future movements of an approaching ice edge. This model utilizes the present position of the ice edge along with wind and current Information to generate a set of points which represent the future boundary of the ice sheet or edge. 3. ENSEMBLE - A dynamic model which can be used to predict the future movements of iceberg ensembles. Icebergs are grouped together using a geographic grid for which each block is numbered according to the number of icebergs existing in that area. The ENSEMBLE model is capable of predicting the future number of icebergs in each block as icebergs drift and are redistributed throughout the region. The RadarLink project will enable CORETEC to improve the accuracy and reliability of its Ice Management Systems by providing detailed remote sensing services. CORETEC in return, will utilize these services to address site-specific, near real time ice information needs not currently met by others using its own ice models. The proposed project involving the proven effectiveness and accuracy of CORETEC's ice ocean models will serve as an important component in marine safety. Financial sponsorship is provided by CANARIE Incorporated and CCRS (Canadian Centre for Remote Sensing).},

Title = {A Remote-Sensing Ecological Index Approach for Restoration Assessment of Rare-Earth Elements Mining},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {In order to meet the requirements for comprehensive and multidimensional generalization of ecological management effectiveness evaluation indexes in the context of ecological restoration advocating comprehensive management by multiple means, this paper explores the rationality of using RSEI as an ecological management effectiveness evaluation index to adapt to the systematic transformation of the management goal of abandoned mine restoration from ecological restoration to regional socioeconomic sustainable development. Based on Landsat-8 image data, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was used to evaluate the dynamic changes and spatial and temporal differences of the ecological environment in the study area under the long-term multimeans comprehensive management. The RSEI is suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of comprehensive ecological management in mining areas with a large amount of bare soil. The regional RSEI mean value increased by 0.029 in the early stage and 0.051 in the later stage by fragmentation management, indicating a better effect of multimeans comprehensive management. The remote sensing ecological index can objectively reflect the difference of spatial distribution characteristics of ecological environment in the four ``Ecological+{''} governance regions. It can both objectively reflect the ecological status of the study area and reflect the differentiated spatial distribution characteristics of the ecological environment in different treatment areas, which is of long-term practical significance to the ecological construction of the study area. This study provides a theoretical reference for ecological assessment of complex situation under difficult site conditions.},

Abstract = {Land use demand change in the Huaihe River basin (HRB) and ecosystem service values (ESVs) in watersheds are important for the sustainable development and use of land resources. This paper takes the HRB as the research object, and using remote sensing images of land use as the data source adopts the comprehensive evaluation analysis method of ESVs based on equivalent factors and sensitivity analysis of the performance characteristics of ESV changes of different land use types. The PLUS model is used to predict spatiotemporal land use change characteristics to 2030 combining inertial development, ecological development, and cultivated land development. The spatial distribution and aggregation of ESVs at each scale were also explored by analyzing ESVs at municipal, county, and grid scales. Considering also hotspots, the contribution of land use conversion to ESVs was quantified. The results showed that (1) from 2000 to 2020, cultivated land decreased sharply to 28,344.6875 km(2), while construction land increased sharply to 26,914.563 km(2), and the change of other land types was small. (2) The ESVs in the HRB were 222,019 x 10(12) CNY in 2000, 235,015 x 10(12) CNY in 2005, 234,419 x 10(12) CNY in 2010, 229,885 x 10(12) CNY in 2015, and 224,759 x 10(12) CNY in 2020, with an overall fluctuation, first increasing and then decreasing. (3) The ESVs were 219,977 x 10(12) CNY, 218,098 x 10(12) CNY, 219,757 x 10(12) CNY, and 213,985 x 10(12) CNY under the four simulation scenarios of inertial development, ecological development, cultivated land development, and urban development, respectively. At different scales, the high-value areas decreased, and the low-value areas increased. (4) The hot and cold spots of ESV values were relatively clustered, with the former mainly clustered in the southeast region and the latter mainly clustered in the northwest region. The sensitivity of ecological value was lower than 1, while the ESV was inelastic to the ecological coefficient, and the results were plausible. The mutual conversion of cultivated land to water contributed the most to ESVs. Based on the multi-scenario simulation of land use in the HRB by the PLUS model, we identified the spatial distribution characteristics of ESVs at different scales, which can provide a scientific basis and multiple perspectives for the optimization of land use structure and socio-economic development decisions.},

Abstract = {In recent years research within the EU project CHERPLAN and the Global Regions Initiative studied a total of 33 natural and cultural heritage sites in South-Eastern Europe and the Alpine Space with over-used and unused development opportunities. The key success factors analysis was applied to nine pilot sites in the CHERPLAN project to better understand the opportunities and bottle necks of heritage sites, to contribute to local and regional development and to create benefit for local communities. A follow-up study extended the investigations to 24 World Heritage (WH) properties within the Alpine Space, based on the WH Convention's nomination files, management plans and the documents of the Periodic Reporting 2nd cycle (2013 / 2014). The studies evaluated the key success factors and the potential to use heritage sites as resources for local development. The studies focuses on identifying the state-of-the art, bottlenecks and solutions to optimize impact and to contribute to sustainable development processes in and around heritage sites. The four historic centres and the five serial nominations of the Alpine Space in the WH list are situated on the rim of the Alpine Convention area and, because of their particular characteristics, have little impact on local development and create limited added value for local communities. The other 15 sites are situated in rural and remote areas and present considerable unused development opportunities. All the WH sites have very high Natural and Cultural Capital and its Accessibility due to their Outstanding Universal Value, their uniqueness, accessibility and the established education and research facilities. The sites in the high Alps perform rather less well in terms of Limits and Pre-requisites for Development, either because of the remote location and difficult environmental conditions or because of limited marketing and promotion prospects of their brands. The main weaknesses and opportunities emerged in the third key factors group Strategy, Cooperation and Sustainability: lack of public private cooperation, strategic planning, integrated management plans, sustainable development concepts and involvement of stakeholders. The holistic development approach, targeted at sustainable growth and benefit for local people, and stakeholders involvement, is not yet considered adequately in WH strategies and in the Periodic Reporting.},

Title = {Do Big Unstructured Biodiversity Data Mean More Knowledge?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Conserving species biodiversity demands decisive and effective action. Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of ``big unstructured data{''} for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on ``big data.{''} Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritize data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs. standardized data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: (1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardized long-termspecies population studies; (2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and (3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.},

Title = {Geospatial sensor web: A cyber-physical infrastructure for geoscience research and application},
Journal = {EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {185},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the last half-century, geoscience research has advanced due to multidisciplinary technologies, among which Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has played a vital role. However, scientifically organizing these ICTs toward improving geoscience measurements, data processing, and information services has encountered tremendous challenges. This paper reviews a profound revolution in geoscience that has resulted from the Geospatial Sensor Web (GSW), serving as a new cyber-physical spatio-temporal information infrastructure for geoscience on the World Wide Web (WWW). In contrast to previous experiment-based and sensor-based paradigms, the GSW-based paradigm is able to accomplish the following: (1) achieve integrated and sharable management of diverse sensing resources, (2) obtain real-time or near real-time and spatiotemporal continuous data, (3) conduct interoperable and online geoscience data processing and analysis, and (4) provide focusing services with web-based geoscience information and knowledge. As a benefit of the GSW, increasingly more geoscience disciplines are enjoying the value of real-time data, multi-source monitoring, online processing, and intelligence services. This paper reviews the evolution of geoscience research paradigm to demonstrate the scientific background of GSW. Then, we elaborates on four key methods provided by GSW, namely, integrated management, collaborative observation, scalable processing and fusion, and focusing service web capacity. Furthermore, current GSW prototypes and applications for environmental, hydrological, and natural disaster analysis are also reviewed. Moreover, four challenges to the future GSW in geoscience research are identified and analyzed, including integration with the Model Web initiative for sophisticated geo-processing, integration with humans for pervasive sensing, integration with Internet of Things (IoT) to achieve high-quality performance and data mining, and integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide smart geoservices. We have concluded that GSW has become an indispensable cyber-physical infrastructure, and will play a greater role in geoscience research and application.},

Abstract = {Recently, multi-modal fusion methods based on remote sensing data and social sensing data have been widely used in the field of urban region function recognition. However, due to the high complexity of noise problem, most of the existing methods are not robust enough when applied in real-world scenes, which seriously affect their application value in urban planning and management. In addition, how to extract valuable periodic feature from social sensing data still needs to be further study. To this end, we propose a multi-modal fusion network guided by feature co-occurrence for urban region function recognition, which leverages the co-occurrence relationship between multi-modal features to identify abnormal noise feature, so as to guide the fusion network to suppress noise feature and focus on clean feature. Furthermore, we employ a graph convolutional network that incorporates node weighting layer and interactive update layer to effectively extract valuable periodic feature from social sensing data. Lastly, experimental results on public available datasets indicate that our proposed method yeilds promising improvements of both accuracy and robustness over several state-of-the-art methods.},

Title = {Econometric Approaches That Consider Farmers' Adaptation in Estimating the Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture: A Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The question of whether and to what extent farmers can adapt to climate change has recently gained academic interest. This paper reviews contemporary econometric approaches that assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture and consider farmer adaptation, complementing previous methodological reviews with this distinctive adaptation perspective. The value of adaptation can be measured by comparing the differences between the long-term climate change effect and the short-term weather shock effect. However, this theoretical model has not yet been well supported by empirical evidence, as it is difficult to identify true adaptation, incorporating adaptation cost, and estimated adaptation rate. Quasi-natural experiments, cost-benefit analysis, and Bayesian models are effective tools to address these methodological drawbacks. Two methods dominate in the estimation of climate effects, but each has its own advantages. A good estimate provides a trade-off between the incorporation of farmers' adaptive behavior and the reduction in omitted variables bias. Cross-sectional data models based on climate variability can capture farmers' long-term adaptations but are prone to bias due to omitted variables. Panel data models are more effective at mitigating omitted variable bias by applying fixed effects, but do not consider farmers' adaptative behavior to long-term climate change. To address this dilemma, several cutting-edge approaches have been developed, including integration with the weather and climate model, the long differences approach, and the long- and short-term hybrid approach. We found three key challenges, namely: (1) exploring adaptation mechanisms, (2) the CO2 fertilization effect, and (3) estimating the distributional effects of climate impacts. We also recommend future empirical studies to incorporate satellite remote sensing data, examine the relationship between different adaptation measures, model farmers' future climate expectations, and include adaptation costs.},

Abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operations are changing the way aviation and commerce are conducted today. Until recently, for civil aviation commercial operations, nearly all UAS operations are conducted within visual line of sight (VLOS). However, this severely limits the economic benefits that can be realized by the use of these unmanned, and someday, autonomous systems. Beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations require much more capabilities for the operator to rely on and for the general public to condone and be comfortable with. BVLOS operations rely on ground and platform technologies all with varying states of maturity. In this paper, we focus on the interaction between the UAS operator / Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) to maintain a continuous Command \& Control (C2) link with its unmanned aircraft. There must be a reliable, robust, infrastructure in place to enable operators to fly beyond visual range. In areas with sparse communications network coverage, various communication technologies such as LTE and satellite are expected to be utilized in combination to provide C2 connectivity. However, resources for communication links can be saturated, depending on the available spectrum and activity within each network (LTE, Satellite). UAS Traffic Management (UTM) may ultimately be a pay-for-use service. UTM providers will certainly rely on commercial mobile networks for data communications services and guaranteeing quality of service. Use of communication services can be costly so they must consider implementing a cost-benefit analysis to determine service profitability based on number of service missions, mission type, distribution of missions over an area, and cost of use of each communication resource so that adequate price points can be set for its customers' service missions. Using a combination of cost modeling and agent-based simulation, one can define many UTM operation scenarios with different parameters such as LTE service coverage area distributions that can be analyzed to determine when LTE communication channels are lost in order to switch to a secondary satellite link to re-establish a C2 connectivity. In this paper, we develop a cost model based on these parameters and a simulation methodology that is envisaged to help UAV fleet operators to manage and price their services while ensuring that BVLOS operations maintain C2 connectivity via a combination of communication technologies.},

Abstract = {Water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (C. Mart) Solms (Pontederiaceae), is an invasive aquatic macrophyte with major negative economic and ecological impacts in Rwanda and other East African countries since its establishment in the region in the 1960s. Reliable estimates of water hyacinth distribution are required to determine the severity of the problem and identify waterbodies requiring management. Remote sensing techniques, based on the Landsat 8 sensor, offer promising alternatives to accurately detect, map and monitor the extent of the water hyacinth invasion in Rwandan waterbodies. The aim of the current study was to investigate the utility of multispectral remote sensed imagery using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms to detect and map water hyacinth in Rwandan waterbodies. Random Forest had a high overall accuracy of 85\%, compared with Support Vector Machine (65\%). These algorithms confirmed different levels of water hyacinth infestations in three main Rwandan rivers. Many of the wetlands along these riparian systems and most of the lakes, particularly those from the Eastern Province of the country were found to be invaded by water hyacinth. These findings would, therefore, assist government partners and policy makers to put in place sustainable methods, such as biological control, along with integrated pest management, to control the of water hyacinth invasion in Rwanda.},

Abstract = {Carbon sequestration is an indispensable ecosystem service provided by soil and vegetation, so mapping and valuing the carbon budget by considering both ecological and social factors is an important trend in evaluating ecosystem services. In this work, we established multiple scenarios to evaluate the impacts of land use change, population growth, carbon emission per capita, and carbon markets on carbon budget. We quantified carbon sinks (aboveground and belowground) under different scenarios, using the Carnegie-AmesStanford Approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon cycle process model, and studied carbon sources caused by human activities by analyzing the spatial distribution of human population and carbon emission per capita. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios using NPV model. Our results indicate that the carbon budget of Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Region is surplus: Carbon sinks range from 1.50 x 10(10) to 1.54 x 10(10) t, while carbon sources caused by human activities range from 2.76 x 10(5) to 7.60 x 105 t. And the NPV for carbon deficits range from 3.20 x 10(11) RMB to 1.52 x 10(12) RMB. From the perspective of ecological management, deforestation, urban sprawl, population growth, and excessive carbon consumption are considered as the main challenges in balancing carbon sources and sinks. Levying carbon tax would be a considerable option when decision maker develops carbon emission reduction policies. Our results provide a scientific and credible reference for harmonious and sustainable development in the Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Region of China.},

Abstract = {Large scale land-based investments have a significant impact on natural resources and environmental conditions. It is necessary to protect areas of high conservation value (HCV) within land management investments, such as the mining sector, to minimise this impact. The existence of high conservation value sites in locations with activities related to the mining sector is intended to maintain the ecological and conservation value of a mining investment area. We demonstrate a model that can identify potential high conservation value sites in mining areas using remote sensing data and spatial analysis compiled with field observation data. The research was conducted in one of the largest nickel mining areas (71,047 ha) in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. We mapped vegetation density using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery. We also collected biodiversity data in predetermined inventory sampling plots, which we then used to estimate species richness using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Using a linear regression model to compare the normalized difference vegetation index value in each sampling plot with the biodiversity value of flora and fauna, we then estimated biodiversity distribution patterns for the entire study area. We found that potential high conservation value areas (areas likely to have high biodiversity based on our regression model) covered 40,000 ha, more than half of the total concession area.},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature is an important factor for determination of most physical, biological, energy and water processes and cycles, weather prediction, global ocean circulation and climatic variability in the earth. Further, knowledge of land surface temperature is necessary for management of earth energy resources and environmental studies. For these aims, land surface temperature maps were constituted by using NOAA-12,14,15/AVHRR satellite data. Cities of Adana, Ankara, and Antalya, Artvin, Istanbul, Izmir, Kayseri, Konya, Malatya, Samsun, Sivas, Sanliurfa and Van were chosen as control points on the maps. The values which were obtained from the maps produced were compared with these ground-truth values. On monthly avereges of overall comparisons, the correlation coefficient (r) and root mean squared error (RMSE) value Were found to be 0,989 and 1,493 K respectively. When the separate cities were considered, correlation coefficient and RMSE values were found to change within the intervals 0,959-0,990 and 1,589-3,332 degrees K respectively. These show that land surface temperatures can be determined with a high accuracy by using the data from NOAA-AVHRR satellites.},

Abstract = {Urban green mapping has become an operational task in city planning, urban land management, and quality of life assessments. As a multi-dimensional, integrative concept, urban green comprising several ecological, socio-economic, and policy-related aspects. In this paper, the author advances the representation of urban green by deriving scale-adapted, policy-relevant units. These so-called geons represent areas of uniform green valuation under certain size and homogeneity constraints in a spatially explicit representation. The study accompanies a regular monitoring scheme carried out by the urban municipality of the city of Salzburg, Austria, using optical satellite data. It was conducted in two stages, namely SBG\_QB (10.2 km(2), QuickBird data from 2005) and SBG\_WV (140 km(2), WorldView-2 data from 2010), within the functional urban area of Salzburg. The geon delineation was validated by several quantitative measures and spatial analysis techniques, as well as ground documentation, including panorama photographs and visual interpretation. The spatial association pattern was assessed by calculating Global Moran's I with incremental search distances. The final geonscape, consisting of 1083 units with an average size of 13.5 ha, was analyzed by spatial metrics. Finally, categories were derived for different types of functional geons. Future research paths and improvements to the described strategy are outlined.},

Title = {Emergent Challenges for Science sUAS Data Management: Fairness through Community Engagement and Best Practices Development},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) as platforms for data capture has rapidly increased in recent years. However, while there has been significant investment in improving the aircraft, sensors, operations, and legislation infrastructure for such, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of the complex data capture pipeline sUAS involve. This paper reports on a four-year, community-based investigation into the tools, data practices, and challenges that currently exist for particularly researchers using sUAS as data capture platforms. The key results of this effort are: (1) sUAS captured data-as a set that is rapidly growing to include data in a wide range of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Engineering Disciplines, and many civil and commercial use cases-is characterized as both sharing many traits with traditional remote sensing data and also as exhibiting-as common across the spectrum of disciplines and use cases-novel characteristics that require novel data support infrastructure; and (2), given this characterization of sUAS data and its potential value in the identified wide variety of use case, we outline eight challenges that need to be addressed in order for the full value of sUAS captured data to be realized. We conclude that there would be significant value gained and costs saved across both commercial and academic sectors if the global sUAS user and data management communities were to address these challenges in the immediate to near future, so as to extract the maximal value of sUAS captured data for the lowest long-term effort and monetary cost.},

Abstract = {Water level changes at Poyang Lake have great impact of the area of the lakeshore wetlands and landscape spatial pattern. Therefore, the research of the structure, rules, and driving forces for changes of the wetlands have great reference value to the management of Poyang Lake basin. This article first introduce the research methods and date source, including the definition of lakeshore hydro-fluctuation belt, wetland classification method, interpretation method, and so on Based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) tools, it analyzes the yearly change rules of landscape spatial pattern and the composition characteristics of lakeshore wetlands. We analyzes the changes in landscape spatial pattern by process the RS images under equivalent water level over a long period from 1985 to 2005, and the natural, social, economic and policy driving forces were also analyzed on a basis of social economic statistics. Results indicate that there is a significant change of spatial pattern in the lakeshore wetlands landscape under an equivalent water level and human activities are the main driving forces for the changes.

Abstract = {During recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been increasingly used for flood mapping. New radar satellites especially, such as TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2 and COSMO-SkyMed, provide high-resolution data with high potential for fast and reliable detection of inundated areas. This article compares three simple approaches to derive water areas from SAR data in relation to the German-Vietnamese project, Water-related Information System for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong Delta (WISDOM). Two methods are pixel based and use histogram-based grey-level thresholds, as well as a homogeneity criterion for classification. The third approach is object based and applies characteristic attributes of water objects such as grey value, texture and relations to neighbouring objects. Further discussed are the influence of a variation of the thresholds and the challenges to validate water masks derived from active remote-sensing data. We implemented one of the introduced approaches for surface water derivation in a water mask processor for automatic water mask calculation from radar satellite imagery (WaMaPro). This fully automatic processing chain was developed to process TerraSAR-X and Environmental Satellite Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ENVISAT ASAR) imagery in order to meet the demands for automatic flood monitoring.},

Title = {Formative evaluation of a telemedicine model for delivering clinical neurophysiology services part I: Utility, technical performance and service provider perspective},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: Formative evaluation is conducted in the early stages of system implementation to assess how it works in practice and to identify opportunities for improving technical and process performance. A formative evaluation of a teleneurophysiology service was conducted to examine its technical and sociological dimensions. Methods: A teleneurophysiology service providing routine EEG investigation was established. Service use, technical performance and satisfaction of clinical neurophysiology personnel were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. These were contrasted with a previously reported analysis of the need for teleneurophysiology, and examination of expectation and satisfaction with clinical neurophysiology services in Ireland. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis was also conducted. Results: Over the course of 40 clinical sessions during 20 weeks, 142 EEG investigations were recorded and stored on a file server at a satellite centre which was 130 miles away from the host clinical neurophysiology department. Using a virtual private network, the EEGs were accessed by a consultant neurophysiologist at the host centre for interpretation. The model resulted in a 5-fold increase in access to EEG services as well as reducing average waiting times for investigation by a half. Technically the model worked well, although a temporary loss of virtual private network connectivity highlighted the need for clarity in terms of responsibility for troubleshooting and repair of equipment problems. Referral quality, communication between host and satellite centres, quality of EEG recordings, and ease of EEG review and reporting indicated that appropriate organisational processes were adopted by the service. Compared to traditional CN service delivery, the teleneurophysiology model resulted in a comparable unit cost per EEG. Conclusion: Observations suggest that when traditional organisational boundaries are crossed challenges associated with the social dimension of service delivery may be amplified. Teleneurophysiology requires a governance and management that recognises its socio-technical nature.},

Abstract = {Invasive alien plants are considered as a major threat to many ecological and socio-economic systems. Nevertheless, the management of some of these plants is often controversial due to the positive socioeconomic and ecosystem roles they play. This necessitates proper mapping and monitoring of the extent and spatial distribution of such plants to prioritize resource allocation and management. However, mapping plant species using remote sensing in a heterogeneous environment such as an urban area is often challenged by high levels of spectral muddle. This study investigated the utility of the high and medium spectral and spatial resolution imageries from the WorldView-2 (WV-2) and SPOT-7 satellites, respectively, to map eucalypts trees in urban areas. Furthermore, the classification performances of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were compared. Both WV-2 and SPOT-7 imageries attained overall accuracies of 81.67\% (0.78 kappa) and 72.78\% (0.67 kappa), respectively, when the RF algorithm was used and 80\% (0.76 Kappa) and 71.11\% (0.65 Kappa), respectively when SVM algorithm was used. The user's accuracies for the eucalypts class in both WV-2 and SPOT 7 imageries were 73.33\% and 60\%, respectively, for the RF and 70\% and 56.67\% for the SVM algorithm, respectively. Thus, WV-2 imagery is more suitable for mapping eucalypts trees in a heterogeneous urban environment. Therefore, the classification of WV-2 imageries using RF produced a relatively more accurate map of the eucalypts trees for the study areas, the southern part of Johannesburg city.

Abstract = {To successfully fight plant invasions, new methods enabling fast and efficient monitoring are needed, and remote sensing can make their management more efficient and less expensive. However, the data resolution, cost, and availability can be limiting. Optimal solution depends on the species characteristics, where the spectral and spatial resolution can compensate each other to some extent, and phenology plays an important role. Available high spatial resolution satellite data are sufficient for recognition of species that are distinct and either large or form uniform patches at size comparable to the data pixel size. For other species, higher spatial resolution is needed, and unmanned aircraft (UAV) provide data of extremely high spatial resolution (cm) at low cost and high flexibility. We assess its potential to map invasive black locust (BL, Robinia pseudoaccacia), testing imagery of different origin (satellite, UAV), spectral (multispectral, red, green, and blue (RGB) + near-infrared (NIR)) and spatial resolution, and various technical approaches to choose the best strategy for the species monitoring balancing between precision of detection and economic feasibility. Using purposely designed low-cost UAV with tailless fixed wing design for two consumer cameras (RGB and modified NIR) ensures robustness and repeatable field performance while maintaining high aerodynamic efficiency, with resulting mapping capacity over 10 km(2) per day. Several challenges exist in UAV application, such as lower spectral resolution, geometrical and radiometric distortions, and significant amount of data (necessity of automatic processing). In our study, we tested different options of UAV data processing and present comparison of resulting orthomosaic accuracies. For repeated measurements, it is extremely important to ensure spatial co-registration of pixels/objects from different phenological phases. Investment in GPS receiver in the UAV and GPS post-processing eliminated laborious collection of ground control points, while maintaining the co-registration of objects across multiple flights. In our study we provide evidence of benefit of the low cost unmanned system for species monitoring with high classification accuracies of target species from UAV orthomosaic outcompeting WorldView-2 satellite data, and describe methodology that can be used for practical management of invasions.},

Abstract = {A better comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the tempo-spatial dynamics of land use and cover (LULC) in the dry lowlands areas of Ethiopia is crucial for restoring degraded landscapes. This study aimed at analyzing the trends of LULC changes and determine their ecosystem service values in Kewet district central dry lowlands of Ethiopia using multi-temporal satellite imagery for three periods: 1995, 2008, and 2017. Supervised classification, using the maximum likelihood classifier, was applied to quantify LULC changes. Ecosystem Service values were estimated using the modified ecosystem service value coefficients. LULC analysis showed that cultivated land was the most predominant which covered over 41\% of the study area in all three periods. Forests showed a net increase of 18.2\%. Shrubland occupied the second largest portion in all LULC analysis next to cultivated land, and it showed a net decrease of 29.2\%. Open grassland showed a periodic increase. Over the past 20 years, built-up area and bared land grew continuously by 1.80 and 1.01 km(2) yr(-1), respectively. However, some degraded land was converted into woody vegetation land through area exclosure, which improved the vegetation coverage of the study area. Ecosystem Service values ranged from US\$ 2.37 million for shrubland in 1995 to US\$ 22.49 million for forest land in 2008. The total ESVs of the district also continuously decreased over the past two decades. Generally, the LULC in the Kewet district has been dynamic in that some of the LULC classes were expanding, while the others were shrinking through time.},

Abstract = {Archaeological sites often exist as ruins. It is difficult to get an overall perspective while standing near them. The present work is a 3D visualization analysis conducted on the site of Badami, which is in the state of Karnataka in India, using space based observation. The terrain of Badami is dramatically rocky. Scattered on this landscape are many monuments that are either hewn from or built with the local rock, hence they appear camouflaged with the background or hidden because of the surface undulations. It is often difficult to spot individual structures from a distance. The peculiar topography of the site and its amenability for better understanding through 3D perspectives and synoptic coverage led us to carry out 3D visualization through virtual reconstruction of this landscape. Analyses of spatial distribution of monuments in this area together with slope, aspect and visibility analysis were conducted. Any construction around an archaeological site like roads, bridges and ropeways for access to the site or other construction in the surrounding area such as canals or factories can damage objects of historical significance and hinder the heritage value of the landscape. 3D terrain and building visualization and virtual flights can become a valuable tool for Cultural Resource Management for planning construction activities without hindering the preservation of the site. Three different methods of generating Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are discussed in this paper. The first method involves the use of ground survey information with suitable surface rendition derived from merged images from satellites, second approach uses multi-date satellite imagery of the site to create stereo pair and thus generate DEM and the third involves the use of direct stereo of Indian CARTOSAT-1 satellite which has a high resolution along track stereo capability. Outcome of these three approaches are analyzed in the context of their respective abilities to delineate different topographical features. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reclamation and Ecological Service Value Evaluation of Coastal Wetlands Using Multispectral Satellite Imagery},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There are special locational value and natural resources in coastal wetlands. Studying their changes and evaluating their ecosystem service value (ESV) is beneficial for protecting the ecology of coastal wetlands and for maintaining sustainable human development. In this paper, the coastal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay is selected as the research area, an object-oriented method is used to extract shoreline and wetland information, and the coastal wetland reclamation process in Jiaozhou Bay is evaluated. The value equivalent method and market value method are used to evaluate the service value of wetland ecosystems from the perspective of ecological economics. The results show that the reclamation area of Jiaozhou Bay reached 75.2 km(2) in 40 years, with nearly 23\% of the bay area eroding. Reclamation engineering, estuary engineering, policy implementation and urbanization are the main factors affecting the changes in the Jiaozhou Bay wetland, and the main direction of wetland succession is natural wetlands -> artificial wetlands -> nonwetlands. Wetland reclamation in Jiaozhou Bay has led to the continuous extension of the coastline to the sea, especially during the 2005-2020 period, and the wetland area has declined in area by 116 km(2). The changes in the wetland in the past 40 years have affected the changes in the ESV of Jiaozhou Bay, and there have been different synergistic/trade-off relationships in different periods. This research provides data to support the comprehensive ecological management of coastal areas, which is conducive to maximizing the utilization value of wetlands and promoting wetland protection.},

Title = {What's driving solar energy adoption in Brazil? Exploring settlement patterns of place and space},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The energy transition is forcing power systems to face exceptional transformations, with the rise of the distributed generation systems, and the urge of prosumers. This paper aims to investigate the influence of settlement patterns on residential photovoltaic adoption in Brazil, under a cross-section structure, using the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator. Other key drivers are also included as control variables in the analysis. I benefit from a rich dataset of economic, social, housing, and environmental variables for 310,120 census sectors. Variables such as rural/urban dummies or population/housing density, used in previous papers to test for association between settlement patterns and residential PV adoption poorly represent the real relationship between these dimensions. The results of this paper ratify a U-shape relationship between urbanization degree and household solar power uptake. Satellite areas in the surroundings of great urban centers are more likely to present households equipped with photovoltaic systems in Brazil. Besides, the number of housing units, average income, solar resource potential, gender, education, ethnicity, age, housing type, and housing size play an important role in the explanation of the dynamics of household photovoltaic adoption. Policy design must take into consideration these effects in order to democratize photovoltaic home uptake.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to analysis of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) for anticipating the effect of oil spills on the environment in coastal areas. The study location is the coastal area and waters of the Karas District, Fakfak Regency, West Papua Province, Indonesia. The purpose of the study is to determine the priority of areas that are sensitive to oil spills. This method was carried out by scoring each unit of land based on vulnerability, conservation, and social values. ESI Analysis was carried out through geographic information systems and classified into 5 classes of sensitivity levels. The land use classification was carried out through satellite imagery and field surveys conducted in December 2018. The results of resource classification can be divided into 16 classes. The ESI analysis showed that most (51\%) were categorized as insensitive, sensitive low 24\%, very sensitive 15\%, moderately sensitive 6\%, and sensitive 4\%. Although most are not sensitive, it should be followed by effective environmental protection to maintain sustainable development.},

Pages = {191-209},
Abstract = {Scholars have added nuance to debates about technology's effects on journalism by exploring how news organizations adopt technologies. Extending this work, this article argues that technological adoption occurs at the intersection of technological affordances, journalism practice, and internal power relations. It uses interviews and observations with over 100 journalists at eight mainstream television news organizations in the United Kingdom and Canada to compare the adoption of social media and satellite technologies and their affordance of immediacy, a central television news value. Adoption trajectories and use of each set of technologies are found to vary in three respects: the extent to which they afford and shape immediacy; top-down versus bottom-up investment strategies; and effects on news-gathering and transmission practices.},

Journal = {IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 28},
Abstract = {Based on yours suggestion, we have shortened the abstract below 250 words and is mentioned as follows, ``Internet of things (IoT) is the most advanced version of the internet to maintain a number of applications that combines different intelligent devices used by management or individuals, such as remote sensing data processing, smart health with environmental monitoring, and other related fields. IoT devices interact and interfere with one another, posing a variety of security risks. Prior industrial IoT blockchain data transmission methods suffer from lower security, higher management costs for trading centres, and significant supervision challenges. To deal with this issue, Theil-Sen Regressive Miyaguchi-Preneel-based Cryptographic Hash Blockchain approach is proposed in this manuscript for securing data transmission utilizing remote sensing data in IoT (TSR-MPCHB-SDT-RSD). To enhance data transfer security, TSR-MPCHB is proposed. Remote sensing data are gathered using IoT devices. Miyaguchi-Preneel cryptographic function generates every data confusing value. It aids to enhance data privacy with an integrity ratio. The simulation of the proposed approach is done in Java. The performance metrics, namely data privacy ratio, data dependability ratio, process time average delay, average power consumption, and blockchain data transfer efficacy, is examined. The proposed approach attains higher data confidentiality rate of 31.06\%, 12.24\%, 15.64\%, and 11.66\% compared to existing such as Blockchain-Envisioned Secure Data Delivery along Collection Mode for 5G-Base IoT-Enabled Internet of Drones Context (BESDDC-IOD-RSD), BIoTHR: Electronic Health Record Service System in IoT-Blockchain Ecosystem (BIoTHR-SDT-RSD), Blockchain- LamportMerkle Digital Signature: Authentication tool in IoT healthcare (LMDSG-SDT-RSD), and Privacy Protection Blockchain Attain Safe and Dependable Sharing of IoT Data (ACOMKSVM-SDT-RSD).},

Title = {Ontogenetic shifts from social to experiential learning drive avian migration timing},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Learning from one's own experience, and/or social learning from older individuals, could influence decision-making in migrating birds. Here the authors analyse 16 years of tracking data on whooping cranes to show that whether social or experiential learning is the dominant process in migration timing depends on life stage. Migrating animals may benefit from social or experiential learning, yet whether and how these learning processes interact or change over time to produce observed migration patterns remains unexplored. Using 16 years of satellite-tracking data from 105 reintroduced whooping cranes, we reveal an interplay between social and experiential learning in migration timing. Both processes dramatically improved individuals' abilities to dynamically adjust their timing to track environmental conditions along the migration path. However, results revealed an ontogenetic shift in the dominant learning process, whereby subadult birds relied on social information, while mature birds primarily relied on experiential information. These results indicate that the adjustment of migration phenology in response to the environment is a learned skill that depends on both social context and individual age. Assessing how animals successfully learn to time migrations as environmental conditions change is critical for understanding intraspecific differences in migration patterns and for anticipating responses to global change.},

Title = {Mapping fine-scale human disturbances in a working landscape with Landsat time series on Google Earth Engine},

Abstract = {Large fractions of human-altered lands are working landscapes where people and nature interact to balance social, economic, and ecological needs. Achieving these sustainability goals requires tracking human footprints and landscape disturbance at fine scales over time-an effort facilitated by remote sensing but still under development. Here, we report a satellite time-series analysis approach to detecting fine-scale human disturbances in an Ohio watershed dominated by forests and pastures but with diverse small-scale industrial activities such as hydraulic fracturing (HF) and surface mining. We leveraged Google Earth Engine to stack decades of Landsat images and explored the effectiveness of a fuzzy change detection algorithm called the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality, and Trend (BEAST) to capture fine-scale disturbances. BEAST is an ensemble method, capable of estimating changepoints probabilistically and identifying sub-pixel disturbances. We found the algorithm can successfully capture the patterns and timings of small-scale disturbances, such as grazing, agriculture management, coal mining, HF, and right-of-ways for gas and power lines, many of which were not captured in the annual land cover maps from Cropland Data Layers-one of the most widely used classification-based land dynamics products in the US. For example, BEAST could detect the initial HF wellpad construction within 60 days of the registered drilling dates on 88.2\% of the sites. The wellpad footprints were small, disturbing only 0.24\% of the watershed in area, which was dwarfed by other activities (e.g., right-of-ways of utility transmission lines). Together, these known activities have disturbed 9.7\% of the watershed from the year 2000 to 2017 with evergeen forests being the most affected land cover. This study provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness and reliability of BEAST for changepoint detection as well as its capability to detect disturbances from satellite images at sub-pixel levels and also documents the value of Google Earth Engine and satellite time-series imaging for monitoring human activities in complex working landscapes.},

Abstract = {The expansion of resource tax to the occupation of natural ecological space is an important part of China's tax reform. This paper quantifies the occupation of natural ecological space based on the demand for energy, water, and agriculture resources in terms of an ecological footprint, and creatively convert the carbon emissions from energy consumption to occupation of carbon sinks such as woodlands and grasslands, to obtain the ecological deficits in various regions of China. Based on the evaluation of the ecological service value, the paper determines the correspondence between consumption projects, land types and ecological functions, realized the accounting of the economic value of the national ecological deficit as the sum of the regional deficits. Based on this, the ecological deficit is used as an unpaid input factor in the construction of a green Social Accounting Matrix table, and a recursive dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model is used to analyze the effects of a tax policy on the compensation for the ecological deficit value. The simulation results show that the double-dividend hypothesis exists in the primary and tertiary industries, and employment in the secondary industry that with a high value-added labor decreased, resulting in decreases in both the labor income of residents and their proportion of the national income. The growth rate of GDP decreases in the short term and then gradually increases. Capital appreciation and net exports contribute greatly to economic growth. Based on the positive role of taxation schemes in reducing ecological deficits and their negative impacts on economic growth and the income distribution, this paper suggests that, with the improvement of big data on ecological occupation, an ecological deficit tax can be introduced to target the energy sector, which has a large ecological footprint. In addition, household income should be protected through tax cuts, transfer payments, and earmarked funds, among other means, to promote economic growth and protect the environment.

Abstract = {Flood disasters in Southeast Asia result in significant loss of life and economic damage. Remote sensing information systems designed to spatially and temporally monitor floods can help governments and international agencies formulate effective disaster response strategies during a flood and ultimately alleviate impacts to population, infrastructure, and agriculture. Recent destructive flood events in the Lower Mekong River Basin occurred in 2000, 2011, 2013, and 2016 (http://ffw.mrcmekong.org/historical\_rec.htm, April 24, 2017). The large spatial distribution of flooded areas and lack of proper gauge data in the region makes accurate monitoring and assessment of impacts of floods difficult. Here, we discuss the utility of applying satellite-based Earth observations for improving flood inundation monitoring over the flood-prone Lower Mekong River Basin. We present a methodology for determining near real-time surface water extent associated with current and historic flood events by training surface water classifiers from 8-day, 250-m Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data spanning the length of the MODIS satellite record. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) signature of permanent water bodies (MOD44W; Carroll et al., 2009) is used to train surface water classifiers which are applied to a time period of interest. From this, an operational nowcast flood detection component is produced using twice daily imagery acquired at 3-h latency which performs image compositing routines to minimize cloud cover. Case studies and accuracy assessments against radar-based observations for historic flood events are presented. The customizable system has been transferred to regional organizations and near real-time derived surface water products are made available through a web interface platform. Results highlight the potential of near real-time observation and impact assessment systems to serve as effective decision support tools for governments, international agencies, and disaster responders.},

Abstract = {The management of a territory is a complex process, involving a number of different operators, administrators and decision makers. Territory management requires accessing and processing a wide range of heterogeneous and multi-dimensional GI (GI). Within a typical scenario, the process involves departments at public administrations responsible for urban planning, environmental control, infrastructure planning and maintenance. Additionally units such as civil protection, fire brigades also play a vital role when dealing with emergencies. Data to be managed range from alphanumerical information, stored within enterprise-level databases, to satellite imagery, vector data and information coming from on-site sensors. It is acknowledged that creating an infrastructure capable to provide access to such a range of information requires, an integrated system approach, both from a technological and from a procedural point of view. This article illustrates the benefit of adopting a system approach which makes use of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) and 3D geobrowsers to provide an answer to the aforementioned shortcomings. To do so the article presents the client-server platform designed to support decision makers and experts from local or regional administrations in the process of managing their territory. The infrastructure developed allows a large number of concurrent applications to access geographical data in a fully interactive way, within a 3D environment, thus providing support to territorial and environmental management tasks. The work illustrates also the results of the application of the infrastructure within a real-life scenario, thus providing the chance to discuss of implications of adopting such an approach.},

Title = {Modeling air pollution-related hospital admissions employing remote sensing and geographical information systems},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {261},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Land-use regression models and remote sensing data have been widely employed to forecast atmospheric aerosol levels. Recently, these methodologies have been combined to predict the influence of this pollutant on human health. However, traditional land-use regression models do not often consider the complex interactions between predictors, and most of these do not include socioeconomic variables. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to estimate suspended particle-related hospital admissions by employing remote sensing, meteorological, environmental, and demographic parameters. In this cohort study, we analyzed 1,612,049 hospital admissions from C ` ordoba city, Argentina, from 2005 to 2011, and developed several regression and machine learning land-use models to compare their predictive powers. We found that childhood was the age group with the highest number of hospital admissions related with upper respiratory tract diseases. When predicting populationnormalized hospital admissions, the machine learning models, in particular the generalized boosted machine, revealed a better performance than regression models, exhibiting the lowest root mean square error (0.4264) in the test data set. This model also achieved the best R2adj (0.6088) when plotting predicted vs. reported normalized cases. The most important predictors were the meteorological variables, followed by the aerosol optical depth and the planet boundary layer height. Some other predictors, such as educational level, land value, and unsatisfied basic needs, showed less relevance but enhanced the model's prediction power. Furthermore, the predictive power increased after a 1-day lag in hospital admissions (RMSE = 0.4121), highlighting the importance of meteorological and environmental variables in the onset of respiratory diseases.},

Abstract = {Land use and its dynamics have attracted considerable scientific attention for their significant ecological and socioeconomic implications. Many studies have investigated the past changes in land use, but efforts exploring the potential changes in land use and implications under future scenarios are still lacking. Here we simulate the future land use changes and their impacts on ecosystem services in Northeast China (NEC) over the period of 2000-2050 using the CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) model under the scenarios of ecological security (ESS), food security (FSS) and comprehensive development (CDS). The model was validated against remote sensing data in 2005. Overall, the accuracy of the CLUE-S model was evaluated at 82.5\%. Obtained results show that future cropland changes mainly occur in the Songnen Plain and the Liaohe Plain, forest and grassland changes are concentrated in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains and the western Changbai Mountains, while the Sanjiang Plain will witness major changes of the wetlands. Our results also show that even though CDS is defined based on the goals of the regional development plan, the ecological service value (ESV) under CDS is RMB 2656.18 billion in 2050. The ESV of CDS is lower compared with the other scenarios. Thus, CDS is not an optimum scenario for eco-environmental protection, especially for the wetlands, which should be given higher priority for future development. The issue of coordination is also critical in future development. The results can help to assist structural adjustments for agriculture and to guide policy interventions in NEC.},

Abstract = {Sustainability is an emerging concept in product chains and integrates environmental, social, and economic aspects during the product's life cycle. Recently, the demand for environmental quality has required information about the products' life cycle. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) includes the inventory analysis, where the inputs, outputs and feedback mechanisms of matter and energy for each phase of the product life cycle are systematized, and the Life Cycle Impact Assessment, when the environmental impacts potentials are calculated. A powerful tool to describe the history, use, and location of a product is called geotraceability. This paper presents an environmental life cycle management for storing and retrieving product life cycle data within a food chain (tracing), as well as following the location of the product in real time (tracking), particularly for recall operations in case of a crisis. Information about inputs and outputs can be structured and integrated through LCA. Geographic information can be obtained from satellite imagery and positioning systems. The development and integration of these tools will add value to products and enhance food safety to consumers, as well as the environmental quality within the production area, fostering environmental sustainability to the product life cycle.},

Title = {Mapping for coral reef conservation: comparing the value of participatory and remote sensing approaches},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66\%; RS: 76\%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.},

Title = {Detecting Spatial-Temporal Changes of Urban Environment Quality by Remote Sensing-Based Ecological Indices: A Case Study in Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Panzhihua City is a typical agricultural-forestry-pastoral and ecologically sensitive city in China. It is also an important ecological defense in the upper Yangtze River. It has abundant mineral resources, including vanadium, titanium, and water supplies. However, ecological and environmental problems emerge due to the excessive development of mining, agriculture, animal husbandry, and other non-natural urban economies. Therefore, a scientific understanding of the spatio-temporal changes of the eco-environment of Panzhihua is critical for environmental protection, city planning, and construction. To objectively evaluate the eco-environmental status of Panzhihua, the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) was first applied to Panzhihua, a typical resource-based city, and its ecological environmental quality (EEQ) was quantitatively assessed from 1990 to 2020. This study explored the effects of mining activities and policies on EEQ and used change detection to reveal the spatial-temporal changes of EEQ in Panzhihua City over the past three decades. In addition, this study also verified the suitability of RSEI for evaluating EEQ in resource-based city using spatial autocorrelation, revealed the spatial heterogeneity of EEQ in Panzhihua City using optimized hot spot analysis, and showed different ecological clustering by hot spot analysis at two scales of urban and mining areas. According to the results: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the general eco-environmental condition of Panzhihua is improving, but there are still regional differences. (2) The Moran's I value ranges from 0.436 (1990) to 0.700 (2020), indicating that there is autocorrelation in the distribution of eco-environmental quality. (3) At the mine, the mean value of RSEI dropped by 20-40\%, and the EEQ decreased significantly due to mining activities. (4) A series of ecological restoration policies can buffer the negative impact of mining activities on the ecosystem, resulting in a slight improvement in the quality of the ecological environment. This study evaluates the EEQ of resource-based city and its spatial-temporal changes using RSEI constructed by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which can provide theoretical support for ecological and environmental conditions monitoring, development planning, and environmental protection policy-making of a resource-based city.},

Abstract = {Marine spatial planning and ecosystem models that aim to predict and protect fisheries and wildlife benefit greatly from syntheses of empirical information on physical and biological partitioning of marine ecosystems. Here, we develop spatially-explicit oceanographic and ecological descriptions of the central California Current region. To partition this region, we integrate data from 20 years of shipboard surveys with satellite remote-sensing to characterize local seascapes of ecological significance, focusing on krill, other micronekton taxa, and top predators (seabirds and marine mammals). Specifically, we investigate if micronekton and predator assemblages co-vary spatially with mesoscale oceanographic conditions. The first principal component of environmental and micronekton seascapes indicates significant coupling between physics, primary productivity, and secondary and tertiary marine consumers. Subsequent principal components indicate latitudinal variability in niche-community space due to varying habitat characteristics between Monterey Bay (deep submarine canyon system) and the Gulf of the Farallones (extensive continental shelf), even though both of these sub-regions are located downstream from upwelling centers. Overall, we identified five ecologically important areas based on spatial integration of environmental and biotic features. These areas, characterized by proximity to upwelling centers, shallow pycnoclines, and high chlorophyll-a and krill concentrations, are potential areas of elevated trophic focusing for specific epipelagic and mesopelagic communities. This synthesis will benefit ecosystem-based management approaches for the central California Current, a region long-impacted by anthropogenic factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Land use and land cover modeling in Central Benin},
Booktitle = {IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE ON THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE IN WEST AND NORTHWEST AFRICA},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {512-534},
Abstract = {Land use and land cover is a critical ecosystem component, and changes in land use and land cover have definite and predictable impacts on climate, hydrology, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles. In Benin, land use and land cover changes will happen at high rates, mainly because of a doubling in the population within the next 30 years. In order to estimate the recent and future land use and land cover changes, the remote-sensing-based regional Land Use Model and Information System LUMIS was developed. LUMIS is a spatially explicit raster-based land use and land cover change model. Based on a logistic regression approach, land use changes are driven by a set of natural, demographic, economic and cultural factors. The parametrization of LUMIS was performed for the period of 1991 to 2002, when detailed ecological and socioeconomic data were available. The model accuracy can be classified as medium-to-high, with an area-under-curve value between 0.7 and 0.9. The results show that population density and the distance to the road are the dominant driving forces for the conversion of natural savannah areas into agricultural land. Using the IMPETUS land use scenarios B1 (economic growth), B2 (economic stagnation) and B5 (intervention), future land use changes (until the year 2025) were calculated, and the possible consequences on water availability (see sect. II-4.2) and food security (see sect. II-4.1) were analyzed. While the B1-scenario shows a reduced loss of forest land for agriculture, the B2-scenario is characterized by a high deforestation rate. Furthermore, both scenarios show an increased settlement growth, either caused by positive economic development with an increasing number of off-farm jobs in the cities (B1) or by a high rural-urban migration rate, with more and more people moving into the vicinity of the cities in search of work (B2). Land use and land cover change modeling using LUMIS can be of particular utility in identifying and monitoring the critical development of `Hot-Spots'. LUMIS enables the early detection of land use and land cover changes as well as of planning effective measures to counter such changes.},

Abstract = {Satellite Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a critical part to build information infrastructure for environmental and ecological monitoring in remote areas where the cellular networks are uneasy to cover. When massive IoT terminals pour in the crowded satellite channels, how to enhance the spectrum utility of satellite band and guarantee the system capacity calls for full investigations. In this paper, a secure spectrum optimization scheme is proposed in satellite IoT by introducing blockchain to hamper malicious users to involve in the spectrum sharing. A market-oriented spectrum optimization strategy is designed to improve the satellite systems' benefits wherein the heterogeneous satellite channels are fully be considered and priced. In this circumstance, differentiated pricing is adopted to satisfy the various spectrum users' demands. When applying blockchain to secure the spectrum trading, the edge computing along with the mechanism of user reputation are devised to address the concerns of limited computation power for general IoT devices. Besides, the consensus algorithm of Delegated Proof of Stake is used to improve the computing efficiency so as to better fit in the application circumstance of satellite IoT. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performances of our proposed solution on satellite channel pricing and system benefits.},

Abstract = {Biotic mixing, where introduced and native species mix into a newly formed ecosystem, is an increasing phenomenon worldwide. It particularly affects islands, where the number of introduced plants often exceeds native ones, and where invasive alien species are one of the main threats to terrestrial biodiversity. The mangrove tree species Rhizophora stylosa, first introduced in French Polynesia (South Pacific) in the early 1930s, is now well established and found in nearly all the inhabited islands of the Society archipelago (Bora Bora, Huahine, Moorea, Raiatea, Tahaa, Tahiti). It forms dense thickets on coastal habitats and estuaries, and gradually colonizes native tidal grassland marshes and nearshore rocky habitats. In order to assess its current expansion, we mapped its distribution from satellite images interpretation and ground-truthing fieldwork. Results indicate that mangroves currently cover a total of 41 ha in the Society Islands. Expansion rate seems relatively slow, particularly in Moorea where only 2.8\% of the coastline is colonized over 90 years after its introduction. A preliminary study of the socio-cultural perception of mangroves was undertaken through an online questionnaire sent to local stakeholders and NGOs. It revealed that although more than 70\% of the respondents recognized R. stylosa as an introduced species, 40\% considered that it had positive impacts and only 20\% that it was a harmful species. A more detailed ecological and socio-economical cost-benefit analysis is still needed to provide clearer conclusions on the invasive status of mangroves in the Society Islands, and the most appropriate management strategies to be implemented by local authorities in collaboration with island communities.},

Xinjiang has its distinctive uses for its land, due to its arid climate, and unusually geomorphic characteristics. Oasis is the living place of the people in arid area. Oases are unique landscape in arid and semi arid regions of the world. In this study, urban area in Xinjiang Oasis was analyzed using remote sensing and GIS. Utilizing binary urban/nonurban maps generated by MODIS and DMSP-OLS. Our model can inform urban planners and policy makers about the most probable locations and periods of future urban land cover change. Urban development was achieving momentum in Xinjiang oasis. The MODIS and nighttime light data have many advantages, such as high time resolution, continuity and low cost. It should be very useful to detect larger scale dynamics of environmental changes.},

Abstract = {An accurate model for predicting sugarcane yield will benefit many aspects of managing growth and harvest of sugarcane crops. In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery were used in combination with climate, soil and elevation data to predict field-level sugarcane yield across the multiple sugar mill areas in the Wet Tropics of Australia at different time steps over four consecutive growing seasons (2016-2019). A total of approximate to 1400 field-level measurements were used to train predictive machine learning models of cane yield (t/ha), commercial cane sugar (CCS, \%), sugar yield (t/ha), crop varieties and ratoon numbers. We compared the predictive performance of models based on both satellite imagery only and a fusion of satellite imagery with climate, soil and topographical information. Randomized search on hyperparameters was the method used to optimize and identify the most accurate decision tree-based machine model. Overall, gradient boosting was the most accurate method for predicting sugarcane attributes. The analysis resulted in cane yield, CCS and sugar yield predicted at the field level with R-2 of up to 0.51 (RMSE = 16 t/ha), 0.63 (RMSE = 1 \%) and 0.62 (RMSE = 2 t/ha) as soon as four months before the harvest season. It was also found that sugarcane varieties could be mapped with an accuracy of up to 73.4 \%, while the differentiation of planted and ratoon crops exhibited the lowest accuracy of 45.4 \%. Using a novel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the output of our machine learning models we found that Sentinel-2 derived spectral indices were the most important in predicting cane yield as well as differentiating sugarcane varieties and ratoon numbers. In contrast, climate and elevation derived predictors were the most important in predicting CCS and sugar yield. At the whole sugar mill area level, spatially averaged field-level results predicted mill area cane yield, CCS and sugar yield with R-2 of 0.75 (RMSE = 4.6 t/ha), 0.80 (RMSE = 0.6 \%) and 0.77 (RMSE = 1 t/ha). Early season prediction of sugarcane yields at both fieldand mill-area level could be valuable for informing fertilizer application, harvest scheduling and marketing decisions.},
