Abstract = {Investigating migratory connectivity between breeding and foraging areas is critical to effective management and conservation of highly mobile marine taxa, particularly threatened, endangered, or economically important species that cross through regional, national and international boundaries. The leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea, Vandelli 1761) is one such transboundary species that spends time at breeding areas at low latitudes in the northwest Atlantic during spring and summer. From there, they migrate widely throughout the North Atlantic, but many show fidelity to one region off eastern Canada, where critical foraging habitat has been proposed. Our goal was to identify nesting beach origins for turtles foraging here. Using genetics, we identified natal beaches for 288 turtles that were live-captured off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Turtles were sampled (skin or blood) and genotyped using 17 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Results from three assignment testing programs (ONCOR, GeneClass2 and Structure) were compared. Our nesting population reference data set included 1417 individuals from nine Atlantic nesting assemblages. A supplementary data set for 83 foraging turtles traced to nesting beaches using flipper tags and/or PIT tags (n=72), or inferred from satellite telemetry (n=11), enabled ground-truthing of the assignments. We first assigned turtles using only genetic information and then used the supplementary recapture information to verify assignments. ONCOR performed best, assigning 64 of the 83 recaptured turtles to natal beaches (77 center dot 1\%). Turtles assigned to Trinidad (164), French Guiana (72), Costa Rica (44), St. Croix (7), and Florida (1) reflect the relative size of those nesting populations, although none of the turtles were assigned to four other potential source nesting assemblages. Our results demonstrate the utility of genetic approaches for determining source populations of foraging marine animals and include the first identification of natal rookeries of male leatherbacks, identified through satellite telemetry and verified with genetics. This work highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and tagging programmes in nesting and high-use foraging areas. Moreover, it provides a scientific basis for evaluating stock-specific effects of fisheries on migratory marine species, thus identifying where coordinated international recovery efforts may be most effective.},

Abstract = {Information about regional-level carbon (C) stocks in agroforestry systems (AFS), as well as the annual loss of agroforests and associated C stocks, is scarce, limiting our capacity for increasing C sequestration through establishing, retaining, and enhancing these systems. This study quantified regional-level C stocks and the associated incremental economic value in the forest land-use component of three common AFS (hedgerows, shelterbelts, and silvopastures), estimated the annual loss of hedgerow and silvopasture forests and the associated C, and assessed the potential to enhance C storage through the expansion of shelterbelts in central Alberta, Canada, using publicly available satellite imagery, previously collected field data and the Google Earth Engine platform. Results showed that forests in the three AFS stored 699.9 million tons (Mt) C across 9.5 million hectares (Mha) of land in central Alberta and were valued at \$102.7 billion based on the 2021 Canadian C tax rate of \$40 t(-1) CO2-equivalent. Silvopasture forests in the studied region had the highest C stocks, which were 14.2 and 67.2 times that found in hedgerow and shelterbelt forests, respectively. Between 2001 and 2020, forests in hedgerows and silvopastures declined at rates of 468.1 and 1957.1 ha year(-1), respectively, leading to an 8.4 Mt decline in total C storage over the 20 years. However, there is potential to establish new shelterbelts at many road/field margins, which could increase C stocks by 2.3 times the current C stocks in shelterbelt forests. These results highlight the importance of retaining existing and establishing new AFS for increasing C sequestration, emphasizing the impact of agroforest loss on reducing C storage within agroecosystems. The development of policies that assist or reward landowners for providing the ecosystem service of C storage by retaining, establishing, and enhancing agroforests as part of existing agroecosystem management should be encouraged for mitigating climate change.},

Abstract = {The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will provide two-dimensional maps of water elevation for rivers with width greater than 100 m globally. We describe a modeling framework and an automatic control algorithm that prescribe optimal releases from the Selingue dam in the Upper Niger River Basin, with the objective of understanding how SWOT data might be used to the benefit of operational water management. The modeling framework was used in a twin experiment to simulate the true system state and an ensemble of corrupted model states. Virtual SWOT observations of reservoir and river levels were assimilated into the model with a repeat cycle of 21 days. The updated state was used to initialize a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that computed the optimal reservoir release that meets a minimum flow requirement 300 km downstream of the dam. The data assimilation results indicate that the model updates had a positive effect on estimates of both water level and discharge. The persistence, which describes the duration of the assimilation effect, was clearly improved (greater than 21 days) by integrating a smoother into the assimilation procedure. We compared performances of the MPC with SWOT data assimilation to an open-loop MPC simulation. Results show that the data assimilation resulted in substantial improvements in the performances of the Selingue dam management with a greater ability to meet environmental requirements (the number of days the target is missed falls to zero) and a minimum volume of water released from the dam.},

Abstract = {Due to the explosive increase in the world's population as well as the economic and technological development serving to provide the increasing standard of living, humans intervene more and more into the system and order of nature, therefore causing various damages in the environment. Consequently, damages to the living creatures on some parts of the Earth have become so serious that they endanger the essential elements of the environment that are necessary for living. In order to apply an efficient spatial development policy, the most suitable tools and methods should be found. They should include technical, biological, ecological, legal, official, economic and organizational etc. methods and solutions, i.e. only a systematic approach can lead to success. Based on the above mentioned, elaboration of spatial development strategies is a much more complicated and complex issue than simply development of the economy. The development policy of a given area is a complex of various economic, natural, social coherences, with a special focus on the optimal use of the endogenous resources of the area. In this study we discuss the major relationship and coherences between land-use and the use of space. Based on our former researches, we could observe that in the various development strategies, including the rural development or regional development ones, land is considered as only a resource used in agriculture and its value is calculated primarily based on its agricultural quality. However, nowadays, many researchers are shifting from land-use analysis to the use of space when it comes to endogenous resources and helping to catch up the rural areas.},

Title = {Integration of Farm Financial Accounting and Farm Management Information Systems for Better Sustainability Reporting},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Farmers face an increasing administrative burden as agricultural policies and certification systems of trade partners ask for more sustainability reporting. Several indicator frameworks have been developed to measure sustainability, but they often lack empirical operationalization and are not always measured at the farm level. The research gap we address in this paper is the empirical link between the data needs for sustainability reporting and the developments in data management at the farm level. Family farms do not collect much data for internal management, but external demand for sustainability data can partly be fulfilled by reorganizing data management in the farm office. The Farm Financial Accounts (FFAs) and Farm Management Information Systems (FMISs) are the main data sources in the farm office. They originate from the same source of note-taking by farmers but became separated when formalized and computerized. Nearly all European farms have a bank account and must keep financial accounts (e.g., for Value-Added Tax or income tax) that can be audited. Financial accounts are not designed for environmental accounting or calculating sustainability metrics but provide a wealth of information to make assessments on these subjects. FMISs are much less frequently used but collect more technical and fine-grained data at crop or enterprise level for different fields. FMISs are also strong in integrating sensor and satellite data. Integrating data availability and workflows of FFAs and FMISs makes sustainability reporting less cumbersome regarding data entry and adds valuable data to environmental accounts. This paper applies a design science approach to design an artifact, a dashboard for sustainability reporting based on the integration of information flows from farm financial accounting systems and farm management information systems. The design developed in this paper illustrates that if invoices were digitized, most data-gathering needed for external sustainability reporting would automatically be done when the invoices is paid by a bank transfer. Data on the use of inputs and production could be added with procedures as in current FMISs, but with less data entry, fewer risks of differences in outcomes, and possibilities of cross-checking the results.},

Abstract = {The quantitative analysis of the drainage morphometric system is vital to understand the hydrological and environmental interaction and its processes of an area. The present study deals with quantitative characteristics of morphometry of steep slope and short length sub-basin of R. Thamirabarani in Kanyakumari District, Tamilnadu, India, using geospatial technology. In this study, the digital elevation model data product (ASTER DEM), Landsat ETM+ image and Survey of India topographical map were used to delineate slope, relief and drainage system structures such as drainage pattern, stream order, stream network and stream length of the sub-basin using ArcGIS 9.3 software. The morphometric analysis deals with hydrologic processes such as stream frequency, bifurcation ratio, circulatory ratio and length of overland flow of the sub-basin area and their influences on the local morphologic landforms. The quantitative measurement of these characteristics is used to explore the basin's contribution to the hydrological cycle and the shape, size and formation of the local landscapes in the region. Moreover, the hypsometric analysis and denudation rate were estimated for understanding the quantitative geomorphological characteristics of the sub-basin. The relationship of the morphometric parameters reveals that the drainage network is strongly controlled by geological and geomorphological structures of the area. The geometry of streams exhibits dendritic drainage pattern associated with coarse drainage texture in primary order of streams present on hilly terrain surface and semi-dendritic pattern in higher stream order flow on less elevated surface with gentle slope. The drainage density of the study area ranges from 0.1 to 1.89 km/km(2), and the maximum density value was found along the higher stream order. The mean bifurcation ratio of this area is 4.21 and the high ratio was measured between the third and fourth order of stream segments. The morphometry of this area is depicted by the length of the stream segment, drainage pattern and stream flow direction, which are influenced by relief, steep slope and local geological structure. Furthermore, the sub-basin is found to be strongly elongated in shape with a length of 42.78 km, and the circularity ratio of this area is measured as 0.33 and elongation ratio as 0.57. The textural dissection of the landforms shows low drainage density in the high elevated hilly terrain in the north and high level in the plain areas in the southern part. The values of the circulatory ratio, length of overland flow and elongation ratio are relatively close to one another and the relationship among them shows their influences on the process of surface runoff and sediment deposition along the estuary landforms in the study area. Moreover, it is observed that the hypsometric curve of this study area is characterized by convex-up shape in nature and represents the youth stage (inequilibrium) of landscapes. Consequently, the hypsometric integral value 0.49 reflects the distribution of a major volume of the landmass (435.32 km(2)) at relatively low elevations (< 180 m). The morphometric parameters-induced denudation rate of this study area is 65.14 t/km(2)/year and indicates the occurrence of a wide range of denudation intensities throughout the sub-basin, which is relatively proportional to the suspended sediment yield that is transported in the suspension per unit area. Based on the realistic output, it is proved that remote sensing and GIS are effective tools for morphometric studies of the drainage basin.},

Title = {Threatened and specialist species suffer from increased wood cover and productivity in Swiss steppes},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {258},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In Switzerland, steppe vegetation is restricted to inner alpine dry valleys in the West (Valais) and the East (Grisons). They harbour many specialist and threatened species. In 2011, a long-term program was established to monitor changes in Swiss habitats of national importance. Here, we studied patterns of vascular plant diversity in a subset of 148 steppe plots of 10 m(2) from this program. Plots were either grazed or abandoned. On average, we found 23.3 species per plot. The proportion of steppe specialists and of threatened species out of the total species richness was 29.3\% and 12.2\%, respectively. The total number of species increased with elevation and peaked at intermediate productivity levels. In contrast, the proportion of threatened and steppe specialist species was generally negatively related to higher productivity and wood cover - two factors considered as indicators of habitat degradation. Abandonment vs. pasture had no effects on total species richness. Productivity was positively related to ecological indicator values for moisture, competition and ruderality, as well as the community mean traits of plant height and specific leaf area, but negatively with the indicator value for light. Similarly, wood cover was positively associated with higher ecological indicator values for productivity, moisture and competition, as well as the community mean trait of plant height, but negatively with the indicator value for light and ruderality. The negative response of threatened and steppe specialist vascular plant species to habitat degrading factors suggests their proportional richness to be a better indicator of habitat quality than the total species richness. We conclude that management regimes which guarantee low productivity and low wood cover and avoid intensification by fertilization and irrigation are essential for the conservation of steppe habitats. Beside periodic clearing of woody species, low-intensity grazing might prevent shrub encroachment.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out in the teaching and research forest of the University of Dschang in Belabo, with the aim of analysing land-cover and land-use changes as well as carbon stocks dynamic. The databases used are composed of three Landsat satellite images (5TM of 1984, 7ETMthornof 2000 and 8OLI of 2016), enhanced by field missions. Satellite images were processed using ENVI and ArcGIS software. Interview, focus group discussion methods and participatory mapping were used to identify the activities carried out by the local population. An inventory design consisting of four transects was used to measure dendrometric parameters and to identify land-use types. An estimation of carbon stocks in aboveground and underground woody biomass was made using allometric models based on non-destructive method. Dynamic of land-cover showed that the average annual rate of deforestation is 0.48\%. The main activities at the base of this change are agriculture, house built-up and logging. Seven types of land-use were identified; adult secondary forests (64.10\%), young secondary forests (7.54\%), wetlands (7.39\%), fallows (3.63\%), savannahs (9.59\%), cocoa farms (4.28\%) and mixed crop farms (3.47\%). Adult secondary forests had the highest amount of carbon (250.75 t C ha(-1)). This value has decreased by more than 60\% for mixed crop farms (94.67 t C ha(-1)), showing the impact of agricultural activities on both forest cover and carbon stocks. Agroforestry systems that allow conservation and introduction of woody species should be encouraged as part of a participatory management strategy of this forest.},

Abstract = {Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is crucial for several purposes like town planning, hydrological analysis, land sliding, flash floods, earthquake, road construction, surface analysis, ortho-rectification of satellite imagery, 3D visualization, precise farming and forestry, base mapping, flight simulation and disaster management. Pleiades is a French constellation of very high resolution satellites. It acquires both panchromatic as well as multispectral imagery in Visible Near Infra-red (VNIR) range. The added benefit of Pleiades is that it provides tri stereo-pair imagery at 0.5m spatial resolution, unlike its other contemporary systems like Quickbird and IKONOS. Tri stereo-pair is used for Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) extraction because of its backward and forward look angles. Moreover, Pleiades provides Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RPC) and sensor model data which augment the accuracy of its 3D products. Being a newly launched system, it provides fertile field for researchers to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this system. This study explores the potential of Pleiades Tri stereo-pair in generating high resolution DEM, and comparing its accuracy with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Advanced Space Thermal Emission Radiometer (ASTER). In this study, data from space borne LiDAR (ICESat/GLAS) was used as a reference due to its reported unprecedented accuracy. Comparison of Pleiades with LiDAR resulted in an R2 of 0.92 with an RMSE of 5.2m. Similarly, comparison of SRTM and ASTER resulted in an R2 of 0.74 (RMSE 7.5m) and R2 0.84 (RMSE 6.6m), respectively.},

Title = {A multi-sensor approach for detecting the different land covers of tidal flats in the German Wadden Sea - A case study at Norderney},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {188-202},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The tidal flats of the Wadden Sea are a highly dynamic and largely natural ecosystem with high economic and ecological value but which are also at risk due to climate change, rising sea levels, algae blooms, invasive species and marine pollution. There is a need for the detection of emerging changes and the potential loss of the natural or semi-natural ecosystems accompanied by a decrease in water quality. Accessibility both from sea and land is very poor, which makes the monitoring and mapping of tidal flat environments from in situ measurements very difficult In this study, a multi-sensor concept for the classification of intertidal areas in the Wadden Sea is developed. The basis for this method is a combined analysis involving RapidEye (RE) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data combined with ancillary vector data about the distribution of vegetation, shellfish beds and sediments for the accuracy assessment The overall methodology is based on a hierarchical decision tree. First, the water coverage is separated from the tidal flats by using the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Second, the shellfish beds are estimated with the textural features of the TSX data and morphologic filters (MFs). Third, the classification of vegetation (salt marsh, sea grass/algae) is based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), object-based features and exclusionary criteria. The remaining area is then separated into different sediment types with an algorithm that uses a thresholding technique applied to radiometric values, the MSAVI and a majority filter. The results show that we are able to identify the location and shape of salt marsh and shellfish beds (a true positive rate of 0.63 and a precision of 0.55) by using multi-sensor remote sensing data. A detailed shellfish bed classification can only be done with radar sensors, like TSX. The extraction of the sea grass areas from the multi-sensor approach is difficult Sea grass often grows very sparsely in the study area which, with respect to the spatial resolution of RE, leads to a mixture of the spectral signatures of sediment and sea grass. The classification of the sediment types in tidal flats is a challenge compared to vegetation and shellfish beds. An overall accuracy of 64.53\%, 66.85\%, 68.22\% and 68.2\% was achieved. The results emphasize that a sediment-type classification cannot be achieved with high accuracy using spectral properties alone due to their similarity, which is predominately caused by their water content.

Title = {Discrimination of Settlement and Industrial Area Using Landscape Metrics in Rural Region},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Detailed and precise information of land-use and land-cover (LULC) in rural area is essential for land-use planning, environment and energy management. The confusion in mapping residential and industrial areas brings problems in energy management, environmental management and sustainable land use development. However, they remain ambiguous in the former rural LULC mapping, and this insufficient supervision leads to inefficient land exploitation and a great waste of land resources. Hence, the extent and area of residential and industrial cover need to be revealed urgently. However, spectral and textural information is not sufficient for classification heterogeneity due to the similarity between different LULC types. Meanwhile, the contextual information about the relationship between a LULC feature and its surroundings still has potential in classification application. This paper attempts to discriminate settlement and industry area using landscape metrics. A feasible classification scheme integrating landscape metrics, chessboard segmentation and object-based image analysis (OBIA) is proposed. First LULC map is generated from GeoEye-1 image, which delineated distribution of different land-cover materials using traditional OBIA method with spectrum and texture information. Then, a chessboard segmentation of the whole LULC map is conducted to create landscape units in a uniform spatial area. Landscape characteristics in each square of chessboard are adopted in the classification algorithm subsequently. To analyze landscape unit scale effect, a variety of chessboard scales are tested, with overall accuracy ranging from 75\% to 88\%, and Kappa coefficient from 0.51 to 0.76. Optimal chessboard scale is obtained through accuracy assessment comparison. This classification scheme is then compared to two other approaches: a top-down hierarchical classification network using only spectral, textural and shape properties, and lacunarity based hierarchical classification. The distinction approach proposed is overwhelming by achieving the highest value in overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient and McNemar test. The results show that landscape properties from chessboard segment squares could provide valuable information in classification.},

Abstract = {Geosynchronous orbits have the unique characteristic that their orbital period is equal to one sidereal day. This configuration does provide coverage on a regional scale. This is a potential advantage in terms of system usage as the demand for some satellite services is concentrated in certain regions of the globe. This paper investigates both active and passive configurations, highlighting their different features and advantages. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) simulator has been developed to study the influence of integration time on SAR processing in both low earth orbit (LEO) and geosynchronous SAR (GeoSAR) configurations. Different scenarios with targets affected by noise sources with various decorrelation time have been simulated in order to test the system response. Simulations show that in a geosynchronous SAR the long integration time averages out non-stationary signals within the resolution cell converting their influence to background clutter. Indeed, noise rejection is effective even if noise amplitude is one order of magnitude larger than the sigal itself. The features that have been demonstrated via numerical simulations could be exploited in new SAR applications. SAR interferometry can benefit of the increased temporal correlation as all the high frequency components of interferometric phase noise have been previously filtered out. Fine temporal sampling is a feature that might be exploited for disaster management and might lead to major advances in the understanding of rapidly evolving phenomena on the ground surface. Future applications can be foreseen also in soil moisture retrieval and other related agricultural applications. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing Spatial Variation and Driving Factors of Available Phosphorus in a Hilly Area (Gaozhou, South China) Using Modeling Approaches and Digital Soil Mapping},

Abstract = {Soil fertility plays a crucial role in crop growth, so it is important to study the spatial distribution and variation of soil fertility for agricultural management and decision-making. However, traditional methods for assessing soil fertility are time-consuming and economically burdensome. Moreover, it is hard to capture the spatial variation of soil properties across continuous geographic space using the conventional methods. As key techniques of digital soil mapping (DSM), spatial interpolation techniques have been widely applied in soil surveys and analysis in recent years, since they can predict soil properties at unknown points in continuous space based on limited sample points. However, further research is needed on spatial interpolation models for DSM in regions with variable climates and complex terrains, which are characterized by strong spatial variation in both environmental variables and soil fertility. In this study, taking a typical hilly area in a subtropical monsoon climate, i.e., Gaozhou, Guangdong Province, China, as an example, the performances of four popular spatial interpolation models (Random Forest (RF), Ordinary Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting, and Radial Basis Function) for digital soil mapping on available phosphorus (AP) are compared. Based on RF, the spatial variation and its driving factors of the AP of Gaozhou are then analyzed. Furthermore, by selecting three typical truncation lines from different directions, the correlations between environmental variables and AP in different spatial positions are demonstrated. The root mean square error (RMSE) results of the above four models are 32.01, 32.08, 32.74, and 33.08, respectively, which indicate that the RF has a higher interpolation accuracy. Based on the mapping results of RF, the minimum, maximum, and mean values of AP in the study area are 38.90, 95.24, and 64.96 mg/kg, respectively. The high-value areas of AP are mainly distributed in forested and orchard areas, while the low-value areas are primarily found in urban and cultivated areas in the eastern and western regions. Vegetation and topography are identified as the key factors shaping the spatial variations of AP in the study area. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of the influence strength of altitude and EVI is revealed, providing a new direction for further research on DSM in the future, i.e., spatial interpolation models considering the spatial heterogeneity of the influence of environmental variables.},

Title = {Land Cover Change and Its Driving Forces in Nepal Since 1990},
Booktitle = {LAND COVER CHANGE AND ITS ECO-ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSES IN NEPAL},
Series = {Springer Geography},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {41-65},
Abstract = {Nepal is a typically mountainous landlocked country. In recent years, land cover in Nepal has changed significantly due to climate changes, population growth and economic development. This study used four periods of land cover change data (1990-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010 and 2010-2015) produced by the object-oriented change detection method, to reveal the spatial patterns of land cover change and its driving forces in Nepal since 1990. The result showed that the total change area from 1990 to 2015 in Nepal is 1665.58 km(2), accounting for 1.13\% of the land. Among these changes, forests, wetlands and permanent ice/snow presented a trend of decrease, whereas croplands, artificial surfaces and bare lands had been continuously increasing. The prominent land cover changes included mutual transformation between wetlands and croplands, wetland class inner shifts and the conversion of forests to croplands. These changes varied among different development regions and during different periods. In general, the intensities of land cover change in Eastern and Central Development Regions were higher than in other development regions. The annual change area was 59.26 km(2)/year during 1990-2000, reached to 98.44 km(2)/year during 2000-2005 and turned to slowly decline after 2005. The analysis and discussion indicated that major driving forces of land cover change in Nepal include climate changes, natural hazards, population growth, urbanization, economic development and government policy implementation. A comprehensive understanding of the relationships between land cover change and various driving forces in Nepal was given in this study, which would be valuable for policymaking, land planning, resource development and protection. Simultaneously, it could be also benefit to China's ``Belt and Road Initiative.{''}},

Title = {Modeling the spatial variation of calcium carbonate equivalent to depth using machine learning techniques},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Inorganic carbon is the largest source of carbon in terrestrial surface, particularly in arid and semiarid regions, including the Chahardowli Plain in western Iran. Inorganic carbon plays an equal or greater role than organic soil carbon in these areas, although less attention has been paid in quantifying their variability. The objective of this study was to model and map calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) presenting inorganic carbon in soil using machine learning and digital soil mapping techniques. Chahardowli Plain in foothills of the Zagros Mountains in the southeast of Kurdistan Province in Iran was taken as a case study area. CCE was measured at 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm depths following GloalSoilMap.net project specifications. A total of 145 samples were collected from 30 soil profiles using the conditional Latin hypercube (cLHS) method of sampling. Relationships between CCE and environmental predictors were modeled using random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) models. In general, the RF model performed slightly superior than the DT model. The mean value of CCE increased with soil depth, from 3.5\% (0-5 cm) to 63.8\% (30-60 cm). Remote sensing (RS) variables and terrestrial variables were equally important. The importance of RS variables was higher at the surface than terrestrial variables, and vice versa. The most significant variables were Channel Network Base Level (CNBL) variable and Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) with the same variable importance value (21.1\%). In areas affected by river activities, the use of the CNBL and vertical distance to channel networks (VDCN) as variables in digital soil mapping (DSM) could increase the accuracy of soil property prediction maps. The VDCN played a principal role in soil distribution in the study area by affecting the rate of discharge and, thus, erosion and sedimentation. A high percentage of carbonate in parts of the region could exacerbate nutrient deficiencies for most crops and provide information for sustainably managing agricultural activity.},

Title = {Monitoring standing herbaceous biomass and thresholds in semiarid rangelands from harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to support within-season adaptive management},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {271},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Adaptive management requires rangeland managers to respond to changing forage conditions (e.g., standing herbaceous biomass) within the grazing season at the scale of individual pastures. While within-season biomass can be measured or estimated in the field, it is often impractical to make field measurements in extensive rangeland systems with adequate frequency and spatial representation for responsive decision-making by rangeland managers. We sought to develop a single model to accurately predict daily herbaceous biomass across seasonally and annually varying conditions from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel satellite time series. We also sought to assess how information about plant community composition derived from a high-spatial resolution map would improve model performance. We used herbaceous biomass data from 1764 ground observations collected over 8 years in North American shortgrass steppe for training in a cross-validated model selection approach to evaluate (1) predictive performance of candidate models both spatially and temporally, (2) relative variable importance of individual spectral bands, vegetation indices, and recently developed broadband spectral angle indices, and (3) the degree to which including plant community composition improved model performance. All 11 candidate models identified in the model selection procedure contained a band angle index and an individual spectral band, and 6 contained one of each input feature type, demonstrating the benefit of combining spectral features for predicting herbaceous biomass across varying conditions. The spatial and temporal cross-validation and selection procedures produced the same top model with similar performance (mean absolute error = 151-182 kg ha(-1); R-2 = 0.75-0.79), suggesting that a single model performs well over space and time. Including plant community composition in the model reduced mean absolute error by 11-13\%. Bootstrapping revealed that -six to seven years of training data were required to achieve consistent model performance across years with varying environmental conditions (e.g., wet, average, dry). The top model could accurately detect (70-87\% accuracy) the week that biomass dropped below management-related thresholds as low as 450 kg ha(-1) in an independent dataset (n = 950) with modest commission error (10-26\%). We discuss how maps showing the probability that herbaceous biomass is below a given threshold can support adaptive management in extensive semiarid rangelands across differing scenarios of risk perception and avoidance. In addition to producing maps to support precision rangeland management strategies, this study demonstrates the importance of combining complementary vegetation indices and acquiring long-term training datasets to achieve reliable predictions of herbaceous standing biomass in highly variable systems.},

Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {This paper reports the decision-making process of a forest company to implement LiDAR technology for mapping and inventory issues. The methodology consisted in comparing the accuracy obtained by using LiDAR-derived data, with that obtained by both photogrammetry and satellite imagery in two applications: i) altimetric accuracy on profile estimation, and ii) planimetric accuracy on perimeter and area estimation. As a result, LiDAR showed greater accuracy than alternative methods in the altimetric analysis; however, LiDAR did not show significant differences with the photogrametric method in the planimetric analysis. The economic evaluation of incorporating LiDAR for planning harvesting, forest tracks and plantations establishment, resulted profitable with a net present value of USD \$ 2 095 000, at a discount rate of 10\%.},

Abstract = {Flood occurrence is naturally annihilating, with enormous consequences on human lives, properties and resources. Thus, its occurrence worldwide, has serious environmental and socio-economic implications. In view of this, the incorporation of an all-encompassing flood management scheme is indispensable to mitigate the effects of the flood on human lives, resources and other livelihoods. The preliminary objective of this study was to assess the vulnerability of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana to flooding by applying the frequency ratio modeling technique to integrate nine conditioning factors derived from climatic and remote sensing datasets. The nine conditioning factors, which comprise the slope aspect, topographic roughness index (TRI), topographic positioning index (TPI), stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), profile curvature, LS factor, rainfall and drainage density were employed in outlining various flood prone zones within the study area using geographic information systems (GIS). 70\% of flood inventory data (consisting of various locations of flood occurrence within the study area) were chosen randomly to produce the flood susceptibility model. The remaining 30\% of the flood inventory data (validation data) were employed to validate and evaluate the efficacy of the flood vulnerability results generated. The flood vulnerability model (FVM) was discretised into five classes of very high (751.33 km(2)), high (333.19 km(2)), moderate (387.88 km(2)), low (479.33 km(2)) and very low (1590.55 km(2)) zones representing, respectively, 21.21\%, 9.41\%, 10.95\%, 13.53\% and 44.90\% of the total study area size. This was succeeded by applying the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve on the output generated (flood vulnerability model) to assess its performance and accuracy. An AUROC score value of 0.788 was obtained, which shows that the model generated is accurate for the study area.},

Title = {A spatial analysis of the development potential of rooftop and community solar energy},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Solar energy is a technically and economically feasible solution for transitioning to renewable sources for electrification. Physical and socio-economic conditions that are important determinants of solar access and use have been discussed in the literature. However, the relative access of different population groups to surfaces able to accommodate equipment to generate solar energy (both individual and community levels) is rarely investigated. In this study, we use remote sensing (e.g., LiDAR) and land use data (e.g., tax parcels) to identify residential rooftop and community solar potential (SP) in Erie County, New York. Underlying socio-demographic and urbanization context are then examined to show if community solar is a solution for population groups who have limited access to rooftop solar. Results indicate that rooftop and community SP have similar distributions among socio-demographic groups. Low income and minority population have not only relatively low access to rooftop solar (54\% compared to affluent households, 60\% compared to white households), but also have limited access to potential community solar sites in their neighborhoods (37\% compared to affluent households, 16\% compared to white households). Nevertheless, our methodology provides a way to identify neighborhoods where community solar can be a solution for population with limited access to rooftop solar. Results show that in selected areas with available space (e.g., brownfields), community solar is an accessible alternative. The results imply the need for policy development to address such access issues so that technological advancements can benefit different communities.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the successful use of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-10 (GOES-10) and -12 (GOES-12), mainly beyond their retirement as operational satellites in the United States, in support of meteorological activities in South America (SA). These satellites were maneuvered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to approximately 60 degrees W, enabling other countries in Central and South America to benefit from their ongoing measurements. The extended usefulness of GOES-10 and -12 was only possible as a result of a new image geolocalization system developed by NOAA for correcting image distortions and evaluated in collaboration with the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. The extension allowed GOES-10 and -12 to monitor SA for an additional 7 years proving the efficiency of this navigation capability implemented for the first time in the GOES series well beyond the expected satellites' lifetime. Such successful capability is incorporated in the new-generation GOES-R series. This practical and technological experience shows the importance of communication between scientists from the United States and SA for advancing Earth's monitoring system through the development of novel software and derived products. For SA in particular, GOES-10 and -12 were employed operationally to monitor dry spells, relevant for agriculture and forest fire management and to nowcast severe weather for flash flood warnings. Additionally, GOES-12 detected the first registered tropical hurricane over the Brazilian coast. This paper describes some of the technical and operational challenges faced in extending the GOES-10 and -12 missions to provide coverage over South America and emphasizes the usefulness of their ongoing measurements benefiting Brazilian environmental monitoring.},

Pages = {17-39},
Abstract = {Nepal, located in a unique transition zone spanning from plains to mountains and then to the plateau, is characterized by diverse and complex land cover. Based on an object-oriented method and decision tree classifier, a land cover product covering the whole of Nepal in 2010 (hereinafter referred to as the NepalCover-2010) was produced using 30 m-resolution Landsat TM images, consisting of 8 classes at Level I and 31 classes at Level II. The accuracy of the NepalCover-2010 product at Level II was validated using samples collected from high-resolution Google Earth images. The result showed that the overall accuracy of the product was 87.17\%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.85, making it the most accurate product among similar land cover products. The product can accurately reflect the spatial patterns of land cover in Nepal. Forests are the main land cover classes, accounting for 41\% of the land, followed by croplands covering about 25\%. The areal proportion of paddy fields to dry farmlands was approximately two to three. Topographical and meteorological factors presented as the determining effects on the spatial patterns of land cover in Nepal. With elevation uplift from south to north, land cover classes showed a vertical zonality ordered thus: paddy fields, evergreen broadleaf forests, dry farmlands, evergreen broadleaf shrubs, evergreen needleleaf forests, grasslands, sparse vegetation, and permanent ice/ snow. Land cover mapping in Nepal contributes significantly to the basic data collection in this country, and can also be of a benefit to China's international regional economic cooperation strategy entitled `` the Belt and Road Initiative{''}.},

Abstract = {At present, flood is the most significant environmental problem in the entire world. In this work, flood susceptibility (FS) analysis has been done in the Dwarkeswar River basin of Bengal basin, India. Fourteen flood causative factors extracted from different datasets like DEM, satellite images, geology, soil and rainfall data have been considered to predict FS. Three heuristic models and one statistical model fuzzy Logic (FL), frequency ratio (FR), multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and logistic regression (LR) have been used. The validating datasets are used to validate these models. The result shows that 68.71\%, 68.7\%, 60.56\% and 48.51\% area of the basin is under the moderate to very high FS by the MCDA, FR, FL and LR, respectively. The ROC curve with AUC analysis has shown that the accuracy level of the LR model (AUC = 0.916) is very much successful to predict the flood. The rest of the models like FL, MCDA and FR (AUC = 0.893, 0.857 and 0.835, respectively) have lesser accuracy than the LR model. The elevation was the most dominating factor with coefficient value of 19.078 in preparation of the FS according to the LR model. The outcome of this study can be implemented by local and state authority to minimize the flood hazard.},

Title = {Remote Sensing Applied to the Study of Fire Regime Attributes and Their Influence on Post-Fire Greenness Recovery in Pine Ecosystems},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We aimed to analyze the relationship between fire regime attributes and the post-fire greenness recovery of fire-prone pine ecosystems over the short (2-year) and medium (5-year) term after a large wildfire, using both a single and a combined fire regime attribute approach. We characterized the spatial (fire size), temporal (number of fires, fire recurrence, and return interval), and magnitude (burn severity of the last fire) fire regime attributes throughout a 40-year period with a long-time series of Landsat imagery and ancillary data. The burn severity of the last fire was measured by the dNBR (difference of the Normalized Burn Ratio) spectral index, and classified according to the ground reference values of the CBI (Composite Burn Index). Post-fire greenness recovery was obtained through the difference of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) between pre- and post-fire Landsat scenes. The relationship between fire regime attributes (single attributes: fire recurrence, fire return interval, and burn severity; combined attributes: fire recurrence-burn severity and fire return interval-burn severity) and post-fire greenness recovery was evaluated using linear models. The results indicated that all the single and combined attributes significantly affected greenness recovery. The single attribute approach showed that high recurrence, short return interval and low severity situations had the highest vegetation greenness recovery. The combined attribute approach allowed us to identify a wider variety of post-fire greenness recovery situations than the single attribute one. Over the short term, high recurrence as well as short return interval scenarios showed the best post-fire greenness recovery independently of burn severity, while over the medium term, high recurrence combined with low severity was the most recovered scenario. This novel combined attribute approach (temporal plus magnitude) could be of great value to forest managers in the development of post-fire restoration strategies to promote vegetation recovery in fire-prone pine ecosystems in the Mediterranean Basin under complex fire regime scenarios.},

Title = {Individual variation in migratory movements of chinstrap penguins leads to widespread occupancy of ice-free winter habitats over the continental shelf and deep ocean basins of the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {A goal of tracking migratory animals is to characterize the habitats they use and to interpret population processes with respect to conditions experienced en route to, and within, overwintering areas. For migratory seabirds with broad breeding ranges, inferring population-level effects of environmental conditions that are experienced during migratory periods would benefit by directly comparing how birds from different breeding aggregations disperse, characterizing the physical conditions of areas they use, and determining whether they occupy shared foraging areas. We therefore tracked 41 adult and juvenile chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) from three breeding locations in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region during the austral winter of 2017. The satellite tracking data revealed overlap of individuals over continental shelf areas during autumn months (Mar-May), shared outbound corridors that track the southern Antarctic circumpolar current front, followed by occupancy of progressively colder, deeper, and ice-free waters that spanned the entire western hemisphere south of the Polar Front. Despite broadly similar physical environments used by individuals from different colonies, the proportion of birds from each colony that remained within 500km of their colony was positively correlated with their local population trends. This suggests that local migration strategies near the Antarctic Peninsula may benefit breeding populations. However, the magnitude of inter-colony and intra-colony overlap was generally low given the broad scale of habitats occupied. High individual variation in winter movements suggests that habitat selection among chinstrap penguins is more opportunistic, without clear colony-specific preference for fine-scale foraging hotspots. Mixing of individuals from multiple colonies across broad regions of the Southern Ocean would expose chinstrap penguins from the Antarctic Peninsula to a shared environmental experience that helps explain the regional decline in their abundance.},

Title = {Towards risk-based flood management in highly productive paddy rice cultivation - concept development and application to the Mekong Delta},

Abstract = {Flooding is an imminent natural hazard threatening most river deltas, e.g. the Mekong Delta. An appropriate flood management is thus required for a sustainable development of the often densely populated regions. Recently, the traditional event-based hazard control shifted towards a risk management approach in many regions, driven by intensive research leading to new legal regulation on flood management. However, a large-scale flood risk assessment does not exist for the Mekong Delta. Particularly, flood risk to paddy rice cultivation, the most important economic activity in the delta, has not been performed yet. Therefore, the present study was developed to provide the very first insight into delta-scale flood damages and risks to rice cultivation. The flood hazard was quantified by probabilistic flood hazard maps of the whole delta using a bivariate extreme value statistics, synthetic flood hydrographs, and a large-scale hydraulic model. The flood risk to paddy rice was then quantified considering cropping calendars, rice phenology, and harvest times based on a time series of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from MODIS satellite data, and a published rice flood damage function. The proposed concept provided flood risk maps to paddy rice for the Mekong Delta in terms of expected annual damage. The presented concept can be used as a blueprint for regions facing similar problems due to its generic approach. Furthermore, the changes in flood risk to paddy rice caused by changes in land use currently under discussion in the Mekong Delta were estimated. Two land-use scenarios either intensifying or reducing rice cropping were considered, and the changes in risk were presented in spatially explicit flood risk maps. The basic risk maps could serve as guidance for the authorities to develop spatially explicit flood management and mitigation plans for the delta. The land-use change risk maps could further be used for adaptive risk management plans and as a basis for a cost-benefit of the discussed land-use change scenarios. Additionally, the damage and risks maps may support the recently initiated agricultural insurance programme in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {People's observations of climate change and its impacts, mediated by cultures and capacities, shape adaptive responses. Adaptation is critical in regions of rainfed smallholder agriculture where changing rainfall patterns have disproportionate impacts on livelihoods, yet scientific climate data to inform responses are often sparse. Despite calls for better integration of local knowledge into adaptation frameworks, there is a lack of empirical evidence linking both smallholder climate observations and scientific data to on-farm outcomes. We combine smallholder observations of past seasonal rainfall timing with satellite-based rainfall estimates in Uganda to explore whether farmers' ability to track climate patterns is associated with higher crop yields. We show that high-fidelity tracking, or alignment of farmer recall with recent rainfall patterns, predicts higher yields in the present year, suggesting that farmers may translate their cumulative record of environmental knowledge into productive on-farm decisions, such as crop selection and timing of planting. However, tracking of less-recent rainfall (i.e., 1-2 decades in the past) does not predict higher yields in the present, while climate data indicate significant trends over this period toward warmer and wetter seasons. Our findings demonstrate the value of smallholder knowledge systems in filling information gaps in climate science while suggesting ways to improve adaptive capacity to climate change.},

Title = {Habitat highs and lows: Using terrestrial and UAV LiDAR for modelling avian species richness and abundance in a restored woodland},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {285},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Vegetation structure influences landscape use and habitat quality for many bird species. Owing to the difficulties associated with collecting structural data from traditional field measurements, numerous studies have investigated the utility of Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for providing landscape-scale structural information that may be useful for exploring animal-habitat associations. Notably, almost all of these studies have involved the use of LiDAR from airborne rather than terrestrial platforms. However, vegetation metrics that might be important for explaining bird species occurrence and diversity, such as understory vegetation complexity and overall vegetation volume, may be partially obscured from airborne sensors by tree canopy cover. These challenges might be overcome by terrestrial and UAV LiDAR sensors that can provide detailed information of understory forest strata. For the first time, we collected terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) and unoccupied aerial vehicle LiDAR (ULS) data in a woodland landscape to compare the ability of both sensors to identify relationships among vegetation structural metrics and bird species richness and abundance. Overall, TLS and ULS models provided similar results based on the sampling methodology we used for LiDAR data collection in an open woodland landscape. Canopy roughness, ground vegetation vertical complexity, total vegetation volume and canopy height derived from these sensors were among the most common significant variables in explaining avian diversity and individual species abundance. Individual species abundance models provided better prediction power (up to R2 = 0.82 (TLS) and R2 = 0.83 (ULS)) than bird community abundance by functional guilds (up to R2 = 0.40 (TLS), R2 = 0.41 (ULS)) and overall bird abundance (R2 = 0.10 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)), species richness (R2 = 0.14 (TLS), R2 = 0.14 (ULS)) and diversity (R2 = 0.17 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)). Additionally, we found that several vulnerable bird species are strongly associated with LiDAR structural variables, which may assist with habitat assessment and conservation management.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Malaysia has been recognized as a country with the greatest diversity of mangrove species. In this study, the mangrove forest at Rembau River, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia was classified using multispectral SPOT 5 image. The mangrove vegetation species was identified using texture analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was also utilized to identify vegetation densities in the mangrove area. Classification approach was implemented using Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Eight classes of mangrove species were found within the study site which includes Sonneratia caseolaris, Nypa fruticans Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Xylocarpus granatum, Cerbera odollam, Sonneratia alba, Thespesia populnea and Rhizophora apiculata. The results showed that the highest per pixel classification accuracy (84.81\%) for SPOT 5 image was using NIR band with a 9 x 9 window size. The upstream riverside area was dominated by Sonneratia caseolaris whereas Rhizhopora apiculata were dominant at downstream of the river. Dense vegetation dominates the overall mangrove forest of this study area. However, Sonneratia caseolaris and Nypa fruticans were found in low dense vegetation area. This endangers the firefly habitat. The results suggest preserving mangrove ecosystems to support firefly tourist operations. The findings of this research will benefit in monitoring and conservation of the mangrove habitats for the firefly population. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper will discuss the role of small entrepreneurial companies and business to business (B2B) collaborations to advance the circular economy (CE). The authors will share insights from a U.S.-based research project that examined the drivers, barriers and opportunities for advancing waste repurposing and product reuse/remanufacturing. Many large companies fail to incorporate CE principles into their business strategy due to costs, logistical hurdles and lack of mandates. This presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models to fill the gap and provide critical links for corporations in reverse supply chains while creating new business opportunities with social benefits. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on empirical study of six large corporations with zero waste goals and six entrepreneurs focused on product reuse/remanufacturing or waste repurposing. Some of the participating companies include Dell Technologies, Raytheon, Waste Management, First Solar, Circular Blu, and Seeding Labs. Data was collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with senior managers or founders. The study employs a theoretical model for developing a life cycle management strategy proposed by Sanchez et. al. (2004) and the circular business canvas model (Levandowski, 2016), wherein the authors analyze the emerging drivers, current barriers and future opportunities for business to advance the CE. Findings: The study found that despite the lack of federal regulations in the U.S. a growing number of companies are forming partnerships to reduce waste and advance product reuse or remanufacturing. Key drivers for such trends include customer demands, corporate sustainability commitments and state-level mandates. Technology also plays a critical role in reducing transaction costs and supporting social-marketing strategies and partnerships. Research/practical implications: The study contributes to the research on the relationship between entrepreneurial innovation and the development of CE principles within corporate supply chains, a field that is still in its infant stage (Heshmati, 2015). The study offers valuable lessons for entrepreneurs interested in developing viable business models around product reuse, remanufacturing or waste repurposing. Future research should consider comparing B2B collaborations in the U.S. and Europe to analyze the similarities and differences in business strategies for advancing the CE. Originality/value: This paper provides insights into a field that is still greatly underdeveloped - the role of environmental entrepreneurs entering a new market space based on collaborations with large corporations to advance product reuse/remanufacturing or waste repurposing that promote the circular economy.},

Abstract = {It is crucial to investigate the urban agglomerations spatio-temporal evolution patterns and driving factors for analyzing the urban spatial structure-functional division and promoting the coordinated development of urban agglomerations. In this study, a novel vegetation-building-nighttime light-adjusted index (VBNAI) was established for rapid and effective mapping of urban construction land (UCL) in Central Plains Urban Agglomeration (CPUA), China during 2000-2020 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Compared with traditional indices, VBNAI can significantly decrease the blooming effect, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) saturation, and soil background of nighttime light data. In addition, the urban expansion indices and standard deviation ellipse model were synthetically adopted to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of urban expansion. The gravity model and the geographically weighted regression model were employed to determine the spatial interaction forces and drivers of urban expansion, respectively. The results showed that the VBNAI index has obvious advantages in efficiency and accuracy to extract UCL with the overall accuracy of more than 91\%. The UCL of CPUA had increased by 4489.84 km(2) during 2000-2020 with the gravity center moving towards southeast continuously. From 2000 to 2010, the urban expansion was in a `center-hinterland' pattern which had benefit from the favorable effect of the traffic shaft belt. During 2010-2020, the urban network structure had basically established. Urban expansion had been influenced by a variety of socio-economic and demographic factors, and the impact degree varied from region to region. This study could provide scientific references for facilitating the intensive utilization of urban resources and optimizing the spatial development pattern of urban agglomeration.},

Title = {Quality Assessment of Ecological Environment Based on Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of the Zhoushan Islands},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {With the development of society, the impact of human activities on the ecological environment is becoming increasingly intense, so the dynamic monitoring of the status of the ecological environment is of great significance to the management and protection of urban ecology. As an objective and rapid ecological quality monitoring and evaluation technique, the remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) has been widely used in the field of ecological research. Free available Landsat series data has the character of a long time series and high spatial resolution provides the possibility to conduct large-scale and long-term monitoring of ecological environment quality. Compared with traditional methods, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform can save a lot of time and energy in the data acquisition and preprocessing steps. To monitor the quality of the ecological environment in Zhoushan from 2000 to 2020, the GEE platform was used for cloud computing to obtain the RSEI, which can reflect the quality of the ecological environment. The results show that (1) from 2000 to 2020, the average RSEI value in Zhoushan Islands decreased from 0.748 to 0.681, indicating that the overall ecological environment exhibited a degradation trend. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the change in the area of each ecological environment level indicates that the quality of the ecological environment in Zhoushan Islands exhibited a degradation trend. The proportion of the area with an excellent eco-environment grade decreased by 13.54\%, and the proportion of the area with poor and fair eco-environment grades increased by 3.43\%.},

Title = {A novel framework for turbidity source apportionment of the urban lakeside river network},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Turbidity source apportionment is essential but complex for precise environmental rehabilitation of worldwide urban lakeside river networks impaired by turbidity. A new turbidity source analysis framework including in-situ sampling, vessel monitoring, remote sensing, and hydrodynamic modelling was proposed, where the critical processes of flow reversal from the turbid lake, navigation, and urban non-point source in urban lakeside river networks were explicitly considered. The case study results showed that the turbidity problem (mean value was 211.3 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)) was primarily led by suspended inorganic matter (58\%), followed by suspended organic matter (19\%) and other matter. The Tiaoxi River and busy shipping contributed most to the annual total suspended solids load of the target river, with the same percentage of 34\%. The turbid Lake Taihu provided 64,663 tonnes and 31\% of the total suspended solids load, focusing on the autumn and winter months. Tiaoxi River load was highly concentrated on the storm events, which accounted for 71.4\% of the annual Tiaoxi River source (209846 tonnes). The large water volume of reverse flow and the high TSS concentration of Lake Taihu in the autumn and winter months accounted for the seasonal change in Lake Taihu's TSS load. The coronavirus disease lockdown reduced the mean monthly total suspended solids concentration of 152.4 mg/L in November and December 2019 to 49.2 mg/L in January and February 2020, by limiting the waterway transportation and the market demand for building materials. The river estuary's vegetation interception belt, shipping restriction and rerouting, and integrated catchment management were advised to mitigate the urban river network turbidity.},

Abstract = {Measuring and monitoring mangrove Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential part of monitoring and management of mangrove environments. This study investigated the use of ALOS AVNIR-2 (AVNIR-2) image data for LAI estimation in mangrove environment through semi-empirical analysis, and compared and contrasted the results with different mangrove environmental settings and vegetation structures at sites in tropical Karimunjawa Island (KI, Indonesia) and sub-tropical Moreton Bay (MB, Australia). We used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy to estimate LAI in both sites. The results indicated that the regression analyses showed significant coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.82 at KI and 0.83 at MB. The range of LAI values for KI from 0.88 to 5.33 (n = 76, mean = 2.98, SD = 1.04) and for MB from 0.26 to 3.23 (n = 120, mean = 1.97, SD = 0.45). In terms of site comparison, we found that the results of LAI estimation from field measurement and remote sensing data varies across sites; the Karimunjawa Island mangroves had a comparatively wider range and variation of LAI values than the Moreton Bay mangroves. This difference was attributed to the difference in stand heterogeneity and species composition. Further investigation shows that mangrove LAI values are independent of the mangrove structural formation (i. e. scrub, lowclosed forest, closed forest, etc.). Instead, the LAI value depends on the local spatial variation of mangrove phenological stages and canopy cover. The findings provide an understanding of the spatial variation of mangrove vegetation structure for estimating LAI.},

Title = {Spatial Consistency Assessments for Global Land-Cover Datasets: A Comparison among GLC2000, CCI LC, MCD12, GLOBCOVER and GLCNMO},

Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Numerous global-scale land-cover datasets have greatly contributed to the study of global environmental change and the sustainable management of natural resources. However, land-cover datasets inevitably experience information loss because of the nature of the uncertainty in the interpretation of remote-sensing images. Therefore, analyzing the spatial consistency of multi-source land-cover datasets on the global scale is important to maintain the consistency of time and consider the effects of land-cover changes on spatial consistency. In this study, we assess the spatial consistency of five land-cover datasets, namely, GLC2000, CCI LC, MCD12, GLOBCOVER and GLCNMO, at the global and continental scales through climate and elevation partitions. The influencing factors of surface conditions and data producers on the spatial inconsistency are discussed. The results show that the global overall consistency of the five datasets ranges from 49.2\% to 67.63\%. The spatial consistency of Europe is high, and the multi-year value is 66.57\%. In addition, the overall consistency in the EF climatic zone is very high, around 95\%. The surface conditions and data producers affect the spatial consistency of land-cover datasets to different degrees. CCI LC and GLCNMO (2013) have the highest overall consistencies on the global scale, reaching 67.63\%. Generally, the consistency of these five global land-cover datasets is relatively low, increasing the difficulty of satisfying the needs of high-precision land-surface-process simulations.},

Title = {Are Patagonia grasslands being overgrazed? A response to Marino et al. (2020)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2399-2405},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Based upon primary productivity estimates, Oliva et al. (2019) concluded that, at the end of last century and after long periods of overgrazing, Patagonia's domestic stocks adjusted to regional-scale herbivore carrying capacity. Populations of guanaco, a native camelid, increased thereafter, driving combined grazing pressures once again over carrying capacity in some areas. Marino et al. (2020) argued that grazing is not really at equilibrium because domestic stocks are concentrated in areas that remain overgrazed. They support the ideas that guanaco density is auto-regulated by resource-defence territoriality, and that guanacos are weak competitors with domestic stock, occupying only marginal areas. In their view, Oliva et al. (2019) put guanacos in the role of scapegoats, leaving domestic stocks unchecked. Equilibrium at regional scale does not preclude overgrazing and under-grazing at local scales. By separating areas with and without domestic stocks, Marino et al. (2020) estimated overgrazing at 28\% in Chubut Province and 73\% in Santa Cruz Province. Our recalculations show 28\% and 47\% domestic overgrazing, respectively. However, when combined with guanaco densities, these increase to 48\% for Chubut and 108\% for Santa Cruz. We question the hypothesised lack of competitive value and efficient self-regulating mechanisms that would prevent guanaco populations from overshooting carrying capacity. A dataset of 13 sheep farms showed mean density of 26 +/- 3.8 guanacos/km(2)and high combined grazing pressures. This was also observed in a protected area of Chubut that reached 42 guanacos/km(2)and crashed during drought, with 60\% mortality. Thereafter, guanacos increased to 70 guanacos/km(2), with recruitment rates that showed a complex response of density dependence but remained relatively elevated at densities above the estimated carrying capacity. Synthesis and applications. Marino et al. (2020) are right to question the apparent equilibrium of domestic stocks that are concentrated in areas that may be still overgrazed. But ground data show that guanaco populations have inefficient density population regulation and can reach densities well over carrying capacity, even in the presence of sheep. This does not mean that the main control should be on growing guanaco populations but it stresses our conclusion that joint management of the native-domestic herbivore system is urgently needed. Joint management can be effected through local plans, as current guanaco management permits can only be issued in areas that are not overgrazed by sheep. Farm management plans may in this way transform an apparent competitor into a valuable resource, complementary to sheep raising.},

Abstract = {Water use efficiency (WUE), the carbon uptake per unit of water consumption, is a critical indicator of the coupling between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the spatiotemporal changes in WUE and its drivers is vital for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Herein, we used a remote sensing-driven analytical model to estimate spatiotemporal variations of WUE in China during 2000-2016 and quantified its key drivers. The simulated WUE matched well with the eddy covariance observations across different ecosystems in China, with coefficients of determination of 0.86 and 0.81. The annual WUE increased significantly at a rate of 0.021 g C mm(-1) H2O y(-1) (P < 0.01), with the mean value of 1.62 g C mm(-1) H2O during 2000-2016. Analyses based on a factorial experiment (FE) and the sensitivity method (SE) showed that the increased leaf area index was the largest contributor to the increase in WUE, with contributions of 50.1\% and 42.8\% determined via FE and SE, respectively. CO2 enrichment was the second largest contributor (FE: 20.7\% and SE: 31.4\%), followed by the decrease in the vapor pressure deficit (FE: 15.4\% and SE: 13.4\%). The increased ratio of water loss by canopy interaction had a negative impact on WUE due to the increased non-productive water loss. Although these attributions had some inherent uncertainties, the results highlighted that the significant greening in China, which was mainly caused by human land-use management, and increased CO2 concentrations significantly promoted WUE during the recent 17 years.},

Abstract = {OzFlux is the regional Australian and New Zealand flux tower network that aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess trends, and improve predictions, of Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate. This paper describes the evolution, design, and current status of OzFlux as well as provides an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from all sites within the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and two sites from New Zealand. The response of the Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies except that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70 \%) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had a similar radiation-use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The two New Zealand sites represented extremes in productivity for a moist temperate climate zone, with the grazed dairy farm site having the highest GPP of any OzFlux site (2620 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) and the natural raised peat bog site having a very low GPP (820 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing, and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux, and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances, including drought, fire, land-use and land-cover change, land management, and climate change, which are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human, and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australasia.},

Title = {A Novel Approach to Using Seabed Geomorphology as a Predictor of Habitat Use in Highly Mobile Marine Predators: Implications for Ecology and Conservation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Understanding how marine predators find patchily distributed prey resources in a dynamic environment is key to identifying important ecological areas for ecosystem-level conservation management. However, the mechanisms underpinning important foraging areas often result from complex interactions between static and dynamic covariates (e.g. topography and currents). Modelling habitat associations with hydrodynamic processes is rarely useful when attempting to identify and characterise foraging areas across an individual's foraging range. Investigating the influence of static habitat features on predator behaviour can provide a more tractable baseline understanding of habitat associations, upon which additional complexity can be added. Seabed gradient covariates (e.g. slope and aspect) are often used, yet such metrics are computed at singular user-defined resolutions, and provide limited ecological insight when used in isolation. Instead, categorising the seabed into geomorphological features may provide better characterisation of seabed structure. Here we explore the utility of a pattern recognition algorithm to delineate whole geomorphological features ({''}geomorphons{''}) on the seabed (e.g. valleys, ridges, footslopes) from bathymetry data, and examine the influence of geomorphology on marine predator habitat use. We demonstrate the potential application of this approach in a case study, examining the influence of geomorphons on the at-sea behaviour of a highly mobile predator inhabiting shelf seas: the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). We analyse GPS tracking data from three seals tagged in the southern North Sea, an area with heterogeneous geomorphology. We use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer foraging and travelling behaviour and model the effect of different feature types on the probability of switching between states. All three seals showed an increased probability of transitioning from travelling to foraging when encountering slopes, footslopes and hollows, and foraging activity was concentrated at slopes on the fringes of the Dogger Bank. We hypothesise that such features may host prey aggregations, and/or lead to increased prey capture success. The results suggest the importance of such areas for grey seals in the southern North Sea, a region undergoing rapid and widespread anthropogenic habitat change. This method could be incorporated into future species distribution models to improve estimates of predator distribution, informing conservation management and marine spatial planning.},

Abstract = {Patagonian archaeology includes several valuable applications of Geographical Information Systems. But mapping, the necessary previous step to analysis, is not always detailed. The case of the middle Limay river basin is presented. The research team has been working in the region for decades, as well as other scholars have, both during and before this time. Only in recent years has been possible to involve direct positioning devices (like GPS) in surveys. Because of that, a considerable amount of information is embedded in conventional cartography, site forms, survey logs and other documents. Part of the data was previously entered in digital databases, and made available to study. The task at hand consisted in developing a georreferenced database of sites by means of digitizing documentation, inventorying and cross-referencing observations, and marking them on satellite images accessed online. We emphasize the importance of keeping simple work processes, the convenience of registering of each mark with precision, and the value of `digging' in the archaeological files. The result -provisory because of its possibility of improvement- is a start point for future research, cultural resource management, or divulgation.},

Abstract = {Salt-affected soils are a major threat to agriculture especially in the semiarid regions of the world. The effective management of these soils requires adequate understanding of not only how water and, hence, solutes are transported within the soil, but also how soil salinity and sodicity spatially interact to determine soil structural breakdown. For sustainable agricultural production, information on quantitative soil quality, such as salinity, is required for effective land management and environmental planning. In this study, quantitative methods for mapping indicators of soil structural stability, namely salinity and sodicity, were developed to assess the effect of these primary indicators on soil structural breakdown. The current levels of soil salinity, as measured by electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil/water suspension, soil sodicity, represented by exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and aggregate stability, were assessed. Remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS), and geostatistical techniques-primarily regression-kriging and indicator-kriging-were used to spatially predict the soil sodicity and salinity. The patterns of salinity (EC) and sodicity (ESP > 5\%) were identified. The effect of land use on these soil quality indicators was found to be minimal. Co-spatial patterns were elucidated between sodic soils (defined by ESP > 5\%) and highly probable mechanically dispersive soils predicted from indicator-kriging of ASWAT scores. It was established that the incorporation of EC with ESP into an objective index, called electrolyte stability index (ESI = ESP/EC), gave a good indication of soil dispersion, although the threshold ESI value below which effective structural breakdown might occur is 0.025, which is twice as small as the expected 0.05. The discrepancies between ESI and ASWAT scores suggest that other soil factors than salinity and sodicity are affecting soil structural breakdown. This calls for further investigation. The study provides valuable information in the form of risk zones of soil structural breakdown for land management. These zones, with a probability of mechanical soil dispersion of > 0.70, require immediate management attention with greater monitoring and amelioration techniques, particularly gypsum or lime application and/or altered cultivation techniques.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The Bush Administration of the United States recently released a revised National Space Policy. Although the revised National Space Policy can be interpreted as a step towards the weaponization of space, it does not necessarily weaponize space. It nonetheless brings to the forefront important legal issues concerning the basing of conventional weapons in space. The present international law matrix on the issue of space-based weapons is to be found in international space law, principally in the Outer Space Treaty, where certain prohibitions apply to nuclear weapons and to weapons of mass destruction, Space must also be used for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development. Space objects must be registered in accordance with the Registration Convention. The UN collective security system and the customary right of self-defence govern the use of force or jus ad bellum. The means and methods through which self-defence is exercised are in turn governed by international humanitarian law. Should space be weaponized the basing of these weapons and their use will be subject not only to international space law but also to the UN Charter and to international humanitarian law. The interface between these legal regimes consequently gains in importance, possibly forcing a reinterpretation of certain space treaties along with a correction in state practice.},

Abstract = {The aims of the research were to: (1) establish a profile of `special recyclers' i.e. those who make special trips by car to recycle their household waste; and (2) establish whether the environmental burden resulting from their activities presents a significant environmental problem than needs pro-active management. The research was undertaken through surveys of recyclers at supermarket recycling centres and at civic amenity sites in Glasgow and across Ayrshire in south-west Scotland. Twenty-two percent of civic amenity recyclers made special trips to recycle, whilst at supermarkets less than 10\% made special journeys. Those making special journeys tended to make shorter journeys than those combining recycling with another activity. Special recyclers also fended, on average, to recycle more items and bring greater weights of recyclable material per trip. No demographic difference was found between the special recyclers and the `non-specials'. The environmental impact of consumer journeys to recycle was estimated from the statistic: `The total distance travelled by car by special recyclers/the total weight deposited by all recyclers'. For the sites of this survey, this statistic ranged in value from 9 km tonne(-1) to 106 km tonne(-l). The lowest impacts of 9 km tonne(-1) were at a supermarket site in a small town with a predominantly local catchment. The highest impacts were at a civic amenity site, in a major town, also used by residents from satellite communities. Over 50\% of special recyclers cited nearness as their prime reason for choosing a particular site, compared with 32\% of non-specials. Although special recyclers in Ayrshire did appear to act reasonably responsibly (environmentally), their activities produced additional environmental burden. Simulation studies demonstrate that up to 34\% reduction in this burden may be possible through encouraging longer intervals between recycling trips. Three quarters of the environmental burden was attributable to less than 5\% of the overall recycling population. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Title = {The Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Mangrove Forest Cover from 1973 to 2020 in Chwaka Bay and Menai Bay, Zanzibar},

Abstract = {Mangroves in Zanzibar have a high value for biodiversity and scenic beauty. However, mangroves are susceptible to anthropogenic and natural environmental disturbances. Although global mangrove monitoring systems exist, it is the practitioners focused on small mangrove areas who are knowledgeable about the area in which they work. This study examined the change in mangrove cover in Chwaka Bay and Menai Bay, between 1973 and 2020, using Landsat satellite data. The transformed divergence (TD) index and Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance were used to calculate separability of land cover classes before classification. The overall accuracies ranged between 82.5 and 92.7\% for Chwaka Bay and 85.5 and 94.5\% for Menai Bay. The kappa coefficients (\& kappa;) were in the range of 0.72-0.90, while the producer's and user's accuracies were between 72 and 100\%. Chwaka Bay's annual decrease in mangrove cover between 1973 and 2020 was 48.5 ha, compared to Menai's 6.8 ha. The loss of mangroves in Zanzibar is linked to illegal timber/pole cutting, firewood collection, charcoal burning, unsustainable aquaculture, and agricultural and urban development. Others are changes in environmental conditions that are suitable for mangroves and climate change. This study is crucial in providing a basis for the ecological restoration and management of Zanzibar's mangrove ecosystem.},

Title = {Reproductive tactics of sexes and fitness in the dragonfly, <i>Diastatops obscura</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {The sexual selection strategies of territorial Odonata that do not present courtship behavior is still not completely understood, especially the role of the females. Diastatops obscura Fabricius ( Odonata: Libellulidae) females participate in mate selection in a passive manner, allowing copulation with the first male that captures them and afterwards choosing whether to oviposit or not. This study introduces the idea of female passive choice as an adaptative tactic in intersexual selection. Also discussed is the adaptative value of this tactic and its flexibility according to environmental conditions and reproductive strategies adopted by the males. A natural population of Diastatops obscura was observed in the Pitimbu River of northeast Brazil. Focal continuous and ad libitum techniques were used to record attempted copulation, copulation, and oviposition behavior, in addition to registering male territoriality. An estimate of individual reproductive success ( IRS) was obtained by recording 187 reproductive events. Territorial males, mainly occupying areas near the river margin, achieved greater copulation and oviposition success ( IRS = 0.371) than did satellite males ( IRS = 0.028). Females that copulated with territorial males experienced, for the most part, only one copulation and oviposition event, while those that copulated with satellite males fled or performed a second copulation with a territorial male. Thus, the best tactic adopted by the D. obscura males was to occupy a territory providing the greatest access to females, while the females used passive choice for fitness optimization.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In this study, we used Landsat Earth observations and gridded weather data along with global soil datasets available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to estimate crop yield at 30 m resolution. We implemented a remote sensing and evapotranspiration-based light use efficiency model globally and integrated abiotic environmental stressors (temperature, soil moisture, and vapor deficit stressors). The operational model (Global Yield Mapper in Earth Engine (GYMEE)) was validated against actual yield data for three agricultural schemes with different climatic, soil, and management conditions located in Lebanon, Brazil, and Spain. Field-level crop yield data on wheat, potato, and corn for 2015-2020 were used for assessment. The performance of GYMEE was statistically evaluated through root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), relative error (RE), and index of agreement (d). The results showed that the absolute difference between the modeled and predicted field-level yield was within +/- 16\% for the analyzed crops in both Brazil and Lebanon study sites and within +/- 15\% in the Spain site (except for two fields). GYMEE performed best for wheat crop in Lebanon with a low RMSE (0.6 t/ha), MAE (0.5 t/ha), MBE (-0.06 t/ha), and RE (0.83\%). A very good agreement was observed for all analyzed crop yields, with an index of agreement (d) averaging at 0.8 in all studied sites. GYMEE shows potential in providing yield estimates for potato, wheat, and corn yields at a relative error of +/- 6\%. We also quantified and spatialized the soil moisture stress constraint and its impact on reducing biomass production. A showcasing of moisture stress impact on two emphasized fields from the Lebanon site revealed that a 12\% difference in soil moisture stress can decrease yield by 17\%. A comparison between the 2017 and 2018 seasons for the potato culture of Lebanon showed that the 2017 season with lower abiotic stresses had higher light use efficiency, above-ground biomass, and yield by 5\%, 10\%, and 9\%, respectively. The results show that the model is of high value for assessing global food production.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {The rapid progression of an invasive genotype of common reed along roads and other linear infrastructures in North America provides one of the most spectacular examples of the role of transportation corridors as invasion pathways. In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.},

Abstract = {Acoustic indices are increasingly employed in the analysis of soundscapes to ascertain biodiversity value. However, conflicting results and lack of consensus on best practices for their usage has hindered their application in conservation and land-use management contexts. Here we propose that the sensitivity of acoustic indices to ecological change and fidelity of acoustic indices to ecological communities are negatively impacted by signal masking. Signal masking can occur when acoustic responses of taxa sensitive to the effect of interest are masked by less-sensitive acoustic groups, or target taxa sonification is masked by non-target noise. We argue that by calculating acoustic indices at ecologically appropriate time and frequency bins, masking effects can be reduced and the efficacy of indices increased. We test this on a large acoustic dataset collected in Eastern Amazonia spanning a disturbance gradient of undisturbed, logged, burned, logged-and-burned and secondary forests. We calculated values for two acoustic indices: the Acoustic Complexity Index and the Bioacoustic Index, across the entire frequency spectrum (0-22.1 kHz), and four narrower subsets of the frequency spectrum; at dawn, day, dusk and night. We show that signal masking has a large impact on the sensitivity of acoustic indices to forest disturbance classes. Calculating acoustic indices at a range of narrower time-frequency bins substantially increases the classification accuracy of forest classes by random forest models. Furthermore, signal masking led to misleading correlations, including spurious inverse correlations, between biodiversity indicator metrics and acoustic index values compared to correlations derived from manual sampling of the audio data. Consequently, we recommend that acoustic indices are calculated either at a range of time and frequency bins, or at a single narrow bin, predetermined by a priori ecological understanding of the soundscape.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) modified by the use of tangential, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histologic specimens is advantageous in treating selected skin neoplasms. OBJECTIVE. To review the use of our experience with a modification of MMS to treat lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), lentigo maligna (LM) and other melanoma in situ (MIS) lesions, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), and angiosarcoma. METHODS. Our experience utilizing a modification of MMS in the treatment of 77 patients with LM or other MIS, 23 patients with LMM, 11 patients with DFSP, 1 patient with AFX, and 1 patient with angiosarcoma was reviewed. Length of follow-up and rate of recurrence were examined. A literature review of this pertinent modification of the Mohs technique was performed. RESULTS. One hundred fourteen patients underwent MMS for melanocytic (LM, MIS, LMM), spindle cell (DFSP, AFX), and vascular malignant neoplasms. One patient developed locally recurrent LM and one patient with LMM developed satellite metastasis. Regional lymph node metastasis occurred in one patient with LMM and in a patient with angiosarcoma. CONCLUSION. The use of Mohs micrographic surgery in conjunction with rush formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tangential histologic sections provides the accuracy and tissue conservation of the Mohs procedure while ensuring more confident interpretation of histology in cases of lentigo maligna, lentigo maligna melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atypical fibroxanthoma, and angiosarcoma.},

Title = {Comparison of the Applicability of J-M Distance Feature Selection Methods for Coastal Wetland Classification},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Accurate determination of the spatial distribution of coastal wetlands is crucial for the management and conservation of ecosystems. Feature selection methods based on the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) method include J-M distance with simple average ranking (JM(ave)), J-M distance based on weights and correlations (JM(improved)), and heuristic J-M distance (JM(mc)). However, as the impacts of these methods on wetland classification are different, their applicability has rarely been investigated. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and random forest (RF) classifier, this is a comparative analysis of the applicability of the JM(ave), JM(improved), and JM(mc) methods. The results show that the three methods compress feature dimensions and retain all feature types as much as possible. JM(mc) exhibits the most significant compression from a value of 35 to 15 (57.14\%), which is 37.14\% and 40\% more compressed than JM(ave) and JM(improved), respectively. Moreover, they produce comparable classification results, with an overall classification accuracy of 90.20 \& PLUSMN; 0.19\% and a Kappa coefficient of 88.80 \& PLUSMN; 0.22\%. However, different methods had their own advantages for the classification of different land classes. Specifically, JM(ave) has a better classification only in cropland, while JM(mc) is advantageous for recognizing water bodies, tidal flats, and aquaculture. While JM(improved) failed to retain vegetation and mangrove features, it enables a better depiction of the mangroves, salt pans, and vegetation classes. Both JM(ave) and JM(improved) rearrange features based on J-M distance, while JM(mc) places more emphasis on feature selection. As a result, there can be significant differences in feature subsets among these three methods. Therefore, the comparative analysis of these three methods further elucidates the importance of J-M distance in feature selection, demonstrating the significant potential of J-M distance-based feature selection methods in wetland classification.},

Title = {Waking the Sleeping Giant: Agricultural intensification, extensification or stagnation in Mali's Guinea Savannah},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {58-70},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The World Bank argued that West Africa's Guinea Savannah zone forms part of ``Africa's Sleeping Giant,{''}where increases in agricultural production could be an engine of economic growth, through expansion of cultivated land in sparsely populated areas. The district of Bougouni, in southern Mali, falls within this zone. We used multiple data sources including a panel survey, remote sensing-based land cover classification, population data, and farmer focus group discussions, to investigate whether the area is following a commonly-described pathway of agricultural intensification due to increasing land scarcity. We then used our understanding of historical change to explore plausible future pathways. Bougouni forms part of the expansion zone of the CMDT, which since the mid-1980s has provided support for intensive agricultural systems of cotton-maize rotations with animal traction and use of mineral fertilizer. In the period of the panel survey (1994-2012), cropped land at household level was correlated with household size: households with less than one full team of draft oxen cultivated 0.50 ha/family member, while households with two or more teams cultivated 0.82 ha/family member (R-2 > 0.8). At the village level, cropped land increases varied with the amount of remaining available land and the importance of off-farm income. We see some intensification in maize and cotton, and corresponding improvements in food self-sufficiency. However, despite increasing fertilizer use, average maize and cotton yields remain around 1600 and 900 kg/ha respectively, well below national averages. Other crops are still grown in outfields relying on long fallows with limited nutrient inputs. Thus rather than either intensification or extensification the agricultural situation may be best described as stagnation. This may be due to limited incentives to invest in agriculture when compared to opportunities such as gold mining or small businesses, which (in 2012) contribute at least 25\% of household income to ten out of 29 households. In future, cropland expansion will likely continue, which could lead to increased conflict between farmers and transhumant herders, and could lead to increased inequality at village level. Factors mitigating the tendency to land expansion include opportunities for off-farm income and migration, or market opportunities and capacity to produce high-value crops such as mango, cashew, or vegetables. This could preserve some remaining savannah area for grazing use and conservation purposes. Understanding household livelihood systems as part of a network of complex social and ecological factors allows the identification and exploration of multiple viable pathways towards desirable futures.

Abstract = {A prefeasibility study of a solar power plant project was carried out in order to study and search the best location to install a concentrated solar power plant according to a tender with the Algerian electricity company ``SPE{''} following a specific criteria and methodology in order to obtain a site with a maximum possible irradiation along with other economic constraints. Normally, eleven years of solar irradiation data from an on-ground weather station is needed for site assessment, such data are not available, hence the typical meteorological year irradiation based on satellite imagery results is needed in order to have the accurate value, therefore we can give the right evaluation for the site candidate. Additionally, an analysis of a weather measurement station was carried out to ensure the proper functioning of the weather data reception and analysis processes, and thus to optimize the algorithm of a data logger in order to get the right measurement with a minimum error. The correction algorithm was developed by weather scientists and was added to the data logger main program.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to determine the amount and value of carbon stock in Southwestern Ethiopia's coffee forest from 1978 to 2050, as well as carbon sequestration from 1988 to 2050. Different time-series satellite data were acquired and classified into land-use categories using ArcGIS and ENVI 5:0, followed by IDRISI forecasts up to 2050, and finally modeling with INVEST. Data were collected within the plot constructed in a systematic random sampling manner using quadrates 20 m X 20 m. The social cost of carbon (US\$12/tCO(2)e) used to estimate the monetary worth of the services. Forest conversion anticipated to reduce the carbon stock by 1.86 Mt by the end of 2050, from 65.8 Mt in 1978 to 7.01 Mt in 2018. The rate of Carbon sequestration was 2.1Mt/year at the end of 1998, and it will be reduced to 1.49Mt/year by the end of 2050. Overall, 121.1Mt of CO2 is sequestered over 63 years, but there was also emission from deforestation and service loss (84.4Mt), resulting a net sequestered CO2 of 36.6Mt by the end of 2050. The total elemental carbon stock value in 1978 was \$2. 896 billion, this will be reached \$2.5billion (\$9.175 billion CO(2)e) at the end of 2050. The value of sequestration will be estimated at \$1.715 billion, but with a value loss of \$1.153 billion, the net sink value from 1988 to 2050 will be \$0.6 billion. In general, these findings show that the forest region will have a total storage and sequestration value (CO(2)e) of \$9.775 billion by the end of 2050. The carbon worth in this forest area is thus a good indicator of the importance, and thus the value estimate here may well persuade policymakers to revise their forest-related policy and provide site-specific information to preserve this remnant forest.},

Title = {Geospatial Assessment of Water-Migration Scenarios in the Context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 11, and 16},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Communities and countries around the world are gearing up efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda goals and targets. In this paper, the water and migration scenarios are explained with a focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 (water-related), 11 (urbanization), and 16 (peace and political stability). The study has two phases. The first phase illustrates the application of geospatial data and tools to assess the water-migration interlinkages (nexus) by employing a case study approach. Three case studies, Lake Chad, the Aral Sea region, and the Nile Delta, representing various geographic and socio-political settings, were selected to perform the multitemporal analysis. For this analysis, a mixed toolset framework that combined algorithmic functions of digital image processing, the Landsat sensor data, and applied a geographic information system (GIS) platform was adopted. How water-related events directly or indirectly trigger human migration is described using spatial indicators such as water spread and the extent of urban sprawl. Additionally, the geospatial outputs were analyzed in tandem with the climate variables such as temperature, precipitation data, and socio-economic variables such as population trends and migration patterns. Overall, the three case studies examined how water and climate crisis scenarios influence migration at a local and regional scale. The second phase showcases global-scale analysis based on the Global Conflict Risk Index (GCRI). This indicator reflects on the risks and conflicts with environmental, social, and political aspects and comments on the connection of these dimensions with migration. Together, the two phases of this paper provide an understanding ofthe interplay of water-related events on migration by applying the geospatial assessment and a proxy global index. Additionally, the paper reiterates that such an understanding can serve to establish facts and create evidence to inform sustainable development planning and decision making, particularly with regard to SDGs 6, 11, and 16. Targets such as 6.4 (managing water stress), 6.5 (transboundary challenges) and, 11.B (adaptation and resilience planning) can benefit from the knowledge generated by this geospatial exercise. For example, the high GCRI values for the African region speak to SDG targets 11.B (integrated policies/plans) and 16.7 (decision support systems for peaceful societies). Two key highlights from the synthesis: (a) migration and urbanization are closely interconnected, and (b) the impact of water and climate crisis is comparatively high for rural-urban migration due to the considerable dependence of rural communities on nature-based livelihoods. In conclusion, geospatial analysis is an important tool to study the interlinkages between water and migration. The paper presents a novel perspective toward widening the scope of remote sensing data and GIS toward the implementation of the SDG Agenda.},

Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {10},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {The sustainable economic advancement of a nation stands on an adequate supply of electrical energy. Reduction in cost for industrial processing units has been pulled with the wide utilization of rice husk (RH) and solar energy as value-added renewable energy sources for the era of power generation. The principal reason is to assist the study area towards development and to build up an integrated hybrid renewable power plant in rural regions in India. In this study, a new solar town concept and integrated biomass can be served as a hybrid global model for a smart eco-village in tropical countries like India. The demand, properties and cost of RH generation from rice mills resemble substitution of coal in power generation. Solar energy and agricultural residues are seasonally accessible sources and loosely dispersed over the substantial topographical area. So, for such an assessment, satellite image is a handy input and the preciseness of estimation increases with a high-resolution image. The methodology has been implemented for optimal sizing of an integrated renewable energy system-based power generation plants in India with less investment and minimum power cost. The outcome of the study reveals that the efficient use of renewable energy sources and proposal for placing a power generation plant require cautious identification of various techno-economic parameters. By considering the power crisis in India, the findings of these works are expected to assist the policymakers in the decision-making process. Particularly, this paper generates data on village-level RH availability from rice mills and subsequently potential electric power capacity for a particular region.},

Title = {Agroforestry suitability analysis based upon nutrient availability mapping: a GIS based suitability mapping},
Journal = {AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-220},
Abstract = {Agroforestry has drawn the attention of researchers due to its capacity to reduce the poverty and land degradation, improve food security and mitigate the climate change. However, the progress in promoting agroforestry is held back due to the lack of reliable data sets and appropriate tools to accurately map and to have an adequate decision making system for agroforestry modules. Agroforestry suitability being one special form of land suitability is very pertinent to study in the current times when there is tremendous pressure on the land as it is a limited commodity. The study aims for applying the geo-spatial tools towards visualizing various soil and environmental data to reveal the trends and interrelationships and to achieve a nutrient availability and agroforestry suitability map. Using weight matrix and ranks, individual maps were developed in ArcGIS 10.1 platform to generate nutrient availability map, which was later used to develop agroforestry suitability map. Watersheds were delineated using DEM in some part of the study area and were evaluated for prioritizing it and agroforestry suitability of the watersheds were also done as per the schematic flowchart. Agroforestry suitability regions were delineated based upon the weight and ranks by integrated mapping. The total open area was identified 42.4\% out of which 21.6\% area was found to have high suitability towards agroforestry. Within the watersheds, 22 village points were generated for creating buffers, which were further evaluated showing its proximity to high suitable agroforestry sites thus generating tremendous opportunity to the villagers to carry out agroforestry projects locally. This research shows the capability of remote sensing in studying agroforestry practices and in estimating the prominent factors for its optimal productivity. The ongoing agroforestry projects can be potentially diverted in the areas of high suitability as an extension. The use of ancillary data in GIS domain can have enormous ability to map the land for the benefit of rural people even up to the village level.},

Abstract = {Modelling the impact of river regulation on large floodplain wetland ecosystems is essential for long-term management of these systems. Understanding the response to hydrological events is critical to developing conceptual models, while appropriate data is required to calibrate, test and validate models. In the Gwydir wetlands, NSW, Australia, satellite-derived normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been used to assess flood response. This paper firstly compares the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI for use in long-term temporal profile analysis and then explores the use of these data to identify the flood response from wetland ecosystems. Terra MODIS 16-day maximum value composite (MVC) NDVI data at a pixel resolution of 250 m(2) is stacked temporally for the period 29 September 2000 to 26 June 2005 for the study area. The NOAA AVHRR High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) dataset (1 km(2)) was extracted for the period 21 March 1992 to 26 June 2005 and an MVC algorithm applied to correspond to the MODIS 16-day periods. Both MODIS and AVHRR data are used to determine the flood response using two sites, an internationally recognised wetland site and an adjacent native grassland site. Rainfall and inflow data were extracted from Bureau of Meteorology and NSW Department of Natural Resources databases respectively at daily resolution and the cumulative total for each 16-day antecedent period calculated. For both the wetland and grassland site, the AVHRR NDVI value was lower overall than for MODIS NDVI for the 109 composite periods analysed. A simple linear regression model explained over 80\% of the variation between the AVHRR and MODIS data for both sites, although the intercept was higher for the wetland site. Mean NDVI was significantly higher in the wetland site compared to the grassland site but both sites can reach similar peak values following large rainfall or flood events. The NDVI time-series has significant auto-correlation at lags of 1 to 4 (64 days). Cross-correlation between NDVI, rainfall and inflow was generally significant at lags up to 80 days. Events were extracted from the AVHRR 16-day time-series where peak wetland NDVI exceeded 0.45. The mean NDVI for the event, initial NDVI, antecedent rainfall and inflows (80 days) were calculated for each event. Multiple regression analysis indicated that pre-event NDVI and antecedent inflows accounted for over 79\% of the event NDVI for the wetland site. Neither rainfall nor inflows were significant for grasslands. This exploratory analysis of events indicates that the modelling of NDVI response is possible for small wetland sites using the AVHRR satellite data and can be compared to higher resolution MODIS data to provide a level of confidence when scaling from field sites to MODIS to AVHRR. Further investigation of modelling approaches using time-series may strengthen the analysis. More research is required to provide confidence in the sensitivity of models and data to small differences in event NDVI that separated highly productive wetlands from normal seasonal greening responses. This work must also be coupled with field monitoring to validate the NDVI results and determine the target event NDVI response required to maintain wetland vegetation communities in a healthy state. Despite some limitations and the need for further analysis, the results of this paper show promise for application to water management. These types of models can be used to estimate the water requirements to achieve a pre-determined NDVI response under a variety of antecedent conditions (as indicated by pre-event NDVI).},

Abstract = {Rice is considered the main food source for over 40\% of the world population and plays a crucial role in countries' food security, food management, and economic aspects. The value of SAR remote sensing in agricultural studies has its source of illumination and not limited to cloud cover. This makes it highly preferable over optical sensors in cloud-shrouded countries. The objective of the study is to assess the capability of Sentinel-1 data for determining paddy planting methods, identifying unhealthy paddy and an attempt made to differentiate rice varieties through correlation of in situ measurements and temporal variation of SAR backscattered signals. Six Sentinel-1 images are stacked to cover the entire paddy lifecycle. The correlated field data and plant backscatter showed that transplanted paddy has backscatter higher than broadcasted paddy. Two drops of paddy backscatter coefficient occurred, the first one, at the reproductive stage when paddy was attacked by bacteria and the second drop was at the ripening stage due to the attack of pests. The five rice varieties planted in Seberang Perak, Malaysia had the backscatter with insignificant differences that cannot confirm the Sentinel-1 capability to differentiate planted rice varieties. According to the obtained results, the time series of Sentinel-1 data has the capability for paddy rice growth monitoring.},

Abstract = {The Lancang-Mekong River basin, as an important transboundary river in Southeast Asia, is challenged by rapid socio-economic development, especially the construction of hydropower dams. Furthermore, substantial factors, such as terrain, rainfall, soil properties and agricultural activity, affect and are highly susceptible to soil erosion and sediment yield. This study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in terms of spatial distribution and sediment deposition by using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and GIS techniques. This study also applied remote sensing and available data sources for soil erosion analysis. Annual soil erosion in most parts of the study area range from 700 to 10,000 t/km(2)/y with a mean value of 5350 t/km(2)/y. Approximately 45\% of the total area undergoes moderate erosion. Moreover, the assessments of sediment deposition and erosion using the modified RUSLE and the GIS techniques indicate high sediment erosion along the flow direction of the mainstream, from the upper Mekong River to the Mekong Delta. The northern part of the upper Mekong River and the central and southern parts of the lower Mekong River are the most vulnerable to the increase in soil erosion rates, indicating sediment deposition.},

Pages = {145-166},
Abstract = {In Asia, cassava (Manihot esculenta) is cultivated by more than 8 million farmers, driving the rural economy of many countries. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in partnership with national agricultural research institutes (NARIS), instigated breeding and agronomic research in Asia, 1983. The breeding program has successfully released high-yielding cultivars resulting in an average yield increase from 13.0 t ha(-1) in 1996 to 21.3 t ha(-1) in 2016, with significant economic benefits. Following the success in increasing yields, cassava breeding has turned its focus to higher-value traits, such as waxy cassava, to reach new market niches. More recently, building resistance to invasive pests and diseases has become a top priority due to the emergent threat of cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The agronomic research involves driving profitability with advanced technologies focusing on better agronomic management practices thereby maintaining sustainable production systems. Remote sensing technologies are being tested for trait discovery and large-scale field evaluation of cassava. In summary, cassava breeding in Asia is driven by a combination of food and market demand with technological innovations to increase the productivity. Further, exploration in the potential of data-driven agriculture is needed to empower researchers and producers for sustainable advancement.},

Title = {Desertification: Mapping Constraints and Challenges},
Booktitle = {ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SOIL SCIENCE, VOLS I-III, 3RD EDITION},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {633-641},
Abstract = {Mapping desertification has proven to be a challenging task. Difficulties derive from its ambiguous definition and the comprehensive integration of various biophysical and socioeconomic indicators that need to be considered in the evaluation process. In the early 1990s, assessments and mapping were based primarily on expert opinions that introduced uncertainties and obvious shortcomings. Later on, with the development of the remote sensing technology and the advancement of the geographic information systems, global mapping became commonplace. Results showed that temporal and spatial scales are crucial components of the mapping and assessment process, but great difficulties arose comparing maps that were developed using different methodologies. Global maps could depict only general trends in desertification caused by human-induced land use changes or climatic variations but proved to be of limited value at local level. On the other side, local studies have problems of extrapolation. This necessitates the performance of mapping at various scales, but only after a methodological approach has been developed that accounts for all the components of the desertification process, allowing upscaling from global to local level and vice versa. Desertification mapping is under way by the World Atlas of Desertification (WAD) 3rd edition. The WAD places particular importance on case studies that document local realities affected by desertification as well as mitigation actions. Finally, concerned efforts must be made to develop and implement sustainable land use planning and land management techniques that arrest and reverse the negative consequences of desertification.},

Abstract = {Human-induced land use and land cover (LUC) changes threaten the ecosystem services of the vulnerable tropical afro-alpine vegetation. Several LUC change studies are available for the Ethiopian highlands, but relatively little is known about LUC change in the afro-alpine zones. In this study, LUC changes between 1964 and 2012 were mapped for the afro-alpine zone of Lib Amba Mountain, part of the Abune Yosef Mountains in North Ethiopia. Historical LUC was derived from georeferenced aerial photographs of 1964 and 1982, and the present LUC (2012) from Bing Map satellite imagery. Based on these successive LUC maps a time-depth map, LUC proportions, LUC transition matrices and LUC change trajectories were calculated. Two main phases of LUC change could be distinguished linked to the neo-Boserupian perspective. (i) Between 1964 and 1982, there were large-scale deforestation and general degradation of the vegetation above 3500m, in a period of low population pressure; (ii) Between 1982 and 2012, an intensification of land use prevailed accompanied with a slight regeneration of the vegetation and the Erica arborea L. forest, under increased population pressure. Depth interviews indicated that local and governmental land management measures are very important for the protection against vegetation depletion and soil degradation. Quick recovery of the forest on Lib Amba provides confidence that degraded afro-alpine areas would benefit in a short time from complete protection, given the vicinity of remaining patches of afro-alpine vegetation. Management interventions are thus vital to restore the important ecosystem services of the afro-alpine vegetation belt. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Engineers have shaped the environment across the centuries in order to improve the quality and safety of human life. The unrestrained invasion of nature led to significant environmental problems, for this reason nowadays engineering projects should be based on ecological concepts to protect our environment. This paper presents an integrated methodology that involves GIS tools, hydraulic numerical models, and landscape metrics to investigate ecological consequences caused by river restoration activities. The combined use of these different tools represents a bridge to connect the field of engineering with ecological techniques. The proposed method was tested to predict and assess the influence of a river restoration plan on a reach of the Orco river located in the northwest of Italy. Morphological alterations were simulated to reconnect remnant meanders and provide water to the floodplain, enhancing the ecological value of riparian ecosystems. The application of the hydraulic model permitted to evaluate the distribution of water inside the study area before and after the restoration plan. Thereafter, spatial configuration and temporal dynamics of the landscape structures were quantified using landscape metrics. The increase of patch density (PD) by 9\% and edge density (ED) up to 10\% highlights that restoration activities lead to a new configuration characterized by a higher level of fragmentation and heterogeneity. The characteristics of versatility, repeatability, and the possibility to predict the outcomes of a specific plan make the proposed method a useful tool that could help decision-makers to manage the territory while safeguarding natural ecosystems.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rapidly changing remote sensing technologies (lidar, aerial photography, satellites) provide opportunities to improve regional-scale landslide risk mapping. However, data limitations regarding landslide hazard and exposure data influence how landslide risk is calculated. To develop risk assessments for a landslide-prone region of eastern Kentucky, USA, we assessed risk modeling and applicability using variable quality data. First, we used a risk equation that incorporated the hazard as a logistic regression landslide susceptibility model using geomorphic variables derived from lidar data. Susceptibility is calculated as a probability of occurrence. The exposure data included population, roads, railroads, and land class. Our vulnerability value was assumed to equal one (worst-case scenario for a degree of loss) and consequence data was economic cost. Results indicate 64.1 percent of the study area is classified as moderate to high socioeconomic risk. To develop a more data-limited approach, we used a 30 m slope-angle map as the hazard input and simplified exposure data. Results for the slope-based approach show the distribution of risk that is less uniform, with large areas of over-and under-prediction. Changes in the hazard and exposure inputs result in significant changes in the quality and applicability of the maps and demonstrate the broad range of risk modelling approaches.},

Abstract = {Macroalgae plays an important role in coastal ecosystems. The accurate delineation of macroalgae areas is important for environmental management. This study compared the pixel- and object-based methods using Gaofen satellite no. 2 image to explore an efficient classification approach. Expert system rules and nearest neighbour classifier were adopted for object-based classification, whereas maximum likelihood classifier was implemented in the pixel-based approach. Normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, mean value of the blue band and geometric characteristics were selected as features to distinguish macroalgae farms by considering the spectral and spatial characteristics. Results show that the object-based method achieved a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient than the pixel-based method. Moreover, the object-based approach displayed superiority in identifying Porphyra class. These findings suggest that the object-based method can delineate macroalgae farming areas efficiently and be applied in the future to monitor the macroalgae farms with high spatial resolution imagery.},

Title = {Estimating evapotranspiration based on the satellite-retrieved near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIR<sub>v</sub>) over croplands},

Abstract = {Accurate information on cropland evapotranspiration (ET) can facilitate effective agricultural management. However, the application of existing physical models over broad regions may be impeded due to the need for difficult to acquire information about environmental factors that constrain ET. The recently developed near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), which can reasonably characterize ecosystem photosynthesis without the need for additional environmental information, is potentially useful for estimating cropland ET and reducing the difficulty in ET modeling. As such, we proposed two simply formulated semi-empirical models that utilize NIRv as a major factor constraining cropland ET. The first model, termed Penman-Monteith+ (PM+), computed canopy transpiration using the PM equation along with canopy conductance values estimated from NIRv-derived gross primary productivity (NIRv-GPP) and calculated soil evaporation using an empirical approach. Another model, termed underlying water-use efficiency+ (uWUE+), used the uWUE approach along with the NIRv-GPP to predict ET. We calibrated and validated PM+ and uWUE+ over 32 cropland flux sites and then compared them with six complex models. The better model between PM+ and uWUE+ was applied to estimate regional ET over North China Plain (NCP), where typical C-3 and C-4 crops were planted during 2010-2018, along with remote sensing and meteorological data. Results indicated that the two new models can reasonably estimate cropland ET. The PM+ model reproduced an eight-day value of ET (denoted as eight-day ET) with R-2 = 0.741 and RMSE = 5.638 mm/8d, slightly better than the uWUE+ model (R-2 = 0. 674 and RMSE = 6.275 mm/8d) for a cross-site validation over 17 flux sites of the validation dataset. Site-level validation revealed consistently better performance of PM+ compared to uWUE+ over most flux sites. For the comparisons with six existing models, PM+ can perform better than all these models and uWUE+ is better than five of them. Subsequently, the PM+ (uWUE+) model reasonably reproduced eight-day ET over four sites under a dry climate (Arid Index <= 0.5) with site-level R-2 = 0.691 (0.617) and RMSE = 6.663 (7.906) mm/8d on average, which is better than the six existing models. In addition, the regional mean annual ET varied from 590 mm per year (mm/yr) to 680 mm/yr over NCP with a significant increasing trend of 9.05 mm/yr (p < 0.01), and the ET values in maize growing season were higher than that in wheat growing season. Our results demonstrated that the simply formulated PM+ and uWUE+ models can provide simple and robust approaches to estimate regional and global cropland ET.},

Title = {Quantitative Evaluation of the Integrity of Natural Ecosystems and Anthropogenic Impacts in Shennongjia National Park, China},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {China launched its pilot national park system in 2015, and Shennongjia National Park has attracted much attention as one of the first batch of pilot national parks. The primary goal of national park construction in China is to effectively protect the integrity and authenticity of nationally important natural ecosystems. Based on the theory of landscape ecology, this study interpreted data from high-resolution remote sensing images and used landscape pattern analysis, spatial correlation analysis, and geographic weighted regression analysis to quantitatively evaluate the integrity of natural ecosystems at the landscape scale. A more accurate and operable calculation method was proposed to analyze the spatial variation in natural ecosystem integrity and to explore the scope and intensity of the impact of different anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystem integrity. The results showed that: (1) from the perspective of the spatial distribution patterns of natural ecosystem integrity, the degree of natural ecosystem integrity of Shennongjia National Park was generally high, with an integrity index value of 96.06, and the proportion of high-integrity areas accounted for 72.38\%. The integrity index value of the strict protection zone was 98.83, and the proportion of the low-integrity index area only accounted for 0.01\% of the strict protection zone, which was mainly distributed in the main urban areas of the nearby townships and along the highways in the national park, as well as in other areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. (2) From the perspective of the degree of impact of anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystem integrity, population density (0.3344), traffic accessibility (0.2389), traditional utilization activities (0.1101), and industrial and mining activities (0.0095) were, in descending order, the most impactful, and there was no significant correlation between ecotourism activities and natural ecosystem integrity. (3) From the perspective of the impact range of anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystem integrity, traditional utilization activities had the largest impact, accounting for 19.71\% of the total area of the national park. The area affected by population density accounted for 1.52\%. Industrial and mining activities had an influence of 4.75\%, and the area affected by traffic accessibility accounted for 9.28\%. Through conducting quantitative research into the integrity of natural ecosystems in Shennongjia National Park, this study provides a new research paradigm for the conservation of natural ecosystems and for the sustainable development of resources in protected areas, which is of great significance for the sensible development of national park conservation and management.},

Abstract = {The present study utilized satellite imagery and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the post-earthquake spatio-temporal changes of landslide for Huisun Experimental Forest Station (HEFS). Total 26 SPOT satellite images taken between January 1999 (before the Chi-Chi earthquake) and July 2016 shows that the total landslide area was fluctuated after the earthquake and then became stable after 2008. Overall, the long-term landslide trends of HEFS is approaching a stable stage in terms of the slightly increasing mean NDVI value with decreasing NDVI variance from 1999 to 2016 based on the linear regression and Mean-Variance analyses. Two large landslide areas in Xinsheng Village and along Meitangan River were identified as statistically significant hot spots. More than 50\% of landslides in HEFS were observed in areas with S-facing and SE-facing slopes with the majority of landslides occurred at 500 - 1500 m elevation. The slope characteristic of landslides changed to a concentration in 30 - 40 degree after the Chi-Chi earthquake and changed again to a concentration in 20 - 30 degree after 2008. Based on the results of the frequency of landslide occurrence, the total landslide area was the largest in the 0 - 9 times category. In the 10 - 16 and 17 - 26 times categories, high percentages of landslides were found in SE-facing and S-facing slopes. An inverse relationship was found between the landslide areas and the distance to river channel in the 0 - 9 and 10 - 16 times categories. The results of spatio-temporal landslide analysis can be references for management and conservation strategies in HEFS.},

Title = {Model for estimation of total nitrogen content in sandalwood leaves based on nonlinear mixed effects and dummy variables using multispectral images},

Abstract = {Fertilizer overuse is a common phenomenon in global agroforestry production, and this overuse causes ecological destruction. The ability to accurately estimate the nutrient content of plant leaves in real-time would be a wonderful solution to reduce the degree of environmental damage. in recent years, remote sensing technology has been widely used in the diagnosis of crop nutrition in many countries. Most studies focus on optimal band selection or create new vegetation indices, but these studies have ignored the random impact of natural environmental factors on the estimated results. This paper proposed an estimation model of total nitrogen content (TNC) in sandalwood leaves that takes sampling season and site conditions as the dummy variable and random effect, respectively. Three forestry farms with different locations and site conditions were selected as study areas to enhance the universality of this model. Multispectral images of leaves were obtained using a low-cost five-band camera (RedEdge3, MicaSense, USA), and the experimental results indicate the following: (1) the growth of the tree height, crown width and stem effectively increased under the medium gradient level (N2), whereas a high gradient level (N3) significantly promoted all aspects except tree height; (2) the mean and variance of some image texture features of the G, RE and NIR band were significantly correlated with TNC at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, and the texture mean value index (TMVI) proposed in this paper can improve the correlation with TNC; and (3) the results obtained using the nonlinear mixed-effects model with dummy variables improved the fitting degree and estimation accuracy compared with results of SVR and BPNN. This study demonstrates the advantages of using the nonlinear mixed-effects model with dummy variables to obtain a more reliable estimation model for the nutritional diagnosis of rare tree species.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, mankind has sought to minimize the impact of the unpredictability and severity of violent storms such as tornadoes. To date, solutions have focused on early warning and on development of fortified buildings made to withstand the strong forces that are the hallmark of these atmospheric events. Sophisticated prediction methods have been developed to warn populations of potential storm danger. These ``warn and seek shelter{''} mechanisms have clearly reduced the loss of life and, to a lesser extent, property damage associated with these natural events. However, despite our best efforts, loss of life and costly property damage are still strongly associated with severe weather phenomenon. This paper describes concepts that use either ground or space based platforms for generating beams of microwave radiation to provide localized thermal heating or ionization of the atmosphere. It is further suggested that these heating techniques could initially be used as research tools for improving computer simulations of atmospheric phenomena. The ultimate goal is to utilize such tools for prevention of severe storm phenomena and eventually for the manipulation of the jet stream for alleviation of draught and floods. The experimental techniques include a) heating of rain droplets with microwaves between 26 and 35 Ghz, b) Heating of atmospheric oxygen with microwave frequencies of about 54 Ghz and c) creation of artificial ionization plasma patterns in the atmosphere which can be heated with microwaves to produce acoustic or gravitational waves and can interact with electrical phenomena by adjustments in atmospheric electrical conductivity. New experimental techniques similar to ``ink drop{''} experiments to determine the diffusion of chemicals in a liquid can be applied to the atmosphere to study heat transport and electrical properties. Weather research concepts are discussed. The microwave heating technologies suggested in this paper provide methods for rapidly heating well-defined regions of a weather system. Ground or satellite based microwave phased arrays, focused on specific locations in the atmosphere, will be used to heat the atmosphere and to create useful artificial ionized plasma patterns. Initial experiments would correlate heating in a specific region of a weather system with computer simulations. Weather modification of tornadoes and of the jet stream is also discussed. One such application is to prevent concentration of rotational energy in a mesocyclone by heating the cold rainy downdrafts. The anticipated result is to prevent the precise rotation geometry that can produce a tornado and thus interrupt tornado formation. Methods of influencing the jet stream are also discussed. A new approach to influencing hurricanes and typhoons by influencing the position of the jet stream and the behavior of atmospheric gravitational waves is also discussed. Development of Space-Based Solar Power as a clean, renewable energy source for the world's needs is dependent on an evolutionary approach. Dual use of such systems for weather research and control will increase the economic value of solar power satellites. Understanding the weather and computer simulation of storm systems is necessary before attempting interaction to mitigate storms. When that has been achieved, the initial investment can save lives and reduce property damage. In the process, the fundamentals of Space-Based Solar Power are demonstrated, leading to development of commercial energy systems as well as systems for modifying the weather and the effects of global warming on weather.},

Abstract = {Land consolidation is an effective means of promoting the regularization of fragmented arable land, optimizing the allocation of land resources and improving the environment in farming areas, as well as an important means of increasing the economic returns of farming households, and it is important to scientifically assess the ecological and economic benefits of agricultural land consolidation. In this study, participatory rural assessment (PRA) was used to investigate, in detail, the meaning, satisfaction and changes in farmland rehabilitation before and after implementation. The accuracy of the remote sensing data was verified through an experiment on the net cultivation coefficient. We used a sample of 447 farmers from nine villages in Manas County to study the differences in plot area, crop unit value, income and irrigation before and after the farmers' integration. We found that, after the integration of farmland, the cultivated area increased significantly, the crop unit yield increased by at least 42.66\%, the average income of farmers increased by a value of RMB 4324/ha and the water savings were all higher than 7.18 m(3)/ha. At the same time, after the integration of farmland, the number of plots was significantly reduced, the arable land became more regular and the microclimate of the farmland improved significantly. The government and individuals should follow the concept and construction requirements of the ``community of life in mountain, water, forest, lake, grass and sand{''}, consider the economic and ecological benefits of land consolidation, ensure the quality of farmland ecosystems, actively explore new models of land consolidation and stimulate the economic vitality of rural areas.},

Abstract = {Urbanization due to population growth and regional development can cause various environmental problems, such as the urban heat island phenomenon. A planned city is considered an appropriate study site to analyze changes in urban climate caused by rapid urbanization in a short-term period. In this study, changes in land cover and surface heat island phenomenon were analyzed according to the development plan in Sejong City from 2013 to 2020 using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager/ Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) satellite imagery. The surface temperature was calculated in consideration of the thermal infrared band value provided by the satellite image and the emissivity, and based on this the surface heat island effect intensity and Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) change analysis were performed. The level-2 land cover map provided by the Ministry of Environment was used to confirm the change in land cover as the development progressed and the difference in the surface heat island intensity by each land cover. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that the urbanized area increased by 15\% and the vegetation decreased by more than 28\%. Expansion and intensification of the heat island phenomenon due to urban development were observed, and it was confirmed that the ecological level of the area where the heat island phenomenon occurred was very low. Therefore, It can suggest the need for a policy to improve the residential environment according to the quantitative change of the thermal environment due to rapid urbanization.},

Abstract = {Methane (CH4) is both a greenhouse gas and a precursor of tropospheric ozone, making it an important focus of chemistry-climate interactions. Methane has both anthropogenic and natural emission sources, and reaction with the atmosphere's principal oxidizing agent, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is the dominant tropospheric loss process of methane. The tight coupling between methane and OH abundances drives indirect linkages between methane and other short-lived air pollutants and prompts the use of interactive methane chemistry in global chemistry-climate modeling. In this study, an updated contemporary inventory of natural methane emissions and the soil sink is developed using an optimization procedure that applies published emissions data to the NASA GISS ModelE2-Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (ModelE2-YIBs) global chemistry-climate model. Methane observations from the global surface air-sampling network of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are used to guide refinement of the natural methane inventory. The wetland methane flux is calculated as a best fit; thus, the accuracy of this derived flux assumes accurate simulation of methane chemical loss in the atmosphere and accurate prescription of the other methane fluxes (anthropogenic and natural). The optimization process indicates global annual wetland methane emissions of 140 Tg CH4 yr(-1). The updated inventory includes total global annual methane emissions from natural sources of 181 Tg CH4 yr(-1) and a global annual methane soil sink of 60 Tg CH4 yr(-1). An interactive methane simulation is run using ModelE2-YIBs, applying dynamic methane emissions and the updated natural methane emissions inventory that results from the optimization process. The simulated methane chemical lifetime of 10.4 +/- 0.1 years corresponds well to observed lifetimes. The simulated year 2005 global-mean surface methane concentration is 1.1\% higher than the observed value from the NOAA ESRL measurements. Comparison of the simulated atmospheric methane distribution with the NOAA ESRL surface observations at 50 measurement locations finds that the simulated annual methane mixing ratio is within 1\% (i.e., +1 \% to -1 \%) of the observed value at 76\% of locations. Considering the 50 stations, the mean relative difference between the simulated and observed annual methane mixing ratio is a model overestimate of only 0.5 \%. Comparison of simulated annual column-averaged methane concentrations with SCIAMACHY satellite retrievals provides an independent post-optimization evaluation of modeled methane. The comparison finds a slight model underestimate in 95\% of grid cells, suggesting that the applied methane source in the model is slightly underestimated or the model's methane sink strength is slightly too strong outside of the surface layer. Overall, the strong agreement between simulated and observed methane lifetimes and concentrations indicates that the ModelE2-YIBs chemistry-climate model is able to capture the principal processes that control atmospheric methane.},

Title = {Quantifying the Impact of Hydrological Connectivity on Salt Marsh Vegetation in the Liao River Delta Wetland},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Salt marshes play a critical role in ecological functioning and have significant economic value. Hydrological elements are considered to be one of the major contributors to salt marsh degradation. However, how hydrological connectivity affects salt marshes remains poorly investigated at fine scales. This paper used spatial analysis and statistical methods to investigate the impact of hydrological connectivity on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of salt marsh vegetation in two natural succession areas of the Liao River Delta wetland in 2020 and 2021 by selecting vegetation area, NDVI, tidal creeks area, distance to tidal creeks, and the Index of Connectivity, using 1 m Gaofen-2 data and 0.2 m aerial topographic data. The study found that the area and growth status of vegetation and the overall connectivity in 2021 were better than that in 2020, while the west bank of the Liao River was better than that on the east bank. Phragmites australis showed a round island distribution pattern primarily at the end of tidal creeks. The differences between different hydrological connectivity and vegetation area were significant in 2021. The vegetation area was the largest under poor and moderate connectivity. We also found that within a distance range of 0-6 m from tidal creeks, the vegetation area increased with increasing distance, but beyond 6 m, the vegetation area decreased with increasing distance. Our results showed that poor and moderate connectivity conditions were more suitable for vegetation growth. The threshold value of 6 m can provide an important reference for wetland vegetation restoration in the Liao River Delta wetland.},

Abstract = {With shrinking budgets and expanding program costs, government program offices are seeking innovative ways to accomplish their goals with better efficiency and less cost. In 2008, the U. S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center's Development Planning Directorate (SMC/XRF) took a bold step in this direction and funded a new program that started as an unsolicited proposal from SES Government Solutions, and its industry teammates, Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The program called for hosting of an Air Force furnished infrared sensor, developed by SAIC, on an SES commercial communications satellite, built by Orbital, and was appropriately referred to as CHIRP (Commercially Hosted Infra-Red Payload). This bold new effort has been a resounding success and has stimulated a whole new market area for hosted payloads that is now germinating throughout the aerospace industry. The concept of a staring sensor using large format focal plane arrays began as a risk reduction program by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Under that program (the Alternate InfraRed Satellite System (AIRSS) or Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) program), SAIC developed a laboratory model of a full-earth, four-telescope staring Overhead Persistent InfraRed (OPIR) sensor for ground validation. For the CHIRP contract, but under the 3GIRS umbrella, SAIC designed and developed a space-qualified, one-quarter earth, single OPIR staring telescope for a technical demonstration in space. The satellite was built by Orbital Sciences as part of an existing commercial contract with SES. The sensor and satellite efforts were leveraged by the CHIRP program, integrating the government furnished equipment (GFE) sensor with the commercial SES-2 telecommunications satellite. The CHIRP program uses contractor ground system facilities and mission operations teams to operate and evaluate the CHIRP system, including sensor commanding, state-of-health monitoring, sensor calibration and characterization, and tracking algorithm assessment on the ground using on-orbit data. The satellite is operated by SES through its commercial satellite operations center (SOC). By design, CHIRP operations are completely independent of spacecraft operations except for initial deployments and CHIRP power on/off activities. Sensor commands are generated at SAIC's CHIRP Mission Analysis Center (CMAC) in Seal Beach, California, transmitted through Orbital's CHIRP Mission Operations Center (CMOC) in Dulles, Virginia, and uplinked to the spacecraft by the SES-operated teleport in Woodbine, Maryland. The CHIRP mission data is transmitted from the CHIRP payload through an Orbital-developed Secondary Payload Interface (SPI) on the spacecraft, where it is encrypted and transmitted to the ground through one of the commercial transponders. The ground entry point for the CHIRP data is a SES teleport, which transmits the data to the CMOC for dissemination in real-time to the CMAC and the U. S. Air Force's Advanced Fusion Center (AFC). The CMOC and CMAC are accredited to handle collateral classified data, while the SES facilities are commercial entities with no access to classified data. The CHIRP program is a truly ground breaking, but like many early endeavors had to overcome challenges along the way. However, at the end of the day, the CHIRP team: a) Space-qualified a ground-breaking wide-field-of-wiew (WFOV), OPIR sensor designed and developed by SAIC in two years on the 3GIRS program; b) Integrated the payload onto a commercial communications satellite platform, including all payload accommodations for heat, power, and commanding, and tested the payload within the commercial integration and testing (I\&T) flow; c) Launched and flew the sensor in space a little over three years from the start of the contract; d) Demonstrated the agility and flexibility of the commercially hosted payload concept, which included accommodating a payload development within commercial schedules; e) Delivered a sensor to orbit that was operational and performing its mission two days before the satellite arrived at its operational orbital location and within 24 hours of removal of the baffle cover; f) Proved that classified systems can be operated as a commercially hosted payload; and g) Showed that high quality commercial buses can support demanding optical missions. The CHIRP program uncovered and resolved several hosted payload-related challenges and pioneered solutions for future hosted payloads in areas ranging from contracts to space policy, weight/power/thermal accommodations, security and cultural differences between the commercial and government environments. The main take-away from this unique program is that by working closely together, with a common goal, both government and industry can benefit greatly from the hosted payload model.},

Abstract = {Atriplex nummularia has been extensively planted in Northern Africa to combat desertification. However, few studies evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions. This study aimed at assessing the dynamic performance of a number of Atriplex plantations located in the Marrakech province in terms of multitemporal dry biomass production. Three SPOT 5 images (2004, 2008 and 2012) and field biomass measurements were integrated to quantify the dry biomass production dynamics of plantations established from 1996 to 2007. Different plant ages covered the whole plant life cycle curve. Vegetation indices were derived from the images and those of 2012 were coupled to the measured biomass of 2012 to formulate biomass models. An analysis of shrub biomass production was conducted in plantations and in adjacent rangelands, covering varying degree of plant development, and an estimate of the economic benefits generated by the plantations in terms of available fodder biomass was performed. The results show that, on average, the plantation sites produced 221 to 361Mgha(-1) of dry biomass more than the surrounding rangelands. The best performing plantations yielded even greater differences, up to more than 7Mgha(-1). It was observed that the most performing plantations, while contributing to mitigating land degradation, have generated economic value and could compensate the economic cost of the intervention even under drought conditions. However, in several cases the plantation performance was far from sustainability, particularly due to poor management (early and/or over grazing), revealing that management is a critical factor for the success of this restoration practice.

Title = {Measuring the economic impact of tourism: the case of Lower and Upper Austria},
Journal = {TOURISM REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {289-297},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to demonstrate that the information content of a regional tourism satellite account (RTSA) is a very complex phenomenon and the complete impact of tourism is difficult to capture. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on the recommended framework for tourism satellite account-building and is concentrated on Lower and Upper Austria, two of the nine Austrian federal states. The RTSA provides an analytical framework of issues related to tourism economics and tourism policy as well as for model building, tourism growth analysis and productivity measurement. Findings - Considering only direct effects, calculations showed that tourism made around 3 1/2 per cent of the Upper Austrian gross regional product. In case of Lower Austria, the relevant figure was around 1 percentage lower. Considering the direct and indirect effects, tourism contributed almost 6 per cent to the overall gross regional product of Upper Austria, and in Lower Austria, tourism contributed around 5 per cent to the overall gross regional product. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first papers about considering (beside the direct effects) also the indirect effects of tourism and pointing out the true economic impact of tourism on the whole economy on a regional level.},

Title = {Assessment of biomass and yield loss of maize caused by aerosols in heavily polluted agricultural areas of China based on APSIM model},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid economic growth, the government and the public pay more and more attention to the environmental effects caused by aerosols. In this study, the effects of aerosols on the biomass and yield of maize from 2001 to 2014 in heavily polluted agricultural areas of China were explored using global AErosol Robotic Network (AERONET) monitoring data, the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum radiative transfer (6S) model, and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop growth model. Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations were selected as research areas. The results showed that the APSIM-maize model was able to accurately simulate the interactions between maize and the climatic constraints in the maize planting areas at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations. Our results revealed that the aerosols reduced direct solar radiation, and that the decreasing trend was mainly due to the net radiation flux caused by aerosols. The average total radiation from 2001 to 2014 at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations decreased by 31.95\%, 14.74\%, and 28.30\%, respectively, and the average maize biomass decreased by 34.12\%, 20.78\%, and 28.41\%, respectively. As a result, the average maize yield at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations declined by 28.44\%, 13.43\%, and 14.89\%, respectively. Our findings, particularly the understanding of the effect of aerosols on crop production, will have important implications for improving climate change impact studies and helping local agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change. They could also benefit strategic decision-making related to future agricultural adaptation methods in China.},

Title = {Proximal sensing estimation of glyphosate injury on weeds in central Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Herbicide injury on weeds is quantified through responses such as mortality, biomass, and visual scores, which are time consuming and/or subjective, making it hard to evaluate injury in experiments and making the site-specific management impracticable in major crops. The objective of our work was to build prediction models of glyphosate injury on weed species of economic importance in the Brazilian Cerrado (savana) through multispectral digital images. Two weed species with different levels of susceptibility to glyphosate, Eleusine indica (L.) Pers. and Brachiaria decumbens L., were cultivated in pots and subjected to increasing doses of glyphosate, simulating a gradient of injury. Visual scores were given by three trained evaluators during three weeks after the application. Images of the pots were acquired with a digital multispectral camera in the following bands of the electromagnetic spectrum: blue (450 nm), green (560 nm), red (660 nm), and near-infrared (850 nm), with a digital camera at 0.9-m height from the ground. Images were first segmented to separate plant from soil using the hue-saturation- value color space. Vegetation indices were calculated and used as explanatory variables for phytotoxicity in regression models. A field experiment was conducted in order to validate predictions. The injury pattern of glyphosate on E. inidica and B. decumbens was best modeled by an exponential function of the median of hue for plant pixels, which could be reproduced at field scale with prediction errors below 8\%. Differences in sensitivity to glyphosate between the two species were detected with the kernel density of hue for plant pixels, with absolute correlation with phytotoxicity above 0.8.

Title = {Comparison of RS/GIS analysis with classic mapping approaches for siting low-yield boreholes for hand pumps in crystalline terrains. An application to rural communities of the Caimbambo province, Angola},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {22-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In poverty-stricken regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, groundwater for supply is often obtained by means of hand pumps, which means that low-yield boreholes are acceptable. However, boreholes are often sited without sufficient hydrogeological information due to budget constraints, which leads to high failure rates. Cost-effective techniques for borehole siting need to be developed in order to maximize the success rate. In regions underlain by granite, weathered formations are usually targeted for drilling, as these are generally presented as a better cost-benefit ratio than the fractured basement. Within this context, this research focuses on a granite region of Angola. A comparison of two mapping techniques for borehole siting-groundwater prospect is presented. A classic hydrogeomorphological map was developed first based on aerial photographs, field mapping and a geophysical survey. This map represents a considerable time investment and was developed by qualified technicians. The second map (RS/GIS) is considerably simpler and more cost-effective. It was developed by the integration in a GIS platform of six maps of equal importance-slope, drainage density, vegetation vigor, presence of clay in the soil, lineaments and rock outcrops-prepared from Landsat 8 imagery and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Similar results were obtained in both cases. By means of a supervised classification of Landsat images, RS/GIS analysis allows for the identification of granitic outcrops, house clusters and sandy alluvial valleys. This in turn allows for the delineation of low-interest or contamination-prone areas, thus contributing additional qualitative information. The position of a well that is going to be powered by a handpump is chosen also upon social and local matters as the distance to the stakeholders, information that are not difficult to integrate in the GIS. Although the second map needs some field inputs (i.e. surveys to determine the thickness of the weathered pack), results show that RS/GIS analyses such as this one provide a valuable and cost-effective alternative for siting low-yield boreholes in remote regions.

Abstract = {With the onset of a global pandemic, all the sectors have started to become heavily dependent on Information Technology to improve the standards and performance of their respective fields. Being of utmost importance to the day-to-day life of humans, shipping plays a major role in our everyday life. As it is the case with the other sectors shipping had become increasingly dependent on Information Technology. The use of satellite communication along with other sophisticated tools have improved the shipping sector with the latest technology improving the performance of ships and shipping as well. This study explores the possibilities of globally consistent connectivity and specialized analytics channels enabling shipping equipment vendors to sell add-on aftercare services such as remote real-time analytics of fuel use to aid compliance with emissions regulations. Web Companies assume that fibre-like connectivity should be as accessible at sea as it is in the home, so that shipping fleets, floating communities, and offshore operations can become more efficient, sustainable, and profitable. The main objective of this study is to investigate high throughput, low latency solutions enabling a digital transformation of operations at sea. Focusing on improving access to real time performance data, supporting environmental impact monitoring, improving the timeliness of tracking and crew scheduling in addition to enhancing customer experiences for cruise and yacht passengers, the capabilities enable user access to fast, flexible, secure connectivity as a standardized service. Beyond regulation, digital transformation enabled by reliable and flexible connectivity also promises to deliver major cost efficiencies to the maritime sector. Unlocking the capability for real-time data exchange between all equipment and ships in all locations, will empower crews to make management and optimisation decisions not only on their own vessel, but fleet-wide. These new and pending regulatory and non-regulatory drivers create a need for real-time collection and analysis of data in a secure and trustworthy format. Operators will need to find new ways to co-operate between ship and shore to transform fuel efficiency, which will require new technologies to ensure greater standardization, integration and communication of maritime data. Reliable, flexible connectivity will enable maritime shipping organizations to meet new challenges, but also get ahead by implementing their own transformative changes to benefit efficiency and profitability for years to come. Based at CINEC Sri Lanka, venturing into this Jetstream with expert solutions to cover a wide range of products and services throughout the life cycle of any vessel and technology - from 3D design and engineering to risk assessment and ship management this overall solution, based on Information Technology, will optimize the digitalization of the outlook of the global maritime industry.},

Title = {A Contour-Directional Detection for Deriving Terrace Ridge From Open Source Images and Digital Elevation Models},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {129215-129224},
Abstract = {Agricultural terraces, as typically artificial landforms, have maintained an important role throughout human history. Terrace ridges, which form the main constructive part of terraces, face the greatest risk from gully or gravity erosion. Mapping terrace ridges can benefit agricultural production management and soil-and-water conservation. This study presents a contour-directional detection method that automatically maps terrace ridges by considering the image features and topographic features of terraces. First, the terrace areas were extracted via object-based image analysis. Second, the Canny edge detector was employed to extract all edges from the image, and a digital elevation model (DEM) was used to generate the contour direction. The contour direction and edge image were then overlaid to implement the contour-directional detection method, which detects ridges along the contour direction. Finally, those candidate terrace ridges which lengths exceed an appropriate threshold were identified as terrace ridges. Five study areas located in the Loess Plateau of China were used to validate the proposed method. The results showed that the correctness, completeness, and quality ranged from 82.57\% to 94.92\%, from 82.51\% to 88.39\%, and from 70.28\% to 84.40\%, respectively. However, the proposed method is widely available and can be easily applied by using open global images and DEMs, such as Google Earth images and ASTER GDEM.},

Title = {Effects of Coffee Management on Deforestation Rates and Forest Integrity},

Abstract = {Knowledge about how forest margins are utilized can be crucial for a general understanding of changes in forest cover, forest structure, and biodiversity across landscapes. We studied forest-agriculture transitions in southwestern Ethiopia and hypothesized that the presence of coffee (Coffea arabica)decreases deforestation rates because of coffee's importance to local economies and its widespread occurrence in forests and forest margins. Using satellite images and elevation data, we compared changes in forest cover over 37 years (1973-2010) across elevations in 2 forest-agriculture mosaic landscapes (1100 km(2) around Bonga and 3000 km(2) in Goma-Gera). In the field in the Bonga area, we determined coffee cover and forest structure in 40 forest margins that differed in time since deforestation. Both the absolute and relative deforestation rates were lower at coffee-growing elevations compared with at higher elevations (-10/20\% vs. -40/50\% comparing relative rates at 1800 m asl and 2300-2500 m asl, respectively). Within the coffee-growing elevation, the proportion of sites with high coffee cover (>20\%) was significantly higher in stable margins (42\% of sites that had been in the same location for the entire period) than in recently changed margins (0\% of sites where expansion of annual crops had changed the margin). Disturbance level and forest structure did not differ between sites with 30\% or 3\% coffee. However, a growing body of literature on gradients of coffee management in Ethiopia reports coffee's negative effects on abundances of forest-specialist species. Even if the presence of coffee slows down the conversion of forest to annual-crop agriculture, there is a risk that an intensification of coffee management will still threaten forest biodiversity, including the genetic diversity of wild coffee. Conservation policy for Ethiopian forests thus needs to develop strategies that acknowledge that forests without coffee production may have higher deforestation risks than forests with coffee production and that forests with coffee production often have lower biodiversity value. Efectos de la Administracion Cafetalera sobre las Tasas de Deforestacion y la Integridad de los Bosques Resumen El conocimiento sobre como se utilizan los margenes de los bosques puede ser crucial para el entendimiento general de los cambios en la cubierta boscosa, la estructura de los bosques y la biodiversidad en el paisaje. Estudiamos transiciones bosque-agricultura en el suroeste de Etiopia y partimos de la hipotesis de que la presencia del cafe (Coffea arabica) disminuye las tasas de deforestacion por la importancia del cafe para las economias locales y su ocurrencia extensa en los bosques y los margenes de estos. Usando imagenes de satelite e informacion de elevacion, comparamos los cambios en la cubierta boscosa a traves de 37 anos (1973-2010) a lo largo de elevaciones en 2 paisajes mosaico de bosque y sembradios (1100 km(2) alrededor de Bonga y 3000 km(2) en Goma-Gera). En el campo en el area de Bonga determinamos la cobertura de cafe y la estructura del bosque en 40 margenes de bosque que difirieron en el tiempo desde la deforestacion. Tanto la tasa absoluta como la relativa de deforestacion fueron mas bajas en las elevaciones donde se cultiva cafe comparadas con las de elevaciones mas altas (-10/20\% vs. -40/50\% comparando tasas relativas en 1800 msnm y 2300-2500 msnm, respectivamente). Dentro de la elevacion donde se cultiva cafe, la proporcion de sitios con una alta cobertura de cafe (>20\%) fue significativamente mas alta en los margenes estables (42\% de los sitios que habian estado en la misma localidad durante el periodo entero) que en los margenes con cambios recientes (0\% de los sitios donde la expansion anual de cultivos habian alterado el margen). El nivel de perturbacion y de estructura del bosque no difirio entre los sitios con 30\% o 3\% de cafe. Sin embargo, un creciente cuerpo de literatura sobre los gradientes de administracion del cafe en Etiopia reportan los efectos negativos del cafe sobre la abundancia de especies especialistas de bosques. Aunque sea cierto que la presencia de cafe disminuye la conversion de bosque a sembradios de cosecha anual, existe el riesgo de que la intensificacion de la administracion de cafe todavia amenace la biodiversidad del bosque, incluyendo la diversidad genetica del cafe silvestre. La politica de conservacion para los bosques etiopes entonces debe desarrollar estrategias que reconozcan que los bosques sin produccion cafetalera pueden tener riesgos mayores de deforestacion que los bosques con produccion cafetalera y que los bosques con produccion cafetalera seguido tienen un valor bajo de biodiversidad.},

Abstract = {Adaptive managements on susceptible forested regions not only benefit forest recovery, but also help to improve the stability of soil-degraded area and carbon (C) sequestration. The gain of afforestation on C sink has not been addressed clearly especially in tropical and subtropical regions that will be critical in an era of global warming. Based on the Landsat satellite images, in situ forest survey and archives, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of C density and storage in a typical soil-water conservation area in Changting county in southeastern China, dominated by the pioneer tree Pinus massoniana forest. The results showed that the C density (storage) increased significantly from 20.14Mg C ha(-1) (0.38Tg C) in 1981 to 43.57Mg C ha(-1) (1.98Tg C) in 2015 (p<0.05) and proved the success of ecological management adopted considering the interactions between local residential livelihoods and the features of local forest ecosystem. In addition, the differences of C density and storage across elevational and slope gradients also narrowed over the past 35years. The landscape also gradually shifted from lower C density to higher C density conditions based on the landscape metrics. The ecological-dominated approaches should be put in a high priority for the issue of C sequestration especially in a changing climate.},

Abstract = {Illegal fishing is a growing threat to aquatic biodiversity and as a result, marine protected areas (MPAs) have arisen as a suitable alternative for the protection of imperiled biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to map out and analyze the movements of illegal fishing vessels which operate within ` Area de Protec a similar to o Ambiental Costa dos Corais (APACC), the largest Brazilian coastal MPA. A dataset from the National Program for Tracking Fishing Vessels by Satellite (PREPS) was used to detect the fishing vessels navigating the waters within the APACC over the period 2013-2020. We performed spatial density analysis with the aim of finding the most widely recorded hotspot regions of illegal fishing and also evaluated whether the illegal lobster-fishing occurred within or outside the fishing seasons. We found that there were 62 fishing vessels operating within the APACC and that 19 of them were engaged in some form of fishing activity in this area. Over the years 2013 and 2020, there were a total number of 15,353 detections (63.9\% of the detections were identified as being potentially illegal). Fishing ac-tivities were defined as illegal when they occurred during the closed season, within an area where fishing is prohibited, or within less than 4 nautical miles from the coast. These fisheries mainly affect species with eco-nomic value, such as lobsters, snappers and groupers, and often involve the use of diving air compressors as a fishing technique. It is thus necessary to design better monitoring systems of these fishing fleets to prevent any conflicts over their operations and ensure an effective conservation of biodiversity.},

Title = {Assessing the role of climate and resource management on groundwater dependent ecosystem changes in arid environments with the Landsat archive},

Abstract = {Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary relationship studies. This work is supporting land and water managers for evaluation of GDEs with respect to climate, groundwater, and resource management. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Accurate and timely maps of tree cover attributes are important tools for environmental research and natural resource management. We evaluate the utility of Landsat 8 for mapping tree canopy cover (TCC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) in a woodland landscape in Burkina Faso. Field data and WorldView-2 imagery were used to assemble the reference dataset. Spectral, texture, and phenology predictor variables were extracted from Landsat 8 imagery and used as input to Random Forest (RF) models. RF models based on multi-temporal and single date imagery were compared to determine the influence of phenology predictor variables. The effect of reducing the number of predictor variables on the RF predictions was also investigated. The model error was assessed using 10-fold cross validation. The most accurate models were created using multi-temporal imagery and variable selection, for both TCC (five predictor variables) and AGB (four predictor variables). The coefficient of determination of predicted versus observed values was 0.77 for TCC (RMSE = 8.9\%) and 0.57 for AGB (RMSE = 17.6 tons center dot ha(-1)). This mapping approach is based on freely available Landsat 8 data and relatively simple analytical methods, and is therefore applicable in woodland areas where sufficient reference data areavailable.},

Title = {Revealing Annual Crop Type Distribution and Spatiotemporal Changes in Northeast China Based on Google Earth Engine},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Northeast China (NEC) produces 1/4 of the grain and 1/3 of the commercial grain in China, and is essential for food security and a sustainable socio-ecological system development. However, long-term annual crop type distribution in this vital area remains largely unknown, compromising the scientific basis for planting structure adjustment and sustainable agriculture management. To this end, we integrated 111-dimensional MOD09A1 features, feature optimization and random forest algorithms on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to classify annual crop types in the NEC during 2000-2020, and adopted multi-source spatial data and geostatistical methods to reveal anthropogenic and natural characteristics of crop type changes. The results demonstrated that sample-based classification accuracies were 84.73-86.93\% and statistics-based R-2 were 0.81-0.95. From 2000-2020, the sowing area of maize and rice increased by 11.92 x 10(6) ha (111.05\%) and 4.03 x 10(6) ha (149.28\%), whereas that of soybean and other crops decreased by 13.73 x 10(6) ha (-64.10\%) and 1.03 x 10(6) ha (-50.94\%), respectively. Spatially, maize expanded northwestward, rice expanded northeastward, and soybean demonstrated a south-north shrinkage. The soybean-to-maize shift was the main conversion type, and its area largely reduced from 8.68 x 10(6) ha in 2000-2010 to 4.15 x 10(6) ha in 2010-2020. Economic comparative benefit and climate change jointly affected crop types in NEC. Higher-benefits maize and rice were mainly planted in more convenient areas with more population and closer to settlements, roads and waterways. The planting of maize and rice required higher temperature and precipitation, and climate change in the NEC provided favorable conditions for their expansion toward high-latitude areas. The crop type changes in the NEC have boosted economic benefits, but increased water-carbon-energy costs. Thus, effective measures such as subsidy policies, ecological compensation, and knowledge-exchange should be implemented to aid crop type and rotation adjustment and ensure food-ecological security.},

Title = {Diagnosis of Nitrogen Nutrition in Sugar Beet Based on the Characteristics of Scanned Leaf Images},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Sugar beet is an important economic crop in Northwest China. In this area, efficient use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has become crucial due to decreased profits associated with both under- and oversupply relative to sugar beet requirements. Thus, fast and non-destruction diagnostic tools for estimating plant N status have an important role in reducing N inputs while maintaining sugar beet yield and qualify. The objective of our study was to quantify leaf color characterization of sugar beet with an inexpensive scanner and establish the relationship with yield, leaf nitrogen content (LNC), plant total nitrogen content (PTNC), chlorophyll content (CC), soil nitrate nitrogen content (SNNC) and soil plant analysis development (SPAD) readings in sugar beet. In 2017 and 2018, field experiments were conducted with five N treatments ranging from 0 to 180 kg N ha(-1). The main results showed the following: The SPAD readings (SPR) and CC exhibited a significant or highly significant correlation (maximum = 0.70, P < 0.01), both of which reflected well the N nutrient status of the entire plant. Furtherly, a detailed association analysis revealed that there was a close relationship (maximum = - 0.63, P < 0.01) of LNC, SPR, PTNC, CC and yield with leaf color parameter Red/Blue (R/B), which was recommended as leaf color parameters for N diagnosis in sugar beet. In addition, based on the distribution of R/B value under different N rate, the yield was low with greater R/B value than 1.36 indicating an insufficient N supply, and with the R/B value was lower than 1.36, the theoretical yield reached its peak indicating an adequate supply of N fertilizer. To summarize, compared to the complicated and expensive of hyperspectral and other remote sensing technologies, scanned leaf image (SLI) processing technique was a simple, inexpensive and reliable method of determining sugar beet N status that has potential as a diagnostic tool for determining crop N requirement.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study investigated the spatial pattern evolution of the rural settlement system in the town of Menggang, China, based on settlement patches extracted from remote sensing data for four time points between 1990 and 2018. Five typical villages were selected to study their spatial textures from point to surface. The reasons for the evolution of the rural settlements were examined as well. The results indicated that the number of settlement patches in Menggang decreased, the area of a single patch expanded, and the scale of the rural settlements continued to expand. Settlements were distributed randomly, but an agglomeration trend began to appear. The plain terrain had little restriction on settlement site selection. Cofferdams and embankments were the limiting factors for settlement expansion, which led to the compact development of the settlements. Economic development, population growth, and family miniaturization were positive factors for the expansion of the rural settlements. In the typical villages, cluster settlements and cluster settlements with a banded tendency had higher spatial utilization efficiency. Several high-density building centers were formed in the settlements, and the trend of residential buildings was mainly northeast-southwest. The plain terrain had little effect on the orientation of buildings, single-building areas, or the public spaces of the settlements. Traditional culture and traffic routes affected the orientation of the main buildings of folk houses. This study has theoretical and reference value for the structure optimization and sustainable development of rural settlements in the lower Yellow River plain.},

Title = {Assessing impact of forest landscape dynamics on migratory corridors: a case study of two protected areas in Himalayan foothills},

Abstract = {Contiguity of protected areas (PAs) is a critical factor to promote well being of the native flora, fauna and life support system to humans. Such contiguity cannot be guaranteed without providing a path or `a corridor' through forested landscapes that includes natural land cover and undisturbed patches. Incidentally, the Himalayan foothills have greater pressure on these landscapes due to high human dependence for livelihood. This pressure is expected to increase in the coming years altering the potential corridors between PAs. The PA managers need flexible processing, modeling and decision tools to propose a range of acceptable corridors between the PAs and ensure their sustainable health. Such flexible tools can be utilized in future to modify for taking decision to conserve the patches connecting patches and adapt as per changing landscapes. This article describes utility of geospatial modeling tools to assess the status of corridors in light of changing landscapes between Rajaji and Jim Corbett National Park, the two most important PAs in the Himalayan foothills. The work has been carried out in four stages, first-using satellite data land use land cover (LULC) maps were prepared for year 1990, 2000 and 2005, second-Land Change Modeler (LCM) was used for LULC change analysis, third-Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) was used to predict the status of LULC for 2015 and 2020, and fourth-using temporal morphology of the areas behaving both as barrier and easiness, friction surface cost was calculated to identify least cost pathways (LCPs)/migratory corridors between the PAs. The LULC maps for 1990, 2000 and 2005 were evaluated using accuracy assessment (80\%) and Khat statistics (> 0.79). The change prediction model was validated by comparing actual LULC of 2005 with predicted LULC of 2005 and the agreement was 71\%. The LCP has shifted with the predicted change in the classes. The corridor has shifted by 0.5-3 km towards the south and has come closer to the agriculture fields and river channels.},

Title = {Reading Greenness in Urban Areas: Possible Roles of Phenological Metrics from the Copernicus HR-VPP Dataset},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Vegetation phenology is that branch of science that describes periodic plant life cycle events across the growing seasons. Remote sensing typically monitors these significant events by means of time series of vegetation indices, permitting to characterize vegetation dynamics. It is well known that vegetation in urban areas, i.e., green spaces in general, may benefit human health mainly by mitigating noise and air pollution, promoting physical or social activities, and improving mental health. Based on the influence that green space exposure seems to exert on Public Health and using a multidisciplinary approach, we mapped phenological behavior of urban green areas to explore yearly persistence of their potential favorable effect, such as heat reduction, air purification, noise mitigation, and promotion of physical/social activities and improvement of mental health. The study area corresponds to the municipality of Torino (about 800,000 inhabitants, NW, Italy). Renouncing to a rigorous at-species level phenological description, this work investigated macro-phenology of vegetated areas for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 years with reference to the new free and open Copernicus HR-VPP dataset. Vegetation type, deduced with reference to the 2019 BDTRE official technical map of the Piemonte Region, was considered and related to the correspondent macro-phenology using a limited number of metrics from the HR-VPP dataset. Investigation was aimed at exploring their capability of providing synthetic and easy-to-use information for urban planners. No validation was achieved about phenological metrics values (assuming their accuracy correspondent to the nominal one reported in the associated manuals). Nevertheless, a spatial validation was operated to investigate the capability of the dataset to properly recognize vegetated areas, thus providing correspondent metrics. Preliminary results showed a spatial inconsistency related to the HR-VPP dataset, that greatly overestimates (about 50\%) vegetated areas in the city, assigning metric values to pixels that, if compared with technical maps, do not fall within vegetated areas. The work found out that, among HR-VPP metrics, LOS (Length Of Season) and SPROD (Seasonal Productivity) well characterized vegetation patches, making it possible to clearly read vegetation behavior, which can be effectively exploited to zone the city and make management of green areas and real estate considerations more effective.},

Title = {Reexamining supply chain integration and the supplier's performance relationships under uncertainty},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-78},
Abstract = {Purpose - Effective and efficient supply chain coordination requires the integration of all product flow processes. However, inconsistent empirical results have been obtained with respect to the relationships between supply chain integration (SCI) and performance. Drawing on efficiency-flexibility arguments, this paper seeks to develop a SCI model that includes buyer-supplier-supplier relationships, and proposes a contingency framework for reexamining the SCI-supplier performance relationship under demand and technological uncertainties. Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage data collection process was conducted, and a total of 878 suppliers that listed in the Taiwanese ``Center-Satellite Production System{''} with supply contract were contacted for this study. Finally 164 suppliers were gathered and screened as valid responses. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses in this study. Findings - Evidence indicates that SCI has a significant positive effect on the suppliers' performance. The positive SCI-performance relationship can be moderately weakened by demand uncertainty; however, this positive SCI-performance relationship will be strengthened by technological uncertainty. Originality/value - While supply chain management is needed to manage the vertical and horizontal relationships simultaneously, this study offers a framework to solve efficiency-flexibility dilemma arguments when dealing with ``exploitation{''} and ``exploration{''} alternatives to help to reexamine the inconsistent SCI-performance relationship. Furthermore, based on transaction cost theory, this paper takes the nature of uncertainty into account for improving the theoretical background of the SCI-performance relationship arguments. Empirical results indicate the existence of an ambidextrous supply chain integration strategy which justifies the choice of which one is preferable in efficiency-flexibility dilemma arguments.},

Title = {Spatial Management Measures Alter Vessel Behavior in the Aleutian Archipelago},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The Aleutian Archipelago and surrounding waters have enormous ecological, cultural, and commercial significance. As one of the shortest routes between North American and Asian ports, the North Pacific Great Circle Route, which crosses through the Aleutian Archipelago, is traveled by thousands of large cargo ships and tanker vessels every year. To reduce maritime risks and enhance navigational safety, the International Maritime Organization built upon earlier offshore routing efforts by designating five Areas To Be Avoided (ATBAs) in the Aleutian Islands in 2016. The ATBAs are designed to keep large vessels at least 50 nautical miles (93 km) from shore unless calling at a local port or transiting an authorized pass between islands. However, very few studies have examined the effectiveness of ATBAs as a mechanism for changing vessel behavior and thereby reducing the ecological impacts of maritime commerce. In this study, we use 4 years of satellite-based vessel tracking data to assess the effectiveness of the Aleutian ATBAs since their implementation in 2016. We determined whether vessels transiting the North Pacific Great Circle Route changed behavior after ATBA implementation, both in terms of overall route selection and in terms of compliance with each ATBA boundary. We found a total of 2,252 unique tankers and cargo vessels >400 gross tons transited the study region, completing a total of 8,794 voyages. To quantify routing changes of individual vessels, we analyzed the 767 vessels that transited the study region both before and after implementation. The percentage of voyages transiting through the boundaries of what would become ATBAs decreased from 76.3\% in 2014-2015 (prior to ATBA designation) to 11.8\% in 2016-2017 (after implementation). All five Aleutian ATBAs had significant increases in compliance, with the West ATBA showing the most dramatic increase, from 32.1\% to 95.0\%. We discuss the framework for ATBA enforcement and highlight the value of local institutional capacity for real-time monitoring. Overall, our results indicate that ATBAs represent a viable strategy for risk mitigation in sensitive ecological areas and that through monitoring, spatial protections influence vessel route decisions on multiple spatial scales.},

Title = {Modelling the impacts of changing land use and climate on sediment and nutrient retention in Lake Tana Basin, Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {482},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Natural ecosystems provide many different services such as carbon sequestration, regulation of climate change, biodiversity, and aesthetic value. Ecosystem functions are significantly impacted by both natural and man-made processes, such as sediment and nutrient deposition. The Lake Tana basin faces significant problems with soil depletion, sedimentation, and degradation. Thus, this study is designed to assess the effects of climate and land use change on the export of sediment and nutrients as well as their retention in the basin. This study used different data sources such as satellite data for land use and land cover and watershed preparation, climate data from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase five (CMIP5), soil data from Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity (MoWIE), and field data for model calibration. Five different Global Climate Models (GCMs) were employed to produce climate projections using the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) for the basin. The cellular automata (CA) and Markov chain has then been employed for future projections of changes in land use. Finally, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoff (InVEST) sediment delivery ratio (SDR) and nutrient delivery ratio (NDR) models have been applied to assess the changes in sediment and nutrient export between the baseline and future time periods. The findings indicated that between 1990 and 2019, there was a change in land use that led to an increase in sediment exports of 60.5\% and a decrease in sediment retention of 12.8\%. Projecting into the future, the amount of exported and retained sediment increases under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios in the 2040s by 8.4\% and 17.8\%, respectively due to the combined effects of climate and land use change. Equally, nitrogen and phosphorus exports rose under land use change scenarios but are projected to decrease under climate and integrated climate and land use change scenarios. Out of the 12 sub-watersheds that were designated, five were found to have a high mean annual rate of sediment and nutrient export and were then ranked in terms of priority level for conservation planning. Hence, this research shows that the integration of spatial data with the InVEST model can be used to aid land use planning and decision-making to combat nutrient and sediment exports and prioritize watersheds.},

Abstract = {This research is aimed at designing, implementing, and testing a geospatial database for wind and solar energy applications in the Kingdom of Bahrain. All decision making needed to determine economic feasibility and establish site location for wind turbines or solar panels depends primarily on geospatial feature theme information and non-spatial (attribute) data for wind, solar, rainfall, temperature and weather characteristics of a particular region. Spatial data includes, but is not limited to, digital elevation, slopes, land use, zonings, parks, population density, road utility maps, and other related information. Digital elevations for over 450,000 spot at 50 m spatial horizontal resolution plus field surveying and GPS (at selected locations) was obtained from the Surveying and Land Registration Bureau (SLRB). Road, utilities, and population density are obtained from the Central Information Organization (CIO). Land use zoning, recreational parks, and other data are obtained from the Ministry of Municipalities and Agricultural Affairs. Wind, solar, humidity, rainfall, and temperature data are obtained from the Ministry of Transportation, Civil Aviation Section. LandSat Satellite and others images are obtained from NASA and online sources respectively. The collected geospatial data was georeferenced to Ain el-Abd UTM Zone 39 North, 3D Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-50 m spatial resolutions was created using SLRB spot elevations. Slope and aspect maps were generate based on the DEM. Supervised image classification to identify open spaces was performed utilizing satellite images. Other geospatial data was converted to raster format with the same cell resolution. Non-spatial data are entered as an attribute to spatial features. To eliminate ambiguous solution, multi-criteria GIS model is developed based on, vector (discrete point, line, and polygon representations) as well as raster model (continuous representation). The model was tested at the Al-Areen proposed project, a relatively small area (15 km(2)). Optimum site spatial location for the location of wind turbines and solar panels was determined and initial results indicates that the combination of wind and solar energy would be sufficient for the project to meet the energy demand at the present per capita consummation rate..},

Title = {UAV to Inform Restoration: A Case Study From a California Tidal Marsh},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Monitoring of environmental restoration is essential to communicate progress and improve outcomes of current and future projects, but is typically done in a very limited capacity due to budget and personnel constraints. Unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in a variety of natural and human-influenced environments and have been found to be time- and cost-efficient, but have not yet been widely applied to restoration contexts. In this study, we evaluated the utility of UAVs as an innovative tool for monitoring tidal marsh restoration. We first optimized methods for creating high-resolution orthomosaics and Structure from Motion digital elevation models from UAV imagery by conducting experiments to determine an optimal density of ground control points (GCPs) and flight altitude for UAV monitoring of topography and new vegetation. We used elevation models and raw and classified orthomosaics before, during, and after construction of the restoration site to communicate with various audiences and inform adaptive management. We found that we could achieve 1.1 cm vertical accuracy in our elevation models using 2.1 GCPs per hectare at a flight altitude of 50 m. A lower flight altitude of 30 m was more ideal for capturing patchy early plant cover while still being efficient enough to cover the entire 25-hectare site. UAV products were valuable for several monitoring applications, including calculating the volume of soil moved during construction, tracking whether elevation targets were achieved, quantifying and examining the patterns of vegetation development, and monitoring topographic change including subsidence, erosion, and creek development. We found UAV monitoring advantageous for the ability to survey areas difficult to access on foot, capture spatial variation, tailor timing of data collection to research needs, and collect a large amount of accurate data rapidly at relatively low cost, though with some compromise in detail compared with field monitoring. In summary, we found that UAV data informed the planning, implementation and monitoring phases of a major landscape restoration project and could be valuable for restoration in many habitats.},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover are essential in all environmental aspects. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of LST and vegetation abundance is beneficial to investigate the microclimate studies of an urban area. In urban areas, vegetation is an essential element in flourishing microclimate and outdoor thermal consolation. Due to unplanned rapid urbanization and lack of proper management, the vegetation cover in Rangpur City Corporation (RpCC) are decline day by day. The vegetation covers are declined in fast-growing city like RpCC and it is leading to more sensible heat than the normal heat flux. This study focused on the relationship between LST and vegetation cover of the RpCC area of different periods and how they affect the regional microclimate. Through this research has also been evaluate the impacts of reducing the vegetation cover on the microclimate conditions in the study area. To fulfil the aim of the study, satellite imageries of the year 2021 (Operational Landsat), 2017 (Operational Landsat), 2009 and (Thematic mapper), 2000 (Thematic mapper) were processed using ArcGIS 10.5 software. From the satellite imageries, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST have been estimated to show the relation between LST and vegetation in RpCC and ANN (Artificial neural network) model was developed to predict the value of LST and NDVI after 7 years, particularly to the year 2028 based on datasets from 2000 to 2021. The linear regression analysis provides the inverse relationship between LST and vegetation in the study area that explains that due to urban growth materials, the amount of vegetation has been decreased, leading to increased surface temperature during 2000-2021. The developed ANN model using obtained data sets of LST and NDVI of RpCC predicts that the value of LST and NDVI till the year 2028 will not be changed so much compared to the previous 21 years (2000-2021). The highest LST may occur 32.71 degrees c in the year 2028 whereas the predicted highest NDVI value has been observed 0.57 which is not so sufficient in controlling LST in the city. However, more amount forestation is needed to minimize the effects of LST to make the city comfortable for the inhabitants including flora and fauna and others process as well like as cultivation, fishing, farming, etc.},

Abstract = {Background: Sooty (Puffinus griseus) and short-tailed (P. tenuirostris) shearwaters are abundant seabirds that range widely across global oceans. Understanding the foraging ecology of these species in the Southern Ocean is important for monitoring and ecosystem conservation and management. Methodology/Principal Findings: Tracking data from sooty and short-tailed shearwaters from three regions of New Zealand and Australia were combined with at-sea observations of shearwaters in the Southern Ocean, physical oceanography, near-surface copepod distributions, pelagic trawl data, and synoptic near-surface winds. Shearwaters from all three regions foraged in the Polar Front zone, and showed particular overlap in the region around 140 degrees E. Short-tailed shearwaters from South Australia also foraged in Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front. The spatial distribution of shearwater foraging effort in the Polar Front zone was matched by patterns in large-scale upwelling, primary production, and abundances of copepods and myctophid fish. Oceanic winds were found to be broad determinants of foraging distribution, and of the flight paths taken by the birds on long foraging trips to Antarctic waters. Conclusions/Significance: The shearwaters displayed foraging site fidelity and overlap of foraging habitat between species and populations that may enhance their utility as indicators of Southern Ocean ecosystems. The results highlight the importance of upwellings due to interactions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with large-scale bottom topography, and the corresponding localised increases in the productivity of the Polar Front ecosystem.},

Abstract = {The landslide susceptibility of a region is important for socioeconomic considerations and engineering applications. Thus, an automated system for mapping of landslide susceptibility could be of significant benefit for society. In this paper, a knowledge-based landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) system has been proposed. The system consists of input, understanding, expert, and output modules. The input module accepts thematic images of contributing factors for landslides. The understanding module interprets input images to extract relevant information as required by the expert module. The expert module consists of knowledge base and inference strategy to categorize a region into different landslide intensities. Finally the output module provides a LSZ map. It is a pixel-based system and provides output having the scale same as that of the input maps. The system has been tested to prepare a landslide susceptibility map for the Tehri-Garhwal region in India's lower Himalayas, and further validated with studies for two other different regions. The proposed system provides output commensurate with that provided by experts. The categories of hazard zones have a discrepancy as little as 6.2\% in high hazard zones and near to 1.5\% and 4\% in moderate and low hazard zones, respectively. The high hazard zones in the LSZ maps from the proposed system are supersets of that obtained by experts (i.e., the proposed system provides safer LSZ map). Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed system can be used for preparation of LSZ maps. In the future, the methodology may be extended for real time assessment and prediction of landslide hazards.},

Abstract = {The Global Positioning System (CPS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) satellites are both information system technologies applicable to the mobile user. GPS, which was developed by the United States military, is one of the most successful dual-use systems. The size of the military GPS user equipment market currently is only a small fraction of the civilian market. GPS enables accurate timing, positioning, and navigation capabilities on a worldwide basis, whereas PCS satellites also enable worldwide communications. In the past, commercial GPS user sets have been integrated with digital maps and computer databases (yellow pages) to enable user situational awareness. For example, this type of implementation has been integrated into auto navigation systems. However, in many applications, the user requires time-evolving environmental data for enhanced situational awareness. For example, the automobile navigator would like information on traffic patterns, accidents, and road construction Since the user is mobile, he needs a driver information service supplied through a wireless data link. In the past, we have proposed Personal Navigation Service (PNS) as wireless PCS tailored to the mobile consumer/navigator. Military battlefield planners and participants have similar types of requirements for situational awareness involving both navigation and wireless data communication. Current world political situations require an effective military network centric global grid, which maximizes information superiority for the US and our allies. Shared communication links and the PVT (position, velocity and time) strengths of GPS create many opportunities (many yet to be conceived) for improved mission effectiveness. There is a compelling opportunity for a complementary space-based Navcom satellite architecture to meet the needs of both the military and civilian users. Global civil Navcom systems for air, rail, road traffic and infrastructure management (among many others) parallel many aspects of military Navcom systems for battlefield awareness inside the zones of armed conflict. Agreed upon overlapping elements of constituent civil and military navigation and communication systems can be integrated into a common infrastructure. Open system PNS standards illustrate some of these shared architecture concepts {[}1]. With a dual-use system, there are several issues, which need to be resolved. (1) Can a cost-effective Navcom Sat system be developed that meets all of the requirements of both military and civilian users? (2) Why should the military consider dual-use? (3) Why should the civilian sector consider dual-use? (4) Can dual-use be developed without compromising military performance, availability, and security? (5) How does dual-use benefit the military as well as the civilian sector? (6) Why should navigation service and communication services be integrated on the same satellite system? This paper will address these questions as well as identify many issues associated with dual-use, integrated Navcom, and propose solutions to those issues.},

Title = {Combining Tourism Economic Account and Tourism Employment Module for a best measurement of tourism at a sub-national level},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {99-113},
Abstract = {For more than 15 years, the World tourism organization and other major multilateral organizations have worked on the development of reliable tools for assessing tourism related to others economic activities in a country: the tourism satellite account. Its implementation at a sub-national level is a challenging endeavour and requires going beyond this framework. A regional tourism economic account is a good answer to the demand for regional tourism economic data and to highlight the problematic of employment with a tourism employment module. This combination sheds a new light on the role of tourism in creating, preserving and diversifying jobs in the economy. We developed a regional tourism economic account (RTEA), based on the supply-side, in order to take advantage of the existence a system of regional accounts and to respond to the lack of domestic tourism data. All these developments have been applied in a French overseas region, Reunion Island. The results show their feasibility. The others ultra-peripheral regions of European Union, others European islands and more generally small island tourism economies can benefit from this experience, (i.e. all regions in which a system of regional account has been implented).

Abstract = {The Census of Marine Life was a 10-year, international research effort to explore poorly known ocean habitats and conduct large-scale experimentation with new technology. The goal of Census 2010 in its mission statement was to describe what did live in the oceans, what does live in the oceans, and what will live in the ocean. Many of the findings and techniques from census research may prove valuable in making a transition, which many governments have publicly endorsed, from single-species fisheries management to more holistic ecosystem management. Census researchers sampled continental margins, mid-Atlantic ridges, ocean floor vents and seeps, and abyssal plains and polar seas and organized massive amounts of past and new information in a public online database called the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (www.iobis.org). The census described and categorized seamount biology worldwide for its vulnerability to fishing, advanced large-scale animal tracking with acoustic arrays and satellite archival tags, and accelerated species identification, including nearshore, coral reef, and zooplankton sampling using genetic barcoding and pyrotag sequencing for microbes and helped to launch the exciting new field of marine environmental history. Above all, the census showed the value of investing in large-scale, collaborative projects and sharing results publicly.},

Abstract = {The vegetation cover of northern Australia ranges from open forest or woodland savanna (dominated by eucalypts over a range of highly flammable annual and perennial grasses) to hummock and tussock grasslands occupying sandy and fertile fine-textured soils. Like monsoonal eastern Indonesia, the major fire period occurs over the long dry season, typically between April/May-October/November. People light fires for a range of land management purposes; lightning strikes cause relatively few fires at the start of the annual wet season. Based on regional mapping of fires from satellite imagery (mostly NOAA-AVHRR and LANDSAT) from the 1980s, we can identify two broad patterns concerning the application of fire in northern Australia. In northwestern and northern Australia, and possibly also on parts of Cape York in the northeast, intense wild fires typically late in the dry season burn vast tracts annually. Ecological studies indicate that such fire regimes are having catastrophic impacts on native fire-sensitive species, communities, and habitats. Conversely, elsewhere across northern Australia but especially on more productive pastoral lands, the restricted application/absence of burning is in some cases leading to native and exotic woody species thickening/invading, likewise with profound ecologic and economic consequences. Growing recognition of these issues has led to the development of collaborative fire management programs in various parts of northern Australia. Similar cooperative approaches involving practitioners from northern Australia working with relevant parties in eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea would bring significant benefit to the study of regional landscape management issues.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are a vital component of coastal and marine ecosystems. They are now under strong environmental challenges and are being harmed by human activities and rising sea surface temperatures, which are reducing the living coral cover. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the mapping accuracy of coral covers using PlanetScope satellite pictures with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method surrounding Cu Lao Xanh Island in Binh Dinh province. To adjust for the sunglint effect, the bands were corrected using the Hedley technique. After that, the Depth-Invariant Index technique was utilized to reduce the influence of the water column, and the ANN algorithm was employed for mapping. Hard coral, soft coral, seagrass, deep water, and bare bottom were identified as the five kinds of benthic habitat. The accuracy of the classification results was assessed using field data collected on May 10 and 11, 2022. The results indicated that the artificial neural network (ANN) technique had a higher accuracy, with a total classification accuracy of 89.55\% and a kappa value of 0.87. Cu Lao Xanh's coral area is around 68 hectares, with soft corals mostly found west and southwest of the island and hard corals in the east. This finding demonstrates that Planetscope satellite imagery is effective at monitoring shallow coral reefs on small islands, providing a scientific foundation and reliable data for the development of a more comprehensive coral reef ecological monitoring and management.},

Title = {Soil erosion and sediment yield assessment using RUSLE and GIS-based approach in Anjeb watershed, Northwest Ethiopia},

Abstract = {Soil erosion is a serious and continuous environmental problem in Ethiopia. Lack of land use planning, environmental protection, over-cultivation, and overgrazing are prominent causes of erosion and sedimentation. This study is conducted in Anjeb watershed located in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. In this study, the quantity and distribution of soil erosion, sediment delivery ratio (SDR), and sediment yield of the watershed were assessed by employing remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and revised universal soil loss equation analysis capabilities. Important data sets of topography, soil, conservations practices, cover management, and rainfall factors were processed and superimposed in GIS analysis, and soil loss rate, SDR, and sediment yield of the watershed were derived. Based on the result found, the watershed was categorized into six classes of erosion: slight (0-5), moderate (5-10), high (10-15), very high (15-30), severe (30-50), and very severe (>50) t ha(-1) yr(-1). The estimated average annual soil loss was 17.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1). The soil loss rate is higher in the steeper and topographically dissected part of the watershed. The average sediment delivery capacity was about 0.122. The result showed that the average sediment yield in the watershed was grouped into classes of low (<2.5), moderate (2.5-7.5), high (7.5-12.5), very high (12.5-22.5), severe (22.5-40), and very severe (>40) t ha(-1) yr(-1). It is found that from a total of 20,125.5 t yr(-1) eroded soil over the whole watershed 2254.5 t yr(-1) of sediment has been brought and deposited to the channels. Sediment accumulation from the watershed threatens the storage capacity and life span of Anjeb reservoir which is the source of irrigation water downstream. The study provides an insight to planners and resource managers to design and implement practices of watershed management to reduce erosion and enhance land productivity and to minimize the reservoir sediment accumulation. Article Highlights center dot The soil loss in the watershed ranges between 0 and 195 t ha(-1) yr(-1) center dot The range of SDR value of the channel networks was between 0.03 and 0.214. center dot From a total of eroded soil materials, 12.2\% have been delivered to the channels, and 87.8\% deposited before getting into the channel networks.},

Abstract = {Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations are one of the most important economic forest in tropical area. Retrieving leaf area index (LA!) and its dynamics by remote sensing is of great significance in ecological study and production management, such as yield prediction and post-hurricane damage evaluation. Thirteen HJ-1A/1B CCD images, which possess the spatial advantage of Landsat TM/ETM+ and 2-days temporal resolution of MODIS, were introduced to predict the spatial-temporal LAI of rubber plantation on Hainan Island by Nonlinear AutoRegressive networks with exogenous inputs (NARX) model. Monthly measured LAIs at 30 stands by LAI-2000 between 2012 and 2013 were used to explore the LAI dynamics and their relationship with spectral bands and seven vegetation indices, and to develop and validate model. The NARX model, which was built base on input variables of day of year (DOY), four spectral bands and weight difference vegetation index (WDVI), possessed good accuracies during the model building for the data set of training (N = 202, R-2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.13), validation (N = 43, R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.24) and testing (N = 43, R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 031), respectively. The model performed well during field validation (N = 24, R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.24) and most of its mapping results showed better agreement (R-2 = 0.54-0.58, RMSE = 0.47-0.71) with the field data than the results of corresponding stepwise regression models (R-2 = 0.43-0.51, RMSE = 0.52-0.82). Besides, the LAI statistical values from the spatio-temporal LAI maps and their dynamics, which increased dramatically from late March (2.36 +/- 0.59) to early May (3.22 +/-. 0.64) and then gradually slow down until reached the maximum value in early October (4.21 +/- 0.87), were quite consistent with the statistical results of the field data. The study demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of retrieving spatio-temporal LAI of rubber plantations by an artificial neural network (ANN) approach, and provides some insight on the application of HJ-IA/1B CCD images, and data and methods for productivity study of rubber plantation in future.

Title = {Species density of foliage-dwelling spiders in field margins: a simple, fuzzy rule-based model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {129},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Field margins are grassy strips or banks between arable fields or meadows that are not cultivated or ploughed and contain only single shrubs or trees. They not only support beneficial arthropods, e.g. predators of crop pests, but can also be of potential value to species of concern, making them a critical target for conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Most ecological data and most knowledge of ecological relationships are imprecise, uncertain or ambiguous. An overemphasis on the precision of mathematical models, thus, does not necessarily translate into a greater representation of reality. In contrast, fuzzy expert systems permit the representation and processing of `soft' ecological knowledge in terms of natural language. This is done by sets of IF-THEN rules that relate the variables (expressed in the form of fuzzy sets such as `rather cold', `comparably few species', etc.) among each other. Data on 96 field margins in southern Germany and their foliage-dwelling spider assemblages, which had been collected from May to September 1994, were used for fuzzy modelling of the effects of margin width, margin density, frequency of mechanical disturbance and vegetation-architectural complexity on species density of spiders. Habitat factors were ordered according to their hierarchical effectiveness: margin width and disturbance determine habitat persistence, habitat persistence and margin density determine colonisation potential, and colonisation potential and herbaceous-plant cover determine species density. Forty-five rules are necessary to relate these factors. The predictive power of the fuzzy model was surprisingly high. The mean average error between predicted and observed number of species for test data, which was not used for model development, was less than 1.4 species (observed values ranged between 3 and 25). A multiple-regression model showed a mean average error of 3.17 species. We conclude that fuzzy models are suitable for representing the soft knowledge of field-margin/spider-assemblage relationships. The model permits time- and manpower-saving validation on larger scales by qualitative rather than quantitative data collection and by the inclusion of remote sensing data. We believe that fuzzy models could provide a valuable means for formulating measures necessary for conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the development of an optimal design framework for high altitude long endurance solar unmanned aerial vehicle. The proposed solar aircraft design framework provides a simple method to design solar aircraft for users of all levels of experience. Design/methodology/approach This design framework consists of algorithms and user interfaces for the design of experiments, optimization and mission analysis that includes aerodynamics, performance, solar energy, weight and flight distances. Findings The proposed sizing method produces the optimal solar aircraft that yields the minimum weight and satisfies the constraints such as the power balance, the night time energy balance and the lift coefficient limit. Research limitations/implications - The design conditions for the sizing process are given in terms of mission altitudes, flight dates, flight latitudes/longitudes and design factors for the aircraft configuration. Practical implications - The framework environment is light and easily accessible as it is implemented using open programs without the use of any expensive commercial tools or in-house programs. In addition, this study presents a sizing method for solar aircraft as traditional sizing methods fail to reflect their unique features. Social implications - Solar aircraft can be used in place of a satellite and introduce many advantages. The solar aircraft is much cheaper than the conventional satellite, which costs approximately \$200-300m. It operates at a closer altitude to the ground and allows for a better visual inspection. It also provides greater flexibility of missions and covers a wider range of applications. Originality/value This study presents the implementation of a function that yields optimized flight performance under the given mission conditions, such as climb, cruise and descent for a solar aircraft.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Over recent years, the frequency and intensity of droughts have increased and there has been a large drying trend over many parts of the world. Consequently, drought monitoring using big data analytic has gained an explosive interest. Droughts stand among the most damaging natural disasters. It threatens agricultural production, ecological environment, and socio-economic development. For this reason, early warning, accurate evaluation, and efficient prediction are an emergency especially for the nations that are the most menaced by this danger. There are numerous emerging studies addressing big data and its applications in drought monitoring. In fact, big data handle data heterogeneity which is an additive value for the prediction of drought, it offers a view of the different dimensions such as the spatial distribution, the temporal distribution and the severity detection of this phenomenon. Big data analytic and drought are introduced and reviewed in this paper. Besides, this review includes different studies, researches and applications of big data to drought monitoring. Challenges related to data life cycle such as data challenges, data processing challenges and data infrastructure management challenges are also discussed. Finally, we conclude that big data analytic can be beneficial in drought monitoring but there is a need for statistical and artificial intelligence-based approaches.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the problem of student engagement in the modern educational space. Based on the analysis of the works of Russian and foreign authors, it is shown that engagement is considered as a process, as condition, as a mechanism, as a situation, as an investment of time and energy in the performed activity. There are also various approaches to understanding the structure of engagement, its types, forms, levels, indicators and diagnostic criteria. The most studied is the behavioral side of engagement, the least studied are the mechanisms of the formation of involvement and its management. The authors proposed a systemic anthropological psychology as a methodological basis for the study of student engagement, the foundations of which were laid in the works of Tomsk scientists (V.E. Klochko, E.V. Galazhinsky, O.M. Krasnoryadtseva, O.V. Lukyanov). In this vein, the concordance between the person and the environment is considered as the main mechanism for the formation of engagement. The measure of compliance is the ``resource of engagement{''} of a person, which includes instrumental and value and meaning characteristics. The instrumental component includes various aspects of self- regulation of activity in a changing environment, the value and meaning component is the value and meaning dimension of the objective conditions of activity. The resource of engagement determines the fundamental possibility of including a person in an environment with specific characteristics. The authors conducted an empirical study of the ``resource of engagement{''} of students of two large universities in the Russian Far East; the sample consisted of 498 people. As a result of the factor analysis of the data, the dimensions of the concordance between the student and the educational environment were identified. These are subjective disorganization of activity (impossibility of performing activities in an environment with the specific parameters); flexibility and readiness for change (orientation towards activities in a changing environment); willingness to take responsibility (focus on own forces and resources); result orientation (experience of pleasure in achieving specific results); willingness to work in conditions of uncertainty; selfishness (self-dependence and focus on gaining benefits); focus on the labor process (without taking into account its goals and working conditions). For each option, the directions of psychological assistance aimed at increasing the academic and social involvement of students in the educational space are determined.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem fragmentation is being recognized as an important characteristic of landscapes, with numerous implications on its ecological and socio-economic valuation, and for the sustainable management of forest and natural resources in general. Particularly in regions where the population pressure on natural resources is heavy, and where the natural and man-influenced ecosystems are highly vulnerable, monitoring of landscape pattern provides valuable insight in and indicators of ecological landscape development. Pattern is a relatively complicated and multi-dimensional characteristic of landscape. Among the constituting agents are number of vegetation classes considered, number, size, shape, and relative and absolute spatial arrangement of the single patches, as is the scale (spatial resolution, level of detail) with which the landscape pattern is analysed. If an analysis shall go beyond a merely narrative and descriptive approach, indexes are frequently employed to quantitatively characterize the landscape pattern. These indexes are calculated from one or more measurable attributes. Usually, those indexes are derived on the basis of complete maps produced from remote sensing imagery and GIS analysis, and assuming that segmentation and classification of the imagery has been made with a high level of accuracy. Relatively little has been published on how to possibly estimate landscape pattern from sample surveys. This paper discusses the potential of sample surveys to produce estimates of some aspects of the fragmentation status of a landscape, where forest and non-forest are used as example classes. Sample based indexes can be derived from different sampling and plot designs, where area and perimeter length are attributes that can most easily be estimated. However, not all attributes interesting for landscape pattern description can be estimated from samples. We present a method that gives a metric, which is related to mean patch size. Sample-based approaches have some interesting properties: some analysis of pattern can be done in the absence of complete maps, and also for historic inventory data, when neither maps nor imagery are available. The proposed analysis of estimating a mean patch size related metric could easily be done with common forest inventory plot designs, where no additional measurements are required. This may make it interesting for ``time series{''} using old forest inventory data.},

Abstract = {Climate change is directly related to our livelihoods and needs to be studied in order to form mitigation and adaptation policies. Climate change is a global phenomenon and poses diverse implications in form and type for different ecologies. Human activities are greatly disturbing the nature through using the land for different types of anthropogenic activities like cultural, financial matters, environmental aspects. land policy and land development plans. The present study aims to analyze the climatic variation and assess the land use change of district Bahawalpur having total area of 24,830 km(2). Climatic data (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall) were collected for a period of 30 years (1989-2018). Monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature, annual rainfall, Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) and their anomalies were calculated using secondary data for the study area. Land use data were collected in the form of Landsat satellite images of last 30 years (1990-2019) with 10 yeas interval from different online sources. Landsat ETM and ETM + satellite imagery were processed in ArcGIS software. Results showed that there is a great variation in maximum temperature anomaly during the entire study period. Minimum temperature anomaly shows positive and negative trend during the entire study period from 1989 to 2019. There is a great variation in DTR anomaly during the study period. 10-years moving average of DTR anomaly remained positive during most of the time. There is variation in annual rainfall anomaly, with both positive and negative values. As in the whole time span of 30 years, built-up land increased from 2.54\% (631 Km(2)) in 1990 to 4.66\% (1,157 Km(2)) at the end of 2019. Agricultural land use also increased from 3,439 Km(2) (13.85\%) to 5,168 Km(2) (20.81\%). Forest land use decreased from the 1,321 Km2 (5.32\%) to 775 Km(2) (3.12\%) at end of 2019. Water occupied land with the high fluctuation was 109 Km(2) (0.44\%) in 1990 and in 2019 it recorded 148 Km(2) (0.60\%). The main land use class desert land also decreased from an area of 19,330 Km(2) (77.85\%) to 17,582 Km(2) (70.81\%). Correlation of land use change classes in last 30 years showed relationship intensity between different land use changes. Agricultural land and built up land have strong relationship with the value of 0.98. Desert land and agricultural land have strongly negative relationship with the value of -0.94. This study found how rapidly changes occurred in the land use with rate of land use change is a mile stone for the planners, researchers and scholars for the better understanding towards land use change in district Bahawalpur.},

Title = {Large Scale Flood Risk Mapping in Data Scarce Environments: An Application for Romania},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Large-scale flood risk assessment is essential in supporting national and global policies, emergency operations and land-use management. The present study proposes a cost-efficient method for the large-scale mapping of direct economic flood damage in data-scarce environments. The proposed framework consists of three main stages: (i) deriving a water depth map through a geomorphic method based on a supervised linear binary classification; (ii) generating an exposure land-use map developed from multi-spectral Landsat 8 satellite images using a machine-learning classification algorithm; and (iii) performing a flood damage assessment using a GIS tool, based on the vulnerability (depth-damage) curves method. The proposed integrated method was applied over the entire country of Romania (including minor order basins) for a 100-year return time at 30-m resolution. The results showed how the description of flood risk may especially benefit from the ability of the proposed cost-efficient model to carry out large-scale analyses in data-scarce environments. This approach may help in performing and updating risk assessments and management, taking into account the temporal and spatial changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Around the world, vast improvements in public transportation methods in urban environments have been made. However, in densely populated areas, the bicycle remains a very useful means of transportation. Its small size and minimal environmental impact are the critical factors that maintain its relevance. Moreover, the advancement of connected devices and sharing-based services have allowed private vendors to develop bike-sharing programs, giving millions access to bike transportation around the globe. These bike-sharing programs rely on the user to check out and return the bike to a designated bike-holding station. With the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) services and wirelessly connected devices, there is a major benefit in enabling vendors to track their bicycle assets. Satellite navigation has come a long way, however, it requires a large power overhead. This paper proposes an energy-efficient bicycle tracking system that utilizes bicycle powered Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and Long Range (LoRa) type base-stations in order to track and maintain a real-time location-based inventory of all assets. The BLE beacons are used to track individual bicycle assets based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) proximity and the LoRa base stations exploit longer range communication capabilities to transmit asset location information between each other, for added management capabilities. Preliminary proximity estimations using BLE beacons in an urban outdoor environment show promising results with proximity accuracy consistently under 2 meters.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Health Status of Indonesian Watersheds Using Impervious Surface Area as an Indicator},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Impervious surfaces affect the ecosystem function of watersheds. Therefore, the impervious surface area percentage (ISA\%) in watersheds has been regarded as an important indicator for assessing the health status of watersheds. However, accurate and frequent estimation of ISA\% from satellite data remains a challenge, especially at large scales (national, regional, or global). In this study, we first developed a method to estimate ISA\% by combining daytime and nighttime satellite data. We then used the developed method to generate an annual ISA\% distribution map from 2003 to 2021 for Indonesia. Third, we used these ISA\% distribution maps to assess the health status of Indonesian watersheds according to Schueler's criteria. Accuracy assessment results show that the developed method performed well from low ISA\% (rural) to high ISA\% (urban) values, with a root mean square difference value of 0.52 km(2), a mean absolute percentage difference value of 16.2\%, and a bias of -0.08 km(2). In addition, since the developed method uses only satellite data as input, it can be easily implemented in other regions with some modifications according to differences in light use efficiency and economic development in each region. We also found that 88\% of Indonesian watersheds remain without impact in 2021, indicating that the health status of Indonesian watersheds is not a serious problem. Nevertheless, Indonesia's total ISA increased significantly from 3687.4 km(2) in 2003 to 10,505.5 km(2) in 2021, and most of the increased ISA was in rural areas. These results indicate that negative trends in health status in Indonesian watersheds may emerge in the future without proper watershed management.},

Title = {Interplay of governance elements and their effects on deforestation in tropical landscapes: Quantitative insights from Ecuador},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {148},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {After state-centered and market-centered approaches have driven international development cooperation activities in previous decades, improved governance has now come into the focus as a means to help reversing global trends of tropical deforestation. Yet, ``good governance{''} remains a normative, broad and often underspecified concept consisting of a wide range of elements and implicit value judgements. Specific knowledge is missing on the relative importance of single elements, on their interdependencies and their specific effects. Following an analytical approach, we aimed to investigate if single governance elements affect each other and whether they relate to decreasing deforestation. We conducted a quantitative field study in twelve selected landscapes across 160,000 ha of tropical lowland forest in Ecuador. We mapped governance arrangements and land use in participatory exercises. The performance of single governance elements including tenure, forest management practices, law enforcement, institutions, and participation was quantified based on the governance assessment framework of the World Resource Institute. We assessed context information and used satellite based deforestation data. Principal component analysis showed that all governance elements loaded positively on the first axis. This shows that specific governance elements acted conjointly. They are in general not antagonistic, but interact positively and might reinforce each other. Policy and development work may therefore focus on a smaller number of well-selected governance elements. High performance of specific governance elements, in particular tenure and participation was linked to reduced deforestation. This supports the notion of a number of governance elements as being indeed ``good{''} for low deforestation. This functional understanding draws a more differentiated picture for single governance elements and supports outcome oriented decisions instead of value-oriented principles that underlie ``good governance{''}. Direct deforestation drivers such as agriculture and infrastructure explained larger shares of deforestation as compared to governance. A number of conclusions and recommendations for the specific governance situation in tropical lowland forests of Ecuador are given. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Risk factors related to herd and farmer status, farm and pasture management, and environmental factors derived by satellite data were examined for their association with the prevalence of F. hepatica in sheep and goat farms in Thessaly, Greece. Twelve farms (16.2\%) and 58 farms (78.4\%) of 74 had evidence of infection using coproantigen and serology respectively. The average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of farm location for 12 months before sampling was the most significant environmental risk factor for F. hepatica infection based on high seropositivity. The risk of infection increased by 1\% when the value of NDVI increased by 0.01 degree. A geospatial map was constructed to show the relative risk (RR) of Fasciola infection in sheep and goat farms in Thessaly. In addition, geospatial maps of the model-based predicted RR for the presence of Fasciola infection in farms in Thessaly and the entire area of Greece were constructed from the developed model based on NDVI. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Thessaly should be regarded as an endemic region for Fasciola infection and it represents the first prediction model of Fasciola infection in small ruminants in the Mediterranean basin.},

Title = {Monitoring long-term riparian vegetation trends to inform local habitat management in a mountainous environment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Riparian ecosystems provide critical habitat for many species, yet assessment of vegetation condition at local scales is difficult to measure when considering large areas over long time periods. We present a framework to map and monitor two deciduous cover types, upland and riparian, occupying a small fraction of an expansive, mountainous landscape in north-central Wyoming. Initially, we developed broad-scale predictions of predominant woody vegetation types by integrating Landsat data into species distribution models and combining subsequent outputs into a synthesis map. Then, we evaluated a 35-year Landsat time series (1985-2019) using the Mann-Kendall test to identify significant trends in the condition of upland and riparian deciduous vegetation and assessed the rate and direction of change using the Theil-Sen estimator. Finally, we used plot level data to assess the utility of the framework to detect bottom-up controls (ungulate browse pressure and management actions) on vegetation condition. The synthesis map had an overall correct classification rate of 87\% and field data indicated deciduous vegetation within 45 m of coniferous forest faces increased pressure of conifer expansion. The trend assessment identified consistent patterns operating at the landscape scale across both upland and riparian deciduous vegetation; a predominant greening trend was observed for 12 years followed by a 9-year browning trend, before switching back to a greening trend for the last 13 years of the study. Our results indicate trends are driven by the climate of the measurement period at the landscape scale. Although we did not find conclusive evidence to establish a strong link between browse pressure and satellite data, we highlight examples where prevailing trends can be overridden by local disturbance or management intervention. This framework is transferable to other understudied riparian environments throughout western North America to provide insight on ecohydrological processes and assess global and local stressors across broad spatiotemporal scales.},

Abstract = {Landslide susceptibility maps are vital for disaster management and for planning development activities in the mountainous country like Nepal. In the present study, landslide susceptibility assessment of Mugling-Narayanghat road and its surrounding area is made using bivariate (certainty factor and index of entropy) and multivariate (logistic regression) models. At first, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier reports and aerial photographs as well as by carrying out field survey. As a result, 321 landslides were mapped and out of which 241 (75 \%) were randomly selected for building landslide susceptibility models, while the remaining 80 (25 \%) were used for validating the models. The effectiveness of landslide susceptibility assessment using GIS and statistics is based on appropriate selection of the factors which play a dominant role in slope stability. In this case study, the following landslide conditioning factors were evaluated: slope gradient; slope aspect; altitude; plan curvature; lithology; land use; distance from faults, rivers and roads; topographic wetness index; stream power index; and sediment transport index. These factors were prepared from topographic map, drainage map, road map, and the geological map. Finally, the validation of landslide susceptibility map was carried out using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The ROC plot estimation results showed that the susceptibility map using index of entropy model with AUC value of 0.9016 has highest prediction accuracy of 90.16 \%. Similarly, the susceptibility maps produced using logistic regression model and certainty factor model showed 86.29 and 83.57 \% of prediction accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, the ROC plot showed that the success rate of all the three models performed more than 80 \% accuracy (i.e. 89.15 \% for IOE model, 89.10 \% for LR model and 87.21 \% for CF model). Hence, it is concluded that all the models employed in this study showed reasonably good accuracy in predicting the landslide susceptibility of Mugling-Narayanghat road section. These landslide susceptibility maps can be used for preliminary land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.},

Title = {Phenotyping a diversity panel of quinoa using UAV-retrieved leaf area index, SPAD-based chlorophyll and a random forest approach},

Abstract = {Given its high nutritional value and capacity to grow in harsh environments, quinoa has significant potential to address a range of food security concerns. Monitoring the development of phenotypic traits during field trials can provide insights into the varieties best suited to specific environmental conditions and management strategies. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a promising means for phenotyping and offer the potential for new insights into relative plant performance. During a field trial exploring 141 quinoa accessions, a UAV-based multispectral camera was deployed to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) and SPAD-based chlorophyll across 378 control and 378 saline-irrigated plots using a random forest regression approach based on both individual spectral bands and 25 different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the multispectral imagery. Results show that most VIs had stronger correlation with the LAI and SPAD-based chlorophyll measurements than individual bands. VIs including the red-edge band had high importance in SPAD-based chlorophyll predictions, while VIs including the near infrared band (but not the red-edge band) improved LAI prediction models. When applied to individual treatments (i.e. control or saline), the models trained using all data (i.e. both control and saline data) achieved high mapping accuracies for LAI (R-2 = 0.977-0.980, RMSE = 0.119-0.167) and SPAD-based chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.983-0.986, RMSE = 2.535-2.861). Overall, the study demonstrated that UAV-based remote sensing is not only useful for retrieving important phenotypic traits of quinoa, but that machine learning models trained on all available measurements can provide robust predictions for abiotic stress experiments.},

Abstract = {This study provides improved methanol emission estimates on the global scale, in particular for the largest methanol source, the terrestrial biosphere, and for biomass burning. To this purpose, one complete year of spaceborne measurements of tropospheric methanol columns retrieved for the first time by the thermal infrared sensor IASI aboard the MetOp satellite are compared with distributions calculated by the IMAGESv2 global chemistry-transport model. Two model simulations are performed using a priori biogenic methanol emissions either from the new MEGANv2.1 emission model, which is fully described in this work and is based on net ecosystem flux measurements, or from a previous parameterization based on net primary production by Jacob et al. (2005). A significantly better model performance in terms of both amplitude and seasonality is achieved through the use of MEGANv2.1 in most world regions, with respect to IASI data, and to surface- and air-based methanol measurements, even though important discrepancies over several regions are still present. As a second step of this study, we combine the MEGANv2.1 and the IASI column abundances over continents in an inverse modelling scheme based on the adjoint of the IMAGESv2 model to generate an improved global methanol emission source. The global optimized source totals 187 Tg yr(-1) with a contribution of 100 Tg yr(-1) from plants, only slightly lower than the a priori MEGANv2.1 value of 105 Tg yr(-1). Large decreases with respect to the MEGANv2.1 biogenic source are inferred over Amazonia (up to 55 \%) and Indonesia (up to 58 \%), whereas more moderate reductions are recorded in the Eastern US (20-25 \%) and Central Africa (25-35 \%). On the other hand, the biogenic source is found to strongly increase in the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia (up to a factor of 5) and Western US (factor of 2), probably due to a source of methanol specific to these ecosystems which is unaccounted for in the MEGANv2.1 inventory. The most significant error reductions achieved by the optimization concern the derived biogenic emissions over the Amazon and over the Former Soviet Union. The robustness of the derived fluxes to changes in convective updraft fluxes, in methanol removal processes, and in the choice of the biogenic a priori inventory is assessed through sensitivity inversions. Detailed comparisons of the model with a number of aircraft and surface observations of methanol, as well as new methanol measurements in Europe and in the Reunion Island show that the satellite-derived methanol emissions improve significantly the agreement with the independent data, giving thus credence to the IASI dataset.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {The joint development by Belarus and China of the Great Stone Industrial Park (GSIP) is designed to establish a high-tech industrial zone and an eco-friendly satellite city of Minsk as a key node on the Eurasian Land Bridge linking China with the Eurasian Economic Union and the European Union. The development and organization of the GSIP are explained in the light of a coupling of the strategic goals of the two countries in the context of a new Chinese model of external engagement called an emergent geo-political economic culture. These goals include Belarus' desire to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and oil, upgrade and diversify its economy, strengthen its integration with Eurasia and find new partners, by attracting Chinese and other foreign direct investment in the context of China's Going Out and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). An analysis of the roles of national leaders Aliaksandr Lukashenka and Xi Jinping and of different stakeholders in the predominantly top-down design, development and governance of the park reveals the way in which a BRI cooperation platform permits the coupling of Chinese and Belarusian interests and strategies in ways through which each side expects to benefit.},

Abstract = {Flash floods are very abrupt and sudden and can devastate large areas with in fraction of seconds. Tsunami is also a grass root cause of infrastructure loss and casualties. Tsunami is caused by the release of energy inside the ocean. It has been observed that Tornados and Tsunami frequently occurred that caused more than 120000 casualties between 1992 to 2005. Several approaches and cases have been studied and applied to overcome this topmost issue. Strong and reliable flood risk management system must have the capabilities to forecast and estimate the change in the process: the hydro atmospheric and climatic development that causes flood waves and land and metropolitan exposure that leads to casualties. Techniques utilized for the early investigation of flash floods may be classified into following categories a. Sensors and instrumentation-based b. Radar based c. Satellite images based. In this paper researchers presented a reliable and vigor cost-effective solution for the prediction of flash floods accurately and precisely by using direct measurements with the combination of scaled conjugate gradient back propagation. Researchers have adopted direct measurement method by utilizing couple of sensors named as PIR, ultrasonic sensor, water or humidity sensor, temperature and pressure sensors. Gas sensor has also been used to detect the increased carbon dioxide levels in the environment as soil is saturated more and the probability of flash flood occurrence becomes sure in this situation. An appropriate mixture of estimation sensors can extensively boost the benefit of information in contrast with that from a single sensor. 48 hours of data has been recorded and processed for the false alarm identification by using Scaled conjugate gradient back propagation. Results proved that our proposed system worked better or equivalent to the other available techniques with minimized error rate. Results showed that it performed better than the existing approaches. Multi layer perceptron (MLP) was applied on the same data set for the error and false alarm classification. Results were compared with the multi-layer perceptron and it can be easily observed that they are close enough therefore scaled conjugate gradient back propagation performed very well.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a fundamental model for continuous-time scheduling and marginal pricing of energy generation and storage in day-ahead power systems operation. The paper begins with formulating the economic operation problem of power systems with generating units and energy storage (ES) devices as a continuous-time optimal control problem, where the Lagrange multiplier trajectory associated with the continuous-time power balance constraint is proven to be the marginal price of energy generation and storage. The marginal price is calculated in closed-form, which reveals that in addition to the incremental cost rates of generating units, the marginal price embeds the financial ES charging offers and discharging bids that are defined as incremental charging utility and incremental discharging cost rates. This paper shows that the adjoint function associated with the ES state equation establishes a temporal dependence between the marginal prices during the ES charge and discharge states. A function space-based method is developed to solve the proposed model, which converts the continuous-time problem into a mixed-integer linear programming problem with finite dimensional decision space. The features of the proposed scheduling and pricing models are demonstrated using numerical studies conducted on the IEEE Reliability Test System.},

Title = {Seasonal Change and Spatial Distribution of Traffic Noise in Seferihisar, Turkey},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ACOUSTICS},

Pages = {631-642},
Abstract = {In this study, traffic noise in Seferihisar, which is a holiday resort by the Aegean Sea in the West of Turkey, was investigated. The noise occurring in summer and winter, on weekdays, and at weekends was mapped separately. Besides, land uses exposed to traffic noise were specified. In the carried out method, the land uses were primarily mapped by using the satellite images of the study area. Then, the noise was measured at 46 points during ten days in summer and winter, on weekdays and at weekends, and it was mapped by using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method and by means of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The measurements were taken in the daytime (07: 00-19: 00), in the evening (19: 00-23: 00), and at night (23: 00-07: 00) as stated in the Turkish Regulation of Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise. Since the time interval of the daytime measurements was large, the noise was measured in three different periods for the daytime measurements. In the formation of noise maps, logarithmic averages of all measurements taken at each point were used. The noise maps were overlapped with the land use maps by the help of the GIS techniques; the land use affected by the noise was analyzed. The results showed that the road traffic noise varied from summer to winter seasons in the study area depending on heavy or light traffic. The noise occurring in summer showed an increase both on weekdays and at weekends. While the limit value was exceeded in 49 of the measurement averages taken in winter, the limit value was exceeded in 96 measurements taken in summer. The noise maps formed according to the IDW method displayed that the areas in which the limit value was exceeded in the daytime in summer took up 14.27\% of the study area while this rate went down to 4.06\% in winter. The study area is one of the most important destinations for summer holiday. 20.12\% of the area that exceeded the limit value in summer was builtup and 10.69\% of them was tourism area. The noise together with population and traffic that increase in summer season is an important environmental problem against which some precautions should be taken. The findings of the study present significant results which might guide local governments in preventing and managing the noise.},

Title = {Evaluation of different DTMs in sediment connectivity determination in the Mascarada River Watershed, southern Brazil},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {332},
Pages = {80-87},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The study of sediment connectivity based on the geomorphic characteristics of the watershed has gained interest during the last decades. The calculation of connectivity indexes for a mountainous watershed that is normally susceptible to landslides allows the recognition of the unstable areas that have higher connection to any point such as the watershed outlet. Thus, the knowledge of spatial patterns of connectivity within the watershed is very useful in the sediment-related disaster management because the connectivity provides useful information on sediment pathways. The objective of the present study was to test four different global DTMs to compute the sediment connectivity index (IC) in the Mascarada river watershed (320 km(2)), southern Brazil. By analyzing the land use for each pixel, the Manning roughness was determined and used for the weighting factor in IC calculation. Field survey and satellite image analysis showed that 420 landslides occurred in this watershed on January 5th, 2017. The calculated IC value maps demonstrated that the hillslopes with landslide occurrences have higher values of IC. Among the tested DTMs, the one with the highest resolution (12.5-m resolution DTM) showed the best representation of the flow paths with high IC values. For all the resolutions, the IC mean values of the landslides scars were larger compared to the remaining area of the hillslopes, where the landslides occurred, which implies higher connectivity of the landslides to the watershed outlet. The results also showed that the 12.5-m resolution DTM generated the lowest mean and the largest amplitude of IC values, differentiating areas with high and low connectivity. It is concluded that the global DTM (12.5-m) is capable to provide important information on sediment connectivity and that together with a landslide inventory it can be an important tool for sediment management in mountainous watersheds.

Title = {Modelling fire probability in the Brazilian Amazon using the maximum entropy method},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {955-969},
Abstract = {Fires are both a cause and consequence of important changes in the Amazon region. The development and implementation of better fire management practices and firefighting strategies are important steps to reduce the Amazon ecosystems' degradation and carbon emissions from land-use change in the region. We extended the application of the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) to model fire occurrence probability in the Brazilian Amazon on a monthly basis during the 2008 and 2010 fire seasons using fire detection data derived from satellite images. Predictor variables included climatic variables, inhabited and uninhabited protected areas and land-use change maps. Model fit was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) value (threshold-independent analysis), binomial tests and model sensitivity and specificity (threshold-dependent analysis). Both threshold-independent (AUC = 0.919 +/- 0.004) and threshold-dependent evaluation indicate satisfactory model performance. Pasture, annual deforestation and secondary vegetation are the most effective variables for predicting the distribution of the occurrence data. Our results show that MaxEnt may become an important tool to guide on-the-ground decisions on fire prevention actions and firefighting planning more effectively and thus to minimise forest degradation and carbon loss from forest fires in Amazonian ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Wildfires in Indonesia 2015 burnt forests in many protected areas, including remaining forests in Tesso Nilo National Park. We investigated the extent to which 2015's wildfires affect the remaining habitat and the spatial distribution of ungulates in the park by using satellite images to identify burnt and unburnt forest patches. Habitat conditions and the presence of ungulates indicated by the number of ungulate signs were compared between burnt and unburnt areas. The devastated trees at different rates depending on tree lifeform stages. Wefound that younger trees were more vulnerable to fire. The abundance of ungulates did not differ significantly between burnt and unburnt areas, but all vegetation characteristics were significantly different (Mann-Whitney U-test p-value < 0.05). We surmise that food such as new shoots or leaves, particularly at the edge of burnt areas, attracted ungulates out of unburnt areas. The remaining forest is relatively small, and the park is under continued pressure from illegal conversion, so any further loss of remaining forest as refugia will likely harm the ungulate population. We recommend that management should prioritize the preservation of remaining pristine habitat and the reduction of fire suppression, especially during the dry season.},

Although having their own contribution to sustainable development separately, the linkages between wetlands and forests exemplify the importance of managing ecosystems in their entirety to protect their ecological character and related ecosystem services (ES) that are vital to human activity. To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.

Abstract = {Wetland is an important part of the natural ecosystem. The study of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) and its prediction is of great significance to land-use optimization and ecological environment protection of wetlands. Based on the LULC data of Chongming Dongtan Wetland from 1986 to 2020, the paper analyzed the driving factors of LULCC and predicted the LULCC in the next 10 years by using CA-Markov model. The main land-use type of wetland is water, followed by cultivated land, and other types of land-use areas are small. The area of paddy fields, woodland and construction land continue to increase, while the grassland and mudflat continue to decrease. Waters are gradually transformed into natural wetlands due to sediment accumulation in nature reserves. Agricultural reclamation leads to large-scale conversion of natural wetlands into paddy fields in agricultural reclamation areas. The expansion of construction land and woodland has occupied a large scale of cultivated land. Economic development and agricultural population were the main driving factors of LULCC, with contribution rates of 69.02\% and 15.06\%, respectively. The impact on wetlands increased rapidly after 2002. Fiscal expenditure, agricultural and industrial output value explained wetland LULCC the most. In 2020-2030 years, the area of mudflat and waters increase, the area of reed beach and grassland will continue to decrease. The area of cultivated land will decrease by 964.72hm(2). Woodland and construction land showed a downward trend different from the past. There was no obvious change in spatial distribution.},

Title = {An integrated approach to streamflow estimation and flood inundation mapping using VIC, RAPID and LISFLOOD-FP},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {610},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Controlling the damaging effects of fluvial flood events has been a major challenge for mankind. Integrated hydrologic-hydrodynamic models are often employed to estimate the flow and vital flood inundation information for mitigating such damages. The most important criterion for their implementation is that they should offer large-scale applicability with a finer resolution to have local relevance and practicability. This study presented an integrated modeling framework, VIC-RAPID-LISFP that couples a hydrological model (VIC), a river routing model (RAPID) and a hydrodynamic model (LISFLOOD-FP) for fast generation of high-resolution flow and flood inundation extent. The utility of the model is tested and demonstrated for a case study in the Upper Krishna River basin in India. The results showed that the simulated hourly streamflows from the calibrated model match reasonably well with the observations in terms of various efficiency measures. Also, the generated flood inundation maps from the model can reliably capture more than 80\% of the satellite-derived flood inundation extent during both the low and high flow events. The proposed modeling framework is based on readily available open source hydrographic data, and minimum meteorological information, so it has global applicability for supporting a flood management system with local relevance, especially for the data-scarce regions.},

Abstract = {Piping erosion is one of the water erosions that cause significant changes in the landscape, leading to environmental degradation. To prevent losses resulting from tube growth and enable sustainable development, developing high-precision predictive algorithms for piping erosion is essential. Boosting is a classic algorithm that has been successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. Therefore, this work investigated the predictive performance of the Boosted Linear Model (BLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (Boost GLM), and Deep Boosting models for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in Zarandieh Watershed located in the Markazi province of Iran. A piping inventory map including 152 piping erosion locations was prepared for algorithm training and testing. 18 initial predisposing factors (altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, rainfall, land use, soil type, bulk density, CEC, pH, clay, silt, sand, topographical position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) was derived from multiple remote sensing (RS) sources to determine the piping erosion prone areas. The most significant predisposing factors were selected using multi-collinearity analysis which indicates linear correlations between predisposing factors. Finally, the results were evaluated for Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive values (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV), and Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve. The best Sensitivity (0.80), Specificity (0.84), PPV (0.85), NPV (0.79), and ROC (0.93), were obtained by Deep Boosting model. The results of the piping erosion susceptibility study in agricultural land use showed that 41\% of agricultural lands are very sensitive to piping erosion. This outcome will enable natural resource managers and local planners to assess and take effective decisions to minimize damages to agricultural land use by accurately identifying the most vulnerable areas. Hence, this research proved Deep Boosting model's ability for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in comparison to other popular methods such as BLM, BRT, and Boost GLM.},

Abstract = {Analysis described in the paper were made in the frame of the PROZA (Operational decision-making based on atmospheric conditions, http://projekt-proza.pl/) project co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund. One of its tasks was to develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena, which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model) forecasts. The paper presents analysis of exemplary MCSs in the context of near real-time prediction system development and proves that developed tool can be helpful in MCSs monitoring.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The balance between the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) is an important prerequisite for maintaining the sustainability of ecological protection and restoration project implementation. However, research related to ecological protection and restoration is insufficient for the study of the demand for ecosystem services. Many ecological protection and restoration projects have been implemented in the Fujian Province, but the ESs and the relationship changes between supply and demand are not clear. In this study, multisource remote sensing and public data and the InVEST model were used to quantitatively assess and map four typical ESs, including food production, water yield, soil retention and carbon sequestration. Hotspot analysis was used to analyze the spatial cluster of the ESs supply-demand ratio. The results showed that: (1) there were trade-offs between supporting and regulating services, particularly between carbon sequestration and water yield services, and the strength of trade-offs or synergies between food production and other services was stronger in protection and restoration areas than in other areas; (2) the supply of ESs in the Fujian Province exceeded the demand, and the supply-demand ratio for ESs decreased from the mountainous regions in the northwest interior to the economically developed regions in the southeast coast; and (3) ecological restoration projects improved the relationship between supply and demand for some ESs, while other areas (except protection and restoration areas) had many low-value clusters of supply-demand ratios, especially regarding water yield and carbon sequestration services. Based on the results, our findings also provide suggestions for ensuring the sustainability of ecological protection and restoration in southeast hilly areas and other similar regions.},

Title = {Parameters adaptive adjustment strategy of quantum communication channel in free-space based on software-defined quantum communication},

Abstract = {Quantum communication in free space will be disturbed by natural environment, such as fog, dust, and rain, which is a difficult problem in the construction of quantum communication system. In order to solve this problem and improve the survivability of quantum communication system, we propose an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy for free-space quantum communication based on software-defined quantum communication (SDQC). Firstly, we propose a software-defined quantum communication model based on the idea of software defined networks. The architecture of SDQC is divided into four layers: transport layer, access layer, control layer, and management layer. The SDQC system sends the link information to the preset program at a management level through the real-time monitoring of channel state by the access layer. According to the link information, the management level issues instructions to the control layer to adjust the parameters such as the initial quantum state and the existence time of single quantum state, in order to improve the quantum entanglement and fidelity. Secondly, we analyze the relationship between quantum fidelity and parameters in SDQC system under three noise channels, i.e. depolarization channel, spontaneous amplitude decay channel, and phase damping channel. In the depolarized channel, the quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase of the error probability P-d of the qubit. When the error probability of qubit is certain, the system has the maximum quantum fidelity with the value of parameter x is 0.5. In the spontaneous amplitude decay channel, the quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase of the quantum state transition probability p(t). When the transition probability of quantum state is certain, the higher the value of parameter x, the higher the fidelity will be. In the phase-damped channel, the quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase of the probability p(c) with which the qubit and the background interference equivalent quantum state have complete elastic scattering. When the probability is certain, the larger the value of |1/2 - x|, the higher the quantum fidelity of the system will be. Finally, we study the optimal values of SDQC system parameters under different environmental disturbances. The simulation results show that the optimal parameters of SDQC system are different when the parameters of three noise channels, namely depolarization, spontaneous amplitude decay and phase damping, are different. The system adaptively selects the initial quantum state and the existence time of single quantum state according to the environmental change and business demand, so that the quantum fidelity is always at the peak in the communication process. This strategy effectively improves the adaptability and comprehensive immunity of the quantum communication system.},

Title = {Land use land cover change and the resilience of social-ecological systems in a sub-region in South west Cameroon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains highly prevalent in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and undermining the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems. We analysed satellite imagery of 1986 and 2018 to examine the extent and spatial patterns of LULCC in Fako sub-region of Cameroon. In addition, we explored the likelihood of LULCC and magnitude of impact of the drivers and predictors of LULCC in the sub-region by engaging 25 stakeholders in a focus group survey. Other cultivated areas of cropland, built-up, oil palm, and banana plantation covers increased by 21,360 ha (10.5\%), 3152 ha (1.6\%), 5721 ha (2.8\%), and 1823 ha (0.9\%), while dense forest, rubber and tea plantation covers decreased by -44,945 ha (-22.1\%), -15,557 ha (-7.7\%), and -110 ha (-0.1\%), respectively, from 1986 to 2018. Most of the deforestation and LULCC was caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. The spatial pattern of LULCC showed that expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland and agro-industrial plantations were highest in the north and east zones, respectively, while expansion of built-up areas and decrease in agro-industrial plantation covers were highest in the central, south and western coastal zones of Fako division. The variations in the spatial patterns of LULCC between the sub-divisions are attributed to differences in rates of population growth and urbanisation, topography, size of farming population, proportion of cultivable land, socioeconomic opportunities, and strength and resilience of local economy. The presence of the Mount Cameroon (4095 m), with high value forests, endemism, and conservation attractiveness restricted increased LULCC with elevation, while LULCC increased with nearness to the sea and national road networks. The likelihood of change from one LULC to oil palm plantation, banana plantation, and other cultivated areas and from rubber plantation, dense forest, lowland grassland to other land uses was 95\% and 90\%, respectively. Population growth, agricultural and farmland expansion, and infrastructural development were ranked as the three most important drivers of degradation under the business as usual scenario, while sustainable land management, good governance, and reforestation were ranked as the three most important predictors of LULCC reduction under the green economy scenario. In general, production and living space functions significantly increased at the expense of ecological land cover. Prioritising and increasing the legal protection of the mountain and coastal land-boundary ecosystems while providing for production and living land are invaluable for the sustainability of the social-ecological systems in the western highlands of Cameroon.},

Title = {Climate limits on European forest structure across space and time},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {168-178},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The structure of a forest dictates its function, vulnerability to mortality, and ecosystem services it provides. Many aspects of the environment and management determine forest structures, such as canopy height, stand density, carbon content, etc. Environmental factors, such as climate, limit the extent to which management can maximize structures of a forest. By understanding how climate limits forest structures over large landscapes we can better quantify the potential upper limit that a forest structure can achieve independent of management. Further, by quantifying how climate limits forest structures we can deepen our understanding of the impact climate change has had and will have on our forest resources and services. This type of information goes beyond quantifying how climate will impact the pools and fluxes of a forest, which is typically done for climate change studies over large landscapes. Estimating how climate change will impact structures will allow us to quantify how climate change will impact resources and services unquantifiable by pools and fluxes alone - such as biodiversity, habitat suitability, and market values. We quantified how maximum and minimum temperatures, and precipitation limit 3 forest structures, diameter at breast height, height, and basal area across the European continent. We found that climate zones exist that maximize each forest structure. Further, we estimated how climate change since the 1950's has influenced the potential structures of European forests by assessing eight individual forests throughout Europe and then Europe as a whole. All three forest structures are limited in different ways depending on their location in Europe. Though some individual forests have seen a benefit from climate change, European forests on average have lost 5.0\%, 1.7\% and 6.5\% of potential forest diameter, height and basal area respectively. Further, the extremes of the climate values in our study, which may support endemic life, have already begun to vanish from the entire continent.},

Abstract = {Accurate regional and global information on land cover and its changes over time is crucial for environmental monitoring, land management, and planning. In this study, we selected Fengning County, in China's Hebei Province, as a case study area. Using satellite data, we generated fused normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with high spatial and temporal resolution by utilizing the STARFM algorithm to produce a fused GF-1 and MODIS NDVI dataset. We extracted seven phenological parameters (including the start, end, and length of the growing season, base value, mid-season date, maximum NDVI, seasonal NDVI amplitude) from a fused NDVI time-series after reconstruction using the TIMESAT software. We developed four classification scenarios based on different combinations of GF-1 spectral features, the fused NDVI time-series, and the phenological parameters. We then classified the land cover using a support vector machine and analyzed the classification accuracies. We found that the proposed method achieved satisfactory classification results, and that the combination of the fused NDVI data with the extracted phenological parameters significantly improved classification accuracy. The classification accuracy based on the composited GF-1 multi-spectral bands combined with the phenological parameters was the highest among the four scenarios, with an overall classification accuracy of 88.8\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8714, which represent increases of 9.3 percentage points and 0.1073, respectively, compared with GF-1 spectral data alone. The producer's and user's accuracy for different land cover types improved, with a few exceptions, and cropland and broadleaf forest had the largest increase.},

Abstract = {Hai Phong city is located in the Northern coast of Vietnam where the mangroves are distributed between zone I and zone II among the four mangrove zones in Vietnam. This city is vulnerable to rising sea levels associated with climate change and tropical cyclones, which are forecasted to become more severe due to the impact of climate change. In the past, mangrove forests in this city have decreased markedly because of over expansion of shrimp farming. Thus, identification of mangrove forests is important to monitor and support mangrove conservation and management in the coastal zone. The objectives of this research were to identify the locations of mangrove and characterize mangrove species in Hai Phong using HH and HV backscatters of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) with enhanced Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Image segmentation was used to identify the locations of mangrove forests. Moreover, Geographic Information System (GIS) was applied to update current status of mangrove species in 2015. The results showed that the means of HH and HV backscatter coefficients of K. obovata are lower than S. caseolaris. K. obovata has HH value around -13.9 dB until -10.3 dB and HV value around -20.6 dB until -16.2 dB. Higher HH values between about -14.9 dB and -6.8 dB and HV values between roughly -20.6 dB and -14.3 dB have observed by S. caseolaris. The total area of mangrove forest in Hai Phong in the year 2015 was around 4084 hectares, of which S. caseolaris occupied over 68\% and mixed mangrove species was approximately 25.6\%. This research indicates the potential for the use of L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR in characterizing mangrove forest species in the coastal zone.},

Abstract = {Vegetation cover on the coast of Bahia de Banderas, Nayarit, has been modified and reduced dramatically in recent decades because of tourism development, so that the objectives of this study were: (1) generate information on the composition, richness, and structural values of species of trees, shrubs and woody vines and (2) define the spatial distribution and the current cover of vegetation. The field sampling for the floristic and ecological information was conducted in 60 plots of 1,000 m(2) each; and vegetation cover map was generated from satellite images. 43 families, 92 genera and 127 species were identified. The families with the highest number of species were Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae and Malvaceae; 59 \% of the species were trees, 34.6 \% shrubs and 6.4 \% woody vines. Two variants of tropical deciduous forest and three of tropical semideciduous forest, which together occupy 36 \% of the total area were recognized. The species with the highest relative importance value in the tropical semideciduous forest were Bursera simaruba, Brosimum alicastrum, Couepia polyandra, Ficus obtusifolia, Hippomane mancinella, Attalea cohune, Piper aduncum, and Pisonia aculeata. In the tropical deciduous forest species with higher relative importance value were Bursera instabilis, Cochlospermum vitifolium, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Ficus cotinifolia, Haematoxylum brasiletto, Lysiloma divaricatum, Lonchocarpus mutans, and Plumeria rubra. The tourism and agricultural development, the presence of species in a risk category, and small surface with natural vegetation, indicate the need of implementing management and conservation programs in this area of Nayarit.},

Abstract = {Land use land cover (LULC) changes are caused by natural and human alterations of the landscape that could largely affect forest biodiversity and the environment. The study aimed to analyze LULC change dynamics and driving forces in the western escarpment of the rift valley of the Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Digital satellite images, which are downloaded from USGS, were analyzed using ERDAS Imagine (14) and Arc GIS 10.2 software and supervised image classification was used to generate LULC classification, accuracy assessment, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Drivers of LULC change were identified and analyzed. Four land classes were identified such as forest, farmland, settlement, and water-wetlands. Settlement and farmlands have increased by 8\% and 6\%, respectively. On the other hand, both forest and water-wetlands decreased by aerial coverage of 9\% and 5\%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the study area was 92.86\%, 94.22\%, and 94.3\% with a kappa value of 0.902, 0.92, and 0.922, respectively. NDVI values ranged between -0.42 and 0.73. Agricultural expansion (31.4\%), expansion of settlement (25.7\%) and Fuelwood collection and Charcoal production (22.9\%) were the main driving forces that affected the biodiversity of the vegetation in the study area. Integrated land use and policy to protect biodiversity loss, forest degradation and climate changes are deemed necessary.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the first decadal reanalysis simulation of the biogeochemistry of the North West European shelf, along with a full evaluation of its skill, confidence, and value. An error-characterized satellite product for chlorophyll was assimilated into a physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The results showed that the reanalysis improved the model simulation of assimilated chlorophyll in 60\% of the study region. Model validation metrics showed that the reanalysis had skill in matching a large data set of in situ observations for 10 ecosystem variables. Spearman rank correlations were significant and higher than 0.7 for physical-chemical variables (temperature, salinity, and oxygen), similar to 0.6 for chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, and silicate), and significant, though lower in value, for partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4). The reanalysis captured the magnitude of pH and ammonia observations, but not their variability. The value of the reanalysis for assessing environmental status and variability has been exemplified in two case studies. The first shows that between 325,000 and 365,000 km(2) of shelf bottom waters were vulnerable to oxygen deficiency potentially threatening bottom fishes and benthos. The second application confirmed that the shelf is a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the total amount of uptake varies between 36 and 46 Tg C yr(-1) at a 90\% confidence level. These results indicate that the reanalysis output data set can inform the management of the North West European shelf ecosystem, in relation to eutrophication, fishery, and variability of the carbon cycle.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Kernels found in stone pinecones are of great economic value, often surpassing timber income for most forest owners. Visually evaluating cone production on standing trees is challenging since the cones are located in the sun-exposed part of the crown, and covered by two vegetative shoots. Very few studies were carried out in evaluating how new remote sensing technologies such as terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) can be used in assessing cone production, or in trying to explain the tree-to-tree variability within a given stand. Using data from 129 trees in 26 plots located in the Spanish Northern Plateau, the gain observed by using TLS data when compared to traditional inventory data in predicting the presence, the number, and the average weight of the cones in an individual tree was evaluated. The models using TLS-derived metrics consistently showed better fit statistics, when compared to models using traditional inventory data pertaining to site and tree levels. Crown dimensions such as projected crown area and crown volume, crown density, and crown asymmetry were the key TLS-derived drivers in understanding the variability in inter-tree cone production. These results underline the importance of crown characteristics in assessing cone production in stone pine. Moreover, as cone production (number of cones and average weight) is higher in crowns with lower density, the use of crown pruning, abandoned over 30 years ago, might be the key to increasing production in combination with stand density management.},

Abstract = {Bird conservation Joint Ventures are collaborative partnerships between public agencies and private organizations that facilitate habitat management to support waterfowl and other bird populations. A subset of Joint Ventures has developed energetic carrying capacity models (ECCs) to translate regional waterfowl population goals into habitat objectives during the non-breeding period. Energetic carrying capacity models consider food biomass, metabolism, and available habitat to estimate waterfowl carrying capacity within an area. To evaluate Joint Venture ECCs in the context of waterfowl space use, we monitored 33 female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 55 female American black ducks (A. rubripes) using global positioning system satellite telemetry in the central and eastern United States. To quantify space use, we measured first-passage time (FPT: time required for an individual to transit across a circle of a given radius) at biologically relevant spatial scales for mallards (3.46 km) and American black ducks (2.30 km) during the non-breeding period, which included autumn migration, winter, and spring migration. We developed a series of models to predict FPT using Joint Venture ECCs and compared them to a biological null model that quantified habitat composition and a statistical null model, which included intercept and random terms. Energetic carrying capacity models predicted mallard space use more efficiently during autumn and spring migrations, but the statistical null was the top model for winter. For American black ducks, ECCs did not improve predictions of space use; the biological null was top ranked for winter and the statistical null was top ranked for spring migration. Thus, ECCs provided limited insight into predicting waterfowl space use during the non-breeding season. Refined estimates of spatial and temporal variation in food abundance, habitat conditions, and anthropogenic disturbance will likely improve ECCs and benefit conservation planners in linking non-breeding waterfowl habitat objectives with distribution and population parameters.

Abstract = {This paper presents an automated approach for efficient detection of building regions in complex environments. We investigate the shadow evidence to focus on building regions, and the shadow areas are detected by recently developed false colour shadow detector. The directional spatial relationship between buildings and their shadows in image space is modelled with the prior knowledge of illumination direction. To do that, an approach based on fuzzy landscapes is presented. Once all landscapes are collected, a pruning process is applied to eliminate the landscapes that may occur due to non-building objects. Thereafter, we benefit from a graph-theoretic approach to accurately detect building regions. We consider the building detection task as a binary partitioning problem where a building region has to be accurately separated from its background. To solve the two-class partitioning, an iterative binary graph-cut optimization is performed. In this paper, we redesign the input requirements of the iterative partitioning from the previously detected landscape regions, so that the approach gains an efficient fully automated behaviour for the detection of buildings. Experiments performed on 10 test images selected from QuickBird (0.6 m) and Geoeye-1 (0.5 m) high resolution datasets showed that the presented approach accurately localizes and detects buildings with arbitrary shapes and sizes in complex environments. The tests also reveal that even under challenging environmental and illumination conditions (e.g. low solar elevation angles, snow cover) reasonable building detection performances could be achieved by the proposed approach.},

Title = {The small pelagic fishery of the Pemba Channel, Tanzania: What we know and what we need to know for management under climate change},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Small pelagic fish, including anchovies, sardines and sardinellas, mackerels, capelin, hilsa, sprats and herrings, are distributed widely, from the tropics to the far north Atlantic Ocean and to the southern oceans off Chile and South Africa. They are most abundant in the highly productive major eastern boundary upwelling systems and are characterised by significant natural variations in biomass. Overall, small pelagic fisheries represent about one third of global fish landings although a large proportion of the catch is processed into animal feeds. Nonetheless, in some developing countries in addition to their economic value, small pelagic fisheries also make an important contribution to human diets and the food security of many low-income households. Such is the case for many communities in the Zanzibar Archipelago and on mainland Tanzania in the Western Indian Ocean. Of great concern in this region, as elsewhere, is the potential impact of climate change on marine and coastal ecosystems in general, and on small pelagic fisheries in particular. This paper describes data and information available on Tanzania's small pelagic fisheries, including catch and effort, management protocols and socio-economic significance. Then, incorporating the rapidly improving understanding of the region's oceanography resulting from the application of remote sensing and oceanographic modelling, the paper undertakes the most complete assessment to date of the potential impacts of climate change on the small pelagic fishery of the Pemba Channel. Pathways of climate change impact are explored and crucial knowledge gaps, both in terms of the fishery itself and the wider ecosystem, are identified in order to guide future research activities. Although we analyse small pelagics in the specific context of the Pemba Channel, the key challenges identified in the analysis are likely to be relevant to many small pelagic fisheries in coastal nations heavily dependent on living marine resources.},

Abstract = {Wadi Naghamish is located at a distance of 20 km east of Matrouh City. It occupies an area of about 9000 ha. Wadi Naghamish suffers from seasonal floods that can remove the surface layers, cut off the natural cover, destroy the infrastructures, and cause many natural disasters as well as cause a great economic loss. The study aimed at evaluating soil erosion in Wadi Naghamish, Northwest Coast of Egypt using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) based integration soil chemical, physical properties, and topographic factors. Geomorphological units of Wadi Naghamish were identified based on the integration of sentinel 2 image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The Geomorphological units were classified into: Tableland 77\%, Escarpment 1.3\%, Basin 2.1\%, Alluvial terraces 5.6\%, Wadi 8.98\%. Sandy beach 0.03\% of the total area. The results indicated that soil erosion values were associated with the geomorphic feature of the study area where, the highest values were observed in Tableland unit, where it has average soil erosion ranging between 0.42 +/- 0.21 to 55 +/- 39 t h(-1) y(-1). Meanwhile the lowest values were observed in Wadi, alluvial terraces and Basin where, the overall average of soil erosion were 0.41 +/- 0.23, 0.26 +/- 0.09 and 0.19 +/- 0.13 t h(-1) y(-1) sequentially. The highest values were found in the sloping areas where slope length value reaches 2.8 and the erodibility values ringing between 0.3 and 0.5 Mg h MJ(-1) mm(-1). Therefore, the study emphasized the importance of relying on scientific study in preparing an appropriate management plan including a suitable potential crop system, increasing the organic matter, and implementing a no-till or direct sowing system to preserve the soil from erosion.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing \& Space Science.

Title = {Responses of Ecosystem Services to Urbanization-Induced Land Use Changes in Ecologically Sensitive Suburban Areas in Hangzhou, China},

Abstract = {Ecologically sensitive suburban areas provide important ecosystem services and protect urban ecological security because of their multiple functions in natural and human systems. The research on the ecological environment effects of land use activities in ecologically sensitive suburban areas is important in guiding the healthy and sustainable development of cities. Taking the west suburbs of Hangzhou in China as a case study, we quantified land use changes from Landsat satellite imagery and calculated the value of ecosystem services using the well-established equivalent factor table for land use/cover change (LUCC) and ecosystem services value (ESV). The impacts of LUCC on the ecological environment were analyzed using the transfer matrix of land use and coefficient of elasticity. Results revealed the following. (1) The total ESV in the western suburban area of Hangzhou decreased from \$109.95 million in 2000 to \$87.09 million in 2016. Moreover, the ESV of gas regulation, climate regulation, soil formation and protection, as well as biodiversity conservation presented a large decrease of more than 25\%, especially between 2010 and 2016. (2) The spatial distribution of ESV was high in the west and low in the east. The regions with a significant reduction in ESV were mainly distributed in the eastern town of Wuchang and in Jincheng Town located in the midwest valley. (3) Industrial agglomeration activities in the ecologically sensitive suburban area emerged as the primary factor influencing ESV for various land uses. The elasticity indicator for assessing the responses to ESV changes relative to LUCC showed that 1\% of the land conversion in this area resulted in average changes in ESV of 4.1\% after the establishment of the industrial agglomeration area. (4) The increase in construction land was associated with a significant decrease in forest area because of the policy of cultivated land requisition-compensation balance and development strategies for low-slope hilly lands. Consequently, the ESV in the ecologically sensitive suburban areas rapidly declined.},

Title = {Comparison of Accuracy of Surface Temperature Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Satellite for Precise Thermal Environment Monitoring of Urban Parks Using In Situ Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Rapid urbanization has led to several severe environmental problems, including so-called heat island effects, which can be mitigated by creating more urban green spaces. However, the temperature of various surfaces differs and precise measurement and analyses are required to determine the ``coolest{''} of these. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of surface temperature data based on thermal infrared (TIR) cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have recently been utilized for the spatial analysis of surface temperatures. Accordingly, we investigated land surface temperatures (LSTs) in green spaces, specifically those of different land cover types in an urban park in Korea. We compared and analyzed LST data generated by a thermal infrared (TIR) camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and LST data from the Landsat 8 satellite for seven specific periods. For comparison and evaluation, we measured in situ LSTs using contact thermometers. The UAV TIR LST showed higher accuracy (R-2 0.912, root mean square error (RMSE) 3.502 degrees C) than Landsat TIR LST accuracy (R-2 value lower than 0.3 and RMSE of 7.246 degrees C) in all periods. The Landsat TIR LST did not show distinct LST characteristics by period and land cover type; however, grassland, the largest land cover type in the study area, showed the highest accuracy. With regard to the accuracy of the UAV TIR LST by season, the accuracy was higher in summer and spring (R2 0.868-0.915, RMSE 2.523-3.499 degrees C) than in autumn and winter (R-2 0.766-0.79, RMSE 3.834-5.398 degrees C). Some land cover types (concrete bike path, wooden deck) were overestimated, showing relatively high total RMSEs of 4.439 degrees C and 3.897 degrees C, respectively, whereas grassland, which has lower LST, was underestimated-showing a total RMSE of 3.316 degrees C. Our results showed that the UAV TIR LST could be measured with sufficient reliability for each season and land cover type in an urban park with complex land cover types. Accordingly, our results could contribute to decision-making for urban spaces and environmental planning in consideration of the thermal environment.},

Abstract = {A main field and satellite fields consist of several separate reservoirs with gas cap and/or oil rim. A processing facility on the main field receives and processes the oil, gas, and water from all the reservoirs. This facility is typically capable of processing only a limited amount of oil, gas, and water per unit of time. In order to satisfy these processing limitations, the production needs to be choked. The available capacity is shared among several field owners with different commercial interests. In this paper, we focus on how total oil and gas production from all the fields could be optimized. The satellite-field owners negotiate processing capacities on the main-field facility. This introduces additional processing-capacity constraints (booking constraints) for the owners of the main field. If the total wealth created by all owners represents the economic interests of the community, it is of interest to investigate whether the total wealth may be increased by lifting the booking constraints. If all reservoirs may be produced more optimally by removing the booking constraints, all owners may benefit from this when appropriate commercial arrangements are in place. We will compare two production strategies. The first production strategy optimizes locally, at distinct time intervals. At given intervals, the production is prioritized so that the maximum amount of oil is produced. In the second production strategy, a fixed weight is assigned to each reservoir. The purpose of the weights is to be able to prioritize some reservoirs before others. The weights are optimized from a life-cycle perspective. As an illustration, a case study based on real data is presented. For the examples considered, it is beneficial to lift the booking constraints because all of the reservoirs combined can be produced more efficiently when this is done.},

Title = {A Simple Method to Estimate Weed Control Threshold by Using RGB Images from Drones},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The estimation of the infestation level in a field and the consequent determination of the economic threshold is a basic requisite to rationalize post-emergence weeding. In this study, a simple and inexpensive procedure to determine the economic threshold based on weed cover is proposed. By using high-resolution RGB images captured by a low-cost drone, a free downloadable app for image processing and common spreadsheet software to perform the model parametrization, two different methods have been tested. The first method was based on the joint estimation of the two parameters involved in weed cover calculation, whereas the second method required the availability of further images for the separate estimation of the first parameter. The reliability of the two methods has been evaluated through the comparison with observed data and the goodness of fit in parameter calibration has been verified by calculating appropriate quality indices. The results showed an acceptable estimation of the weed cover value for the second method with respect to observed data (0.24 vs. 0.17 m(2) and 0.17 vs. 0.14 m(2), by processing images captured at 10 and 20 m, respectively), whereas the estimations obtained with the first method were disappointing (0.35 vs. 0.17 m(2) and 0.33 vs. 0.14 m(2), by processing images captured at 10 and 20 m, respectively).},

Title = {Technology Roadmapping Architecture Based on Knowledge Management: Case Study for Improved Indigenous Coffee Production from Guerrero, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Having demonstrated its importance for economic and human developments, technological change is considered one of the biggest supports worldwide. Today, with the population increase, the inclusion of technology is considered the most appropriate way to reduce the impact of this challenge. Considering 171 indigenous coffee producers from Paraje Montero and Tierra Colorada from Guerrero, Mexico, the present study proposes technological routes for the indigenous coffee production chain and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as sensors, actuators, and processing devices basing on the requirements of the chain. During face-to-face sessions, questionaries, field visits, and literature review for knowledge management, the results expose the need of effective actions against diseases and the reduction of climate change, lack of infrastructure, old plantations, and lack of commercialization channels; for these and considering the requirement of greenhouse technology by indigenous coffee producers and following the labor value driver of the digital compass, the necessity of several kinds of sensors, technologies, and methodologies has been identified with high possibilities to be implemented by similar producers analyzed in this manuscript to help in solving the problems identified in this work. The combination of remote sensing, signal processing, and spectroscopy could be employed to explore mineralogical features of soil and help problems with fertilization; sensor modules to collect temperature, humidity, and light intensity data are a priority for greenhouse monitoring; electrochemical sensors and optical technologies could be of great help to detect the presence of diseases in coffee plants; and the installation of a greenhouse solar dryer is necessary to reduce the time of the sun drying process and protect the coffee cherry. These emerging technologies will help to improve the production of coffee. The study contributes to identify a technology roadmap proposing technological implements according to indigenous coffee production chain requirements and serves as support for future studies in indigenous regions.},

Title = {Monitoring Quarry Area with Landsat Long Time-Series for Socioeconomic Study},

Abstract = {Quarry sites result from human activity, which includes the removal of original vegetation and the overlying soil to dig out stones for building use. Therefore, the dynamics of the quarry area provide a unique view of human mining activities. Actually, the topographic changes caused by mining activities are also a result of the development of the local economy. Thus, monitoring the quarry area can provide information about the policies of the economy and environmental protection. In this paper, we developed a combined method of machine learning classification and quarry region analysis to estimate the quarry area in a quarry region near Beijing. A temporal smoothing based on the classification results of all years was applied in post-processing to remove outliers and obtain gently changing sequences along the monitoring term. The method was applied to Landsat images to derive a quarry distribution map and quarry area time series from 1984 to 2017, revealing significant inter-annual variability. The time series revealed a five-stage development of the quarry area with different growth patterns. As the study region lies on two jurisdictions-Tianjin and Hebei-a comparison of the quarry area changes in the two jurisdictions was applied, which revealed that the different policies in the two regions could impose different impacts on the development of a quarry area. An analysis concerning the relationship between quarry area and gross regional product (GRP) was performed to explore the potential application on socioeconomic studies, and we found a strong positive correlation between quarry area and GRP in Langfang City, Hebei Province. These results demonstrate the potential benefit of annual monitoring over the long-term for socioeconomic studies, which can be used for mining decision making.},

Title = {Changing significance of landslide Hazard and risk after the 2015 M<sub>w</sub> 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal Earthquake},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The 2015 M-w 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal Earthquake triggered in excess of 20,000 landslides across 14 districts of Central and Western Nepal. Whilst the instantaneous impact of these landslides was significant, the ongoing effect of the earthquake on changing the potential for rainfall-triggered landsliding in the months and years that followed has remained poorly understood and challenging to predict. To provide insight into how landsliding has evolved since the earthquake, and how it has impacted those living in the affected area, a detailed time-series landslide mapping campaign was undertaken to monitor the evolution of coseismic landslides and the initiation of new post-seismic landslides. This was supplemented by numerical modelling to simulate the future potential reactivation and runout of landslides as debris flows under monsoon rainfall, identifying locations potentially at risk. This analysis shows that landslide hazard was higher in November 2019 as compared to immediately after the 2015 earthquake, with a considerable portion of the landscape being impacted by landsliding. We show that, while pre-existing landslides continued to pose the majority of hazard in the aftermath of the earthquake, a significant number of landslides also occurred in new locations. We discuss the value of this type of analysis in informing the reconstruction and management of settlements at risk by summarizing how this work was integrated into the project Durable Solutions II, that supported communities at risk from landslides. Finally, we consider how such data could be used in future to inform risk sensitive land-use planning and disaster recovery, and to mitigate the impacts of future landsliding in Nepal and beyond.},

Abstract = {Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5\%), 0.893 (89.3\%), and 0.790 (79.0\%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas.},

Abstract = {Land subsidence (LS) is one of the challenging geo-hazards in several regions of the world that is mainly caused by the overexploitation of groundwater and subsequent collapse of underground cavities. The prediction of LS is difficult due to limitations in monitoring, proper surveys, and knowledge related to the functioning and behaviour of the phenomenon. The application of remote sensing (RS) and global positioning system (GPS) for the proper location identification of LS in the ground and its implementation in susceptibility mapping can help to better constrain this geohazard. However, proper LS susceptibility maps to identify LS prone areas and to mitigate this problem in a way are generally lacking. Several methodologies have been developed for preparing LS susceptibility maps through RS techniques coupled with statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Furthermore, different regions have unique natural and anthropogenic causes for the occurrence of LS, such as subsidence due to groundwater over-exploitation, road construction, consolidation of alluvial soil, mining activities, and so forth, resulting in severe economic losses. The LS susceptibility mapping (LSSM) can help to prevent natural and human catastrophes and reduce the economic damages. ML techniques are becoming increasingly proficient at modelling such occurrences and have wide application in LSSM. This study compares the performances of single and hybrid ML models to predict and map the susceptible areas prone to LS. A combination of several algorithms helps to improve the overall results. In order to achieve this, the gradient-boosting machine-evolutionary genetic algorithm (GBM-EG) was adopted in this study for LS assessment and compared to three algorithms, namely random forest, artificial neural networks, and alternating decision tree, that stand as commonly used benchmarks. This case study on LSSM was carried out in the Abozidabad watershed, Isfahan Province, Iran, and a total of 155 LS locations were identified by using GPS. Measures of 12 conditioning factors were compiled for each of the sites. These data were input into the models in five different training-to-validation configurations of sample ratios: D1 (90\%:10\%), D2 (80\%:20\%), D3 (70\%:30\%), D4 (60\%:40\%), and D5 (50\%:50\%). The performance of the algorithms were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic curve and seed cell area index (SCAI). The results show that the best area under curve value (0.989) and SCAI value were achieved by the GBM-EG hybrid model in an 80:20 ratio. The results demonstrate that LSSMs can be effectively produced to support planning and land use for management decisions.},

Abstract = {Land use/land cover (LULC) variations are accelerated by rapid urbanization and significantly impacted global Land Surface Temperature (LST). The dynamic increase in LST results in the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. In this study, future LULC change scenarios, seasonal (summer \& winter) LST variations, and LST distribution over different LULC classes were predicted using Landsat satellite images for 1999, 2009, and 2019 in Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) procedures were used to predict the LULC changes and seasonal LST variations for 2029 and 2039. In addition, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs) were conducted to identify the possible impacts of LULC change, LST shifts, and climate change on agricultural productivity and developed a sustainable land use management plan for the study area. Validation of the CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with a kappa value of 0.82. Similarly, the ANN model's validation using Mean Square Error (0.523 and 0.796 for summer) and Correlation coefficient (0.6023 and 0.831 for winter) values demonstrated a good prediction accuracy. The LULC prediction result indicated that the built-up area will be expanded by 58.03 km(2) and 79.90 km(2), respectively, from 2019 to 2029 and 2039. The predicted seasonal LST indicated that in 2029 and 2039, more than 23.30 \% and 50.46 \% of the summer and 3.02 \% and 13.02 \% of the winter seasons will likely be experienced LSTs greater than 35 degrees C. The results of public participation exposed that changes in LULC classes, variations in LST, and climate change significantly impact the regional biodiversity (loss of farmland and water bodies), reduce agricultural productivity, and increase extreme weather events (flood, heavy rainfall, and cold/warm temperature). This study provides the useful guidelines for agricultural officers, urban planners, and environmental engineers to understand the spatial configurations of built-up area enlargement and provide effective policy measures to conserve farming lands to ensure environmental sustainability.},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The ability to monitor plant nutrient status of high value horticultural crops and to adjust seasonal nutrient supply via fertilizer application has economic and environmental benefits. Recent technological advances may enable growers and field consultants to conduct this type of monitoring nondestructively in the future. Using the perennial crop apple (Malus domestica) and the annual crop potato (Solanum tuberosum), a hand-held leaf reflectance meter was used to evaluate leaf nitrogen (N) status throughout the growing season. In potato, this meter showed good correlation with leaf blade N content. Both time of day and time of season influenced leaf meter measurement, but leaf position did not. In apple, three different leaf meters were compared: the leaf spectral reflectance meter and two leaf greenness meters. Correlation with both N rate and leaf N content were strongest for the leaf reflectance meter early in the season but nonsignificant late in the season, whereas the leaf greenness meters gave weak but significant correlations throughout the growing season. The tapering off of leaf reflectance values found with the hand-held meter is consistent with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values calculated from satellite images from the same plots. Overall, the use of leaf spectral reflectance shows promise as a tool for nondestructive monitoring of plant leaf status and would enable multiple georeferenced measurements throughout a field for differential N management.},

Title = {Investigating the Impacts of Urbanization on Vegetation Net Primary Productivity: A Case Study of Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration from the Perspective of Townships},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {As an emerging national strategic urban agglomeration in China, the changing trend of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and the impact of the urbanization level (UL) on carbon cycle functions in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration (CUA) have received increasing attention. Previous studies have largely overlooked externalities and the heterogeneity of urbanization effects, and urbanization has also been analyzed in isolation (with focus being on land and population urbanization). In this study, the spatial evolution of NPP was evaluated from 2000 to 2020 at the township level (3859) using multivariate remote sensing data and a comprehensive index (UL) that included population urbanization, land urbanization, and economic urbanization. Bivariate spatial autocorrelation, spatial Durbin models, and geographically weighted regression models were used to analyze the spatial externalities of urbanization impacts and assess the global and local effects. The results show that the region's mean NPP increased by 177.25 g{*}c/m(2) (annual growth of 1.59\%), exhibiting a distribution of ``low in the middle and high in the periphery{''} and low-value clustering along major traffic arteries and rivers. Low-value-NPP areas were mainly located in urban centers, while the high-level areas were in the mountainous region (in the southwest and southeast) and significantly expanded over time. Negative correlation clusters were the main clustering types between the UL and NPP; the ``High-Low{''} negative correlation clusters accelerated outward from the urban centers of Chengdu and Chongqing. Overall, urbanization had negative direct and spillover effects on NPP, exhibiting spatial non-stationarity of the negative driving effect within the urban agglomeration. The results indicate the need to strengthen regional ecological joint governance and adopt more place-based urbanization optimization strategies. This study offers new insights to help to reduce the constraining effects of urbanization on vegetation productivity and ecological functions from the perspectives of population agglomeration, land expansion, and industrial construction.},

Title = {Assessment of human-induced impacts on hydrological regime of Gomti river basin, India},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {631-649},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the potential impact of human-induced intervention on hydrological regimes of Gomti river, one of the important tributaries of the Ganga Alluvial Plain in India aiming at an overall assessment of the status quo. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology includes following four components: study of basin morphology, sub-surface geology and sediments profile of Gomti river; a comparison of LANDSAT satellite data of 1978 and IRS-1C/LISS-III satellite data of 2008 to study the changes occurring in the built- up area, forest and water bodies of the basin; study of flow patterns in different stretches of river Gomti from 1978 to 2012; and water quality assessment at different sites from origin of the river to its confluence in the Ganges. Findings - The paper shows that over the years, the water source in the tributaries feeding the river Gomti has shrunk, reducing the flow in the river. A steady increase in developed land area due to rapid urban sprawl has occurred in recent decades, due to which forest cover and wetlands are decreasing, the river and floodplains are getting fragmented, the hydromorphology changed considerably and several tributaries are getting dried as a result of indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater. There is no flow in the initial 57 km stretch of the river with wide encroachment in active floodplains. Groundwater over-extraction to meet the demands of increasing population and intensive agriculture has led to reduction in base-flows and in some reaches even negative. Extensive land-use changes in the Gomti river basin (GRB) severely impact the river and floodplain connectivity, the impacts are already evident as several tributaries are getting dried during the non-monsoon months. Research limitations/implications - The information provided by the paper for GRB is significant for the understanding of the basin and to formulate integrated management and development plan of the basin. Significant changes have taken place in the GRB over the recent past and are still continuing. Because of the chosen river basin and the site-specific research approach, the research results may lack generalization. However, it provides a general framework of analysis which could be applied to other regions. Practical implications - River channels with their floodplains and adjoining ecosystems have to be addressed as interconnected ecological entity in a holistic way. This requires comprehensive observations of the river systems and catchment characteristics using long-term data. The paper could be used as the starting point in the development of management and development strategies for the basin. Originality/value - River and its floodplain offer multiple ecosystem services and deserve an integrated approach for their conservation and restoration. Conservation and protection of ecologically intact river-floodplain systems is extremely important and urgently needs integrated planning and management. This paper has adopted a integrated approach to study the integrity of river ecosystems and the potential pressures on them.},

Title = {Sinkhole risk mapping and early warning: the case of Camaiore (Italy)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Introduction: Sinkholes are ground collapses that can cause significant damage to infrastructure and buildings. Part of the risk represented by sinkholes is related to their abruptness and the difficulty in spotting in advance their exact location within a sinkhole-prone area. For this reason, urban planning informed by an accurate risk mapping and monitoring is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk.Methods: In this study, we propose a two-folded procedure based on the examination of ground displacement data measured by a ground-based interferometric radar and on the generation of a sinkhole risk zonation map. We examined 11 years' worth of ground displacement data measured by a ground-based interferometric radar to search for sinkhole precursors. The analysis was based on averaged displacement time series retrieved from high-coherence pixels scattered around Camaiore, Italy, a test site where a catastrophic sinkhole occurred in 1995. To generate a sinkhole risk map, we evaluated the susceptibility map as derived from a set of predisposing environmental parameters, the vulnerability derived from the thickness of the sedimentary cover that can be linked to the abruptness of the collapse, and the value of the elements at risk from the Italian Real Estate Market Observatory integrated with land cover information for the non-built up areas.Results: The analysis of ground displacement data revealed that Camaiore had not experienced subsidence relatable to incoming sinkholes in the monitored period. However, few cm of vertical movements, which are well correlated with water table oscillations, have been measured and are expected to be of the same order of magnitude of sinkhole precursor deformations. This implies that a phenomenon of the size and velocity of the 1995 event could have likely been detected before its final collapse. The sinkhole risk map identified specific areas that should be closely monitored using in situ and remote sensing instrumentation.Discussion: The sinkhole risk zonation map generated in this study can be used to inform urban planning and risk management strategies. The study also shows the potential of ground-based interferometric radar to detect sinkhole precursors and the importance of integrating different mitigation approaches. Overall, this study can provide insights for sinkhole risk assessment and management in sinkhole-prone areas.},

Abstract = {The accelerated sea level rise and its resulting impacts on the highly populated coastal regions bearing significant economic value is one of the negative outcomes of climate change. In this study, the most vulnerable areas regarding sea level rise in Turkey are defined through CVI analysis, and the level of inundation is estimated from multi-mission satellite altimetry sea level anomaly, together with significant wave heights and the effects of tidal and meteorological forcing. Consequently, the maximum level of flooding that is expected to occur by 2100 reaches up to 6.7 m in Cukurova Delta which is one of the most vulnerable areas of the country, and GIS-based inundation mapping on the high resolution elevation model indicates that 69\% of the area would be under the risk of flooding. Considering the probable sea level rise in Cukurova by the end of this century, immediate adaptive measures must be undertaken for the protection of the coastal zone. In addition, it will be of utmost importance to make an inventory of the vulnerable zones comprising coastal aquifers and ecosystems, and to introduce adaptive long-term strategies related to local coastal zone management plans.},

Title = {Machine Learning for Predicting Forest Fire Occurrence in Changsha: An Innovative Investigation into the Introduction of a Forest Fuel Factor},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Affected by global warming and increased extreme weather, Hunan Province saw a phased and concentrated outbreak of forest fires in 2022, causing significant damage and impact. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in China's forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation, topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel moisture content. In this study, the traditional driving factors of forest fire such as satellite hotspots, vegetation, meteorology, topography and human activities from 2004 to 2021 were introduced along with forest fuel factors (vegetation canopy water content and evapotranspiration from the top of the vegetation canopy), and a database of factors for predicting forest fire occurrence was constructed. And a forest fire occurrence prediction model was built using machine learning methods such as the Random Forest model (RF), the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model (GBDT) and the Adaptive Augmentation Model (AdaBoost). The accuracy of the models was verified using Area Under Curve (AUC) and four other metrics. The RF model with an AUC value of 0.981 was more accurate than all other models in predicting the probability of forest fire occurrence, followed by the GBDT (AUC = 0.978) and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.891) models. The RF model, which has the best accuracy, was selected to predict the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha in 2022 and combined with the Inverse Distance Weight Interpolation method to plot the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha. We found that the monthly spatial and temporal distribution of forest fire probability in Changsha varied significantly, with March, April, May, September, October, November and December being the months with higher forest fire probability. The highest probability of forest fires occurred in the central and northern regions. In this study, the core drivers affecting the occurrence of forest fires in Changsha City were found to be vegetation canopy evapotranspiration and vegetation canopy water content. The RF model was identified as a more suitable forest fire occurrence probability prediction model for Changsha City. Meanwhile, this study found that vegetation characteristics and combustible factors have more influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City than meteorological factors, and surface temperature has less influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City.},

Title = {UAV-based partially sampling system for rapid NDVI mapping in the evaluation of rice nitrogen use efficiency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Rapid acquisition and mapping of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values is essential for a timely evaluation of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in sustainable agriculture. The zonal nutrient management techniques for sustainable agriculture require timely and efficient NDVI data collection and analysis capabilities, - a need that is still rarely addressed. However, as with the use of manned aircraft, the primary limitation of established unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging technologies is the limited time window for large-area data collection. Furthermore, as the spatial resolution increases, the post-processing time generally becomes longer. To overcome problems associated with the need for rapid data acquisition and post-processing, we have developed a UAV-based sensor system called the Accurate and Speed Scanner (AS-Scanner). The data acquisition accuracy and NDVI mapping speed of the system were assessed. According to the results of a ground-level experiment, the mean absolute error (MAE) between the reflectance data of the AS-Scanner and the corresponding data of the ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer is less than 1.11\%. Furthermore, results of a plot-level experiment suggest that the NDVI values of a raw point cloud from AS-Scanner-based UAV platform (AS-NDVI) and UAV-mounted Mica-Sense RedEdge camera (REG-NDVI) are highly correlated (0.54 < R-2 < 0.57, p < 0.01). In a map-level experiment, the interpolated, 15 m x 15 m pixel size AS-NDVI values were in good agreement with the REG-NDVIs over a 4.01 ha (40100 m(2)) rice field (0.55 < R-2 < 0.65, p < 0.01). The average processing times of the inverse distance weighted (IDW, 0.45 s), kriging linear (KL, 0.73 s), and nearest neighbor (NN, 1.05 s) interpolations of the AS-Scanner data prove that it is possible to efficiently create NDVI maps using data from the sensor. Besides, the effect of the varying solar irradiance values on the AS-NDVIs was analyzed under varied illumination conditions. Moreover, the AS-NDVIs were also used to assess the NUE in a paddy rice field at the panicle stage. The results show that nutrients can be effectively assessed using AS-Scanner data. Despite some disadvantages such as the potential of NDVI value saturation over dense canopies, the AS-Scanner provides a method for quickly obtaining reasonable spatial resolution crop information for agricultural nutrient monitoring and management. This also offers the potential to reduce environmental pressure which may be caused by untimely estimation of NUE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Research opportunities from emerging atmospheric observing and modeling capabilities},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {77},

Abstract = {The Second Prospectus Development Team (PDT-2) of the U.S. Weather Research Program was charged with identifying research opportunities that are best matched to emerging operational and experimental measurement and modeling methods. The overarching recommendation of PDT-2 is that inputs for weather forecast models can best be obtained through the use of composite observing systems together with adaptive (or targeted) observing strategies employing both in situ and remote sensing. Optimal observing systems and strategies are best determined through a three-part process: observing system simulation experiments, pilot field measurement programs, and model-assisted data sensitivity experiments. Furthermore, the mesoscale research community needs easy and timely access to the new operational and research datasets in a form that can readily be reformatted into existing software packages for analysis and display. The value of these data is diminished to the extent that they remain inaccessible. The composite observing system of the future must combine synoptic observations, routine mobile observations, and targeted observations, as the current or forecast situation dictates. High costs demand fuller exploitation of commercial aircraft, meteorological and navigation {[}Global Positioning System (GPS)] satellites, and Doppler radar. Single observing systems must be assessed in the context of a composite system that provides complementary information. Maintenance of the current North American rawinsonde network is critical for progress in both research-oriented and operational weather forecasting. Adaptive sampling strategies are designed to improve large-scale and regional weather prediction but they will also improve diagnosis and prediction of flash flooding, air pollution, forest fire management, and other environmental emergencies. Adaptive measurements can be made by piloted or unpiloted aircraft. Rawinsondes can be launched and satellites can be programmed to make adaptive observations at special times or in specific regions. PDT-2 specifically recommends the following forms of data gathering: a pilot field and modeling study should be designed and executed to assess the benefit of adaptive observations over the eastern Pacific for mesoscale forecasts over the contiguous United States; studies should be done over the western Atlantic and Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico regions, particularly during hurricane season; and enhanced observations should be implemented for the mountainous western states and for the Mississippi and Missouri River Valleys. Data sensitivity tests and observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are important tools for gauging the benefit of existing or proposed observing systems. OSSEs involve only model predictions and are essentially self-contained. Data sensitivity tests require the full consideration of modeling infrastructure, namely, observation ingest quality control, objective analysis, and numerical prediction. Sensitivity tests involving both wind and moisture profiles are particularly needed to determine their impact on improved precipitation forecasts. New variational analysis techniques are capable of assimilating so-called proxy observations. These techniques should be fully exploited. Diabatic initialization should be addressed through the assimilation of satellite cloud data and very high resolution WSR-88D radar measurements into very high resolution models with sophisticated cloud microphysics. Success in this area should improve quantitative precipitation forecasts in the first few (model) hours. There is a pressing need to better understand the interaction of moist convection with large-scale flow. One key is better characterization of the impact of precipitation formation and evaporation on the fluxes of mass, momentum, and heat in moist convection. Humidity measurement in precipitating downdrafts is a crucial measurement, which currently cannot be made reliably. The capabilities of polarization-diversity radar should be explored in a quasi-operational context to determine whether WSR-88D radars should be upgraded. Progress in quantitative precipitation forecasting is impeded by poorly resolved and inaccurate water vapor measurements. Further improvements in numerical weather prediction demand improved monitoring of Earth surface characteristics so that spatial and temporal variations in air-surface fluxes are realistically simulated. Over land, priority should be given to the coupling of mesoscale meteorological models with hydrological models and to routine assimilation of surface (soil, moisture, and plant) characteristics. Improved air-sea fluxes are essential to proper modeling of marine cyclogenesis. The most important, practical ocean measurements include sea surface temperature, thermocline depth, wave spectra, and ice coverage and thickness.},

Abstract = {The increasing loss of N and P is one of the greatest negative global consequences of agricultural advance. The aim of this study was to calculate an apparent N and P balance in the county of Benito Juarez during the 1989/90, 2002/03 and 2011/12 agroproductive periods, and relating the results achieved with the agriculture surface in each campaign. Initially, the N and P balance indicator was applied in all three campaigns. Then, the loss of nutrients per unit surface was established, based on data from satellite images of the county and the value of the N and P balances. As a result, remarkable temporal variations were observed with respect to the fertilized surfaces and the applied doses. Likewise, the growth of the agricultural area and alterations in the production values and yield of the crops stand out. The balances of both nutrients were negative in the three campaigns, showing a continuous generation of deficit balances, whit greater loss of tn of N than P per surface unit (km(2)). Obviously, agricultural sustainability is affected, so this study shows the nutrient situation in the county, establishing the need for a sustainable management of fertilization.},

Title = {Evolutionary trends of urban expansion and its sustainable development: Evidence from 80 representative cities in the belt and road initiative region},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {138},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) region has undoubtedly led to changes in the scale, form, and pattern of cities to accommodate the expansion of industry, housing, and commerce and to produce sus-tained impacts on environmental sustainability. However, limited studies have yet to systematically investigate the urban expansion in this area. Based on a systematic research path of ``pattern-mode-coordination-sustain -ability{''}, this study quantified the urban expansion dynamics of BRI countries and 80 representative cities from 2000 to 2018 using multi-source remote sensing data and the Global Atlas of Urban Expansion. The results show that in terms of dynamic rules, the share of urban lands grew from 0.32 \% in 2000 to 0.66 \% in 2018 (an increase of 250,600 km2) and is estimated to increase to 1.68 \% in 2018-2030. Countries in developing regions (i.e., West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Asia) are predicted to become the new high-value centers of urban expansion intensity (UEI). The UEI of BRI cities showed a significant developing region orientation and ``high in the east and low in the west{''} distribution pattern but would gradually shift towards a spatially homogeneous and discrete distribution. BRI cities can be divided into four expansion modes (center-periphery, double-winged strip, dual -core cluster, and single-winged mutation expansion), each with a different evolutionary dynamic mechanism. Regarding coordination, there is a great demand for land expansion by population and economic growth in BRI cities. This dependence increased as the city's UEI index rose; when the UEI exceeded 3 \%, the dependence became more pronounced. The investigations also showed that the adverse ecological effects of urban land expansion are gradually increasing at the urban scale. Furthermore, the ecological impacts of population growth are usually the strongest for BRI's countries and cities, and the intensity showed a synergistic growth trend with the UEI index. This study provides new insights into the dynamic features of BRI's urban expansion from national to urban scales and historical to future periods, while also contributing new perspectives from the BRI to optimal global land management and sustainable urban development.},

Title = {Characterizing the spatio-temporal variations of C3 and C4 dominated grasslands aboveground biomass in the Drakensberg, South Africa},

Abstract = {C3 and C4 grass species composition, with different physiological, morphological and most importantly phenological characteristics, influence Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and their ability to provide ecosystem goods and services, over space and time. For decades, the lack of appropriate remote sensing data sources compromised C3 and C4 grasses AGB estimation, over space and time. This resulted in uncertainties in understanding their potential and contribution to the provision of services. This study therefore examined the utility of the new multi-temporal Sentinel 2 to estimate and map C3 and C4 grasses AGB over time, using the advanced Sparse Partial Least Squares Regression (SPLSR) model. Overall results have shown the variability in AGB between C3 and C4 grasses, estimation accuracies and the performance of the SPLSR model, over time. Themeda (C4) produced higher AGB from February to April, whereas from May to September, Festuca produced higher AGB. Both species also showed a decrease in AGB in August and September, although this was most apparent for Themeda than its counterpart. Spectral bands information predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies and an improvement was observed when both spectral bands and vegetation indices were applied. For instance, in the month of May, spectral bands predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies for Festuca (R-2 = 0.57; 31.70\% of the mean), Themeda (R-2 = 0.59; 24.02\% of the mean) and combined species (R-2 = 0.61; 15.64\% of the mean); the use of spectral bands and vegetation indices yielded 0.77; (18.64\%), 0.75 (14.27\%) and 0.73 (16.47\%), for Festuca, Themeda and combined species, respectively. The red edge (at 0.705 and 0.74 pm) and derived indices, NIR and SWIR 2 (2.19 mu m) were found to contribute more to grass species AGB estimation, over time. Findings have also revealed the potential of the SPLSR model in estimating C3 and C4 grasses AGB using Sentinel 2 images, over time. The AGB spatial variability maps produced in this study can be used to quantify C3 and C4 forage availability or accumulating fuel, as well as for developing operational management strategies.},

Abstract = {This study was performed in two regions of central Chile: Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins y del Maule, to locate and characterize the remnants of schlerophyllous forests. This ecosystem has been subject of an intense and prolonged anthropic pressure resulting in notorious cover reduction and fragmentation. Despite its important biodiversity and endemism, these forests are ill represented in the Chilean system of environmental protection. We located the forest patches using satellite imagery and GIS followed by field verification. The patches were classified on the basis of forest structure and physiognomy into three situations: open, semi-dense and dense, and referred them to the municipality within each of the two regions. These municipalities were ordered by the size their forest cover, and a fragmentation analysis was performed in the top 14 units, using landscape indices. Results showed a very fragmented ecosystem, with great variation in patch size and spatial distribution. We present the forest cover for each situation in each municipality. In the selected municipalities we detail number of patches, mean size, density and patch characteristics. The results are then discussed in the context of landscape and lend use and, its possible value to design management programs at the scale of municipal units to protect and recover the forest.},

Abstract = {Oyster reefs and seagrass beds are being lost worldwide at alarming rates. These habitats provide many services to humankind and, thus, much effort has been dedicated to their restoration. Here, we examine the efficacy of created oyster reefs at enhancing seagrass beds through the amelioration of hydrographic conditions and water quality. We carried out a field experiment in the Northern Gulf of Mexico where we compared areas shoreward of created reefs with adjacent reef-free areas over several years using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design. The reefs were built with oyster shell, measured 65 m, and were placed at circa 100 m from the shoreline to ensure subtidal conditions and enhance oyster recruitment. The BACI results showed few and disparate effects of the reefs, even when distance from the reef was factored in. However, we found a temporal increase in seagrass cover throughout all the experimental area (i.e. including both reef and control plots) following reef deployment. Interestingly, further analysis with satellite imagery showed the experimental area had higher seagrass cover 5 years after reef deployment than it did before reef deployment, but such increase was not observed for nearby areas. In concert, the results suggest ``shadow{''} effects for the reefs examined, where positive effects on seagrass beds extend beyond the area directly shoreward from the reef. Oyster reef restoration may have positive impacts on shallow seagrass beds in turbid, high-energy systems; however, more work on the extent and mechanisms for this interaction is needed.},

Abstract = {Swidden agriculture is an important food production system for rural communities in Kachet village, northern Laos. In swidden system, land is cleared and abandoned for several years to allow regeneration. These fallow areas provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as benzoin, and cardamom, and can be used for other purposes. In Laos, ``Forest Law{''} and factors associated with population growth shortened the fallow period to less than 4 years. This study aimed to clarify the plant utilization and its temporal-spatial distribution in fallow forest and to rethink present land use management based on these information. We used interviews with villagers, geographic information system data, vegetation surveys, and satellite imaging data from 2000 to 2010. Swidden area information was used to estimate the swidden cycle. The farmers in Kachet village used 120 plant species. The results show that the numbers of plant species in edible and medicine use subcategories dramatically increased as the fallow period became longer, and most NTFPs with economic value were observed in forests with a relatively long fallow period (6 or 7 years). The fallow period was maintained by exchanging fields among villagers for swidden agriculture, which is conducted by the whole village. The average area used for swidden agriculture from 2000 to 2010 was 160 +/- 11 ha year(-1), and the average swidden cycle was about 7 years, which is longer than that found in other regions in northern Laos. Recently, market economy has infiltrated to mountain villages and some villagers start to select commercial crops in swidden fields. However, villagers also have conducted sustainable land use to match the situation. Keeping the land use management and plant utilization in the fallows is important for sustainable development of this area.},

Title = {A Restitution Study for the Plans of a Group of Traditional Erzurum Houses in Ibrahim Pasa District},
Journal = {MEGARON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-285},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to purpose a restitution for the plan of a group of traditional Erzurum houses, which were built as independent but adjacent houses in the second half of the 18th century in the historical city center of Erzurum, by examining the spatial, structural and functional transformation with the abolition of borders while transforming into a cafe/restaurant. These traditional Erzurum houses are located at the intersection of Rasit Pasa and Salih Yuzbasi Streets in Ibrahim Pasa District, which is one of the historical settlements in the south west of Inner Castle. Houses once used independently began to be used as a single building with a number of changes made in the plan layout. However, during the change of function, facade layout and numerous spaces intertwined under the same roof and this made it difficult to understand the original plan scheme of the buildings. As there is a lack of documentation of the changes made and the presence of ambiguity in the different verbal information sources about the buildings, the main problem of this study is to determine the number of houses the cafe/restaurant consists of. Other important problems are the determination of the boundaries and the spatial organization of the houses. In addition, the scarcity of written sources in literature about these historic adjacent houses, which are numerous but more modest in the urban fabric compared with the two-story independent houses, increases the importance of this study. In order to reveal the changes and transformation of a group of traditional Erzurum houses built independently but adjacent to each other, first of all, traditional Erzurum houses were examined architecturally under the headings of location, plan and facade layout, material and construction technique properties. Then the architectural features and possible traces of change on this group of buildings, which were not mentioned in any source or document, were revealed in terms of location and plan features. After documentation of the current situation, property deeds, cadastral plans, satellite images, old photographs, historical and current maps, traces of the buildings themselves, information about traditional Erzurum houses and comparative studies were used to understand the different building phrases and restitution of the plan of these buildings. When the archive documents are evaluated, it is understood that the group of buildings were built in the second half of the 18th century according to Nene Saliha Hanim's Foundation record dated to 1791-92. Also, parcel numbers with 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 belong to a foundation named ``Nene Saliha Hanim{''} and parcel numbers with 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 41 and 42 belong to private property according to the land registers. Within the building group, in addition to eight independent houses analyzed spatially, functionally and structurally, the external body walls and garden boundaries of at least two more houses, which do not exist currently, were identified. Possibly, a khan might have existed in the place of one. Unlike the traditional Erzurum houses mentioned in the literature, these houses, for which a restitution is prepared, have a simple spatial organization consisting of one or two rooms. The studied houses, which contain many clues about the social and cultural life style of the old Erzurum city, yet which are decreasing in number, should be registered as cultural assets by the relevant Conservation Board. Additionally, the reconstruction permit decision given in the Conservation Development Plan for this region that conforms to many protection criteria such as historical, architectural, continuity, rarity and memorial value with its structure, parcel and streets should be re-evaluated. This study is important as it reveals that these single-story houses, which are stacked in a building block on a traditional street texture, with modest architectural organization should be part of the relevant literature on traditional Erzurum houses, which mainly deals with independent separate two-story houses owned by wealthy families. In addition, it is stated for the first time in the literature with this study that the parcels inside the building block get access to the main street through a common closed inner street, in contrast to the houses lined up adjacent to each other on independent lots on the street.},

Title = {Comparison of Global and Continental Land Cover Products for Selected Study Areas in South Central and Eastern European Region},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Land cover is one of the key terrestrial variables used for monitoring and as input for modelling in support of achieving the United Nations Strategical Development Goals. Global and Continental Land Cover Products (GCLCs) aim to provide the required harmonized information background across areas; thus, they are not being limited by national or other administrative nomenclature boundaries and their production approaches. Moreover, their increased spatial resolution, and consequently their local relevance, is of high importance for users at a local scale. During the last decade, several GCLCs were developed, including the Global Historical Land-Cover Change Land-Use Conversions (GLC), the Globeland-30 (GLOB), Corine-2012 (CLC) and GMES/ Copernicus Initial Operation High Resolution Layers (GIOS). Accuracy assessment is of high importance for product credibility towards incorporation into decision chains and implementation procedures, especially at local scales. The present study builds on the collaboration of scientists participating in the Global Observations of Forest CoverGlobal Observations of Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC-GOLD), South Central and Eastern European Regional Information Network (SCERIN). The main objective is to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of commonly used GCLCs at selected representative study areas in the SCERIN geographic area, which is characterized by extreme diversity of landscapes and environmental conditions, heavily affected by anthropogenic impacts with similar major socio-economic drivers. The employed validation strategy for evaluating and comparing the different products is detailed, representative results for the selected areas from nine SCERIN countries are presented, the specific regional differences are identified and their underlying causes are discussed. In general, the four GCLCs products achieved relatively high overall accuracy rates: 74-98\% for GLC (mean: 93.8\%), 79-92\% for GLOB (mean: 90.6\%), 74-91\% for CLC (mean: 89\%) and 72-98\% for GIOS (mean: 91.6\%), for all selected areas. In most cases, the CLC product has the lower scores, while the GLC has the highest, closely followed by GIOS and GLOB. The study revealed overall high credibility and validity of the GCLCs products at local scale, a result, which shows expected benefit even for local/regional applications. Identified class dependent specificities in different landscape types can guide the local users for their reasonable usage in local studies. Valuable information is generated for advancing the goals of the international GOFC-GOLD program and aligns well with the agenda of the NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program to improve the quality and consistency of space-derived higher-level products.},

Title = {First satellite tracks of the Endangered black-capped petrel},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-33},
Abstract = {The black-capped petrel Pterodroma hasitata is an endangered seabird with fewer than 2000 breeding pairs restricted to a few breeding sites in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. To date, use areas at sea have been determined entirely from vessel-based surveys and opportunistic sightings and, as such, spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding of the species' marine range are likely. To enhance our understanding of marine use areas, we deployed satellite tags on 3 black-capped petrels breeding on Hispaniola, representing the first tracking study for this species and one of the first published tracking studies for any breeding seabird in the Caribbean. During chick rearing, petrels primarily used marine habitats in the southern Caribbean Sea (ca. 18.0 degrees to 11.5 degrees N, 70.0 degrees to 75.5 degrees W) between the breeding site and the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Maximum distance from the breeding sites ranged from ca. 500 to 1500 km during the chick-rearing period. During the post-breeding period, each bird dispersed north and used waters west of the Gulf Stream offshore of the mid-and southern Atlantic coasts of the USA as well as Gulf Stream waters and deeper pelagic waters east of the Gulf Stream. Maximum distance from the breeding sites ranged from ca. 2000 to 2200 km among birds during the nonbreeding period. Petrels used waters located within 14 different exclusive economic zones, suggesting that international collaboration will benefit the development of management strategies for this species.},

Abstract = {Management of crops is an essential part in the food production procedure. Having a thorough knowledge of growth stages of each crop is of paramount importance in this respect. Phenology (transplanting, panicle formation, flowering etc) is the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena that are controlled by environmental and climatic factors. Monitoring the crop condition manually in the field is difficult and time consuming. Therefore recently, several methods have been introduced by using satellite derived vegetation indices. Extraction of phenological parameters is helpful for the purposes like irrigation management, nutrient management, health management, yield prediction and crop type mapping. Easily extracted parameters will be the important data base for agricultural researchers. This research is an attempt to extract paddy phenological parameters of Sri Lanka by using 16 years' (2000 to 2015) Time series MODIS Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is highly sensitive for the green vegetation and the data were analysed using SPIRITS and TIMESAT software's. Periodicity converter in SPIRITS and Savitzky Golay filtering in TIMESAT and SPIRITS are helpful in smoothing the time series which are perturbed by noise due to missing values and Clouds. Phenology is considered as a sensitive climate change indicator but, it is very essential to have a comprehensive familiarity about the method of water supply that the study area is irrigated or rain fed so as to eliminate the wrong interpretation. As results, average of long time series of NDVI profile for a few agro ecological zones of Sri Lanka with extracted seven parameters (Start of the season, End of the season, Length of the season, Booting date, Base value, Maximum NDVI during the Season, Amplitude) and generated phenological parameter maps are presented here. The crop phenology is a very important element of agricultural monitoring, to ensure the security of the food crop production. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Characterization and classification of freshwater marshy wetland using synthetic aperture radar polarimetry: a case study from Loktak wetland, Northeast India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Loktak is the largest natural wetland of Northeast India, the last home of endangered brow-antlered deer, and a site of global significance recognized under Ramsar convention. Ecological and human-meditated spatial patterns of Loktak wetland were characterized and classified using a Radarsat-2 C band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data. Radarsat-2 quad-pol scene of dry season was preprocessed and classified using PolSARpro software. Eigen vector-eigen value decomposition of coherency matrix (T3) was performed to characterize the scattering properties of wetland targets based on entropy (H)/anisotropy (A)/alpha angle (alpha) segmentation. Results illustrate that RGB color display of H/A/a images is a useful indicator of wetland structure and composition, and provide clear visual discrimination of open water, floating phumdi, permanent phumdi cover, and associated man-made features. Six classes, namely, floating phumdi, permanent phumdi, scrub/shrub, fallow land, built-up, and open water were mapped using Wishart classification of H/A/a images. Scattering mechanisms of natural and man-made targets synthesized from PolSAR data, and their classification using Wishart algorithm have been validated through a visually classified map and field reference points. The land cover generated would be useful for conservation and management of Loktak wetland and brow-antlered deer population. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

Abstract = {Precipitation is one of the main factors of soil erosion, and the intensity, duration and frequency of precipitation can aggravate the erosive process. The objective of the study was to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall erosivity in the Amazon. Data were collected from 334 rainfall gauge stations distributed throughout the region, composing a series of 20 years (1997-2016). The gaps in this series were filled with satellite data using the CPC MORPHing technique. The erosivity equations used were those available in the literature and based on the modified Fournier index. The values of precipitation and erosivity were interpolated using GIS software, and thematic maps were generated for these variables. The annual value of rainfall erosivity ranged from 7060 to 36767 (Mj mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1)). On the monthly scale, the highest rates of erosivity were recorded in the rainy season, i.e., February and March, at approximately 1548 and 2651 (Mj mm ha(-1) h(-1) month(-1)), respectively. In the context of erosion risk, the region was classified as having very strong erosivity. Therefore, it is imperative that land management and conservation policies be implemented to minimize erosion in the region, which, at its borders, undergoes intense land use change, i.e., forests are being transformed into pastures and grain crops.},

Title = {INTEGRATION OF GEOSPATIAL MODELS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF DEFORESTATION HOTSPOTS AND FOREST PROTECTION UNITS},
Journal = {SURANAREE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Geospatial models play an important role in predicting land use and land cover (LULC) data and are applied in various aspects such as land use planning and management, and deforestation vulnerability analysis for forest conservation and protection. Therefore, integration of geospatial models for a LULC prediction and deforestation vulnerability analysis (DVA) are here examined for the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units to prevent deforestation in the protected forest areas (PFAs) of Phuket Island. The main objectives of the study were: (1) to identify the optimum geospatial model for the LULC prediction, (2) to examine the optimum geospatial model for the DVA and zonation, and (3) to allocate deforestation hotspots and forest protection units for the PFAs. The 4 main components of the research methodology that were implemented comprised: (1) data collection and preparation; (2) optimum geospatial modelling for the LULC prediction; (3) optimum geospatial modelling for the DVA; and (4) the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units. From the results of the LULC interpretation of remote sensing data between 1995 and 2014, all 15 PFAs on Phuket Island were deforested with an annual rate ranging between 0.0001-0.2082 sq. km. The causes of deforestation were the conversion of forest land to urban and built-up areas and the expansion of agricultural land. In this study, the CLUES and CA-Markov models were chosen as the optimum geospatial models for the LULC prediction of 9 and 6 PFAs, respectively, while the frequency ratio model was identified as the optimum geospatial model for the DVA and zonation of the 15 PFAs. According to the LULC prediction for 2026, the highest annual deforestation rate of the PFAs during the period from 2014 to 2026 will occur in Khao Kamala national reserved forest (NRF) with a value of 0.1400 sq. km, while the lowest annual deforestation rate will occur in Khong Tarau NRF with a value of 0.0001 sq. km. Meanwhile, the number of PFAs with low and high risks of deforestation in the future based on the percentages of deforestation vulnerability zonation was 11 and 4, respectively. In the case of the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units, 408 deforestation hotspots were distributed over 12 FPAs, with the exception of Khao Sam Liam, Khao Tosae, and Khlong Tarau NRFs, while 5 PFAs - Khao Kamala, Khao Nak Keod, Khlong U-Tapao, Khlong Para, and Khlong Tajin NRFs - required the establishment of 15, 20, 1, 2, and 6 forest protection units, respectively In conclusion, it appears that the integration of geospatial models for the LULC prediction and DVA with zonation can be used as an efficient tool for the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units to fulfill the forest conservation and protection program of the Thai Government.},

Title = {Accounting for capacity and flow of ecosystem services: A conceptual model and a case study for Telemark, Norway},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {539-551},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Understanding the flow of ecosystem services and the capacity of ecosystems to generate these services is an essential element for understanding the sustainability of ecosystem use as well as developing ecosystem accounts. We conduct spatially explicit analyses of nine ecosystem services in Telemark County, Southern Norway. The ecosystem services included are moose hunting, sheep grazing, timber harvest, forest carbon sequestration and storage, snow slide prevention, recreational residential amenity, recreational hiking and existence of areas without technical interference. We conceptually distinguish capacity to provide ecosystem services from the actual flow of services, and empirically assess both. This is done by means of different spatial models, developed with various available datasets and methods, including (multiple layer) look-up tables, causal relations between datasets (including satellite images), environmental regression and indicators derived from direct measurements. Capacity and flow differ both in spatial extent and in quantities. We discuss five conditions for a meaningful spatial capacity-flow-balance. These are (1) a conceptual difference between capacity and flow, (2) spatial explicitness of capacity and flow, (3) the same spatial extent of both, (4) rivalry or congestion, and (5) measurement with aligned indicators. We exemplify spatially explicit balances between capacity and flow for two services, which meet these five conditions. Research in the emerging field of mapping ES should focus on the development of compatible indicators for capacity and flow. The distinction of capacity and flow of ecosystem services provides a parsimonious estimation of over- or underuse of the respective service. Assessment of capacity and flow in a spatially explicit way can thus support monitoring sustainability of ecosystem use, which is an essential element of ecosystem accounting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The acquisition of reliable and accurate data to assess environmental changes over large spatial scales is one of the main limitations to determine the impact of eutrophication, and the effectiveness of management strategies in coastal systems. Here, we used a continuous in situ Chl-a fluorometry sensor and L8/OLI satellite data to develop an algorithm and map Chl-a spatial distribution to assess the impact of freshwater diversions and associated high nutrient loading rates in the Barataria Basin (BB) complex, a coastal system in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We collected water quality samples at 24 sampling stations and high-frequency continuous fluorometry in situ {[}Chl-a] data along a similar to 87 km transect from 2019-2020. Field {[}Chl-a] values were highly correlated (r = 0.86; p < 0.0001) with continuous in situ {[}Chl-a] fluorometry values. These continuous in situ {[}Chl-a] values were significantly related to a surface reflectance ratio ({[}B1 + B4]/B3) estimated using L8/OLI data (exponential model; R-2 = 0.46; RMSE = 4.8, p < 0.0001). The statistical model replicated {[}Chl-a] spatial patterns across the BB complex. This work shows the utility of high-frequency continuous Chl-a fluorometry sampling coupled with L8/OLI image analysis to increase the frequency and number of field data sets to assess water quality conditions at large spatial scales in highly dynamic deltaic regions.},

Title = {Quantifying the impacts of land use/land cover change on groundwater depletion in Northwestern China - A case study of the Dunhuang oasis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {270-279},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the Dunhuang oasis in the arid Northwest China has been undergoing significant changes due to social-economic development and expanded irrigation for agricultural production. Groundwater table was found to have significantly declined during the period of 1987-2007 owing to greater pumping. We analyzed the impacts of land use/land cover (LU/LC) changes on the groundwater fluctuations in the study area. The LU/LC types were derived from the satellite images for the years of 1987, 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2007. The water consumptions associated with the LU/LC types were estimated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith method. Results show that during the period of 1987-2007, the area of agricultural land sharply increased by 98.7 km(2), and the cash crops were the main contributor. Under the current market system, farmers had much more autonomy and greater incentives to shift the cropping pattern from the traditional food crops to the high value cash crops with greater water consumption. The total water consumption of the cash crops accounted for 14.1\% of the total water consumption in 1987, but increased to 71.6\% in 2007, becoming the largest water consumer. The agricultural land use was the main cause of the declining groundwater table during the period from 1987 to 2007. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Multi-Objective Optimal Operations Based on Improved NSGA-II for Hanjiang to Wei River Water Diversion Project, China},
Journal = {WATER},

Abstract = {It is important to investigate the laws of reservoir multi-objective optimization operations, because it can obtain the best benefits from inter-basin water transfer projects to mitigate water shortage in intake areas. Given the multifaceted demands of the Hanjiang to Wei River Water Diversion Project, China (referred hereafter as the Project), an easy-to-operate multi-objective optimal model based on simulation is built and applied to search the multi-objective optimization operation rules between power generation and energy consumption. The Project includes two reservoirs connected by a water transfer tunnel. One is Huangjinxia, located in the mainstream of Hanjiang with abundant inflow but no regulation ability, and the other is Sanhekou, located in the tributary of Hanjiang with multi-year regulation ability but less water. The layout of the Project increases the difficulty of reservoir joint optimization operations. Therefore, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (I-NSGA-II) with a feasible search space is proposed to solve the model based on long-term series data. The results show that: (1) The validated simulation model is helpful to obtain Pareto front curves to reveal the rules between power generation and energy consumption. (2) Choosing a reasonable search step size to build a feasible search space based on simulation results for the I-NSGA-II can help find more optimized solutions. Considering the influence of the initial populations of the algorithm and limited computing ability of computers, the qualified rate of Pareto points solved by I-NSGA-II are superior to NSGA-II. (3) According to the characteristics of the Project, water transfer ratio threshold value of two reservoirs are quantified for maximize economic benefits. Moreover, the flood season is a critical operation period for the Project, in which both reservoirs should supply more water to intake areas to ensure the energy balanced of the entire system. The findings provide an easy-to-operate multi-objective operation model with the I-NSGA-II that can easily be applied in optimal management of inter-basin water transfer projects by relevant authorities.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry is a multidisciplinary effort to increase the overall production through a combination of trees and crops. This study attempts to find out the multifunctional role of agroforestry, such as productive role, services role and farmer's attitude towards agroforestry in District Dir Lower, Pakistan. For data collection, comprehensive questionnaire was used and 200 respondents were interviewed from 40 villages through random sampling. Results showed that people highly preferred productive value and moderately preferred services value of agroforestry. According to the respondents feedback 83.5\% were owner of the land and cultivated the land themselves. The common irrigation system was rain fed (54.5\%) and 50.5\% of respondents were followed Agrosilvo system in the study area. The fast growing timber tree species (N=20-120) were Ailanthus altissima, Morus alba, and Populous nigra on their farmlands generating 20,000-40,000 PKR. (Pakistani rupees) income annually. From the fruit trees such as Juglans regia, Citrus species, and Prunus domestica income was 10,000-15,000 PKR annually. The majority 36.5\% of respondents depended for fuel wood having PKR 5000-35,000. Different types of agricultural crops i.e. wheat, rice, maize, brassica and fodder crops along with farm trees were cultivated. Ecosystem services were reported by 89.6\% respondents with positive affect. It was concluded that agroforestry found best than traditional agriculture system in income generation. The percentages of land use classes were correlated with satellite classified data and found significant correlation with agroforestry services. This study will help in future in implementing agroforestry system in uplifting the socio economic condition of the community in study area.},

Title = {Assessing the Influence of Tourism-Driven Activities on Environmental Variables on Hainan Island, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tourism is a primary socio-economic factor on many coastal islands. Tourism contributes to the livelihoods of the residents, but also influences natural resources and energy consumption and can become a significant driver of land conversion and environmental change. Understanding the influence of tourist-related activities is vital for sustainable tourism development. We chose Hainan Island in South China as a research area to study the influence of tourist-driven activities on environmental variables (as Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and related ecosystem variables) during the period of 2000 to 2019. In Hainan, the local economy relies heavily on tourism, with an ever-growing influx of tourists each year. We categorised location-based points of interest (POIs) into two classes, non-tourism sites and tourism-related sites, and utilised satellite data from the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) to extract LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. We analysed the LST variations, NDVI changes and the land use/land cover (LULC) changes and compared the relative difference in LST and NDVI between the tourism-related sites and non-tourism-related sites. The main findings of this study were: (1) The median LST in the tourism-related sites was relatively higher (1.3) than the LST in the non-tourism-related sites for the 20 years. Moreover, every annual mean LST of tourism-related sites was higher than the LST values in non-tourism-related sites, with an average difference of 1.2 degrees C for the 20 years and a maximum difference of 1.7 degrees C. We found higher annual LST anomalies for tourist-related sites compared to non-tourism sites after 2010, which indicated the likely positive differences in LST above the average LST during 20 years for tourism-related sites when compared against the non-tourism related sites, thus highlighting the potential influence of tourism activities on LST. (2) The annual mean NDVI value for tourism-related sites was significantly lower than for non-tourism places every year, with an average NDVI difference of 0.26 between the two sites. (3) The land cover changed significantly: croplands and forests reduced by 3.5\% and 2.8\% respectively, while the areas covered by orchards and urban areas increased by 2\% and 72.3\% respectively. These results indicate the influence of the tourism-driven activities includes the relatively high LST, vegetation degradation and land-use conversion particular to urban cover type. The outcome of this work provides a method that combines cloud-based satellite-derived data with location-based POIs data for quantifying the long-term influence of tourism-related activities on sensitive coastal ecosystems. It contributes to designing evidence-driven management plans and policies for the sustainable tourism development in coastal areas.},

Abstract = {Purpose Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems have emerged as an established tool within the construction industry. Concurrent with this trend has been the rise in research on RPA, establishing this as a new field of study within the construction management domain. What is needed now is an assessment of the current state of research in this emerging discipline - its strengths and weaknesses - by which future research on RPA in construction may be guided. The purpose of this paper is to address this need. Design/methodology/approach A total of 59 peer-reviewed journal articles covering RPAs within the construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods approach, utilizing qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques. Findings The results reveal a field of study in its fledgling stage, with a limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation, from a limited number of institutions. Key publication outlets are identified, with the main focus of research being in the technical areas of remote sensing, photogrammetry and image processing. Practical implications - The study benefits researchers and industry practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas of high priority in future research. For construction companies, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of RPAs in the industry. Originality/value The study exposes what is missing from current research: a broader consideration of organizational adjustments needed to accommodate RPA usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance.},

Abstract = {Gully erosion has been identified in recent decades as a global threat to people and property. This problem also affects the socioeconomic stability of societies and therefore limits their sustainable development, as it impacts a nonrenewable resource on a human scale, namely, soil. The focus of this study is to evaluate the prediction performance of four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), and the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), which are novel approaches in gully erosion modeling research, particularly in semi-arid regions with a mountainous character. 204 samples of erosion areas and 204 samples of non-erosion areas were collected through field surveys and high-resolution satellite images, and 17 significant factors were considered. The dataset cells of samples (70\% for training and 30\% for testing) were randomly prepared to assess the robustness of the different models. The functional relevance between soil erosion and effective factors was computed using the ML models. The ML models were evaluated using different metrics, including accuracy, the kappa coefficient. kNN is the ideal model for this study. The value of the AUC from ROC considering the testing datasets of KNN is 0.93; the remaining models are associated to ideal AUC and are similar to kNN in terms of values. The AUC values from ROC of GLM, LDA, and CART for testing datasets are 0.90, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively. The value of accuracy considering the validation datasets of LDA, CART, KNN, and GLM are 0.85, 0.82, 0.89, 0.84 respectively. The values of Kappa of LDA, CART, and GLM for testing datasets are 0.70, 0.65, and 0.68, respectively. ML models, in particular KNN, GLM, and LDA, have achieved outstanding results in terms of creating soil erosion susceptibility maps. The maps created with the most reliable models could be a useful tool for sustainable management, watershed conservation and prevention of soil and water losses.},

Pages = {43-58},
Abstract = {Recent trends in abrupt weather changes continue to pose a challenge to agricultural production most especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper specifically addresses the questions on how local farmers read and predict the weather; and how they can collaborate with weather scientists in devising adaptation strategies for climate variability (CV) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Recent trends in agriculture-related weather variables available from country's climate services, as well as in freely available satellite rainfall products were analysed. The utility of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system for the study area in the context of supporting farmer's information needs were assessed. Through a multi-stage sampling procedure, a total of 592 households heads in 8 rural communities in the Okavango Delta were selected and interviewed using open and close-ended interview schedules. Also, 19 scientists were purposively selected and interviewed using questionnaires. Key informant interviews, focus group and knowledge validation workshops were used to generate qualitative information from both farmers and scientists. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in summarising the data. Analysis of satellite rainfall products indicated that there was a consistent increase in total annual rainfall throughout the region in the last 10 years, accompanied by an increase in number of rain days, and reduction of duration of dry spells. However, there is a progressive increase in the region's temperatures leading to increase in potential evaporation. Findings from social surveys show that farmers' age, education level, number of years engaged in farming, sources of weather information, knowledge of weather forecasting and decision on farming practices either had a significant relationship or correlation with their perceptions about the nature of both local {[}ethno-meteorological] and scientific weather knowledge. Nonetheless, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of farmers in relation to their perceptions and those of the climate scientists about the nature of both local and Western knowledge. As farmers are adept at judging seasonal patterns through long-standing ethno-meteorology, one major CV adaptation measure is their ability to anticipate changes in future weather conditions, which enables them to adjust their farming calendars and make decisions on crop type selection in any given season.

Title = {Effective management of slums- Case study of Kalaburagi city, Karnataka, India},

Abstract = {As urbanization grows, we may expect that slums will tend to grow even faster. Kalaburagi is a second tier city and an important commercial hub for the Hyderabad-Karnataka region located in the north eastern part of Karnataka state. It attracts the rural folk from neighbouring districts and the city is undergoing rapid changes in terms of population growth as well as in the degree of urbanization due to which the slum population is increasing. There are 60 slums that account for 11\% of city's population. This study aims to contribute some sustainable methodologies for better execution of slum development programs to advance the living conditions of slum dwellers. Slum ontology has been built to identify slums from very high-resolution satellite data that will benefit all stakeholders. The developed ontology was validated with field survey and the help of field photographs, the physical and socio-economic conditions were documented. As per the slum ontology, basic inputs for the Cellular Automata (CA) model were identified and criteria maps with scores were generated. The suitability map was created by giving appropriate weight to the factors. When the slum map prepared based on slum ontology was overlaid on the final results, the CA model output has given reliable results regarding current slum distribution and also a hint of the possible occurrence of slums in the future. Since the proposed land use plan for 2021 has been finalized by the Urban Local Body (ULB), the suitable area for developing affordable housing stock was suggested for preventing slums from arising. The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was built for selecting slum development options. The design and running of the SDSS model were demonstrated with one case study - Borabai nagar slum to enable the ULB to apply the approach to other slum areas for effective implementation of slum development programs.},

Title = {Public libraries and difficulties with targeting the homeless},
Journal = {LIBRARY REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {7-18},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to consider the potential for public library policies that specifically target ``the homeless{''} to undermine their own objectives, and seeks to suggest alternative approaches to extend inclusion and ensure that all demographics are served equally. Design/methodology/approach - The paper was written for a satellite meeting of the 78th IFLA Congress entitled ``The Homeless and the Libraries - the Right to Information and Knowledge For All{''}. Drawing on previous research detailed in Muggleton, and Muggleton and Ruthven, the author presents a discursive perspective on the impact that assumptions about homelessness might have for policymaking. Findings - Extant prejudices and the tendency to create a homeless ``other{''} mean that policies specifically addressing the homeless have the potential to accentuate difference and patronise and alienate the intended beneficiaries of these policies. Moreover, political opposition to more inclusive, accommodating policymaking makes it important to reject assumptions and prejudices that weaken one's own position. Grounding policymaking in the empirical experience of homeless library users is argued to be the most effective way to extend inclusion, and also avoid false dichotomies and the perpetuation of prejudice. Originality/value - Insights into unconscious assumptions gathered from previous research have been applied to the conceptualisation and implementation of public library policy. The arguments presented in the paper will hopefully be of use both for developing effective policies and for defending policies relating to homeless library users.},

Title = {The long-term development of temperate woodland creation sites: from tree saplings to mature woodlands},
Journal = {FORESTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tree planting is at the forefront of the current environmental agenda to mitigate climate change and tackle the biodiversity crisis. In the United Kingdom (UK), tree planting has been a priority for more than a century and has helped increase woodland cover from a historic low of 5 per cent at the beginning of the 20th century to a current figure of 13 per cent. However, we still know relatively little about the long-term development of woodland creation sites (particularly of native woodlands) over ecologically realistic timescales. We surveyed a chronosequence of 133 temperatewoodland patches encompassing 106woodland creation sites (10-160 years old) and 27 mature `ancient' woodlands (>250 years old), using a combination of field surveys and remote sensing techniques to quantify vegetation structural changes associated with woodland development. Woodland creation sites displayed similar vegetation development patterns to those described for other woodland systems, i.e. a gradual transition as woodlands undergo `stand initiation', `stem exclusion' and `understorey reinitiation' stages, and became more similar to `ancient' woodlands over time. Structural heterogeneity, average tree size and tree density were the attributes that varied the most among woodland developmental stages. In general, structural heterogeneity and average tree size increased with woodland age, whilst tree density decreased as would be expected. Younger sites in stand initiation were strongly dominated by short vegetation, stem exclusion sites by taller trees and older sites had a more even vegetation height distribution. There was a large degree of overlap between the vegetation characteristics of woodlands in understorey re-initiation stages and older ancient woodlands (partly driven by a lack of regeneration in the understorey); these results suggest that it takes between 80 and 160 years for woodland creation sites to develop certain vegetation attributes similar to those of mature ancient woodlands included in this study. Woodland management practices to create canopy gaps and reducing grazing/browsing pressure to promote natural regeneration are likely to accelerate this transition, increase the structural heterogeneity and biodiversity value ofwoodland creation sites and enable adaptation and resilience to climate change.},

Title = {Distribution modelling of vegetation types based on area frame survey data},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km(2). Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km(2). Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m x 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system models.},

Title = {Desertification of Iran in the early twenty-first century: assessment using climate and vegetation indices},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Remote sensing of specific climatic and biogeographical parameters is an effective means of evaluating the large-scale desertification status of drylands affected by negative human impacts. Here, we identify and analyze desertification trends in Iran for the period 2001-2015 via a combination of three indices for vegetation (NPP-net primary production, NDVI-normalized difference vegetation index, LAI-leaf area index) and two climate indices (LST-land surface temperature, P-precipitation). We combine these indices to identify and map areas of Iran that are susceptible to land degradation. We then apply a simple linear regression method, the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test, and the Theil-Sen estimator to identify long-term temporal and spatial trends within the data. Based on desertification map, we find that 68\% of Iran shows a high to very high susceptibility to desertification, representing an area of 1.1 million km(2) (excluding 0.42 million km(2) classified as unvegetated). Our results highlight the importance of scale in assessments of desertification, and the value of high-resolution data, in particular. Annually, no significant change is evident within any of the five indices, but significant changes (some positive, some negative) become apparent on a seasonal basis. Some observations follow expectations; for instance, NDVI is strongly associated with cooler, wet spring and summer seasons, and milder winters. Others require more explanation; for instance, vegetation appears decoupled from climatic forcing during autumn. Spatially, too, there is much local and regional variation, which is lost when the data are considered only at the largest nationwide scale. We identify a northwest-southeast belt spanning central Iran, which has experienced significant vegetation decline (2001-2015). We tentatively link this belt of land degradation with intensified agriculture in the hinterlands of Iran's major cities. The spatial and temporal trends identified with the three vegetation and two climate indices afford a cost-effective framework for the prediction and management of future environmental trends in developing regions at risk of desertification.},

Title = {New capabilities of Sentinel-2A/B satellites combined with <i>in situ</i> data for monitoring small harmful algal blooms in complex coastal waters},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {The increased frequency of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is a major environmental concern worldwide, resulting not only in increased treatment costs for drinking water but also in impacts on tourism, commercial fishing and aquaculture and risks to human and animal health. Traditional strategies with ship-based approaches based on field sampling and laboratory analysis have been adopted to assess HABs. However, these methods are labour intensive and costly and do not provide synoptic views of the bloom conditions. Here, we show that the Sentinel-2 twin satellite mission of the Copernicus programme, in combination with in situ data, is a powerful tool that can offer valuable spatiotemporal information about a bloom of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra that occurred on the SW Iberian Peninsula. Using the robust ACOLITE atmospheric correction processor combined with the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), the enhanced mapping of small blooms can be performed at a 10 m spatial resolution, revealing surface patches and a heterogeneous distribution. This research also demonstrates the improved capabilities of Sentinel-2 compared to those of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-3 for continuous monitoring. The Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 missions provide ecosystem observations that allow the environmental community and water managers to evaluate changes in water quality and bloom distribution and that facilitate field-based measurements. Therefore, the value added by the Copernicus products in terms of frequency and synoptic observations is of paramount importance for ecological and management purposes at regional and national scales.},

Title = {Climate and Socioeconomic Factors Drive Irrigated Agriculture Dynamics in the Lower Colorado River Basin},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Colorado River Basin (CRB) includes seven states and provides municipal and industrial water to millions of people across all major southwestern cities both inside and outside the basin. Agriculture is the largest part of the CRB economy and crop production depends on irrigation, which accounts for about 74\% of the total water demand cross the region. A better understanding of irrigation water demands is critically needed as temperatures continue to rise and drought intensifies, potentially leading to water shortages across the region. Yet, past research on irrigation dynamics has generally utilized relatively low spatiotemporal resolution datasets and has often overlooked the relationship between climate and management decisions such as land fallowing, i.e., the practice of leaving cultivated land idle for a growing season. Here, we produced annual estimates of fallow and active cropland extent at high spatial resolution (30 m) from 2001 to 2017 by applying the fallow-land algorithm based on neighborhood and temporal anomalies (FANTA). We specifically focused on diverse CRB agricultural regions: the lower Colorado River planning (LCRP) area and the Pinal and Phoenix active management areas (PPAMA). Utilizing ground observations collected in 2014 and 2017, we found an overall classification accuracy of 88.9\% and 87.2\% for LCRP and PPAMA, respectively. We then quantified how factors such as climate, district water rights, and market value influenced: (1) annual fallow and active cropland extent and (2) annual cropland productivity, approximated by integrated growing season NDVI (iNDVI). We found that for the LCRP, a region of winter cropping and senior (i.e., preferential) water rights, active cropland productivity was positively correlated with cool-season average vapor pressure deficit (R = 0.72; p < 0.01). By contrast, for the PPAMA, a region of summer cropping and junior water rights, annual fallow and active cropland extent was positively correlated with cool-season aridity (precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) (R = 0.46; p < 0.05), and active cropland productivity was positively correlated with warm-season aridity (precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) (R = 0.42; p < 0.01). We also found that PPAMA cropland productivity was more sensitive to aridity when crop prices were low, potentially due to the influence of market value on management decisions. Our analysis highlights how biophysical (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and socioeconomic (e.g., water rights and crop market value) factors interact to explain seasonal patterns of cropland extent, water use and productivity. These findings indicate that increasing aridity across the region may result in reduced cropland productivity and increased land fallowing for some regions, particularly those with junior water rights.},

Title = {A high-resolution physical modelling approach to assess runoff and soil erosion in vineyards under different soil managements},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Steep-slope viticulture is a common practice in the Mediterranean basin, and provides landscapes of considerable socio-economic value. However, these complex agricultural systems are intrinsically fragile. One of the main problems is soil erosion due to extreme rainfall events. This may cause a progressive reduction in soil fertility and the occurrence of instabilities and land degradation phenomena. To worsen this condition there is the increasing mechanisation of agricultural management causing soil compaction, and the pressure of climate change, with an intensification of extreme weather events. In this context, vineyard soil management plays a key role, as it can accelerate or mitigate overland flow and soil erosion phenomena. There are various techniques for quantifying these processes, often based on field measurements through prolonged data collection using experimental plots. However, the advent of new technologies in remote sensing opens new frontiers in the acquisition of highresolution spatial data. Indeed, they could be used in runoff/erosion simulation models and integrated with site-specific data. The aim of this paper is to assess runoff and soil erosion processes in vineyard under four different soil managements. Specifically, four practices were tested: (1) Reference (inter-row managed with standard farm grass cover; RF); (2) Continuous Tillage (bare soil obtained by continuous mechanical weeding using roto-tiller; CT); Nectariferous (a mix of herbaceous species capable of attracting insects favouring inter-row biodiversity; NF); (4) Single Tillage (inter-row weeding once a year using roto-tiller; ST). The research proposes a modelling approach using a physically-based model (SIMWE) using samples of runoff and sediment as an assessment, collected with a low-cost methodology. In particular, a cost-effective approach easily replicable in different contexts (such as developing countries) is sought. In addition to cultivation specifics, areas of soil compacted by the passage of agricultural vehicles were also analysed using the connectivity index. In general, results show an interesting capacity of ST in mitigating soil erosion, as well as for NF. Furthermore, the negative role of wheel tracks as preferential pathways for surface runoff and sediment is highlighted. Finally, the work shows that CT aggravated soil erosion as compared to RF.},

Title = {The effects of applying different DEM resolutions, DEM sources and flow tracing algorithms on LS factor and sediment yield estimation using USLE in Barajin river basin (BRB), Iran},

Abstract = {Accurate estimation of the spatial pattern of annual soil erosion and sediment yield is of paramount importance in watershed conservation measures, design of sedimentation dams, reduction of reservoir storage capacity, integrated watershed management, flood problems, and alteration of ecosystems' locations. One of the most widely used empirical/ conceptual methods for estimating soil erosion and the sediment yield rate (SYR) is the universal soil loss equation (USLE) model. Topographic factor (LS) is one of the main inputs of RUSLE and can be calculated using digital elevation models (DEMs). This research studied the impacts of using different DEM resolutions (cell size ranges from 30 to 200 m), DEM sources (ALOS-30 m, ASTER-30 m, and SRTM-90 m), and various LS formulas on the USLE and estimated SYR at the Barajin river basin (BRB) outlet. Also, assessing the effect of distinct flow tracing algorithms (FTAs) on LS factor and RUSLE output is another purpose of this study. Findings show that using different LS equations without considering their limitations leads to a significant absolute relative error (ARE) in the estimation of SYR (ranging from 1.2 to 400\%). Furthermore, Liu et al. (1994) and Moore and Burch (1986) equations, due to an ARE of lower than 10\% in estimating SYR, are the best ones for high slope regions like BRB. Evaluating the effects of scale issues indicates that DEM resolution is more critical than DEM sources (or data resolution). Based on findings, the ARE of SYR estimation caused by DEM resolution varies between 1.5\% and 58\%, while for different DEM sources, it changes from 15.1\% to 48.5\%. Besides, ASTER-30 m and SRTM-90 m with the mean ARE value of 34.9 and 15.3\%, respectively, are the worst and best DEM sources in BRB. Finally, investigating the impact of using different FTAs indicates that ignoring this issue can lead to significant errors ranging between 1.6 and 42.2\%. Among all FTAs the MFD and Aspects are the best ones for applying in the USLE model. To summarize, in data-sparse regions or developing countries, the findings of this study can be considered as appropriate guidance.},

Title = {Development and application of the soil moisture routing (SMR) model to identify subfield-scale hydrologic classes in dryland cropping systems using the Budyko framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {573},
Pages = {153-167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework, for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact. Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively. Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172\% and 137\% that of the dry zone. Depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91\% in the western-most field to approximately 70\% in each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses. Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems.},

Abstract = {Land use/land cover change evaluation and prediction using spatiotemporal data are crucial for environmental monitoring and better planning and management of land use. The main objective of this study is to evaluate land use/land cover changes for the time period of 1991-2022 and predict future changes using the CA-ANN model in the Upper Omo-Gibe River basin. Landsat-5 TM for 1991, 1997, and 2004, Landsat-7 ETM+ for 2010, and Landsat-8 (OLI) for 2016 and 2022 were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer Data Center. A random forest machine learning algorithm was employed for LULC classification. The LULC classification result was evaluated using an accuracy assessment technique to assure the correctness of the classification method employing the kappa coefficient. Kappa coefficient values of the classification indicate that there was strong agreement between the classified and reference data. Using the MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS and the CA-ANN model, future LULC changes were predicted. Artificial neural network (ANN) and cellular automata (CA) machine learning methods were made available for LULC change modeling and prediction via the QGIS MOLUSCE plugin. Transition potential modeling was computed, and future LULC changes were predicted using the CA-ANN model. An overall accuracy of 86.53\% and an overall kappa value of 0.82 were obtained by comparing the actual data of 2022 with the simulated LULC data from the same year. The study findings revealed that between 2022 and 2037, agricultural land (63.09\%) and shrubland (5.74\%) showed significant increases, and forest (-48.10\%) and grassland (-0.31\%) decreased. From 2037 to 2052, the built-up area (2.99\%) showed a significant increase, and forest and agricultural land (-2.55\%) showed a significant decrease. From 2052 to 2067, the projected LULC simulation result showed that agricultural land (3.15\%) and built-up area (0.32\%) increased, and forest (-1.59\%) and shrubland (-0.56\%) showed significant decreases. According to the study's findings, the main drivers of LULC changes are the expansion of built-up areas and agricultural land, which calls for a thorough investigation using additional data and models to give planners and policymakers clear information on LULC changes and their environmental effects.},

Abstract = {High loadings of nitrate (NO3-) in the aerosol over China significantly exacerbate the air quality and pose a great threat to ecosystem safety through dry-wet deposition. Unfortunately, limited ground-level observation data make it challenging to fully reflect the spatial pattern of NO3- levels across China. Until now, long-term monthly particulate NO3- datasets at a high resolution were still missing, which restricted the assessment of human health and ecosystem safety. Therefore, a unique monthly NO3- dataset at 0.25 degrees resolution over China during 2005-2015 was developed by assimilating surface observations, satellite products, meteorological data, land use types and other covariates using an ensemble model combining random forest (RF), gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient-boosting (XGBoost) methods. The new developed product featured an excellent cross-validation R-2 value (0.78) and relatively lower root-mean-square error (RMSE: 1.19 mu gNm(-3)) and mean absolute error (MAE: 0.81 mu gNm(-3)). Besides, the dataset also exhibited relatively robust performance at the spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, the dataset displayed good agreement with (R-2 = 0 :85, RMSE = 0 :74 mu gNm(-3), and MAE = 0 :55 mu gNm(-3)) some unlearned data collected from previous studies. The spatiotemporal variations in the developed product were also shown. The estimated NO3- concentration showed the highest value in the North China Plain (NCP) (3:55 +/- 1:25 mu gNm(-3)); followed by the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (2:56 +/- 1:12 mu gNm(-3)), Pearl River Delta (PRD) (1:68 +/- 0:81 mu gNm(-3)), and Sichuan Basin (1 :53 +/- 0 :63 mu gNm(-3)), and the lowest one in the Tibetan Plateau (0 :42 +/- 0 :25 mu gNm(-3)). The higher ambient NO3- concentrations in the NCP, YRD, and PRD were closely linked to the dense anthropogenic emissions. Apart from the intensive human activities, poor terrain condition might be a key factor for the serious NO3- pollution in the Sichuan Basin. The lowest ambient NO3- concentration in the Tibetan Plateau was contributed by the scarce anthropogenic emission and favourable meteorological factors (e.g. high wind speed). In addition, the ambient NO3- concentration showed a marked increasing tendency of 0.10 mu gNm(-3) yr(-1) during 2005-2014 ( p < 0 :05), while it decreased sharply from 2014 to 2015 at a rate of 0 :40 mu gNm(-3) yr(-1) ( p < 0 :05). The ambient NO3- levels in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), YRD, and PRD displayed gradual increases at a rate of 0.20, 0.11, and 0.05 mu gNm(-3) yr(-1) ( p < 0 :05) during 2005-2013, respectively. The gradual increases in NO3- concentrations in these regions from 2005 to 2013 were due to the fact that the emission reduction measures during this period focused on the reduction of SO2 emission rather than NOx emission and the rapid increase in energy consumption. Afterwards, the government further strengthened these emission reduction measures and thus caused the dramatic decreases in NO3- concentrations in these regions from 2013 to 2015 ( p < 0 :05). The long-term NO3- dataset over China could greatly deepen the knowledge about the impacts of emission reduction measures on air quality improvement. The monthly particulate NO3- levels over China during 2005-2015 are open access at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3988307 (Li et al., 2020c).},

Abstract = {Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System (GH-LPS) is a ground-based positioning system, it can provide high-precision, high reliability, and high environmental adaptability independently within a limited area. The location services to make up for space-based navigation systems on the ground are limited by many factors. It mainly uses the carrier phase measurement value for positioning. To ensure its stable performance, it is necessary to detect and repair the cycle slip caused by high dynamics, signal impairments, and loss of lock on the signal. Therefore, in this paper, we establish the integration positioning model of Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System /INS, we propose a method for using the inertial information to assist the Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System for cycle slip detection. We use the position information predicted by the INS to calculate the cycle slip detection decision, and use the hypothesis test to determine whether the cycle slip occurs and correctly identify the size and position of the occurrence of the cycle slip. The experimental analysis of the simulated and measured scenes validates the performance of the proposed algorithm for cycle slip detection, effectively detects the occurrence of small cycle slip. For the effect of different noise variance, the cycle slip detection method proposed in this paper can also keep the probability of accurate detection of cycle slips above 86\%. From the positioning result, detection and repair of cycle slip can improve positioning accuracy by 64\%.},

Title = {Routine implementation costs of larviciding with <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> <i>israelensis</i> against malaria vectors in a district in rural Burkina Faso},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Background: The key tools in malaria control are early diagnosis and treatment of cases as well as vector control. Current strategies for malaria vector control in sub-Saharan Africa are largely based on long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and to a much smaller extent on indoor residual spraying (IRS). An additional tool in the fight against malaria vectors, larval source management (LSM), has not been used in sub-Saharan Africa on a wider scale since the abandonment of environmental spraying of DDT. Increasing concerns about limitations of LLINs and IRS and encouraging results from large larvicide-based LSM trials make a strong case for using biological larviciding as a complementary tool to existing control measures. Arguments that are often quoted against such a combined approach are the alleged high implementation costs of LSM. This study makes the first step to test this argument. The implementation costs of larval source management based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) (strain AM65-52) spraying under different implementation scenarios were analysed in a rural health district in Burkina Faso. Methods: The analysis draws on detailed cost data gathered during a large-scale LSM intervention between 2013 and 2015. All 127 villages in the study setup were assigned to two treatment arms and one control group. Treatment either implied exhaustive spraying of all available water collections or targeted spraying of the 50 \% most productive larval sources via remote-sensing derived and entomologically validated risk maps. Based on the cost reports from both intervention arms, the per capita programme costs were calculated under the assumption of covering the whole district with either intervention scenario. Cost calculations have been generalized by providing an adaptable cost formula. In addition, this study assesses the sensitivity of per capita programme costs with respect to changes in the underlying cost components. Results: The average annual per capita costs of exhaustive larviciding with Bti during the main malaria transmission period (June-October) in the Nouna health district were calculated to be US\$ 1.05. When targeted spraying of the 50 \% most productive larval sources is used instead, average annual per capita costs decrease by 27 \% to US\$ 0.77. Additionally, a high sensitivity of per capita programme costs against changes in total surface of potential larval sources and the number of spraying repetitions was found. Discussion: The per capita costs for larval source management interventions with Bti are roughly a third of the annual per capita expenditures for anti-malarial drugs and those for LLINs in Burkina Faso which are US\$ 3.80 and 3.00, respectively. The average LSM costs compare to those of IRS and LLINs for sub-Saharan Africa. The authors argue that in such a setting LSM based on Bti spraying is within the range of affordable anti-malarial strategies and, consequently, should deserve more attention in practice. Future research includes a cost-benefit calculation, based on entomological and epidemiological data collected during the research project.},

Title = {Diagnosing pristine pine forest development through pansharpened-surface-reflectance Landsat image derived aboveground biomass productivity},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {487},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {A map of natural forest aboveground biomass (AGB) can serve as a baseline for forest managers to integrate multi-temporal information to account for the trend of reducing carbon emission from the forest degradation over time. Taking advantage of spectral and spatial enhancement in Landsat OLI images, a machine learning based kNN algorithm was applied to derive AGB maps of a pristine forest of Pinus kesiya in 2014 and 2019 via allometric models of the pine and inventory data. AGB productivity of the study site was derived and examined for diagnosing the pristine pine forest development. The radiance of the Landsat image was first restored and then normalized by the FLAASH model, a radiation transfer model-based algorithm used to derive surface reflectance image, and finally a pansharpening technique was applied to improve the spatial resolution while retaining the spectral resolution of the reflectance image. Results showed that the pansharpened surface reflectance image was able to derive AGB maps with a satisfactory accuracy of root mean square percentage error, RMSPE = 15\%, which shows significant improvement on the performance of AGB estimation using the raw image (RMSPE = 56\%) and non-pansharpened surface reflectance image (RMSPE = 48\%). The loss of AGB stocks is mainly caused by landslide, forest fire, and agricultural expansion, particularly the use of fire for land preparation for cropping. Land covers other than pine stands have complicated the edge of the pristine pine forest. The non-forest cover types surrounded the forest enlarged the boundary of the forest and made the pristine forest slightly fragmented. The results also showed that the AGB loss/gain of a forest parcel is negatively/positively related to the size of the parcel. Appropriate forest land zoning and community-based forest management for the surrounding non-pristine pine forest could have the benefit of mitigating the degradation of the pristine pine forest and improving the biomass stocks for better REDD achievements.},

Abstract = {Nowadays remote sensing is a well-established method and technique of providing data. The current development shows the availability of systems with very high geometric resolution for the monitoring of vegetation. At the same time, however, the value of temporally high-resolution data is underestimated, particularly in applications focusing on the detection of short-term changes. These can be natural processes like natural disasters as well as changes caused by anthropogenic interventions. These include economic activities such as forestry, agriculture or mining but also processes which are intended to convert previously used areas into natural or near-natural surfaces. The Konigsbrucker Heide is a former military training site located about 30 km north of the Saxon state capitol Dresden. After the withdrawal of the Soviet forces in 1992 and after nearly 100 years of military use this site was declared as nature reserve in 1996. The management of the whole protection area is implemented in three different management zone. Based on MODIS-NDVI time series between 2000 and 2016 different developments are apparent in the nature development zone and the zone of controlled succession. Nevertheless, the analyses also show that short-term changes, so called breaks in the vegetation development cannot be described using linear trend models. The complete understanding of vegetation trends is only given if discontinuities in vegetation development are considered. Structural breaks in the NDVI time series can be found simultaneously in the whole study area. Hence it can be assumed that these breaks have a more natural character, caused for example by climatic conditions like temperature or precipitation. Otherwise, especially in the zone of controlled succession structural breaks can be detected which cannot be traced back to natural conditions. Final analyses of the spatial distribution of breakpoints as well as their frequency depending on the respective protection zone allow a detailed view to vegetation development in the Konigsbrucker Heide.},

Title = {Assessing land degradation induced by recreational activities in the Algodones Dunes, California using MODIS satellite imagery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {185},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This research investigated spatial and temporal environmental changes associated with climatic variability and off-highway vehicle (OHV) activity in the Algodones Dunes, California, using time-series analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer imagery from 2001 to 2016. We compared changes in land cover, surface albedo, and surface temperatures between the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area (ISDRA) and areas with no OHV activity in the North Algodones Dunes Wilderness area (NADW). Both areas showed a decreasing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and an increasing albedo from 2001 to 2016; however, ISDRA had a lower NDVI value and higher albedo compared to the adjacent NADW. Transects across these adjoining areas revealed substantial differences in daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures. ISDRA had an appreciably higher mean daytime temperature and a lower mean nighttime temperature compared to those within NADW. Results suggest direct association between increasing OHV activity and reduced vegetation cover, increased soil exposure, and higher daytime temperatures in the Algodones Dunes. We recommend enhanced monitoring of ecosystem and land use changes coupled with enhanced land use management to reduce the contributions of recreational OHV activity on land degradation and to maintain habitat for key species and ecosystems of interest in the dune field.},

Journal = {AEOLIAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {79-109},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aeolian science is faced with significant challenges that impact its ability to benefit from recent advances in information technology. The discipline deals with high-end systems in the form of ground and satellite based sensors, computer modeling and simulation, and wind tunnel experiments. Aeolian scientists also collect field data manually with observational methods that may differ significantly between studies with little agreement on even basic morphometric parameters and terminology. Data produced from these studies, while forming the core of research papers and reports, is rarely available to the community at large. Recent advances are also superimposed on an underlying semantic structure that dates to the 1800's or earlier that is confusing, with ambiguously defined, and at times even contradictory, meanings. The aeolian ``world-view{''} does not always fit within neat increments nor is defined by crisp objects. Instead change is continuous and features are fuzzy. Development of an ontological framework to guide spatiotemporal research is the fundamental starting point for organizing data in aeolian science. This requires a ``rethinking{''} of how we define, collect, process, store and share data along with the development of a community-wide collaborative approach designed to bring the discipline into a data rich future. There is also a pressing need to develop efficient methods to integrate, analyze and manage spatial and temporal data and to promote data produced by aeolian scientists so it is available for preparing diagnostic studies, as input into a range of environmental models, and for advising national and international bodies that drive research agendas. This requires the establishment of working groups within the discipline to deal with content, format, processing pipelines, knowledge discovery tools and database access issues unique to aeolian science. Achieving this goal requires the development of comprehensive and highly-organized databases, tools that allow aeolian scientists as well as those in related disciplines to access and analyze the wealth of data available, and a supporting infrastructure and community-wide effort that allows aeolian scientists to communicate their results in replicable ways to scientists and decision and policy makers. Fortunately, much of the groundwork required to move aeolian science into a data rich future has been developed in other data rich physical science fields, and within the computer science and information technology disciplines.

Title = {Assessing the transition from deforestation to forest regrowth with an agent-based model of land cover change for south-central Indiana (USA)},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {819-832},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Midwest and Northeast United States has experienced a net increase in forest cover since the beginning of the 20th century. However, we lack a detailed understanding of the transition to net forest cover increase because this forest regrowth occurred prior to the use of tools like household-level surveys focused on land use decision-making and availability of remote sensing data. Agent-based modeling presents an appealing means to explore what social and biophysical dynamics may have contributed to this forest regrowth process. In this paper we employ an agent-based model to analyze the process of forest regrowth in south-central Indiana from 1939 to 1993. Simulation results are presented for assumptions regarding pre-existing forest age and the stand age at which landowners harvest timber with a goal of understanding the influence of these factors on future trajectories of land cover change. The results demonstrate both the value and the burden of having many time points to evaluate the success of the model. Is the best simulation the one with the smallest net residuals across all time points? Or is the best simulation the one that best reproduces the correct trajectory of land cover change for each time interval? Model simulations that assume a harvesting frequency of 30 years all produced landscapes within 2\% of the actual forest cover in 1993, the end point of the study period. However, the trajectories of these simulations did not all mimic the gradual forest regrowth found in our observed data. The model simulation with the smallest residual values across all time points assumed a initial forest age of 5 years in 1939 and a harvesting frequency of 30 years. Ultimately, we cannot definitively conclude that one model simulation is a better representation of reality than another because we have no way of comprehensively validating the model assumptions. However, we can more plausibly conclude that the age of forest regrowth in 1939 and the frequency of timber harvesting by landowners both had an influence on the successive trajectory of land cover change in the study area.

Abstract = {GolMexSur, a metadatabase for the oceanographic and meteorological information of the southern Gulf of Mexico (SGM) (17N 85W - 26N 99W) was designed and implemented in order to organize and manage in a fine and regular mesh, oceanic and meteorological data coming from several heterogeneous gross-grid-sized or sparse data sources. The metadatabase has three organizational components: (1) knowledge base, (2) metadata, and (3) data values. Knowledge base component contains three classes of knowledge: operating knowledge (triggers, processes, and integrity constraints), control knowledge for sequential systems interactions, and decision knowledge for parallel systems interactions. Metadata component contains organizational information related to the environmental and hydrological data: data's spatial and temporal location, measurement units, obtaining method, quality, etc. Finally, data values component represents the numerical value of each variable or parameter (sea surface temperature, wind speed, wind direction, sea level pressure, etc). Additionally, metadata and data values components have two temporal scopes: recent information, and historical information. GolMexSur has information from sources such as coastal airports, coastal meteorological stations, oceanographic cruises, buoys, wave gauges, and information derived or estimated from satellite imageries or numerical models. In a first stage, GolMexSur was designed and implemented using MS Visual FoxPro(@), but recently the design was modified to work with Oracle(@). The implementation of this metadatabase represents the first step of a major project, whose main objective is to build a regional operational oceanographic system for the SGM, and at present it is being used in studying the oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the SGM oil region.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {13-36},
Abstract = {Urbanization is taking place faster, and urban air temperatures are gradually rising in all cities across the world. Uncontrolled and unplanned urbanization leads to constant environmental threats and can alter local and regional climates. According to the survey published by Economist Intelligence Unit, in India, Keralas Malappuram district ranks first among the fastest-growing urban areas globally, with a 44.05\% growth rate. Hence, the present study aims to identify the hotspot regions of extreme heat within the Malappuram urban agglomeration region and suggest strategies for its improvement. The split-window algorithm retrieved land surface temperature (LST) for 1991, 1998, 2014, and 2020 using Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 satellite imageries. A rising trend in LST has been detected in the last 30 years, and the mean value has increased by 1.70 \& DEG;C within the region. Among the selected hotspots, an LST increase of 1.84 \& DEG;C was observed for those areas with the highest increase in urban density with decreased vegetation. The increasing impact of urbanization and the subsequent change in land use patterns at the cost of greenery have caused a substantial effect on the local climate. Accordingly, planning and policy directions are proposed for the local government that can help provide awareness to the people through the effective implementation of mitigation measures.},

Title = {Comparing fine-scale structural and hydrologic connectivity within unimproved and improved grassland},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Grasslands vary with diverse forms and functions ranging from monocultures of perennial rye grass to more biodiverse unimproved grasslands which cover around 5\% of Europe. Despite the broad diversity of grassland types, within environmental and flood risk models grasslands are frequently represented by a singular set of hydrological and structural parameters which belies their diversity and complexity. This study aimed to determine empirically the extent to which improved versus unimproved grasslands exhibit different hydrological connectivity. Working in SW England at neighbouring field sites with comparable slopes and rainfall regimes, we used unpiloted aerial vehicles to survey a tussocky Molinia caerulea dominated unimproved grassland field (MCUG) field and a Lolium perenne dominated improved grassland (LPIG) field. Using digital photogrammetry workflows applied to the overlapping aerial images, we produced a digital surface model (DSM) at 0.03-m resolution from which flow pathways were modelled using GIS and compared with 1-m LiDAR and DSM produced by a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). MCUG had longer, tortuous pathways through the dense tussock network with a drainage density of 2.54 m m(-2). This was significantly greater than drainage density in the LPIG (1.82 m m(-2)). As a result of this study, we rescaled the Manning's n value for MCUG according to photogrammetrically-derived roughness values. We suggest it should lie between 0.075 and 0.09. Our data shows that MCUG can play an important role in reducing overland flow impacts when compared to LPIG through lower connectivity which can delay run-off to rivers.},

Title = {Assessment of Energy-Population-Urbanization Nexus with Changing Energy Industry Scenario in India},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The demand for energy has been growing worldwide, especially in India partly due to the rapid population growth and urbanization of the country. To meet the ever-increasing energy requirement while maintaining an ecological balance is a challenging task. However, the energy industry-induced effect on population and urbanization has not been addressed before. Therefore, this study investigates the linkages between energy, population, and urbanization. The study also aims to find the quantifiable indicators for the population growth and rate of urbanization due to the expanding energy industry. The integrated framework uses a multi-temporal Landsat data to analyze the urbanization pattern, a census data for changes in population growth, night time light (NTL) data as an indicator for economic development and energy production and consumption data for energy index. Multi-attribute model is used to calculate a unified metric, termed as the energy-population-urbanization (EPU) nexus index. The proposed approach is demonstrated in the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Dadri power plant located in Uttar Pradesh, India. Landsat and NTL data clearly shows the urbanization pattern, economic development, and electrification in the study area. A comparative analysis based on various multi-attribute decision model assessment techniques suggests that the average value of EPU nexus index is 0.529, which significantly large compared to other studies and require special attention by policymakers because large EPU index indicates stronger correlation among energy, population, and urbanization. The authors believe that it would help the policymakers in planning and development of future energy projects, policies, and long-term strategies as India is expanding its energy industry.},

Abstract = {Transformation is a total transition process from a form into a new figure which can be interpreted as the final stage of a process where space and time become greatly affect the changes to the ultimate stage. Changes are done by giving the response of the influence of external and internal elements that will lead to a change of shape that has been known previously. The title of ``education city{''} to the city of Bandung past of history of its establishment. Education in Bandung began to show its development since the establishment of Hollandsch Inlandsche Kweekschool, shortened into HIK48, on May 13, 1868. It was established by some important figures, among others, were R. H. Muhammad Musa. Meanwhile, higher education began to grow since the establishment of Technische Hoogeschool (abbreviated as THS) in 1920 as part of the Ethical Policy of the Dutch Government to its colony. So since then, the life of higher education in the city of Bandung continues to grow and increase. THS is a forerunner to the birth of Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB now). The purpose of this study is to establish the theory that can explain how the transformation of urban space in Balubur Tamansari in Bandung City, so it can be seen adjusting the physical setting of the region as the city's identity. The research method used was a qualitative grounded theory research method, the approach is focused on the discrete phenomenon in the field in order to disclose the meaning of the background of the city region space. This phenomenon was appointed through a process of snowball sampling. The process of data collection, analysis and theory building will be done at the same time in a period of time and iterative of process. This research generates knowledge building based on the knitting of the value system, the activity of perpetrator and physical setting in the region.},

Title = {Fine-scale mapping of urban malaria exposure under data scarcity: an approach centred on vector ecology},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {BackgroundAlthough malaria transmission has experienced an overall decline in sub-Saharan Africa, urban malaria is now considered an emerging health issue due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanization and the adaptation of vectors to urban environments. Fine-scale hazard and exposure maps are required to support evidence-based policies and targeted interventions, but data-driven predictive spatial modelling is hindered by gaps in epidemiological and entomological data. A knowledge-based geospatial framework is proposed for mapping the heterogeneity of urban malaria hazard and exposure under data scarcity. It builds on proven geospatial methods, implements open-source algorithms, and relies heavily on vector ecology knowledge and the involvement of local experts.MethodsA workflow for producing fine-scale maps was systematized, and most processing steps were automated. The method was evaluated through its application to the metropolitan area of Dakar, Senegal, where urban transmission has long been confirmed. Urban malaria exposure was defined as the contact risk between adult Anopheles vectors (the hazard) and urban population and accounted for socioeconomic vulnerability by including the dimension of urban deprivation that is reflected in the morphology of the built-up fabric. Larval habitat suitability was mapped through a deductive geospatial approach involving the participation of experts with a strong background in vector ecology and validated with existing geolocated entomological data. Adult vector habitat suitability was derived through a similar process, based on dispersal from suitable breeding site locations. The resulting hazard map was combined with a population density map to generate a gridded urban malaria exposure map at a spatial resolution of 100 m.ResultsThe identification of key criteria influencing vector habitat suitability, their translation into geospatial layers, and the assessment of their relative importance are major outcomes of the study that can serve as a basis for replication in other sub-Saharan African cities. Quantitative validation of the larval habitat suitability map demonstrates the reliable performance of the deductive approach, and the added value of including local vector ecology experts in the process. The patterns displayed in the hazard and exposure maps reflect the high degree of heterogeneity that exists throughout the city of Dakar and its suburbs, due not only to the influence of environmental factors, but also to urban deprivation.ConclusionsThis study is an effort to bring geospatial research output closer to effective support tools for local stakeholders and decision makers. Its major contributions are the identification of a broad set of criteria related to vector ecology and the systematization of the workflow for producing fine-scale maps. In a context of epidemiological and entomological data scarcity, vector ecology knowledge is key for mapping urban malaria exposure. An application of the framework to Dakar showed its potential in this regard. Fine-grained heterogeneity was revealed by the output maps, and besides the influence of environmental factors, the strong links between urban malaria and deprivation were also highlighted.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Variability in White Shark (<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>) Movement Ecology During Residency and Migration Phases in the Western North Atlantic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {08},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Understanding how mobile, marine predators use three-dimensional space over time is central to inform management and conservation actions. Combining tracking technologies can yield powerful datasets over multiple spatio-temporal scales to provide critical information for these purposes. For the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), detailed movement and migration information over ontogeny, including inter- and intra-annual variation in timing of movement phases, is largely unknown in the western North Atlantic (WNA), a relatively understudied area for this species. To address this need, we tracked 48 large juvenile to adult white sharks between 2012 and 2020, using a combination of satellite-linked and acoustic telemetry. Overall, WNA white sharks showed repeatable and predictable patterns in horizontal movements, although there was variation in these movements related to sex and size. While most sharks undertook an annual migratory cycle with the majority of time spent over the continental shelf, some individuals, particularly adult females, made extensive forays into the open ocean as far east as beyond the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Moreover, increased off-shelf use occurred with body size even though migration and residency phases were conserved. Summer residency areas included coastal Massachusetts and portions of Atlantic Canada, with individuals showing fidelity to specific regions over multiple years. An autumn/winter migration occurred with sharks moving rapidly south to overwintering residency areas in the southeastern United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, where they remained until the following spring/summer. While broad residency and migration periods were consistent, migratory timing varied among years and among individuals within years. White sharks monitored with pop-up satellite-linked archival tags made extensive use of the water column (0-872 m) and experienced a broad range of temperatures (-0.9 - 30.5 degrees C), with evidence for differential vertical use based on migration and residency phases. Overall, results show dynamic inter- and intra-annual three-dimensional patterns of movements conserved within discrete phases. These results demonstrate the value of using multiple tag types to track long-term movements of large mobile species. Our findings expand knowledge of the movements and migration of the WNA white shark population and comprise critically important information to inform sound management strategies for the species.},

Title = {Mapping of Ecological Environment Based on Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform and Landsat Long-Term Data: A Case Study of the Zhoushan Archipelago},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid advancement of China's urbanization, the contradiction between urban development and the ecological environment has become increasingly prominent, and the urban ecological system now faces severe challenges. In this study, we proposed an ecological index-based approach to monitor and evaluate the ecological environment using a Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform and Landsat time series. Firstly, a long-term series of Landsat images was obtained to construct and calculate the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI). Then, the Theil-Sen median estimation and the Mann-Kendall test were used to evaluate the trend and significance of the RSEI time series and combined with the Hurst index to predict the future development trend of the ecological environment in the study area. Finally, the coefficient of variation method was used to determine the temporal stability of the ecological environment. Taking Zhoushan Archipelago, China, as the study area, we mapped the distribution of the ecological environment using a spatial resolution of 30 m and evaluated the ecological environment from 1985 to 2020. The results show that (1) from 1985 to 2020, the average RSEI in the Zhoushan Archipelago decreased from 0.7719 to 0.5817, increasing at a rate of -24.64\%. (2) The changes in the areas of each level of ecological environmental quality show that the ecological environment in the Zhoushan Archipelago generally exhibited a decreasing trend. During the study period, the proportion of the areas with excellent ecological environmental quality decreased by 38.83\%, while the proportion of areas with poor and relatively poor ecological environmental quality increased by 20.03\%. (3) Based on the overall change trend, the degradation in the ecological environment in the Zhoushan Archipelago was greater than the improvement, with the degradation area accounting for 84.35\% of the total area, the improvement area accounting for 12.61\% of the total area, and the stable area accounting for 3.05\% of the total area. (4) From the perspective of the sustainability of the changes, in 86.61\% of the study area, the RSEI exhibited positive sustainability, indicating that the sustainability of the RSEI was relatively strong. (5) The coefficient of variation in the RSEI was concentrated in the range of 0-0.40, having an average value of 0.1627 and a standard deviation of 0.1467, indicating that the RSEI values in the Zhoushan Archipelago during the study period were concentrated, the interannual fluctuations of the data were small, and the time series was relatively stable. The results of this study provide theoretical methods and a decision-making basis for the dynamic monitoring and regional governance of the ecological environment in island areas.},

Abstract = {The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) provides a forum in which government and industry cooperate for the improvement and rational use of telecommunications worldwide. One of the missions of the Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) is the management of the radio-frequency spectrum and orbital locations, which are increasingly in demand from a large number of services. The ITU-R's mission is to ensure rational, equitable, efficient and economical use of this spectrum by all radio-communication services, including those using satellite orbit, and to facilitate studies and adoption of regulations and recommendations on radiocommunication matters. World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) review and revise radio regulations, allocations, and allotment plans, and address any radiocommunication matters. The WRCs are now convened every two or three years. However, with that level of infrequency, spectrum allocation planning might not be very responsive to industry development. Moreover, the general scope of the agenda is extensive and results in political compromise instead of technical readiness. It creates tension regarding the need for adequate time to have relevant technical studies done to support or refute proposals. This issue of political versus technical interests becomes more crucial with the growth of regional activities for coordination and the economic value of the spectrum. In addition, industry has intemational-rather then merely national- representation, affecting the technical study process. In turn, the WRC process impacts on industry are significant: resulting in delays, uncertainties, and political compromises affecting technical viability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {ROAD MAP OF EVOLUTION OF NICNET TOWARDS GLOBALIZATION OF COMPUTER-COMMUNICATION},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS INFORMATION \& PLANNING},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {A view is advocated here that the application of computers and communication as an integrated technology, has more impact on social and economic development than computer technology alone or communication technology alone. As social and economic interaction cannot be localised artificially in a world moving towards a `global village', globalisation of computer-communication networks will become the major enabling instrument for this evolution. The evolution of NICNET, the computer communication nework of the National Informatic Centre, is so oriented that such an integration and globalisation is progressively impelemented utilising the latest low cost technologies available in the international market. Tracing the evolution of NICNET from its genesis in 1985, the choice of the various technologies to date, and, the road map for NICNET till 2000 AD is projected in step with the forecasting of technological evolution towards integration and globalisation of computer and communication resources. The choice of Spread Spectrum Multiple Access/Code Division Multiple Access (SSMA/COMA) based Very Small Aperture Terminal (VAST) Satellite Earth Station technology is discussed to support the contention that VAST Technology enabled the first level of integration and globalisation between 1985 and 1992. Discussing the inevitability of the Ku/Ka band choice for the next level of integration and globalisation, the potential of Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) based `hubles' VASTs with two-way as well as data broadcast capabilities and dedicated high speed external gateways is outlined as the second essential step in the integration and globalisation while at the same time, realising a NICNET Info-Highway during the period 1993 to 1997. On the ground segment, special technologies for effectively linking widely separated local area networks, network FAX and image server and multimedia communication services are proposed. Special features for accommodating a large number or close user groups and offering virtual private networks can increase the propensity for the spread of the IT culture as well as prod the growth of demand. During the period from 1986 to 2001, certain concepts of future space data networks are forecast which can propell NICNET to the third level of integration and globalisation. Based on the concept of NICSAT earlier conceptualised, a series of very low cost microsats will be launched for an internally operable dedicated space data network with user end to end communication capability, built in features for promoting specialised value added services, built in access security and expert system based network management. Low cost on-board features, a versatile space link scenario and a low cost ground infrastructure scenario are suggested. The possibility of introducing BISDN via such a satellite cluster are examined. Towards the end of the decade, NICNET will be incrementally converted for providing global intelligent network services over a strong skeleton of data super highway utilising the concept of application gateway in a global intelligent network, the interoperability of the service management systems, service creation environment and operation systems as well as support the interaction of the intelligent network components for intra-network and inter-network cases. The intelligent network architecture proposed is explicitly designed to support personal communication services on a global basis.},

Title = {Multi-source satellite imagery and point of interest data for poverty mapping in East Java, Indonesia: Machine learning and deep learning approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study proposes a novel approach to provide a more granular poverty map in terms of coverage (up to a grid level with the spatial resolution of 1.5 km) with less cost and time to update to support better poverty monitoring. Two poverty estimation model development scenarios using machine learning and deep learning were evaluated in this study. First, the model is constructed using multisource satellite imagery and geospatial point of interest location of economic in-frastructures using zonal statistics feature extraction, which is the proposed approach in this study. The specific multisource satellite imagery to be used as poverty indicators are night-time light intensity (NTL) as an approach to economic activity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as an approach to detect rural areas based on vegetation, built-up index (BUI) as an approach to detect urban areas based on building distribution, normalized difference water index (NDWI) to detect land cover, land surface temperature (LST) as an approach to detecting urban areas based on surface temperature, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an approach to detecting economic activities based on pollution, as well as point of interest (POI) density, and POI distance which show the accessibility of an area. Second, the model is constructed from daytime multiband and nighttime light intensity satellite imagery using the deep learning architecture of Resnet-34 transfer learning feature extraction. In each scenario, we compared the performance of different machine learning (support vector regression/SVR, decision tree regression/DTR, and random forest regression/RFR) algorithms along with deep learning (multiple layer perceptron/MLP and one dimensional-convolutional neural network/ CNN-1D) algorithms. Based on the results of the model development evaluation, the CNN-1D model was chosen as the best model in the first scenario, and the Resnet-34 + MLP model was chosen as the best model in the second scenario. The two best models from the first and second scenarios are then used to predict poverty at the grid level with a spatial resolution of 1.5 km. Based on official poverty data, the estimated poverty mapping built using the CNN-1D model in the first scenario was chosen as the best map with the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) 1.95 and adjusted R2 0.84 at the district level. The results of visual identification revealed that high estimates of poverty are typically found in sparsely inhabited areas surrounded by unoc-cupied land, which is usually an agricultural area. Otherwise, low poverty estimates, on the other hand, are more likely to be found in highly populated regions with convenient access. Our finding is aligned with the official report of Statistics Indonesia, which claims that poverty in rural re-gions is higher than in urban areas.},

Title = {Spatial Estimation and Visualization of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions for Campus Sustainability: The Case of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {A total of 21 metric tons of CO2 per person in terms of per capita emissions from consumption of energy was recorded in Saudi Arabia in 2011 and forecasts have shown that this emission of CO2 is increasing. This poses the threat of climate change and global warming and therefore the need for the sustainability of the country. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Vision for 2030 addresses environmental sustainability that includes a reduction in CO2 emissions as well as diversified economic growth. Universities have been regarded as institutions with significant responsibilities to resolve the issues of sustainability as well as serve as role model to society by implementing a sustainability plan. This study established a spatial evaluation, estimation, and visualization of the CO2 emissions of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia. The data required for this study were collected from the overall coverage of the university campus buildings by transforming raster data from the satellite image to vector data in the form of polygons, and then multiplying the area by the number of floors of the individual building. ArcGIS 10.3((R)) (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) software was used for this campus CO2 emissions evaluation and visualization. The overall estimate of the CO2 emissions for the university campus was 127.7-tons CO2 equivalent. The lowest emission was 0.02-tons CO2 equivalent while the maximum value was 20.9-tons of CO2 equivalent. By this ArcGIS-based evaluation, it is evident that geographically integrated model for campus estimation and visualization of CO2 emissions provides the information for decision makers to develop viable strategies for achieving a higher standard in overall campus sustainability and addressing the issue of climate change.},

Abstract = {Geomorphological information can be combined with decision-support tools to assess landslide hazard and risk. A heuristic model was applied to a rural municipality in eastern Cuba. The study is based on a terrain mapping units (TMU) map, generated at 1:50,000 scale by interpretation of aerial photos, satellite images and field data. Information describing 603 terrain units was collected in a database. Landslide areas were mapped in detail to classify the different failure types and parts. Three major landslide regions are recognized in the study area: coastal hills with rockfalls, shallow debris flows and old rotational rockslides denudational slopes in limestone, with very large deep-seated rockslides related to tectonic activity and the Sierra de Caujeri scarp, with large rockslides. The Caujeri scarp presents the highest hazard, with recent landslides and various signs of active processes. The different landforms and the causative factors for landslides were analyzed and used to develop the heuristic model. The model is based on weights assigned by expert judgment and organized in a number of components such as slope angle, internal relief, slope shape, geological formation, active faults, distance to drainage, distance to springs, geomorphological subunits and existing landslide zones. From these variables a hierarchical heuristic model was applied in which three levels of weights were designed for classes, variables, and criteria. The model combines all weights into a single hazard value for each pixel of the landslide hazard map. The hazard map was then divided by two scales, one with three classes for disaster managers and one with 10 detailed hazard classes for technical staff The range of weight values and the number of existing landslides is registered for each class. The resulting increasing landslide density with higher hazard classes indicates that the output map is reliable. The landslide hazard map was used in combination with existing information on buildings and infrastructure to prepare a qualitative risk map. The complete lack of historical landslide information and geotechnical data precludes the development of quantitative deterministic or probabilistic models. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Seabuckthorn (Hippophae sp.), belonging to Elaeagnaceae, is a thorny, dioecious bush growing wild in the cold and dry regions of Indian Himalayas mainly in Ladakh (J\&K), Lahaul- Spiti and Kinnaur (HP), Kumaon-Garhwal (Uttranchal) and Sikkim/Arunachal Pradesh in the North-East region. The ripe fruits of seabuckthorn are a rich source of vitamins (A, B, C, and K\&E) with antioxidant and anti stress properties. The plant has medicinal and fodder value besides food and cosmetics properties. However, no attention has been given towards the scientific conservation, propagation and utilization of this valuable plant. Keeping the above in view, Field Research Laboratory (DRDO), located at an altitude of 11500 ft above the MSL, undertook several research and development projects on seabuckthorn from 1992 to promote cultivation and utilization of seabuckthorn for human welfare. Satellite imaginary conducted to estimate the naturally growing areas of seabuckthorn had revealed 11,500 ha pure area of seabuckthorn in the Ladakh region. However, the total area of seabuckthorn vegetation is around 30,000 ha in Ladakh. Extensive explorations have been conducted to identify the promising genetic diversity in the crop in the region which has considerable variation in the physicochemical properties of the fruits. Three promising selections have been made from the natural population and Field genmaile banks have been established to conserve this natural diversity. In order to popularize scientific cultivation of this valuable plant, propagation through seeds, stem cuttings (using PBRs) and suckers, has been standardized. Efforts are also in progress to develop the protocols for in vitro propagation of seabuckthorn. Model seabuckthorn orchards have been established using different planting systems/distances and by maintaining proper male: female plant ratio. The laboratory has developed and patented the process for preparation of nutritive beverage from seabuckthorn fruits which has been commercialized by private vendors and products are readily available in Indian market. The process for preparation of other food products such as jam, pickle, puree, blended/spiced beverages, wine etc have also been developed and are in the process of being patented and commercialized. The need of the hour is to standardize canopy/orchard management practices, post harvest management/value addition techniques, scientific method of harvesting and adopting modern breeding approaches for crop improvement of seabuckthorn to harness its food and medicinal properties for human welfare.},

Title = {MODIS sensors can monitor spatiotemporal trends in fog and low cloud cover at 1 km spatial resolution along the U.S. Pacific Coast},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) provide critical moisture for ecosystems along the Pacific Coast during the summer months and it is currently unclear how climate change has affected FLCC occurrence. Additionally, FLCC impacts visibility and transportation safety for both road and air traffic. As such, a method for the monitoring of FLCC is necessary to inform land management decisions for fog-obligate species and to improve transportation safety, among other applications. Several gaps exist in current FLCC detection methodologies and while the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor has previously been used to detect fog, its utility has not been validated. In this study, we create a 20 year (2000-2020) FLCC dataset using the Terra MODIS cloud flags and examine its effectiveness in detecting daily and monthly FLCC presence along the California and southern Oregon coast for the summer months (June-September). We validate the accuracy of this method using an existing FLCC dataset derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations collected at 15 min intervals from 2000 to 2009. The two FLCC datasets have a strong linear relationship for FLCC frequency for each summer month, with an average r(2) of 0.82 and p-value of < 0.01. This strong relationship demonstrates the ability of Terra MODIS to reliably and accurately detect FLCC. Finally, we demonstrate a case study application of our FLCC dataset in a time series analysis over five coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) state parks in the Big Sur region of coastal California. This case study highlights the benefits provided by a 1 km resolution FLCC dataset for ecological applications and for monitoring spatiotemporal FLCC patterns across summer months over two decades. Our case study results showed that the number of foggy days fluctuates considerably year-to-year with no discernible positive or negative trend occurring between 2000 and 2020. Finally, we present a freely-accessible Google Earth Engine application to view and download the monthly FLCC data for all summer months for the years 2000-2020. The methods and dataset presented in this paper provide a means for efficient, daily FLCC monitoring at 1 km(2) resolution, as well as the capacity for historical FLCC analyses.},

Abstract = {At the 25th Annual European Haemophilia Consortium (EHC) Congress held in Prague, Czech Republic, in October 2012, Pfizer sponsored a satellite symposium entitled: Understanding Health Outcomes: Focus on Haemophilia'. Co-chaired by Brian O'Mahony (President of the EHC) and Brian Colvin (Director Medical and Scientific Affairs Haemophilia, Pfizer, Europe), the symposium examined the role of outcomes in haemophilia care in an age of evidence-based medicine. The current global economic recession has inevitably directed the spotlight of governments and health economists towards the cost of healthcare. Now is the time to focus on which outcome measures are important to collect in order to validate these costs, and how to standardise collection and reporting measures to support services and patient care. Using the United Kingdom (UK) as a case study, where initiatives in data collection and reporting are being trialled, Gerry Dolan opened the discussion by highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to ensuring success. Looking at specific measures of haemophilia healthcare, Carlo Martinoli focused on joint scores as a clinical outcome measure that can be systematically collected, and the role of ultrasound in bringing joint assessment into the hands of the haemophilia treater at the bedside'. Brian O'Mahony then brought the discussion full circle by highlighting the role of the patient in the multidisciplinary care team and the importance of the patient voice in the assessment and critical examination of health outcomes by payers and government bodies. The meeting closed by summarising the importance of collaboration between patients and their carers; physicians; members of the healthcare team; and budget holders in advancing haemophilia care, to provide the best possible care with optimum long-term outcomes for people with haemophilia.},

Title = {Ageing mallee eucalypt vegetation after fire: insights for successional trajectories in semi-arid mallee ecosystems},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},

Pages = {363-372},
Abstract = {A critical requirement in the ecological management of fire is knowledge of the age-class distribution of the vegetation. Such knowledge is important because it underpins the distribution of ecological features important to plants and animals including retreat sites, food sources and foraging microhabitats. However, in many regions, knowledge of the age-class distribution of vegetation is severely constrained by the limited data available on fire history. Much fire-history mapping is restricted to post-1972 fires, following satellite imagery becoming widely available. To investigate fire history in the semi-arid Murray Mallee region in southern Australia, we developed regression models for six species of mallee eucalypt (Eucalyptus oleosa F. Muell. ex. Miq. subsp. oleosa, E. leptophylla F. Muell. ex. Miq., E. dumosa J. Oxley, E. costata subsp. murrayana L. A. S. Johnson \& K. D. Hill, E. gracilis F. Muell. and E. socialis F. Muell. ex. Miq.) to quantify the relationship between mean stem diameter and stem age (indicated by fire-year) at sites of known time since fire. We then used these models to predict mean stem age, and thus infer fire-year, for sites where the time since fire was not known. Validation of the models with independent data revealed a highly significant correlation between the actual and predicted time since fire (r = 0.71, P < 0.001, n = 88), confirming the utility of this method for ageing stands of mallee eucalypt vegetation. Validation data suggest the models provide a conservative estimate of the age of a site (i.e. they may under-estimate the minimum age of sites >35 years since fire). Nevertheless, this approach enables examination of post-fire chronosequences in semi-arid mallee ecosystems to be extended from 35 years post-fire to over 100 years. The predicted ages identified for mallee stands imply a need for redefining what is meant by `old-growth' mallee, and challenges current perceptions of an over-abundance of `long-unburnt' mallee vegetation. Given the strong influence of fire on semi-arid mallee vegetation, this approach offers the potential for a better understanding of long-term successional dynamics and the status of biota in an ecosystem that encompasses more than 250 000 km(2) of southern Australia.},

Abstract = {For both the positive economic benefit and the negative ecological impact of the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in tropical developing countries, it is significant to achieve accurate detection for oil palm trees in large-scale areas. Especially, growing status observation and smart oil palm plantation management enabled by such accurate detections would improve plantation planning, oil palm yield, and reduce manpower and consumption of fertilizer. Although existing studies have already reached a high accuracy in oil palm tree detection, rare attention has been paid to automated observation of each single oil palm tree's growing status. Nowadays, with its high spatial resolution and low cost, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has become a promising tool for monitoring the growing status of individual oil palms. However, the accuracy is still a challenging issue because of the extreme imbalance and high similarity between different classes. In this paper, we propose a Multi-class Oil PAlm Detection approach (MOPAD) to reap both accurate detection of oil palm trees and accurate monitoring of their growing status. Based on Faster RCNN, MOPAD combines a Refined Pyramid Feature (RPF) module and a hybrid class-balanced loss module to achieve satisfying observation of the growing status for individual oil palms. The former takes advantage of multi-level features to distinguish similar classes and detect small oil palms, and the latter effectively resolves the problem of extremely imbalanced samples. Moreover, we elaborately analyze the distribution of different kinds of oil palms, and propose a practical workflow for detecting oil palm vacancy. We evaluate MOPAD using three large-scale UAV images photographed in two sites in Indonesia (denoted by Site 1 and Site 2), containing 363,877 oil palms of five categories: healthy palms, dead palms, mismanaged palms, smallish palms and yellowish palms. Our proposed MOPAD achieves an F1-score of 87.91\% (Site 1) and 99.04\% (Site 2) for overall oil palm tree detection, and outperforms other state-of-the-art object detection methods by a remarkable margin of 10.37-17.09\% and 8.14\%-21.32\% with respect to the average F1score for multi-class oil palm detection in Site 1 and Site 2, respectively. Our method demonstrates excellent potential for individual oil palm tree detection and observation of growing status from UAV images, leading to more precise and efficient management of oil palm plantations.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, China has experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization. As cities have expanded rapidly, the spatial patterns of rural settlements also changed significantly. This study uses land use data from satellite imagery interpretation, socioeconomic statistics, and field survey data, together with techniques including landscape pattern analysis, kernel density estimation, and spatial measurement models, to analyze the evolving spatial patterns of rural settlements influencing factors in China from 1995 to 2015. The results indicate the following: First, China's rural settlements experienced significant changes in the period 1995-2015, as 88.92\% of Prefectural-level administrative district units saw an increase in rural settlement area, with total settlement size increasing by 1.35 million hectares, and settlement area sprawl index values can be summarized as ``high in the west and low in the east{''}. Second, in the two-decade study period, the population agglomeration capacity of rural settlements in China continuously weakened, and the shape and structure of rural settlement became more complex and irregular. The scale and scope of the disappearance of rural settlement areas in the northeast and southeast regions was relatively drastic, and the kernel density value of settlements dropped significantly. Third, the increase in rural settlement land area is concentrated in low-altitude and low-slope areas, with a significant tendency to be near water and roads. Fourth, social and economic factors, such as per capita net income of rural residents, the proportion of the population employed in agriculture, the size and structure of the permanent rural population, local fiscal revenue, and urbanization level, are the main factors that cause changes of rural settlement patterns. The results of this study can serve as a reference for promoting regional rural sustainable development policies and advancing rural spatial governance and comprehensive revitalization.},

Abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation is sensitive to climate change and human activities. Its spatial-temporal changes also affect the ecological and social environment. In this paper, we considered the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to study the spatio-temporal vegetation patterns. The detailed analysis of a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were carried out through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Our results show a slow and tortuous upward trend in the average leaf area index (LAI) in the study region for the periods 2001-2020. Specifically, Beijing had the highest LAI value, with an average of 1.64 over twenty years, followed by Hebei (1.30) and Tianjin (1.04). Among different vegetation types, forests had the highest normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the range of 0.62-0.78, followed by shrubland (0.58-0.75), grassland (0.34-0.66), and cropland (0.38-0.54) over the years. Spatially, compared to the whole study area, index value in the northwestern part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region increased greatly in many areas, such as northwest Beijing, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou, indicating a significant ecological optimization. Meanwhile, there was ecological degradation in the middle and southeast regions, from Tangshan southeastward to Handan, crossing Tianjin, Langfang, the east part of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and the west part of Cangzhou. Air temperature and precipitation were positively and significantly correlated with net primary production (NPP) and precipitation stood out as a key driver. Additionally, an intensification of the urbanization rate will negatively impact the vegetation NPP, with the shrubland and forest being affected most relative to the cropland.},

Abstract = {Purpose The research aims to provide the basis for a better understanding of the internationalization of higher education in Vietnam. First, it examines Vietnam's higher education reforms and policy/ legal frameworks for the promotion of internationalization since the implementation of Doi Moi in 1986. Secondly, it analyzes the internationalization activities at the national and institutional levels. At both levels, the internationalization activities are categorized into internationalization at home and cross borders (Knight, 2012). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges Vietnamese HE is facing and presents policy directions. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a case study research strategy to examine and gain understanding of internationalization of higher education in Vietnam as a phenomenon. The study collected detailed information using a variety of data collection procedures over a period of time. First, it analyzes Vietnam's higher education reforms as well as policy and legal framework for the promotion of internationalization. Then, using Knight's framework, the study analyzed the internationalization at home and crossborder educational activities at the national and institutional levels. At the national level, strategic policy goals and programs were explored. Then, it chose Vietnam National University- Hanoi as a institutional case to learn its institutional strategies on cross border programs and mobility, reputation building, research cooperation. Findings Vietnam has continuously reformed its legal and policy framework of higher education to better integrate into the global higher education market and also to meet the national demand for economic development. Predominant rationale for Vietnam to engage in crossborder programs is for brain development, specifically in the academics and public sector. Meanwhile internationalization at home is driven by (1) international programs and universities and (2) initiative to enhance competitiveness of its higher education institutes. Vietnam hosts different models of international universities, including classical, satellite and co-founded. However, issues and challenges remain, such as poor lack of systematic cooperation and coordination at the governmental level, retaining talents, and finally finances. Originality/value Written for the special edition on Internationalization of Higher Education in the Era of SDGs: Asia-Pacific Perspective, the study aims to provide a basis for understanding the current situation of internationalization higher education in Vietnam and how it compares to its partners in the region. This study is unique as it provides a two-layer analysis, at the national and institutional levels capturing macro and micro perspectives in one scene. In addition, this study includes rich empirical data, which was rare in previous literature due to limited access.},

Abstract = {Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have teamed together to demonstrate the multimission capabilities of commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios. Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial robots providing services and access that was never before considered valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance, rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy. We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature. Additional customized, missioncentric sensors may be added to the systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite communications for navigation and mission data transfer. Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while characterizing the operating conditions for each test series. ``Autonomy{''} is a capability that means different things to different people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system to react to new information, whether from external source or self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance. Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives. We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.},

Title = {Spatial-Temporal Pattern Evolution of Xi'an Metropolitan Area Using DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS Nighttime Light Data},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {A metropolitan area provides valuable space for economic development, and it is the home on which human beings depend for their survival. However, metropolitan areas are often faced with prominent problems caused by the natural environment and city layout. Therefore, understanding metropolitan areas' spatial-temporal pattern evolution is of vital significance for medium-to-long-term city growth. This study uses the nighttime light data to monitor the urban pattern evolution of the Xi'an Metropolitan Area (XMA) over the past 30 years. The study results suggest that the continuity correction and consistency correction used in this study can construct a stable long-term, multi-source nighttime light dataset and, at the same time, accurately reflect the changes in the urban pattern. The determination coefficient between gross domestic product (GDP) and total nighttime light (TNL) reached 0.90; the nighttime light index (NLI) of the XMA is characterized by high spatial heterogeneity. The NLI of the core areas has been saturated before 2004, while the CNLI value of the peripheral Chang'an District was 0.31 by 2021. Urban land expanded in all directions, with an average expansion rate of 12.9\% and an expansion intensity of 2.6\%. The nighttime light gravity center generally shifted towards southwest, from (108.915 degrees E, 34.355 degrees N) in 1992 to (108.922 degrees E, 34.343 degrees N) in 2021. The urban pattern of the metropolitan area is influenced by the natural environment, and the southwest and northeast directions will be the primary development directions in the future. The local development policy is a crucial driving factor in the urban pattern evolution, which significantly affects the location and intensity of urban expansion; the center of gravity of the XMA has different migration directions in different periods, meaning that the development of the metropolitan area tends to be balanced.},

Title = {The Impact of China's Grain for Green Program on Rural Economy and Precipitation: A Case Study of Yan River Basin in the Loess Plateau},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Large-scale deforestation and abandoned planting will bring about the destruction of the ecological environment and the deterioration of the climate. In 1999, China initiated its ``Grain for Green{''} Program (GGP) to improve the ecological environment, control soil erosion, and adjust the agricultural industrial structure to promote the sustainable development of the rural economy. In this paper, economic statistics, rainfall, and remote sensing data are used to analyze the impact of the GGP on agricultural and rural economic development and regional precipitation in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau. The results show that since the implementation of the program, the employment structure of the labor force has changed and the regional economic growth and farmers' income have increased. From 2000 to 2016, the total gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita GDP of the Yan River Basin increased. The conversion of large-scale sloping farmland to forestry and grassland resulted in the decrease of farmland area and the increase of forestry area. The maximum, minimum, and mean value of vegetation coverage increased year by year. With the increase of vegetation coverage, the surface roughness, soil water content, and evapotranspiration improved and annual average precipitation grew significantly after the implementation of the program (2000 to 2018). From 1970 to the implementation of the project (1999), the annual average rainfall decreased at the trough from 1988 to 1999, and there was an overall upward trend from 1970 to 2018. The GGP has an important impact on the economy and people's income in the Yan River Basin, and the vegetation change caused by the variation of land use types has a certain impact on regional rainfall. Under the background of global and regional climate change, it is of great significance to fully understand the impacts of vegetation conversion on climate and its mechanism for objective assessment of driving factors in regional and global climate, as well as for scientific planning of future land use.},

Title = {County-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and sequestration in China during 1997-2017},

Abstract = {With the implementation of China's top-down CO2 emissions reduction strategy, the regional differences should be considered. As the most basic governmental unit in China, counties could better capture the regional heterogeneity than provinces and prefecture-level city, and county-level CO2 emissions could be used for the development of strategic policies tailored to local conditions. However, most of the previous accounts of CO2 emissions in China have only focused on the national, provincial, or city levels, owing to limited methods and smaller-scale data. In this study, a particle swarm optimization-back propagation (PSO-BP) algorithm was employed to unify the scale of DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS satellite imagery and estimate the CO2 emissions in 2,735 Chinese counties during 1997-2017. Moreover, as vegetation has a significant ability to sequester and reduce CO2 emissions, we calculated the county-level carbon sequestration value of terrestrial vegetation. The results presented here can contribute to existing data gaps and enable the development of strategies to reduce CO2 emissions in China.},

Title = {Assessing the Potential of Rural Settlement Land Consolidation in China: A Method Based on Comprehensive Evaluation of Restricted Factors},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rural settlement land consolidation potential calculation is the basic work of land consolidation. An accurate potential is essential to rural development planners and policy makers as a project target or prediction. The traditional calculation methods include the per capita/household construction land method, idle rural residential land method, and comprehensive evaluation method. Though there have been some improvements, the potential for calculation methods on a national level is still limited. This article illustrates a new method for calculating the consolidation potential of rural settlement land, based on field data and the restructuring restrictions applicable to each rural land parcel in China. The field data was from Shandong Province because it lies within the country's biggest grain-producing area with the largest distribution density of rural settlements. It is an excellent representative sample for rural settlement land consolidation, offering a microcosm of rural development in China. For the study's comprehensive evaluation system, due to the lack of nationwide field survey data, the potential of Shandong Province was chosen as the standard value. We selected indicators concerning land resources, depopulation, transportation accessibility, local economic development, urbanization, and natural conditions to build an evaluation system. We then calculated the potential of each province according to their coefficients and field data from Shandong Province. Every province except Taiwan (for which no data were available) was divided into five zones for rural settlement land consolidation: the most-suitable zone, suitable zone, general zone, restricted zone, and most-restricted zone. The total rate of land consolidation is estimated at 0.24 for 2010 and forecast at 0.33 for 2020, while those years' respective consolidation potentials are 32,777.92 km(2) and 44,707.81 km(2). The rate is the total rural settlement land before land consolidation divided by added cultivated land after consolidation. The higher the rate, more effective the land consolidation is.},

Title = {Increasing fragmentation and squeezing of coastal wetlands: Status, drivers, and sustainable protection from the perspective of remote sensing},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {811},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Coastal wetlands arc of great ecological and economic value but face significant degradation and losses because of human activities. Nevertheless, the changes in spatiotcmporal landscape patterns, which have occurred as a result of coastal wetland losses, have not been well documented under the rapid urbanization in coastal zones. In this study, an algorithm based on periodic tidal inundations and full time-series indices was developed to map the detailed status and trends in the coastal wetlands in Fujian Province from 1994 to 2018 by using more than archived 5000 Landsat images. The results showed that in 2018, there were 1136.56 km(2) of coastal wetlands along the coast of Fujian with an overall accuracy of 95.63\%, which were mainly distributed in estuaries and bays. These coastal wetlands consisted of tidal flats, low marshes, and high marshes with proportions of 84.91\%, 13.05\%, and 2.04\%, respectively. An unprecedented loss of coastal wetlands has occurred in Fujian Province, with an annual rate of 15.44 km(2)/a from 1994 to 2018. Many coastal wetlands were reclaimed, dredged, and converted into inland areas for aquaculture ponds, ports, and built-up areas in different urbanization periods, which has led to a great loss of coastal spaces with an area of 476.87 km(2). The interplay between the loss of coastal wetlands and seaward urbanization will lead to severe fragmentation and squeezing effects in the coastal zone and will weaken the coastal protection from marine disasters that is provided by coastal wetlands. Therefore, we conceived two conceptional frameworks for sustainable coastal protection based on the current situations of the coastal communities to provide a trade-off between economic development and the protection of coastal developing countries in the world.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Coastlines and estuaries as one of the most dynamic systems in the marine environment are influenced by not only natural factors but also various anthropogenic activities, but there have been limited comprehensive studies on the relationship between coastline variation and anthropogenic activities at the watershed and local scales. The Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in China has experienced remarkable coastline variation along with rapid economic development and urbanization. In this study, the coastline of the PRE was extracted using Landsat images during 1987-2017, and the impacts of multiple factors on coastline variation were explored with correlation analysis and regression analysis. Results suggested coastlines of the PRE demonstrated a clear expanding trend over recent decades, and the coastline length had increased by 74.81 km and the land area had increased by 679.25 km(2) by 2017, and results also showed rapid coastline variation during 1987-2004 and relatively slow variation during 2004-2017. Artificial coastlines accounted for 80.90\% of the total coastline length in 2017, while natural coastlines accounted for only 19.10\%. In addition, reduction in the sand content caused by construction of reservoirs and river dredging in upstream areas played a dominant role in affecting natural coastline variation in the PRE, especially on the west coast. Moreover, the artificial coastline in the study area expanded quickly due to the influence of various human activities, among which the urbanization and land reclamation for aquaculture played a dominant role in affecting the artificial coastline variation on the east and west coasts, respectively. Results of this study have important value for understanding the individual and joint effects of various human activities on coastline variation and can provide important reference information for the sustainable management of the PRE as well as other estuaries.},

Title = {Origin and foraging ecology of male loggerhead sea turtles from southern Brazil revealed by genetic and stable isotope analysis},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},

Abstract = {The southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWA) represents an important foraging ground for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Most studies at the region have focused on adult females and juveniles, and little is known about males. Here, we present the first insights about origin and foraging ecology of male loggerheads from the SWA, by integrating genetic and stable isotope analysis (SIA). Skin samples were obtained from 26 males stranded along the southern coast of Brazil (from 31 degrees 21S-51 degrees 05W to 33 degrees 44S-53 degrees 22W), from February 2014 to March 2017. Samples of potential food sources (benthic and pelagic organisms) were also collected for SIA. A fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced and a Bayesian Mixed Stock Analysis was performed to estimate natal origins of male loggerheads. Bayesian Stable Isotope Mixing Models were fitted to assess the relative contribution of different food sources assimilated by males. Most males exhibit endemic haplotypes from Brazilian rookeries, followed by a low frequency of a haplotype from the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivaea) haplotype, showing hybridization. SIA showed life stage-related differences in feeding and habitat use by male loggerheads, with benthic invertebrates dominating the diet of adults, while pelagic prey items dominated the diet of juveniles. Our findings demonstrate the importance of southern Brazil neritic and oceanic habitats for male loggerheads and highlight the value of this area for the maintenance of SWA reproductive management units, which are the main contributors to these feeding aggregations.},

Title = {The annual cycle for whimbrel populations using the Western Atlantic Flyway},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {12},

Abstract = {Many long-distance migratory birds use habitats that are scattered across continents and confront hazards throughout the annual cycle that may be population-limiting. Identifying where and when populations spend their time is fundamental to effective management. We tracked 34 adult whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from two breeding populations (Mackenzie Delta and Hudson Bay) with satellite transmitters to document the structure of their annual cycles. The two populations differed in their use of migratory pathways and their seasonal schedules. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels made long (22,800 km) loop migrations with different autumn and spring routes. Hudson Bay whimbrels made shorter (17,500 km) and more direct migrations along the same route during autumn and spring. The two populations overlap on the winter grounds and within one spring staging area. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels left the breeding ground, arrived on winter grounds, left winter grounds and arrived on spring staging areas earlier compared to whimbrels from Hudson Bay. For both populations, migration speed was significantly higher during spring compared to autumn migration. Faster migration was achieved by having fewer and shorter stopovers en route. We identified five migratory staging areas including four that were used during autumn and two that were used during spring. Whimbrels tracked for multiple years had high (98\%) fidelity to staging areas. We documented dozens of locations where birds stopped for short periods along nearly all migration routes. The consistent use of very few staging areas suggests that these areas are integral to the annual cycle of both populations and have high conservation value.},

Title = {Modeling the global distribution of Culicoides imicola: an Ensemble approach},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Culicoides imicola is a midge species serving as vector for a number of viral diseases of livestock, including Bluetongue, and African Horse Sickness. C. imicola is also known to transmit Schmallenberg virus experimentally. E nvironmental and demographic factors may impose rapid changes on the global distribution of C. imicola and aid introduction into new areas. The aim of this study is to predict the global distribution of C. imicola using an ensemble modeling approach by combining climatic, livestock distribution and land cover covariates, together with a comprehensive global dataset of geo-positioned occurrence points for C. imicola. Thirty individual models were generated by `biomod2', with 21 models scoring a true skill statistic (TSS) > 0.8. These 21 models incorporated weighted runs from eight of ten algorithms and were used to create a final ensemble model. The ensemble model performed very well (TSS = 0.898 and ROC = 0.991) and indicated high environmental suitability for C. imicola in the tropics and subtropics. The habitat suitability for C. imicola spans from South Africa to southern Europe and from southern USA to southern China. The distribution of C. imicola is mainly constrained by climatic factors. In the ensemble model, mean annual minimum temperature had the highest overall contribution (42.9\%), followed by mean annual maximum temperature (21.1\%), solar radiation (13.6\%), annual precipitation (11\%), livestock distribution (6.2\%), vapor pressure (3.4\%), wind speed (0.8\%), and land cover (0.1\%). The present study provides the most up-to-date predictive maps of the potential distributions of C. imicola and should be of great value for decision making at global and regional scales.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the activity based on the use of the microblogging Twitter for a better comprehension of the treated topics in the subject Management of Technology Projects. The development of the course is focused in ITIL (a methodology of ICT Services Management), which contents it is on the Web and is reviewed at the Master Classes. Later, the concepts viewed in the classes and reviewed on the Web, are analyzed by the students researching for examples of common life and socializing on Twitter through a HashTag. Students, through a virtual, common space for them, unfold theirselves with a better agility than through a virtual space based on a class. This allows a bigger density of participations in forums, which contributes with the goals of the class. Besides, interacting in an open space, there is a chance that outsider people enrich the developed forums, letting a better comprehension of the treated topics. The students' participations on Twitter must have a specific Hashtag, so they can be reviewed and a feedback can be done. Besides, the teacher reviews each one of the tweets, deciding if they provide worth value or not, to the class. Periodically a summary of the quantity of participations is done, and a weekly continuity also. As the results of this experience, it is highlighted the excellent response of the students about the activity, the development of the writing quality in the virtual forums and a better comprehension of the topics reviewed at the classes.},

Abstract = {The assessment of conservation values and risks to habitat biological diversity and health is herein addressed based on the occurrence of threatened species within ecotype mosaics and incorporating metrics related to current human disturbances. This assessment is made within a view of biological integrity and ecosystem health. Within the Map of Italian Nature project, that started as a result of Italian national law n. 394/91, such assessments are currently applied to approximately 1.5 million hectares in order to establish new reserves and protected areas, based on their ``natural values{''} and ``fragility{''} at scales in which humans generally influence the condition of the landscape, to get a more representative network of regional biological diversity. Risk and value assessments, based on distribution of species and habitats most threatened with extinction and reduction, are made in reference to the coordination of information on the environment (CORINE) habitat mosaics. To this purpose, digital thematic maps are generated as geographic information systems (GIS) coverages in polygonal (vector) format from satellite, airborne, and observed distribution data of 1)existing land cover habitat types and biodiversity component distributions, and 2) different kinds of man-induced disturbance. Habitat fragility is estimated either as ``potential,{''} through a simple conceptual model relating fragility to sensitivity and human disturbance, or as ``displayed,{''} inferred from habitat loss. Habitat sensitivity is used to compare biological health within habitat types. The Map of Italian Nature project aims at identifying gaps in the existing reserve network, and is very akin to the gap analysis approach. Map of Italian Nature intends to protect landscape mosaics at the broader scale, based on gaps in protection and threats while including finer scale data on threatened species to make sure they do not fall through the cracks. Results for a pilot study area are presented and the relevance of the approach to biological health and integrity assessments is discussed.},

Abstract = {Significant relationship between tree height and ALS-derived topography was shown. Taller trees were found on slopes < 10A degrees and southerly aspects. Potential value of ALS in forest management applications was defined. Accurate information on tree height distribution can provide a better understanding of forest productivity and biomass estimation. Airborne light detection and ranging remote sensing, also known as airborne laser scanning (ALS), has proven to be an effective tool for deriving tree height information in forests. While tree height has been reported to vary in response to many environmental factors, few researchers have demonstrated the effect of topography on tree height variation using ALS data. This study investigated the relationship between tree height variation and ALS-derived topographic aspect and slope factors within two even-aged radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) plantation sites in Nundle, New South Wales, Australia. A total of 447 trees was sampled from 77 plots in two plantation age classes: 193 trees from a 34-year-old site and 254 trees from a 9-year-old site. ALS height estimates were highly correlated with field heights (R (2) = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.66 for 2002 and R (2) = 0.87 and RMSE = 1.49 for 1977 sites). ALS-derived slope and aspect metrics were shown to have a significant relationship with height variation across the stands. The slope (P < 0.01) and aspect (P < 0.001) were significant in the mixed linear models. Overall taller trees were found on slopes below 10A degrees and on southerly aspects, while shorter trees dominated steeper slopes (> 20A degrees) and on northerly aspects. However, aspect gradient appeared to have more significant effect on tree heights than slope classes. These results were further verified using an additional 2,000 randomly located trees sampled across the plantations. The study demonstrates a significant relationship between tree height variation and ALS-derived ground aspect and slope categories which may have potential benefits for improving current wood resource inventories and future productivity models.},

Abstract = {Substantial real cases can be formed from disease-specific online medical inquiry texts. Therefore, user preferences can constitute potentially rich commercial medical value and provide decision support for medical service recommendations. It is necessary to mine user preferences in disease-specific online medical inquiry texts. However, user preferences will change with cognitive behavior decisions in the context of disease-specific inquiry texts. More importantly, the context of disease-specific online inquiry texts in which user preferences are located will affect users' cognitive behavior decisions in real time. However, the existing preference access methods have relatively low precision since they fail to consider the inherent connection between different users' cognitive behaviors in various contexts and their preferences. We expanded the contextual perception preference model to propose a cognitive-behavior-based method to assess user preference. The contextual information (in online medical inquiry texts on various disease topics) and the impacts of user and text attributes on their cognitive behaviors were abstracted into concept models (including level, usefulness, risk, and effectiveness cognition) to obtain the mutual influences and adjusted relationships. Moreover, more accurate user cognition references were obtained within the multidimensional text space and multidimensional disease space. Based on a large-volume real-world dataset, our experiments revealed the AP@R as the evaluation standard. The method proposed in this article, compared with the contextual perception and ELPCAP algorithms, significantly improves the precision of preference prediction after the addition of cognitive behaviors, suggesting that the method can effectively mine the user cognitive behavior-preference relationships.},

Title = {Radar imaging mechanism of marine sand waves at very low grazing angle illumination caused by unique hydrodynamic interactions},

Abstract = {{[}1] The investigations carried out between 2002 and 2004 during six field experiments within the Operational Radar and Optical Mapping in monitoring hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and environmental parameters for coastal management (OROMA) project aimed to improve the effectiveness of new remote sensing monitoring technologies such as shipborne imaging radars in coastal waters. The coastal monitoring radar of the GKSS Research Center, Geesthacht, Germany, is based on a Kelvin Hughes RSR 1000 X band (9.42 GHz) vertical (VV) polarized river radar and was mounted on board the research vessel Ludwig Prandtl during the experiments in the Lister Tief, a tidal inlet of the German Bight in the North Sea. The important progress realized in this investigation is the availability of calibrated X band radar data. Another central point of the study is to demonstrate the applicability of the quasi-specular scattering theory in combination with the weak hydrodynamic interaction theory for the radar imaging mechanism of the seabed. Radar data have been taken at very low grazing angles <= 2.6 degrees of flood and ebb tide-oriented sand wave signatures at the sea surface during ebb tidal current phases. Current speeds perpendicular to the sand wave crest <= 0.6 m s(-1) have been measured at wind speeds <= 4.5 m s(-1) and water depths <= 25 m. The difference between the maximum measured and simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation of the ebb tide-oriented sand wave is 27\%. For the flood tide-oriented sand wave, a difference of 21\% has been calculated. The difference between the minimum measured and simulated NRCS modulation of the ebb tide-oriented sand wave is 10\%, and for the flood tide-oriented sand wave, a value of 43\% has been derived. Phases of measured and simulated NRCS modulations correspond to asymmetric sand wave slopes. The results of the simulated NRCS modulation show the qualitative trend but do not always quantitatively match the measured NRCS modulation profiles because the quasi-specular scattering theory at very low grazing angle is a first-order theory.},

Title = {Radius based domain clustering for WiFi indoor positioning},
Journal = {SENSOR REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-60},
Abstract = {Purpose - Nowadays, WiFi indoor positioning based on received signal strength (RSS) becomes a research hotspot due to its low cost and ease of deployment characteristics. To further improve the performance of WiFi indoor positioning based on RSS, this paper aims to propose a novel position estimation strategy which is called radius-based domain clustering (RDC). This domain clustering technology aims to avoid the issue of access point (AP) selection. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed positioning approach uses each individual AP of all available APs to estimate the position of target point. Then, according to circular error probable, the authors search the decision domain which has the 50 per cent of the intermediate position estimates and minimize the radius of a circle via a RDC algorithm. The final estimate of the position of target point is obtained by averaging intermediate position estimates in the decision domain. Findings - Experiments are conducted, and comparison between the different position estimation strategies demonstrates that the new method has a better location estimation accuracy and reliability. Research limitations/implications - Weighted k nearest neighbor approach and Naive Bayes Classifier method are two classic position estimation strategies for location determination using WiFi fingerprinting. Both of the two strategies are affected by AP selection strategies and inappropriate selection of APs may degrade positioning performance considerably. Practical implications - The RDC positioning approach can improve the performance of WiFi indoor positioning, and the issue of AP selection and related drawbacks is avoided. Social implications - The RSS-based effective WiFi indoor positioning system can makes up for the indoor positioning weaknesses of global navigation satellite system. Many indoor location-based services can be encouraged with the effective and low-cost positioning technology. Originality/value - A novel position estimation strategy is introduced to avoid the AP selection problem in RSS-based WiFi indoor positioning technology, and the domain clustering technology is proposed to obtain a better accuracy and reliability.},

Title = {Enhancing catch-and-release science with biotelemetry},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Catch-and-release (C\&R) angling is widely practised by anglers and is a common fisheries management strategy or is a by-product of harvest regulations. Accordingly, there is a growing body of research that examines not only the mortality associated with C\&R, but also the sublethal physiological and behavioural consequences. Biotelemetry offers a powerful means of remotely monitoring the behaviour, physiology and mortality of fish caught and released in their natural environment, but we contend that its usefulness is still underappreciated by scholars and managers. In this study, we review the applications of biotelemetry in C\&R science, identify novel research directions, opportunities and challenges. There are now about 250 C\&R studies but only one quarter of these utilize biotelemetry. In fact, almost all of the C\&R studies that have used biotelemetry have been conducted within the last decade. We found that the majority of C\&R telemetry studies used either radio or acoustic telemetry, while comparatively few studies have used satellite technologies. Most C\&R biotelemetry studies have been used to assess mortality rates, behavioural impairments or to evaluate the effects of displacement on fish. A small fraction of studies (< 8\%) have used physiological sensors despite the fact that these tools are highly applicable to understanding the multiple sublethal consequences of C\&R and are useful for providing mechanistic insights into endpoints such as death. We conclude that C\&R science has the potential to benefit greatly from biotelemetry technology, particularly with respect to providing more robust short-term and delayed mortality estimates and adopting a more integrative and comparative approach to understanding the lethal and sublethal impacts of C\&R. However, there are still a number of challenges including (i) the need for appropriate controls and methodological approaches, (ii) the need for accounting for tagging and handling stress and mortality, and (iii) the need for certainty in assessing mortality. However, the benefits associated with C\&R biotelemetry outweigh its disadvantages and limitations and thereby offer C\&R researchers a suite of new tools to enhance fisheries management and conservation.},

Title = {Probabilistic approach to cloud and snow detection on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {799-822},
Abstract = {Derivation of probability estimates complementary to geophysical data sets has gained special attention over the last years. Information about a confidence level of provided physical quantities is required to construct an error budget of higher-level products and to correctly interpret final results of a particular analysis. Regarding the generation of products based on satellite data a common input consists of a cloud mask which allows discrimination between surface and cloud signals. Further the surface information is divided between snow and snow-free components. At any step of this discrimination process a misclassification in a cloud/snow mask propagates to higher-level products and may alter their usability. Within this scope a novel probabilistic cloud mask (PCM) algorithm suited for the 1 km x 1 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data is proposed which provides three types of probability estimates between: cloudy/clear-sky, cloudy/snow and clear-sky/snow conditions. As opposed to the majority of available techniques which are usually based on the decision-tree approach in the PCM algorithm all spectral, angular and ancillary information is used in a single step to retrieve probability estimates from the precomputed look-up tables (LUTs). Moreover, the issue of derivation of a single threshold value for a spectral test was overcome by the concept of multidimensional information space which is divided into small bins by an extensive set of intervals. The discrimination between snow and ice clouds and detection of broken, thin clouds was enhanced by means of the invariant coordinate system (ICS) transformation. The study area covers a wide range of environmental conditions spanning from Iceland through central Europe to northern parts of Africa which exhibit diverse difficulties for cloud/snow masking algorithms. The retrieved PCM cloud classification was compared to the Polar Platform System (PPS) version 2012 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 cloud masks, SYNOP (surface synoptic observations) weather reports, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) vertical feature mask version 3 and to MODIS collection 5 snow mask. The outcomes of conducted analyses proved fine detection skills of the PCM method with results comparable to or better than the reference PPS algorithm.},

Title = {Can the watershed non-point source phosphorus flux amount be reflected by lake sediment?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {An understanding of the quantitative relationship between watershed non-point source (NPS) pollution and lake nutrient enrichment is essential for the environmental management of water bodies. However, a lack of data availability and integration limit our understanding of this relationship. The most critical bottlenecks are the lack of adequate support for watershed-lake integrated data, a lack of data of the nutrient loading from watersheds into a lake as NPS, and the long-term time series data of lake nutrient concentrations. Since lake sediment is the ultimate destination of watershed nutrients, this study aimed to reveal the relationship between watershed phosphorus (P) concentrations that are transported into lakes and lake P concentrations by using inlet sediments as an indicator. Three typical sub-basins within Hongze Lake, China were selected as the study site, and 30-year dataset was calculated using the technology integration of remote sensing, sediment chemical analysis and SWAT model assessment. It can be concluded that, first, the Mineral-P (Min-P) accounted for nearly 65\% of the watershed Total P (TP) loss, which varied over different basins and temporal periods. Second, the relationship between watershed P loss into lakes and sediment P concentrations represented obvious variation among different basins, sediment depths and P states. With respect to different basins, the highest correlation appeared in Basin 1, which had a R-2 value of 0.65 for Min-P. With respect to different P states, the Inorganic-P (IP) showed a closer relationship between watershed and lake P than Organic-P (OP), and the correlation coefficient (r) was higher than 0.6 in Basin 1 and Basin 3 for IP. In addition, the calcium-phosphorus ratio (Ca-P), which is largely sourced from watershed rock detritus by eroded runoff, played the most critical role among different Min-P states in the relatively ideal relationship of IP. With respect to different sediment depths, a stratification phenomenon existed in Basin 2 and Basin 3, which differed at specific depths. In particular, the ideal relationship only existed within the 7 cm depth from the bottom in basin 2, and this value expands to 10 cm for basin 3. This diversity was influenced by the integration roles from external and endogenous sources. All the findings indicated that lake surface sediment can be used as a proxy to represent NPS P loading under specific conditions. The relationship between watershed P loss and lake sediment P concentration was largely decided by land use/cover change (LUCC), meteorological conditions, and lake resuspension.},

Title = {Model-Observations Synergy in the Coastal Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Integration of observations of the coastal ocean continuum, from regional oceans to shelf seas and estuaries/deltas with models, can substantially increase the value of observations and enable a wealth of applications. In particular, models can play a critical role at connecting sparse observations, synthesizing them, and assisting the design of observational networks; in turn, whenever available, observations can guide coastal model development. Coastal observations should sample the two-way interactions between nearshore, estuarine and shelf processes and open ocean processes, while accounting for the different pace of circulation drivers, such as the fast atmospheric, hydrological and tidal processes and the slower general ocean circulation and climate scales. Because of these challenges, high-resolution models can serve as connectors and integrators of coastal continuum observations. Data assimilation approaches can provide quantitative, validated estimates of Essential Ocean Variables in the coastal continuum, adding scientific and socioeconomic value to observations through applications (e.g., sea-level rise monitoring, coastal management under a sustainable ecosystem approach, aquaculture, dredging, transport and fate of pollutants, maritime safety, hazards under natural variability or climate change). We strongly recommend an internationally coordinated approach in support of the proper integration of global and coastal continuum scales, as well as for critical tasks such as community-agreed bathymetry and coastline products.},

Abstract = {We developed DeepSolar, a deep learning framework analyzing satellite imagery to identify the GPS locations and sizes of solar photovoltaic panels. Leveraging its high accuracy and scalability, we constructed a comprehensive high-fidelity solar deployment database for the contiguous US. We demonstrated its value by discovering that residential solar deployment density peaks at a population density of 1,000 capita/mile 2, increases with annual household income asymptoting at similar to\$150k, and has an inverse correlation with the Gini index representing income inequality. We uncovered a solar radiation threshold (4.5 kWh/m(2)/day) above which the solar deployment is ``triggered.'' Furthermore, we built an accurate machine learning-based predictive model to estimate the solar deployment density at the census tract level. We offer the DeepSolar database as a publicly available resource for researchers, utilities, solar developers, and policymakers to further uncover solar deployment patterns, build comprehensive economic and behavioral models, and ultimately support the adoption and management of solar electricity.},

Title = {Exploring the use of Sentinel-2 datasets and environmental variables to model wheat crop yield in smallholder arid and semi-arid farming systems},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Low levels of agricultural productivity are associated with the persistence of food insecurity, poverty, and other socio-economic stresses. Mapping and monitoring agricultural dynamics and production in real-time at high spatial resolu-tion are essential for ensuring food security and shaping policy interventions. However, an accurate yield estimation might be challenging in some arid and semi-arid regions since input datasets are generally scarce, and access is re-stricted due to security challenges. This work examines how well Sentinel-2 satellite sensor-derived data, topographic and climatic variables, can be used as covariates to accurately model and predict wheat crop yield at the farm level using statistical models in low data settings of arid and semi-arid regions, using Sulaimani governorate in Iraq as an example. We developed a covariate selection procedure that assessed the correlations between the covariates and their relationships with wheat crop yield. Potential non-linear relationships were investigated in the latter case using regression splines. In the absence of substantial non-linear relationships between the covariates and crop yield, and residual spatial autocorrelation, we fitted a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to model and predict crop yield at 10 m resolution. Out of the covariates tested, our results showed significant relationships between crop yield and mean cumulative NDVI during the growing season, mean elevation, mean end of the season, mean maximum temperature and mean the start of the season at the farm level. For in-sample prediction, we estimated an R2 value of 51 \% for the model, whereas for out-of-sample prediction, this was 41 \%, both of which indicate reasonable predictive performance. The calculated root-mean-square error for out-of-sample prediction was 69.80, which is less than the standard deviation of 89.23 for crop yield, further showing that the model performed well by reducing prediction var-iability. Besides crop yield estimates, the model produced uncertainty metrics at 10 m resolution. Overall, this study showed that Sentinel-2 data can be valuable for upscaling field measurement of crop yield in arid and semi-arid regions. In addition, the environmental covariates can strengthen the model predictive power. The method may be applicable in other areas with similar environments, particularly in conflict zones, to increase the availability of agricultural statistics.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aims to assess whether research and development (R\&D) personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental institutions contribute to innovation activities of firms from the Vise -grad Group countries.Research Design \& Methods: Fixed effects panel regression with robust standard errors was used for hypoth-esis testing over the period 2009-2017. The data for the study was extracted from Eurostat, the European Innovation Scoreboard and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development with a particular focus on R\&D personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental institutions. The empirical analy-sis was focused on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Findings: The results provide evidence about significant linkage between R\&D personnel from governmental institutions and innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group countries. The research also highlights the lack of a significant effect of R\&D personnel from firms and the research system on firms' innovation ac-tivities in the analysed former Soviet satellite economies distinguished by innovation performance below the average for the European Union.Implications \& Recommendations: Policy and practical implications that should be indicated include the ne-cessity to further develop knowledge cooperation between governmental institutions and firms in order to reinforce innovation processes. There is also a need to enhance cooperation between the research system and firms to support SMEs from the Visegrad Group countries with highly-skilled human resources.Contribution \& Value Added: This article adds to the literature on drivers and sources of firms' innovation activities by providing new empirical evidence on the effect of R\&D personnel on innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group countries, which are former Soviet satellite economies with a moderate level of in-novativeness and belong to peripheral countries in the European Union.},

Abstract = {Analyses of avian demographic patterns across entire, contiguous landscapes are rare, but such analyses are important for understanding population dynamics. We selected the Black-throated Sparrow in the northern Chihuahuan Desert as a model to test patterns of abundance and nest success. across a landscape. We integrated abundance, nest density, and nesting success measured on sampling plots with a classified satellite map of the distribution of seven habitat types to analyze spatial and temporal patterns contributing to the population dynamics of this species. Adult relative abundance ranged from <1 bird/100 ha in pinyon-juniper habitat to 2439 birds/100 ha in shrubland habitats. Nest density was consistently high in mesquite, moderate to high in creosotebush, and low in black grama grassland; this value exhibited more temporal variability than relative abundance of adults. Nest success rates exhibited a strong habitat effect and ranged from 8\% in mesquite to 47\% in black grama grassland; overall population nest success. was 0.266. In all three years, nest success in mesquite was significantly lower than in all other habitat types (P < 0.01). There was no correlation between nest success and adult relative abundance. While mesquite habitat contained about one-third of all adults in the three years of the study, it contributed as. little as 10\% of successful nests. In creosotebush, the relative contribution to both adult abundance and successful nests was relatively high. Mesa grassland contained relatively few adults, but up to 44\% of successful nests. We discuss how habitat selection theory suggests mechanisms for the observed patterns. Mesquite appears to be a population sink for Black-throated Sparrows and may be, an ecological trap. While we do not propose that there is cause for conservation concern for this widespread species, our results, underscore the pitfalls associated with using adult abundance as an indicator of habitat quality. The method presented here is applicable for man), species and ecosystems and, thus, may be an important tool for conservation and management, as well as a new avenue for scientific investigation of landscape-level population dynamics.},

Title = {Variation of satellite-derived total suspended matter in large lakes with four types of water storage across the Tibetan Plateau, China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {846},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Total suspended matter (TSM), as an indicator of the concentration of fine materials in the water column including particulate nutrients, pollutants, and heavy metals, is widely used to monitor aquatic ecosystems. However, the long-term spatiotemporal variations of TSM in lakes across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and their response to environmental factors are rarely explored. Accordingly, taking advantage of the Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance and in-situ data, an empirical model (R-2= 0.83, RMSE= 1.08 mg/L, and MAPE= 19.49 \%) was developed to estimate the average autumnal TSM in large TP lakes (>= 50 km(2)) during the 1990-2020 period. For analyzing the spatiotemporal variability in TP lakes TSM, the examined lakes were classified into four types (Type A-D) based on their water storage changing in different periods. The results showed that the lakes in the southern and some northeastern parts of the TP exhibited lower TSM values than those situated in other regions. The assessment of TSM in each of these four lake types showed that more than half of them had a TSM value of < 20 mg/L. Apart from Type D, the lakes with the TSM showing significantly decreasing trends were dominantly Types A-C. A relative contribution analysis involving five driving factors indicated that they contributed by > 50 \% to lake TSM interannual variation in 73 out of 114 watersheds, and the lakes area change demonstrated the greatest contribution (82.2\%), followed by wind speed (11.0 \%). Further comparison between the entire lake and the non-expansive regions suggested that the expansive region played an indispensable role in determining the TSM value of the whole lake. This study can help to better understand the water quality condition and provide valuable information for policy-makers to maintain sustainable development in the TP region.},

Abstract = {Accurate detection and quantification of vegetation dynamics and drivers of observed climatic and anthropogenic change in space and time is fundamental for our understanding of the atmosphere-biosphere interactions at local and global scales. This case study examined the coupled spatial patterns of vegetation dynamics and climatic variabilities during the past three decades in the Upper Heihe River Basin (UHRB), a complex multiple use watershed in arid northwestern China. We apply empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis to isolate and identify the spatial patterns of satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) and their close relationship with the variability of an aridity index (AI = Precipitation/Potential Evapotranspiration). Results show that UHRB has become increasingly warm and wet during the past three decades. In general, the rise of air temperature and precipitation had a positive impact on mean LAI at the annual scale. At the monthly scale, LAI variations had a lagged response to climate. Two major coupled spatial change patterns explained 29\% and 41\% of the LAI dynamics during 1983-2000 and 2001-2010, respectively. The strongest connections between climate and LAI were found in the southwest part of the basin prior to 2000, but they shifted towards the north central area afterwards, suggesting that the sensitivity of LAI to climate varied over time, and that human disturbances might play an important role in altering LAI patterns. At the basin level, the positive effects of regional climate warming and precipitation increase as well as local ecological restoration efforts overwhelmed the negative effects of overgrazing. The study results offer insights about the coupled effects of climatic variability and grazing on ecosystem structure and functions at a watershed scale. Findings from this study are useful for land managers and policy makers to make better decisions in response to climate change in the study region.},

Title = {Keynote - Total Design Data Needs for the New Generation Large-Scale Activity Microsimulation Models},
Booktitle = {TRANSPORT SURVEY METHODS: BEST PRACTICE FOR DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {21-45},
Abstract = {Purpose - In this paper we describe a total design data collection method (expanding the definition of the usual ``total design'' terminology used in typical household travel surveys) to emphasize the need to describe individual and group behaviors embedded within their spatial, temporal, and social contexts. Methodology/approach - We first offer an overview of recently developed modeling and simulation applications predominantly in North America followed by a summary of the data needs in typical modeling and simulation modules for statewide and regional travel demand forecasting. We then proceed to describe an ideal data collection scheme with core and satellite survey components that can inform current and future model building. Mention is also made to the currently implemented California Household Travel Survey that brings together multiple agencies, modeling goals, and data collection component surveys. Findings - The preparation of this paper involved reviewing emerging transportation modeling approaches and paradigms, policy questions, and behavioral issues and considerations that are important in the multimodal transportation planning context. It was found that many of the questions being asked of policy makers in the transportation domain require a deep understanding of the interactions and constraints under which individuals make activity-travel choices, the learning processes at play, and the attitudes and perceptions that shape ways in which people adjust their travel behavior in response to policy interventions. Based on the work, it was found that many of the traditional travel survey designs are not able to provide the comprehensive data needed to estimate activity-based model systems that truly capture the full range of behavioral considerations and phenomena of importance. Originality/value of paper - This paper offers a review of the emerging transportation modeling approaches and behavioral paradigms of importance in activity-based travel demand forecasting. The paper discusses how traditional travel survey designs are inadequate to meet the data needs of emerging modeling approaches. Based on a review of all of the data needs and new data collection methods that are making it possible to observe a full range of human behaviors, the paper offers a total survey data collection design that brings together many different surveys and data collection protocols. The core household travel survey is augmented by a full slate of special purpose surveys that together yield a rich behavioral database for activity-based microsimulation modeling. The paper is a valuable reference for transportation planners and modelers interested in developing data collection enterprises that will feed the next generation of transportation models.},

Abstract = {Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health care professionals concerning the effects of stress management on the prevention and control of hypertension in otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women). Options: Alternatives to stress management include other nonpharmacologic interventions and medical therapy; these options are not mutually exclusive. Outcomes: The health outcome considered was reduction of blood pressure. There is little evidence to date that stress management prevents death or vascular events. Because of insufficient evidence, no economic outcomes were considered. Evidence: A systematic search of the literature (which yielded, among other sources, 3 meta-analyses) was conducted for the period 1966-1997 with the terms essential hypertension, treatment, psychological, behavioural, cognitive, relaxation, meditation, biofeedback and stress management. Other relevant evidence was obtained from the reference lists of the articles identified, from the personal files of the authors and through contacts with experts. The articles were reviewed, classified according to study design and graded according to level of evidence. Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular morbidity and premature death caused by uncontrolled hypertension. Benefits, harms and costs: The magnitude of the reduction in blood pressure obtained with multicomponent, individualized cognitive behavioural intervention for stress management was comparable in some studies to that obtained with weight loss or drugs; single-component interventions such as biofeedback or relaxation were less effective. The adverse effects of stress-management techniques are minimal, but the cost for effective interventions is substantial, similar initially to drug costs; continuing costs are probably minimal. Recommendations: (1) In patients with hypertension, the contribution of stress should be considered. (2) For hypertensive patients in whom stress appears to be an important issue, stress management should be considered as an intervention. Individualized cognitive behavioural interventions are more likely to be effective than single-component interventions. Validation: These recommendations were reviewed by all of the sponsoring organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of the fourth International Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They have not been clinically tested. Sponsors: The Canadian Hypertension Society, the Canadian Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control at Health Canada, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.},

Abstract = {The man-made processes, boosted by the increasingly worldwide need of food, fiber, water and shelter, rule the changes of use and land cover {[}1]. The deforestation causes the loss of biodiversity and causes possible weather impacts {[}2]. With the valuation of natural resources, know its allocation in both spatial location and time and know how they interact in space is fundamental to create aid mechanisms to decision taking as well as planning future development {[}3]. The spatial modeling simulation help understand the causing mechanisms and development processes of environmental systems {[}4]. The spatial modeling simulation based on Cellular Automata (CA) have been used for assessing complex environmental issues, such as estimate pathways and impacts related to the greenhouse gases emissions {[}5], {[}6], integrated modeling of population, employment and land-use change {[}7], land-use change {[}8], predict possible trends in deforested areas, pastures and forests {[}9], among others {[}10]. This study proposes the development, calibration and outcomes analysis of a dynamic spatial modeling simulation Land Use, Land Use Change (LULUC), taking into consideration a time period, 1986, 2000 and 2008 (t(1), t2 and t(3), respectively) where t3 is used to assess quality of the simulated map from t(2). Work is focused on reduction rate of the forest remaining of Atlantic Rainforest of the Brazilian Municipality of Maragogipe located at 82 miles east of the State Capital Salvador in the State of Bahia. For so, a modeling platform was used (freeware) based on (CA) DINAMICA-EGO (http://www.csr.ufmg.br/dinamica). Medium and high resolution satellite images were researched and purchased (Landsat-TM and CBERS-2B, sensor CCD; HRC) and other cartographical bases correlated to the study area. Information was cataloged according to its source, homogenized, and defining the work unit: degrees, cartographic and geodetic references, by performing conversions and geo-referencing if applicable. Satellite images were processed to equalization histogram and radiometric. They were classified by using the supervised method and the Bhattacharya algorithm. The following classes were identified: rainforest, mangrove, grassland, regrow, urban areas and others. The thematic precision was assessed with the aid of 300 points acquired in technical visit and by high resolution images analyses, in both cases defined at random. The descriptive statistics of global accuracy reached the 89\% ratio and the Kappa inter-rater agreement: 0.864 number that represents a high acceptance level according to scale suggested by Congalton and Green {[}3]. The classes were grouped in rainforest and non-rainforest. Basically, the model was structured in the software, based on a simulation model suggested by Soares-Filho et al. {[}12]. An initial map (t(2)) has its classes changed according to change rate ``Transition Matrix{''} (TM). TM is the total amount of change for each land cover transition type of the maps classified, taking into account the time period of the simulation through a cross-tab operation. Such changes happen in the most likely areas, defined by the likelihood map, resulting from the calculus of Weights of Evidence (WofE). WofE are the local odds of a transition land use classes taking into account a range of spatial variables by stochastic methods, Bayesian statistical or conditional probability. The spatial variables were: altitude, slope, soil conditions, conservation areas, distance to major rivers, distance to small rivers, distance to urban patches, distance to roads, distance to deforestation, and distance to protected areas. In this study, analyzed transition was transformation of forest in deforested areas (deforestation). Stains of change (landscape disturbance) happened in quantity in accordance with TM and had their rate of appearance or aggregation according to the values arbitrated to certain software function operators, as well as the isometrics of stains. Applied to changes, the resulting landscape map was saved at every step of the model and retro-fed as initial map in the next step until reaching a compatible time variation with t(3), by making possible the validation of outcomes. Validation was performed by calculating the similarity between the simulated map and the real map (t(3)) based on fuzzy logic, applied to a context of pixel vicinity, by means of an exponential decay function with an 11-pixel-window. By visual analysis (Figure 1), it was noted that the heuristic process was successfully designed, as the deforestation standard was respected and are congruent with the local probabilities according to the likelihood map. The similarity reached by comparison between the model outcome and the real map (t(3)) was 46\% of minimal similarity and 77\% of maximal similarity.},

Abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57.8\% (95\% CI 56.6-58.8) of global deaths and 41.2\% (39.8-42.8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211.8 million {[}192.7 million to 231.1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148.6 million {[}134.2 million to 163.1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143.1 million {[}125.1 million to 163.5 million]), high BMI (120.1 million {[}83.8 million to 158.4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113.3 million {[}103.9 million to 123.4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103.1 million {[}90.8 million to 115.1 million]), high total cholesterol (88.7 million {[}74.6 million to 105.7 million]), household air pollution (85.6 million {[}66.7 million to 106.1 million]), alcohol use (85.0 million {[}77.2 million to 93.0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83.0 million {[}49.3 million to 127.5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Satellite technology has been used over the years by the countries the world over with the benefits percolating down to the society. It has contributed in revolutionising communications, improving natural resources management systems, facilitating the study of agriculture potential and in various fields of economic development. Satellites have also been used for surveillance, emergency preparedness and coordinating search and rescue operations on a global basis. A unique benefit of this technology has been realised in the area of navigation and radiopositioning. Satellite based navigation and radiopositioning was first implemented by the USA with the launch of TRANSIT System. TRANSIT had paved the way for worldwide acceptance of satellite navigation although its use, life and accuracy of position fixing were limited. These limitations were overcome with the introduction of concept of Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS was conceived in 1974 by the USA as a better and faster navigation system capable of providing three dimensional position and velocity information along-with precise time to all types of users anywhere on a 24 hours basis. GPS provides for two levels of services i.e. Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Precise Positioning Service (PPS). The SPS is intended to provide a position fix that is accurate to within 100 meters on 95 percent of occasions, whereas PPS requires transfer from Coarse (C/A) code to the more accurate Precision (P) code, which allows accuracy of 16 meters on 50 percent of occasions. The accuracy of 100 meters available to civil users through SPS may not meet the requirements of applications in offshore oil exploration, hydrographic survey, physical oceanographic operation, fixing, collision avoidance, harbour approach and landing of aircraft, geophysical survey of remote locations and conducting search and rescue operations etc. This degraded accuracy can however be improved using the concept of Differential GPS (DGPS). This article deals with various issues related to the GPS technologies, their potential applications and system configurations available for these applications. An approach for design, development and demonstration of GPS and DGPS in Indian conditions with the active participation of user departments, industries and R\&D institutions engaged in this field has also been discussed. Since the GPS/DGPS is a system with potential of revolutionising the concepts in navigation and radiopositioning applications, it is hoped that this article will pave the way for promoting developmental activities for GPS/DGPS and Indian industries will gear up to meet the large requirements anticipated in near future for these.},

Title = {Development and validation of a model to estimate postharvest losses during transport of tomatoes in West Africa},

Abstract = {In an effort to better understand postharvest losses associated with low-cost tomato transport in West Africa we present a spatial-temporal simulation model that links the prevailing outside weather conditions, estimated using satellite meteorology, to the microclimate observed inside truck trailers (cryptoclimate) to determine the deterioration in tomato quality during transport. Tomatoes from Burkina Faso are transported under sub-optimal circumstances to important Ghanaian markets; during a number of these transports conditions for the tomato cargo inside trucks were measured while conditions outside the trucks were monitored by means of weather satellites. The presented tomato quality model analytically combines cryptoclimate, duration since harvest, and kinetic modelling to arrive at estimated firmness. Firmness of tomatoes in transport was monitored with a portable penetrometer in selected trucks, augmented with additional (acoustic firmness) data collected in a climate chamber. Half of these observations were used to calibrate a firmness loss model and the other half to validate the simulation results. Our results indicate that outside weather during transport can be reasonably well estimated using satellite meteorology. The model performance for the estimation of outside global radiation (Rg) and land-surface temperature (LST) were found to be satisfactory, with a RMSE = 87.98 W m(-2); bias = 57.39 W m(-2) and RMSE = 2.95 degrees C; bias = 0.91 degrees C, respectively. Results for the cryptoclimate estimation (conditions inside the trucks) for temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity were as follows: R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 4.18 degrees C (T-incargo); R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 19.59\% (RHincargo); and R-2 = 0.9, RMSE = 137.31 lx (LIincargo). The postharvest loss model that relies on these estimates as its input explained on average 77\% of the variance in observed tomatoes firmness, with total product losses ranging from 30\% to 50\% when integrated over the entire transportation period. With the accuracy of the model quantified and the causality of losses partially demonstrated, we argue that the simulation model can be useful as an economic resistor in transport optimization studies to investigate the cost-benefit of various measures to reduce postharvest losses. Such studies could help to illustrate what net gains can be expected if delays along the transportation route are reduced, cargo conditions are semi-controlled (e.g. pre-cooling treatment), or if a different transport schedule is adopted. The model may also be used to show the impact of different climate change scenarios on postharvest losses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Novel satellite based analytical model developed to predict microalgae yields in open pond raceway systems and applied to Canadian sites},
Journal = {ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Interest in microalgae cultivation continues to increase based on its potential commercial value. Algae converts CO2, nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T biomass would require 17-20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45-56 ha at Medicine Hat, AB, 57-68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71-80 ha at Great Slave Lake, NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass. Modeled land area information provides the basis for life cycle assessments (LCAs), techno-economic analyses (TEAs), and photobioreactor (PBR) versus OPR performance studies, yields simulations based on various parameters, and can assist with algae production platform optimization.},

Abstract = {The Himalayan region, a rugged mountain zone is among the most susceptible zones to the landslide hazard due to its terrain, geography, and active tectonics. Machine learning (ML) techniques are most advanced and precise methods to develop landslide susceptibility model (LSM). The current study was designed to analyze and assess the landslide susceptibility using ML approaches for District Hattian Bala, NW Himalayas, Pakistan. The historical satellite imageries are used to generate spatiotemporal landslide inventories of year 2005, 2007 and 2012. A spatial database was created pertaining to topographic, environmental, geologic, and anthropogenic factors including slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, plane curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, distance to faults, distance to streams, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use/ land cover (LULC). These LCFs were selected to analyze periodic landslide susceptibility in the region. The experimental design utilized 349, 393, and 735 landslide inventory of 2005, 2007, and 2012 respectively. Two ML models, i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to assess landslide susceptibility determine by thirteen landslide causative factors (LCFs). The spatiotemporal landslide inventory was partitioned into training (70\%) and testing (30\%) landslides for respective years to check the prediction accuracies of selected ML models. Comparative analysis of different LSMs was performed by the Receiver Operator Curves - Area Under Curves (ROC-AUC). The resultant accuracy, MAE, RMSE, Kappa, Precision, Recall, F1 indicated that RF outperformed the LR model. The study aims to minimize losses to lives and potential economic damage linked with recurrent slope instabilities in the region. It is anticipated that use of ML algorithms would support concerned authorities and organizations to effectively plan and manage landslide hazard in the region.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

Title = {Application of GIS-based fuzzy logic and rock engineering system (RES) approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping in Selelkula area of the Lower Jema River Gorge, Central Ethiopia},

Abstract = {Landslide susceptibility mapping is an important tool for disaster management and development activities such as planning of transportation infrastructure, settlement and agriculture. Selelkula area of the Jema River Gorge in Central Ethiopian Highland was chosen as a study area. Fuzzy logic (FL) and rock engineering system (RES) in a GIS environment were employed to prepare landslide susceptibility maps for this area. Data sets including slope, aspect, profile curvature, plan curvature, lithology, land use, distance from river and distance from lineament were generated using the field data, remote sensing and GIS. In FL, the fuzzy membership values were calculated by normalizing the frequency ratio values of each factor's class in a range between 0 and 1. Then, the fuzzy membership values were combined by fuzzy AND, fuzzy OR, fuzzy gamma, fuzzy sum and fuzzy product operators. A total of twelve landslide susceptibility maps were produced using FL and the best map was chosen based on area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the highest difference between minimum and maximum susceptibility index values. Based on these criteria, the landslide susceptibility map produced using fuzzy gamma (gamma = 0.8) operator was selected. RES is a semi-quantitative method which assigns each factor's classes a value between 0 and 4 based on the principles of Hudson (Rock engineering systems, theory and practice. Ellis Horwood, Chichester, 1992) and uses an interaction matrix through a coding system of five values in previous researches but a coding system of nine values has been used in this study to provide a wider range of values for interactions among each pair of landslide factors and each landslide factor with a landslide. Unlike other methods, RES has a freedom to evaluate and assign each interaction based on expert's knowledge and experience. But it also bears the problem of subjectivity in assigning the interaction values. On the other hand, FL is completely data driven and does not show any subjectivity in assigning values for each factor class. The prediction accuracies of FL and RES, which can be determined from ROC curves, were found to be 87.2 and 88.6 \%, respectively. For validation purpose, the existing landslides were overlaid over the two landslide susceptibility maps and the percentage of landslides in each susceptibility class was calculated. The percentages of landslides that fall in the high and very high susceptibility classes are slightly higher in RES than FL method and hence the former is more accurate in predicting the future landslide occurrence than the later.},

Title = {Estimation of the Value of Ecosystem Carbon Sequestration Services under Different Scenarios in the Central China (the Qinling-Daba Mountain Area)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The Qinling-Daba Mountain area is a transitional zone between north and south China and not much is known about its carbon storage, particularly its pool of soil organic carbon (SOC). Given this shortcoming, more reliable information regarding its SOC is needed. In light of this, we quantified above and below-ground carbon sinks using both the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon cycle process model. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios using the NPV model. Our results indicated that the net primary productivity (NPP) was lower in places with low density forests that were situated at high elevation. The spatial distribution of carbon storage depended on NPP production and litter decompositon, which reflected specific vegetation as well as temperature and moisture gradients. The lowest amounts of carbon storage were in the center of the Qinling Mountains and also partly in the Daba area, which is a location associated with sparse grassland. Contrastingly, the broad-leaved forested area showed the highest amount of carbon storage. NPV was positively correlated with discount rate and carbon prices, thus resulting in the highest values in the forests and grassland. The net present value of total soil carbon sequestration in the six scenarios in 2015 was 3.555 b yuan, 3.621 b yuan, 5.421 b yuan, 5.579 b yuan, 7.530 b yuan, 7.929 b yuan; The net present value of total soil carbon sequestration in 6 scenarios in 2017 is 2.816 b yuan, 2.845 b yuan, 4.361 b yuan, 4.468 b yuan, 6.144 b yuan, 6.338 b yuan (billion = 10(9); b; RMB is the legal currency of the China, and its unit is yuan, 1 euro = 7.7949 yuan, and 1 pound = 9.2590 yuan). Levying a carbon tax would be a notable option for decision makers as they develop carbon emission reduction policies. Given this, incorporating discount rates and carbon pricing would allow for more realistic value estimations of soil organic carbon. This approach would also provide a theoretical basis and underscore the practical significance for the government to set a reasonable carbon price.},

Title = {Lightning and Severe Weather: A Comparison between Total and Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Trends},
Journal = {WEATHER AND FORECASTING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {744-755},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many studies over the past several decades have attempted to correlate trends in lightning (e.g., rates, polarity) to severe weather occurrence. These studies mainly used cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning information due to the ease of data availability, high detection efficiency, and broad coverage across the United States, with somewhat inconclusive results. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that trends in total lightning are more robustly correlated to severe weather occurrence, with rapid increases in total lightning observed 10s of minutes prior to the onset of severe weather. Unfortunately, total lightning observations are not as numerous, or available over the same areal coverage domain, as provided by CG networks. Relatively few studies have examined concurrent trends in both total and CG lightning within the same severe thunderstorm, or even large sets of thunderstorms using an objective lightning jump algorithm. Multiple studies have shown that the total flash rate rapidly increases prior to the onset of severe weather. What is untested within the same framework is the use of CG information to perform the same task. Herein, total and CG lightning trends for 711 thunderstorms occurring in four regions of the country were examined to demonstrate the increased utility that total lightning provides over CG lightning, specifically within the framework of developing a useful lightning-based severe weather warning decision support tool. Results indicate that while both lightning datasets demonstrate the presence of increased lightning activity prior to the onset of severe weather, the use of total lightning trends was more effective than CG trends {[}probability of detection (POD), 79\% versus 66\%; false alarm rate (FAR), 36\% versus 53\%; critical success index (CSI), 55\% versus 38\%; Heidke skill score (HSS), 0.71 versus 0.55]. Moreover, 40\% of false alarms associated with total lightning, and 16\% of false alarms with CG lightning trends, occurred when a lightning jump associated with a severe weather ``warning{''} was already in effect. If these false alarms are removed, the FAR drops from 36\% to 22\% for total lightning and from 53\% to 44\% for CG lightning. Importantly, average lead times prior to severe weather occurrence were higher using total lightning as compared with CG lightning (20.65 versus 13.54 min). The ultimate goal of this study was to demonstrate the increased utility of total lightning information that the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) will provide to operational meteorology in anticipation of severe convective weather on a hemispheric scale once Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) is deployed in the next decade.},

Abstract = {Sensors, communication systems and geo-reference units are required to achieve an optimized management of agricultural inputs with respect to the economic and environmental aspects of olive groves. In this study, three commercial olive harvesters were tracked during two harvesting seasons in Spain and Chile using remote and autonomous equipment that was developed to determine their time efficiency and effective based on canopy shaking for fruit detachment. These harvesters work in intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards. A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters. The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system. The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective field capacity or field efficiency. A saving of 40\% in effective field capacity was achieved with a reduction from 4 m or higher to 3.5 m in alley width for SHD olive harvester. A yield map was plotted using data that were acquired by a yield monitor, reflecting the yield gradient in spite of the larger differences between tree yields.},

Abstract = {Rapid global economic expansion has resulted in a drastic increase of urbanization while impacting the Earth's entire ecology. This study evaluates the impact of historical land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) change signatures on seasonal variation of climatic variables using a cloud platform-Google Earth Engine. Due to rapid urbanization and the noticeable spatio-temporal difference in the climate, administrative units of Dakshina Kannada district are taken for demonstration. The LU/LC of the district extracted from high-resolution images of Landsat using random forest classification, land surface temperature (LST) extracted from the thermal band of Landsat images using the mono window algorithm, evapotranspiration (ET) data extracted from MOD16A2.006 and precipitation data from CHIPRS was used. The data was extracted for the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period 2001-2019. The district has seen a 13.67\% reduction in the forest area with 18.81\% increase in the built-up areas. The LST and ET has seen a progressive drift in the past two decades, with an increase of 4.07 degrees C in median temperature in forest areas and a decline of 2.19 mm in median ET value, which necessitates monitoring forest encroachment. The higher variation in maximum LST in built-up land (0.36 degrees C) (near the industrial area) indicates that LU/LC change signature is the predominant driving factor and is associated with the physical characteristics of the built-up area. The ET exhibited a decreasing rate of 0.62 mm/year/sq.km of the built-up land. This study highlights the power of Google Earth Engine and free availability of satellite data in environmental protection, land-use management and sustainable development in the region.},

Title = {Heterogeneous accountingisation Accounting and inter-organisational cooperation in home care services},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1080-1112},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the effects of the increased influence of accounting on core values and practices within the services providing home care in Sweden a public sector setting involving inter-organisational cooperation. Design/methodology/approach - Case study data were obtained primarily through semi-structured interviews with managers and front-line staff involved in home care. Findings - When accountingisation is extended to include inter-organisational cooperation, a form of heterogeneous accountingisation occurred in the home care services: an internal domain (with a low level of accountingisation) could be differentiated from an inter-organisational domain (with a high level of accountingisation). When the accounting-induced disturbances intensified, there was a redefinition of core values. In the internal domain, core values of pensioner-oriented focus and flexibility during service delivery persisted. In contrast, in the inter-organisational domain, core values had the legal boundaries of the organisation as their central foundation, standardisation was emphasised, and inter-organisational work practices were defined as the other organisation's responsibility. The findings also extend the research on absorption groups by indicating the rise of a new type of absorption process. Absorption was not undertaken by a few individuals, specialist work groups or satellite organisations, as described in the literature; instead, all front-line welfare professionals were involved in absorbing the accounting-induced disturbances when performing their tasks. Research limitations/implications - This case study research is context-specific and the meaning and consequences of accountingisation may differ within the public sector because of the status and strength of professional groups concerned.

Abstract = {Landslide susceptibility (LSI) modeling of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya is performed by integrating 28 causative factors on C-28(28) combinations on Geographical Information System (GIS) following analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based multicriteria decision protocol, logistic regression (LR)-based multivariate technique, machine learning data-driven random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods wherein the terrain is classified into `None' (with: 0.0 < LSI <= 0.17), `Low' (with: 0.17 < LSI <= 0.34), `Moderate' (with: 0.34 < LSI <= 0.51), `High' (with: 0.51 < LSI <= 0.68),'Very High' (with: 0.68 < LSI <= 0.85) and `Severe' (with: 0.85 < LSI <= 1.00) susceptible zones as validated through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing comparison with the 30\% landslide inventory test data. The best integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of 0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like population density, number of households, building types, building height and building density has demarketed approximately 21\% of the region under `Very High' to `Severe' socioeconomic risk zone while about 36\% area are classified under `Very High' to `Severe' structural risk zone as implicated by devastating landslide hazards in the region. Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in the `Very High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones wherein near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the `Low to Moderate' landslide susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the `High' landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the `Very High to Severe' landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s(2) and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the `High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones.},

Title = {Measuring the U.S. outdoor recreation economy, 2012-2016},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper summarizes the methodology and results of newly-released federal statistics describing the U.S. outdoor recreation economy. These new statistics show that outdoor recreation represented 2.2\% of the U.S. economy from 2012 to 2016, similar in size to the utilities and mining industries. Boating/fishing contributed \$38.2 billion to gross output in 2016, followed by game areas (includes golfing and tennis) (\$36.3 billion) and RVing (\$30.8 billion). Additionally, more than 4.5 million jobs were generated by the outdoor recreation economy in 2016, resulting in \$213.6 billion of compensation paid to U.S. workers. These new statistics provide for the first time a comprehensive and consistent measure of the value of outdoor recreation to the U.S. economy. Any future updates to these statistics may consider adding regional data and a longer time series to provide even more meaningful statistics to researchers and policymakers. Management implications: New statistics provide estimates of the outdoor recreation economy from an unbiased source: the outdoor recreation satellite account (ORSA). The ORSA provides a solid framework to measure the outdoor economy and can be used -To show the significance of the outdoor recreation economy -To compare its relevance with other economic sectors -To examine the growth of the outdoor recreation economy over time in a detailed manner -To pay attention to specific outdoor recreation activities and their respective changes over time.},

Title = {Mapping Oyster Reef Distribution Using Kompsat-2/3 and Linear Spectral Unmixing Algorithm - A Case Study at Hwangdo Tidal Flat},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},

Pages = {246-253},

Abstract = {Oyster areas are widely used as species of biological indicator, and they are also the most important shellfish in terms of ecosystem economic valuation. Oysters are production on the west coast before 2007 accounted for about 5 \% of the nation's total production, but the 2007 Hebei Spirit oil spill caused production to plunge to less than 1 \%. Therefore, spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs are required to help local authorities define management strategies. In this study, Kompsat-2/3 was used to map oyster reef distribution and analyze the distribution of oyster reefs based on linear spctral unmixing in Hwangdo tidal flat. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with a field spectroradiometer, was used to conduct linear spectral unmixing classifications on Kompsat-2/3 data. The classification result shows very high accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 95 \% or more, and there were misclassifications in some areas. The most causes of misclassification are the similarity of spectral characteristics and the limitations of the spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite images. For this reason, it was difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs and area distributed with many macrobenthos, and small-young oyster reefs were difficult to classify due to very weak reflectivity. In addition, the sand bar, it was is difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs related to dead reefs and sandbars because of the high reflectivity of these areas in the imagery. As a result of analyzing the change in the oyster reef area, it increased in 2019 compared to that in 2015. Especially, the oyster reef area increased in 30-50 \% sand content and decreased in 20-30 \% and 60-70 \%. The changes of sand sediment seem to affect the distribution of oyster reefs. This study may be useful for mapping the distribution of oyster reefs and understanding the spatial variation of their habitat.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Variations and Influencing Factors of Country-Level Carbon Emissions for Northeast China Based on VIIRS Nighttime Lighting Data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This paper constructs a county-level carbon emission inversion model in Northeast China. We first fit the nighttime light data of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with local energy consumption statistics and carbon emissions data. We analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of county-level energy-related carbon emissions in Northeast China from 2012 to 2020. At the same time, we use the geographic detector method to analyze the impact of various socio-economic factors on county carbon emissions under the single effect and interaction. The main results are as follows: (1) The county-level carbon emission model in Northeast China is relatively more accurate. The regression coefficient is 0.1217 and the determination coefficient R-2 of the regression equation is 0.7722. More than 80\% of the provinces have an error of less than 25\%, meeting the estimation accuracy requirements. (2) From 2012 to 2020, the carbon emissions of county-level towns in Northeast China showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing from 461.1159 million tons in 2012 to 405.752 million tons in 2020. It reached a peak of 486.325 million tons in 2014. (3) The regions with higher carbon emission growth rates are concentrated in the northern and coastal areas of Northeast China. The areas with low carbon emission growth rates are mainly distributed in some underdeveloped areas in the south and north in Northeast China. (4) Under the effect of the single factor urbanization rate, the added values of the secondary industry and public finance income have higher explanatory power to regional emissions. These factors promote the increase of county carbon emissions. When fiscal revenue and expenditure and the added value of the secondary industry and per capita GDP interact with the urbanization rate, respectively, the explanatory power of these factors on regional carbon emissions will be enhanced and the promotion of carbon emissions will be strengthened. The research results are helpful for exploring the changing rules and influencing factors of county carbon emissions in Northeast China and for providing data support for low-carbon development and decision making in Northeast China.},

Title = {LiDAR as a Tool for Assessing Timber Assortments: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Forest ecosystems strongly contribute to the mitigation of climate change impacts through the carbon stored in forests and through harvested wood products, such as sawed wood and furniture, which are obtained from many types of timber assortments. Timber assortments are defined as log sections of specific dimensions (log length and maximum/minimum end diameters), gathered from felled trunks, that have both specific commercial timber utilisation and economic value. However, it is challenging to discriminate and assess timber assortment types, especially within a forest stand before the forest has been harvested. Accurate estimations of timber assortments are a fundamental prerequisite in supporting forest holdings and assisting practitioners in the optimisation of harvesting activities and promoting forest wood chains, in addition to forest policy and planning. Based on the georeferenced points cloud tool, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a powerful technology for rapidly and accurately depicting forest structure, even if the use of LiDAR for timber assortments estimation is lacking and poorly explored. This systematic literature review aimed to highlight the state-of-the-art applications of the LiDAR systems (spaceborne; airborne, including unmanned aerial UASs; and terrestrial) to quantify and classify different timber assortment types. A total of 304 peer-reviewed papers were examined. The results highlight a constant increment of published articles using LiDAR systems for forest-related aspects in the period between 2000 and 2021. The most recurring investigation topics in LiDAR studies were forest inventory and forest productivity. No studies were found that used spaceborne LiDAR systems for timber assortment assessments, as these were conditioned by the time and sample size (sample size = similar to 12 m/similar to 25 m of laser footprint and 0.7 m/60 m of space along the track for ICESat-2, GEDI and time = since 2018). Terrestrial LiDAR systems demonstrated a higher performance in successfully characterising the trees belonging to an understory layer. Combining airborne/UAS systems with terrestrial LiDAR systems is a promising approach to obtain detailed data concerning the timber assortments of large forest covers. Overall, our results reveal that the interest of scientists in using machine and deep learning algorithms for LiDAR processes is steadily increasing.},

Title = {Landslide Susceptibility Assessment of a Part of the Western Ghats (India) Employing the AHP and F-AHP Models and Comparison with Existing Susceptibility Maps},
Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {Landslides are prevalent in the Western Ghats, and the incidences that happened in 2021 in the Koottickal area of the Kottayam district (Western Ghats) resulted in the loss of 10 lives. The objectives of this study are to assess the landslide susceptibility of the high-range local self-governments (LSGs) in the Kottayam district using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-AHP (F-AHP) models and to compare the performance of existing landslide susceptible maps. This area never witnessed any massive landslides of this dimension, which warrants the necessity of relooking into the existing landslide-susceptible models. For AHP and F-AHP modeling, ten conditioning factors were selected: slope, soil texture, land use/land cover (LULC), geomorphology, road buffer, lithology, and satellite image-derived indices such as the normalized difference road landslide index (NDRLI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the normalized burn ratio (NBR), and the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The landslide-susceptible zones were categorized into three: low, moderate, and high. The validation of the maps created using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique ascertained the performances of the AHP, F-AHP, and TISSA maps as excellent, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value above 0.80, and the NCESS map as acceptable, with an AUC value above 0.70. Though the difference is negligible, the map prepared using the TISSA model has better performance (AUC = 0.889) than the F-AHP (AUC = 0.872), AHP (AUC = 0.867), and NCESS (AUC = 0.789) models. The validation of maps employing other matrices such as accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) also confirmed that the TISSA model (0.869, 0.226, and 0.122, respectively) has better performance, followed by the F-AHP (0.856, 0.243, and 0.147, respectively), AHP (0.855, 0.249, and 0.159, respectively), and NCESS (0.770, 0.309, and 0.177, respectively) models. The most landslide-inducing factors in this area that were identified through this study are slope, soil texture, LULC, geomorphology, and NDRLI. Koottickal, Poonjar-Thekkekara, Moonnilavu, Thalanad, and Koruthodu are the LSGs that are highly susceptible to landslides. The identification of landslide-susceptible areas using diversified techniques will aid decision-makers in identifying critical infrastructure at risk and alternate routes for emergency evacuation of people to safer terrain during an exigency.},

Title = {Can aggregated patterns of urban woody vegetation cover promote greater species diversity, richness and abundance of native birds?},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rapid urban growth poses the global challenge of mitigating urbanization impacts on biodiversity. The amount and spatial arrangement of vegetation could help managers and urban planners improve habitat conditions for fauna; however, whether aggregated patterns of trees and shrubs promote greater diversity of wildlife in urban areas remains poorly understood. To provide empirical evidence to help planning and management of urban vegetation for native fauna, we evaluated the influence of amount and spatial arrangement of woody vegetation cover on species diversity, richness and abundance of native birds in a growing city located in a biodiversity hotspot. We first mapped woody vegetation cover at a high spatial resolution using satellite images (WorldView2, 0.45 m resolution) in the city of Santiago, Chile. Then, we performed a stratified random sampling approach to select 118 urban landscapes (1 km2 size) with different amounts and aggregation of woody cover. All selected urban landscapes were surveyed for birds during reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. We found the amount of woody cover positively influenced native birds, including different diet guilds. Species diversity, richness and abundance of all native, insectivorous and omnivorous birds, and the abundance of granivorous birds increased with the amount of woody cover in the urban landscape. Contrary to our hypothesis, spatial aggregation of woody cover exhibited mainly no-effect or negative effects on native birds. Our findings demonstrate prevailing positive effects of the amount of woody cover on native birds, and mostly no benefit of aggregation at 1 km2 scale. Therefore, both scattered and aggregated trees and shrubs contributed to support native birds in the city. Targeting high levels of woody cover, planting and preserving trees and shrubs (regardless of whether they aggregate or scatter across the urban landscape), will promote greater native bird diversity, mitigate negative impacts of urbanization on local birds, and help restore people-nature interactions in cities.},

Title = {Proximate weather patterns and spring green-up phenology effect Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) body mass and reproductive success: the implications of climate change and topography},

Abstract = {Low spring temperatures have been found to benefit mobile herbivores by reducing the rate of spring-flush, whereas high rainfall increases forage availability. Cold winters prove detrimental, by increasing herbivore thermoregulatory burdens. Here we examine the effects of temperature and rainfall variability on a temperate sedentary herbivore, the Eurasian beaver, Castor fiber, in terms of inter-annual variation in mean body weight and per territory offspring production. Data pertain to 198 individuals, over 11years, using capture-mark-recapture. We use plant growth (tree cores) and fAPAR (a satellite-derived plant productivity index) to examine potential mechanisms through which weather conditions affect the availability and the seasonal phenology of beaver forage. Juvenile body weights were lighter after colder winters, whereas warmer spring temperatures were associated with lighter adult body weights, mediated by enhanced green-up phenology rates. Counter-intuitively, we observed a negative association between rainfall and body weight in juveniles and adults, and also with reproductive success. Alder, Alnus incana, (n=68) growth rings (principal beaver food in the study area) exhibited a positive relationship with rainfall for trees growing at elevations >2m above water level, but a negative relationship for trees growing <0.5m. We deduce that temperature influences beavers at the landscape scale via effects on spring green-up phenology and winter thermoregulation. Rainfall influences beavers at finer spatial scales through topographical interactions with plant growth, where trees near water level, prone to water logging, producing poorer forage in wetter years. Unlike most other herbivores, beavers are an obligate aquatic species that utilize a restricted central-place' foraging range, limiting their ability to take advantage of better forage growth further from water during wetter years. With respect to anthropogenic climate change, interactions between weather variables, plant phenology and topography on forage growth are instructive, and consequently warrant examination when developing conservation management strategies for populations of medium to large herbivores.},

Title = {Drivers of Land Use Change in Lantapan, Bukidnon, Philippines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Agricultural intensification has been the key in addressing the growing demand for food production both for home consumption and supplying the market. The market demand on agricultural production has therefore triggered change in land use. For farmers, it makes a lot of economic sense to venture on high value agricultural products where land and labor capital is limited This study provided a temporal analysis that would describe the land use changes in Barangay Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, with emphasis on the driving forces and how they influence the farming decision of farmers. Participatory mapping and focused group discussion were conducted with selected farmer-residents, and a satellite image to generate the historical land use map of barangay Songco. Maps were digitized and land areas were computed using the ArcGis9 field calculator to derive the estimated area occupied by a certain land use. Land use change in Songco is influenced by a high demand of agricultural products. Furthermore, inappropriate farming systems such as up and down planting that vegetable growers practice has caused severe soil erosion, leading to the decline on crop yield due to the removal of soil nutrients. Moreover, the off-site effect of soil erosion are siltation and sedimentation which carry traces of pesticides and chemical contaminants into water bodies which are likely to degrade water quality and may create health problems for farm families and those living downstream (Coxhead et. al. 2005).},

Abstract = {Vegetation species maps are useful for forestry managements and environmental ecological study. From the forestry management, broad and conifer leaf forest should be mapped. In addition to them, land-cover mapping data with high resolution is needed as validation data sets for low resolution's land-cover mapping results. SGLI sensor on board GCOM-C satellite, which will be launched in 2014, has 250m spatial resolution and it's data will be used for making global land-cover data set. ALOS satellite was launched in 2006. It has AVNIR-2 sensor and PRISM sensor. AVNIR-2 sensor has four spectral bands 460, 560, 650 and 830nm with 10-m spatial resolution. PRISMsensor has panchromatic band from 520nm to 770 nm with 2.5m spatial resolution. If use the both of image, pseudo high spatial multi-spectal image can be processed. Because of the spatial resolution and multi-spectral information, these sensor data are expected to useful for making high resolution land-cover data set. We have developed Universal Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM)(Zhang, L.F. et. al, 2006 (Zhang et al., 2006)) and Modified Vegetation Index based on UPDM (MVIUPD)(Zhang, L. F. et. al, 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007) and Xiong, Y., 2005 (?)) for satellite sensor data analysis for land cover mapping and vegetation monitoring. In the UPDM method, three coefficients of water, vegetation and soil is calculated using three standard patterns of water, vegetation and soil. One of this method's characteristics is the UPDM coefficients from different sensors for the same object being same as each other. The capability of vegetation species mapping was studied with ALOS/AVNIR-2 data and UPDM method. Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, deciduous forest, bamboo forest, orchard and grass land can be classified using AVNIR-2 summer and winter data. In this study, AVNIR-2 and PRISM data are used for vegetation types mapping using universal pattern decomposition method. Firstly, the pan-sharpen image was processed using AVNIR-2 and PRISM data. Each band's Digital Number (DN) value of AVNIR-2's band is calculated using DN of PRISM and AVNIR-2. The reflectance of AVNIR-2 is calculated from calculated DN values. UPDM method is applied to the set of re-calculated reflectance. Using the coefficients of UPDM and vegetation index, evergreen forest and deciduous forest were classified using two seasonal data. These results are compared with forest resource information. The tendency was agree with each other, although detailed validation is needed. From these results, the UPDM method can be applied to pan-sharpen image and the pan-sharpen image can be used for vegetation type classification. In the near future, calculation methods with retaining the original reflectance should be improved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a summary of the work done within the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ECLIPSE (Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants). ECLIPSE had a unique systematic concept for designing a realistic and effective mitigation scenario for short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs; methane, aerosols and ozone, and their precursor species) and quantifying its climate and air quality impacts, and this paper presents the results in the context of this overarching strategy. The first step in ECLIPSE was to create a new emission inventory based on current legislation (CLE) for the recent past and until 2050. Substantial progress compared to previous work was made by including previously unaccounted types of sources such as flaring of gas associated with oil production, and wick lamps. These emission data were used for present-day reference simulations with four advanced Earth system models (ESMs) and six chemistry transport models (CTMs). The model simulations were compared with a variety of ground-based and satellite observational data sets from Asia, Europe and the Arctic. It was found that the models still underestimate the measured seasonality of aerosols in the Arctic but to a lesser extent than in previous studies. Problems likely related to the emissions were identified for northern Russia and India, in particular. To estimate the climate impacts of SLCPs, ECLIPSE followed two paths of research: the first path calculated radiative forcing (RF) values for a large matrix of SLCP species emissions, for different seasons and regions independently. Based on these RF calculations, the Global Temperature change Potential metric for a time horizon of 20 years (GTP(20)) was calculated for each SLCP emission type. This climate metric was then used in an integrated assessment model to identify all emission mitigation measures with a beneficial air quality and short-term (20-year) climate impact. These measures together defined a SLCP mitigation (MIT) scenario. Compared to CLE, the MIT scenario would reduce global methane (CH4) and black carbon (BC) emissions by about 50 and 80 \%, respectively. For CH4, measures on shale gas production, waste management and coal mines were most important. For non-CH4 SLCPs, elimination of high-emitting vehicles and wick lamps, as well as reducing emissions from gas flaring, coal and biomass stoves, agricultural waste, solvents and diesel engines were most important. These measures lead to large reductions in calculated surface concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. We estimate that in the EU, the loss of statistical life expectancy due to air pollution was 7.5 months in 2010, which will be reduced to 5.2 months by 2030 in the CLE scenario. The MIT scenario would reduce this value by another 0.9 to 4.3 months. Substantially larger reductions due to the mitigation are found for China (1.8 months) and India (11-12 months). The climate metrics cannot fully quantify the climate response. Therefore, a second research path was taken. Transient climate ensemble simulations with the four ESMs were run for the CLE and MIT scenarios, to determine the climate impacts of the mitigation. In these simulations, the CLE scenario resulted in a surface temperature increase of 0.70 +/- 0.14 K between the years 2006 and 2050. For the decade 2041-2050, the warming was reduced by 0.22 +/- 0. 07 K in the MIT scenario, and this result was in almost exact agreement with the response calculated based on the emission metrics (reduced warming of 0.22 +/- 0.09 K). The metrics calculations suggest that non-CH4 SLCPs contribute similar to 22 \% to this response and CH4 78 \%. This could not be fully confirmed by the transient simulations, which attributed about 90 \% of the temperature response to CH4 reductions. Attribution of the observed temperature response to non-CH4 SLCP emission reductions and BC specifically is hampered in the transient simulations by small forcing and co-emitted species of the emission basket chosen. Nevertheless, an important conclusion is that our mitigation basket as a whole would lead to clear benefits for both air quality and climate. The climate response from BC reductions in our study is smaller than reported previously, possibly because our study is one of the first to use fully coupled climate models, where unforced variability and sea ice responses cause relatively strong temperature fluctuations that may counteract (and, thus, mask) the impacts of small emission reductions. The temperature responses to the mitigation were generally stronger over the continents than over the oceans, and with a warming reduction of 0.44 K (0.39-0.49) K the largest over the Arctic. Our calculations suggest particularly beneficial climate responses in southern Europe, where surface warming was reduced by about 0.3 K and precipitation rates were increased by about 15 (6-21) mm yr(-1) (more than 4 \% of total precipitation) from spring to autumn. Thus, the mitigation could help to alleviate expected future drought and water shortages in the Mediterranean area. We also report other important results of the ECLIPSE project.},

Abstract = {The black soil area in Northeast China serves as a ``ballast{''} to ensure China's food security. Unreasonable development and utilization lead to serious black soil degradation in some areas and affect regional food production and economic and social development. In the context of the intensification of the contradiction between food supply and demand worldwide, we should pay more attention to the overall situation of regional sustainable development and seek for systematic, scientific, and economic solutions. This study establishes a regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary on the basis of the regional system of human-land relationship, customized and accurate management, agricultural system theory, and agricultural informatization with the guidance of integrated geography concept. The aim of this regional all-for-one customization model is to systematically diagnose the key problems and leading factors of black soil degradation and determine a solution that combines the commonness and individuality of black soil protection from the perspective of multiscale linkage, multifactor coupling, and multitechnology cooperation. The regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary integrates the two perspectives of ``regional{''} and ``customization{''} into the protection and comprehensive utilization of black soil for the first time. It adopts zoning, grading, and classification as the main strategy and big data and artificial intelligence as the main technical approaches. This model constructs three strategies of different scales by combining the ``satellite-air-ground-network{''} 3D monitoring system and the all-for-one customization platform driven by big data and artificial intelligence. First, the ``implementing strategies by regions{''} are implemented at the regional scale to formulate the regional agricultural resource allocation scheme and agricultural zoning, which can provide strategies to protect and utilize black soil effectively. Second, the ``determining strategies in accordance with villages{''} are implemented at the village scale to formulate a black soil protection and utilization model for different categories of villages, which can promote the organic integration of black soil protection and rural revitalization. Third, a ``one strategy for one field{''} concept is applied at the field scale to provide accurate strategies for soil restoration and yield improvement in a fixed, quantitative, and regular manner. Multiscale integrated demonstration and scheme verification of the regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary are conducted in Qiqihar City at three scales, namely, region, village, and field, to solve the key issues in black soil protection and utilization and form a replicable and popularized system solution, thereby providing a model for the sustainable development of Chinese and global black soil agriculture. The proposed regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary has important theoretical and practical value in promoting the high-quality development of regional agriculture and rural revitalization, and provides a demonstration model of land protection and utilization for the black soil area in China and the whole world.},

Title = {Eighty-metre resolution 3D soil-attribute maps for Tasmania, Australia},
Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {8},
Pages = {932-955},
Abstract = {Until recently, Tasmanian environmental modelling and assessments requiring important soil inputs relied on conventionally derived soil polygons that were mapped up to 75 years ago. In the `Wealth from Water' project, digital soil mapping (DSM) was used in a pilot project to map the suitability of 20 different agricultural enterprises over 70 000 ha. Following on from this, the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries Parks Water and Environment has applied DSM to existing soil datasets to develop enterprise suitability predictions across the whole state in response to further expansion of irrigation schemes. The soil surfaces generated have conformed and contributed to the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia, a superset of GlobalSoilMap.net specifications. The surfaces were generated at 80-m resolution for six standard depths and 13 soil properties (e.g. pH, EC, organic carbon, sand and silt percentages and coarse fragments), in addition to several Tasmanian enterprise-suitability soil-attribute parameters. The modelling used soil site data with available explanatory state-wide spatial variables, including the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model and derivatives, gamma-radiometrics, surface geology, and multi-spectral satellite imagery. The DSM has delivered realistic mapping for most attributes, with acceptable validation diagnostics and relatively low uncertainty ranges in data-rich areas, but performed marginally in terms of uncertainty ranges in areas such as the World Heritage-listed Southwest of the state, with a low existing soil site density. Version 1.0 soil-attribute maps form the foundations of a dynamic and evolving new infrastructure that will be improved and re-run with the future collection of new soil data. The Tasmanian mapping has provided a localised integration with the National Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia, and it will guide future investment in soil information capture by quantitatively targeting areas with both high uncertainties and important ecological or agricultural value.},

Title = {The feasibility study of offshore wind energy potential in Kijal, Malaysia: the new alternative energy source exploration in Malaysia},
Journal = {ENERGY EXPLORATION \& EXPLOITATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {329-344},
Abstract = {Nowadays, many countries have been endeavoring to explore and exploit the offshore wind energy in terms of solving the problem of limitations of onshore wind energy. Wind energy is one of potential alternative for generating electricity in Malaysia. The offshore wind speed is better compared to onshore, so there is more potential contribution by offshore wind power in terms of electricity generation. This paper provides a summary of the offshore wind resources of the Kijal, Malaysia by analyzing the QuikSCAT satellite data which is available and can be downloaded from the WindPRO application. Based on these datasets, wind resources are assessed, and economical efficiency is evaluated by means of the expected capacity factor. Research was conducted using WindPRO and WAsP software to assess the potential of wind energy along the South China Sea in Kijal, Terengganu. Seven models of the wind turbines with different rated power; 110kW, 225kW, 275kW, 600kW, 850kW, 1000kW and 1250kW are taken for energy and economic feasibility analyses. The wind turbine with rated power 850 kW was indicated as the best wind turbine for installation in Kijal based on its best capacity factor, 26.8\% In economical aspect, Malaysia does not have Feed in Tariff (FiT) rates for offshore wind projects, thus the range of predicted FiT rates, RM 0.30 to RM 2.00 were tested by using Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback Period (PBP) calculation. Finally, the conducive FiT rates for wind projects with secured investment were identified and the rates were in range RM 0.80 to RM 1.38. The overall results suggest that the wind energy has a bright future for use as an alternative source for generating electricity in Kijal, Malaysia.},

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6\%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4\%). Although the land cover class ``wood sites{''} increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Detecting collective behaviour in animal relocation data, with application to migrating caribou},

Abstract = {1. Collective behaviour can allow populations to have emergent responses to uncertain environments, driven by simple interactions among nearby individuals. High-throughput ethological studies, where individual behaviour is closely observed in each member of a population (typically in the laboratory or by simulation), have revealed that collective behaviour in populations requires only rudimentary cognitive abilities in individuals and could therefore represent a widespread adaptation to life in an uncertain world. However, the ecological significance of collective behaviour is not yet well understood, as most studies to date have been confined to specialized situations that allow intensive monitoring of individual behaviour. 2. Here, we describe a way to screen for collective behaviour in ecological data that is sampled at a coarser resolution than the underlying behavioural processes. We develop and test the method in the context of a well-studied model for collective movement in a noisy environmental gradient. The large-scale distribution patterns associated with collective behaviour are difficult to distinguish from the aggregated responses of independent individuals in this setting because independent individuals also align to track the gradient. However, we show that collective idiosyncratic deviations from the mean gradient direction have high predictive value for detecting collective behaviour. We describe a method of testing for these deviations using the average normalized velocity of the population. 3. We demonstrate the method using data from satellite tracking collars on the migration patterns of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), recovering evidence that collective behaviour is a key driver of caribou migration patterns. We find moreover that the relative importance of collective behaviour fluctuates seasonally, concurrent with the timing of migration and reproduction. 4. Collective behaviour is a potentially widespread dynamic property of populations that can, in some cases, be detected in coarsely sampled ecological data.},

Abstract = {Reliable and accurate environmental state prediction can help in long-term sustainable planning and management. Enormous land-use/ land-cover (LULC) transformation has been increasing the carbon emissions (CEs) and land surface temperature (LST) around the world. The study aimed to (i) examine the influences of land specific CEs on LST dynamics and (ii) simulate future potential LULC, CEs and LST pattern of Khulna City Corporation. Landsat satellite images of the year 2000, 2010 and 2020 were used to derive LULC, LST and CEs pattern and change. The correlation between land-use indices (NDBI, NDVI, NDWI) and LST was examined to explore the impacts of LULC change on LST. Unplanned urbanization has increased 11.79 Km(2)(26.10\%) buildup areas and 25,268 tons of CEs during 2000-2020. The calculated R-2 value indicates the strong positive correlation between CEs and LST. To simulate the future LULC, CEs and LST pattern for the year 2030 and 2040, multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC)-based artificial neural network model was utilized with the accuracy rate of 94.12\%, 99\% and 98.48\% for LULC, LST and CEs model, respectively. The simulation shows that by 2040, buildup area will increase to 87.33\%, net CEs will increase by 19.82x 10(4)tons, and carbon absorptions will decrease by 23. 55 x 10(4)tons and 69.54\% of the total study area's LST will be above 39 degrees C. Such predictions signify the necessity of implementing a sustainable urban development plan immediately for the sustainable, habitable and sound urban environment.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to develop a methodological approach to the problem of a quantitative assessment of the technical level (technical excellence) of geostationary telecommunication satellites (GTS). The technical level indicator is a quantitative measure for assessing the perfection of the design of a product and the quality of products (services) produced with its use. This is an important technical and economic indicator of experimental design work. The value of the technical level indicator is one of the determining factors in the competitiveness of the created space system. The paper discusses the existing methodological approaches to the quantitative assessment of the technical level of science-intensive and technically complex products. We present a new approach to determine the composition of technical performance markers for calculating the GTS technical level indicator allowing a formal description of the beneficial effect and a logical scheme for quantifying the technical level. The methodological approach to calculate the degree of influence of technical efficiency indicators on the value of the beneficial effect of the use of GTS is stated as well. It is based on a mathematical model of the hierarchy analysis introduced by T Saaty, complemented by us with mathematical models for the best consideration of GTS technical features. It allowed us to ensure control of errors and contradictions in expert judgments involved in the preparation of initial data of =measurable or hardly measurable techno-economic indicators of GTS. Due to the higher level of formalization of the process of quantifying the technical level and the application of mathematical methods used in modern decision theory, the developed methodological approach serves to improve the quality of calculations significantly and to reduce the influence of the subjective factor in determining the value of the technical level indicator. Based on the above, we developed a method for quantitative assessment of the GTS technical level that meets the modern requirements.},

Title = {A design of real-time unipath polarization imaging system based on Wollaston prism},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {A real-time polarization imaging system employing the Wollaston prism and a single charge-coupled device (CCD) chip covering a wavelength range of 400-650 nm is proposed to avoid the false polarization information from dynamic scenes in non-real-time polarization detection imaging method. An architecture consisting of telescope lens, collimation lens, Wollaston prism, the imaging lens and a single CCD chip is employed in the system. The telescope lens is used to focus the incoming light on an intermediate image. And after collimation, the beam is angularly separated by the Wollaston prism. Two beams corresponding to ordinary light and extraordinary light are subsequently focused on the CCD plane via the imaging lens. The telescope lens is designed to have a telecentric structure in the imaging space, and the invert of which is used as the collimation lens, the completely symmetrical structure design is used to reduce the influence of aberrations. More abundant details from this system can be obtained by using matched image post-processing strategy, which is beneficial to high-quality target detection with enhanced working distance and improved environment adaptability. After joint-designing and optimization, the system modulation transfer function value at cutoff frequency is higher than 0.55, and the root-mean-square radius of the system is less than 5.3 mu m, which is smaller than the pixel size of the CCD detector. Additionally, the lateral chromatic aberration of the system is much smaller than the diameter of airy disk, and the absolute values of all kinds of aberrations are kept smaller than 0.02 at the same time. The calculation results show that all the aberrations are mostly corrected. The system imaging is numerically modeled and analyzed, and it is demonstrated that two intensity images with perpendicular polarization states appear adjacently on the CCD plane simultaneously in the imaging simulation. One image is formed with the fraction of the backscattered light polarized parallelly to the incident light, and the other with light polarized orthogonally to the incidence, indicating that the expected design is accomplished. Compared with the traditional amplitude-split polarization imaging system, the proposed real-time polarization imaging system shows that the improved performance for real-time detection with promoted power efficiency, spatial resolution, and the light crosstalk in focal plane is well handled. Moreover, the joint design of the whole system can compensate for the distortion aberration in the vertical direction of the CCD detector, which means that a further improvement of image quality can be expected. The proposed system has a promising perspective in the fields of underwater imaging detection, astronomical observation, remote sensing, biological tissues inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

Title = {Quantitative estimation of sentinel-1A interferometric decorrelation using vegetation index},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Sentinel-1A data are widely used in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) studies due to the free and open access policy. However, the short wavelength (C-band) of Sentinal-1A data leads to decorrelation in numerous applications, especially in vegetated areas. Phase blurring and reduced monitoring accuracy can occur owing to changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of vegetation during the satellite revisit period, which essentially makes poor use of SAR data and increases the time and economic costs for researchers. Interferometric coherence is a commonly used index to measure the interference quality of two single-look complex (SLC) images, and its value can be used to characterize the decorrelation degree. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is obtained from optical images, and its value can be used to characterize the surface vegetation coverage. In order to solve the problem that Sentinel-1A decorrelation in the vegetated area is difficult to estimate prior to single-look complex interference, this paper selects a vegetated area in Sichuan Province, China as the study area and establishes two two-order linear quantitative models between Landsat8-derived normalized difference vegetation index and Sentinel-1A interferometric coherence in co- and cross-polarization: When NDVI at extremely high and low levels, coherence is close to zero, while NDVI and coherence show two different linear relationships in co- and cross-polarization in terms of NDVI at the middle level. The models global error basically obeys the normal distribution with the mean value of -0.037 and -0.045, and the standard deviation of 0.205 and 0.201 at the VV and VH channels. The two models are then validated in two validation areas, and the results confirm the reliability of the models and reveal the relationships between Sentinel-1A InSAR decorrelation and vegetation coverage in co- and cross-polarization, thus demonstrating that the NDVI can be applied to quantitatively estimate the InSAR decorrelation in vegetated area of Sentinel-1A data in both polarization modes prior to SLC interference.},

Abstract = {Timely and accurate acquisition of crop area is of great significance for monitoring crop growth and estimation of crop yields. And it's important for strengthening agricultural management, ensuring food security and supply of agricultural products. The combination of remote sensing data with traditional sampling methods is an effective way to monitor and estimate crop area on a large scale. The traditional sampling method, on the basis of traditional statistics theory which studies the laws of random variables, requires that the sampling units should satisfy the principle of mutual independence. However, the regional crops, which are affected by natural conditions and socioeconomic factors, are often spatial variable. There is no report on whether and how spatial variability will influence the sampling efficiency of crop acreage. Therefor the further improvement of sampling efficiency is limited. To solve this problem, a variation function model was constructed with the area ratio between maize or rice and sampling units as object variable on 10 sampling unit scales combining remote sensing data, spatial analysis and traditional sampling methods with Dehui, Jilin as study area. Selecting base value as index for spatial variability within the sampling unit, the effect of sampling unit scales on spatial variability of maize and rice were quantitatively analyzed. Three commonly used sampling schemes (random sampling, systematic sampling and stratified sampling) were selected for sample selection, overall extrapolation and error estimation. The sampling efficiency was quantitatively evaluated using overall relative error (r) of the sampling extrapolation, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the total estimate and the sample size (n) on different sampling unit scales. The results show that the spatial variability of maize and rice decreases with the increase of the sampling unit scale. The range of base value is {[}0.15, 0.20] and {[}0.05, 0.14] for maize and wheat respectively. Using the three sampling methods to extrapolate the maize and rice area separately: 1) Under the same sampling ratio, the relative sampling errors of the two crops' area estimations gradually increase with the decrease of spatial variability (the sampling unit size increases), the coefficient of variation also shows an increasing trend, and the sampling accuracy and extrapolation stability is affected by spatial variability; 2) The relative error in estimation of the two crop areas varies with the sampling method,when using simple random sampling and systematic sampling, the relative error of the two crops was within the range of (1`)/0, 50\%) and (0.5\%, 40\%), and the coefficient of variation was limited to (1\%, 75 A) and In the range of (1\%, 88\%), the relative errors at all scales were limited to 10\% or less with stratified sampling, and the fluctuations of the coefficient of variation were small (both within 0.3\% and 20\%). Therefore, the stratification was selected. Sampling is the best sampling method; 3) When the sampling method is determined, the sampling ratio is the main factor determining the sampling efficiency. As the sampling ratio increases, the rate of change of the relative error of the two crop area estimators gradually decreases, when the sampling fraction reaches S\%, The relative error is basically limited to 5\%, and the coefficient of variation is stable within 12\% On this basis, the effect of increasing the sampling ratio to increase the sampling progress is minimal; 4) According to the conclusions of 2) and 3), Stratified sampling method is used to extrapolate crop area by 5\% sampling ratio. The sampling efficiency decreases with the increase of sampling unit size. When the sampling unit size is limited within 3500mx3500m, the overall sampling satisfies 95\% sampling accuracy requirements., And the coefficient of variation is stable within 7\%, the stability of the extrapolation of the area is also high; 5) Based on the above research conclusions, the quantitative evaluation sampling efficiency scheme and the optimal sampling model composed of the combination of sampling unit scale (spatial variability), sampling fraction, extrapolated total relative error, and variation coefficient were finally obtained. This study provides a reference for the design of a rational spatial sampling schemes of spatial variable crops.},

Title = {Improved Classification Models to Distinguish Natural from Anthropic Oil Slicks in the Gulf of Mexico: Seasonality and Radarsat-2 Beam Mode Effects under a Machine Learning Approach},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Distinguishing between natural and anthropic oil slicks is a challenging task, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, where these events can be simultaneously observed and recognized as seeps or spills. In this study, a powerful data analysis provided by machine learning (ML) methods was employed to develop, test, and implement a classification model (CM) to distinguish an oil slick source (OSS) as natural or anthropic. A robust database containing 4916 validated oil samples, detected using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), was employed for this task. Six ML algorithms were evaluated, including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), naive Bayes (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR). Using RF, the global CM achieved a maximum accuracy value of 73.15. An innovative approach evaluated how external factors, such as seasonality, satellite configurations, and the synergy between them, limit or improve OSS predictions. To accomplish this, specific classification models (SCMs) were derived from the global ones (CMs), tuning the best algorithms and parameters according to different scenarios. Median accuracies revealed winter and spring to be the best seasons and ScanSAR Narrow B (SCNB) as the best beam mode. The maximum median accuracy to distinguish seeps from spills was achieved in winter using SCNB (83.05). Among the tested algorithms, RF was the most robust, with a better performance in 81\% of the investigated scenarios. The accuracy increment provided by the well-fitted models may minimize the confusion between seeps and spills. This represents a concrete contribution to reducing economic and geologic risks derived from exploration activities in offshore areas. Additionally, from an operational standpoint, specific models support specialists to select the best SAR products and seasons for new acquisitions, as well as to optimize performances according to the available data.},

Abstract = {Purpose The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is facing a rapid growth in energy demand mainly because of factors like burgeoning population, economic growth, modernization and infrastructure development. It is estimated that between 2000 and 2017 the power consumption has increased from 120 to 315 TWh. The building sector has an important role in this respect as it accounts for around 80 percent of the total electricity consumption. The situation is imposing significant energy, environmental and economic challenges for the country. To tackle these problems and curtail its dependence on oil-based energy infrastructure, KSA is aiming to develop 9.5 GW of renewable energy projects by 2030. The campus of the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) has been considered as a case study. In the wake of recently announced net-metering policy, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the prospects of rooftop application of PV in buildings. ArcGIS and PVsyst software have been used to determine the rooftop area and undertake PV system modeling respectively. Performance of PV system has been investigated for both horizontal and tilted installations. The study also investigates the economic feasibility of the PV application with the help of various economic parameters such as benefit cost ratio, simple payback period (SPP) and equity payback periods. An environmental analysis has also been carried out with the help of RETScreen software to determine the savings in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of PV system. Design/methodology/approach This study examines the buildings of the university campus for utilizable rooftop areas for PV application. Various types of structural, architectural and utilities-related features affecting the use of building roofs for PV have been investigated to determine the corrected area. To optimize the performance of the PV system as well as space utilization, modeling has been carried out for both horizontal and tilted applications of panels. Detailed economic and environmental assessments of the rooftop PV systems have also been investigated in detail. Modern software tools such as PVsyst, ArcGIS and RETScreen have also been used for system design calculations. Findings Saudi Arabia is embarking on a massive solar energy program as it plans to have over 200 GW of installed capacity by 2030. With solar energy being the most abundant of the available renewable resource for the country, PV is going to be one of the main technologies in achieving the set targets. The country has, however, unlike global trends, traditionally overlooked the small-scale and building-related application of solar PV, focusing mainly on larger projects. This study explores the prospects of utilization of solar PV on building roofs. Building rooftops are constrained in terms of PV application owing to wide ranging obstacles that can be classified into five types - structural, services, accessibility, maintenance and others. The total building rooftop area in the study zone, calculated through ArcGIS has been found to be 857,408 m(2) of which 352,244 m(2) is being used as car parking and hence is not available for PV application. The available roof area, 505,165 m(2) is further hampered by construction and utilities related features including staircases, HVAC systems, skylights, water tanks and satellite dish antennas. Taking into account the relevant obstructive features, the net rooftop area covered by PV panels has been found to be in the range 25-41 percent depending upon the building typology, with residential buildings offering the least. To optimize both the system efficiency and space utilization, PV modeling has been carried out with the help of PVsyst software for both the tilted and horizontal installations. In terms of output, PV panels with tilt angle of 24 degrees have been found to be 9 percent more efficient compared to the horizontally installed ones. Modeling results provide a net annual output 37,750 and 46,050 MWh from 21.44 and 28.51 MW of tilted and horizontal application of PV panels, sufficient to respectively meet 16 and 20 percent of the total campus electricity requirements. Findings of the economic analysis reveal the average SPP for horizontal and tilted applications of the PV to be 9.2 and 8.4 years, respectively. The benefit cost ratio for different types of buildings for horizontal and tilted application has been found to be ranging between 0.89 and 2.08 and 0.83 and 2.15, respectively. As electricity tariff in Saudi Arabia has been increased this year by as much as 45 percent and there are plans to remove \$54bn of subsidy by 2020, the cost effectiveness of PV systems will be greatly helped. Application of PV in buildings can significantly improve their environmental performance as the findings of this study reveal that the annual greenhouse gas emission in the KFUPM campus can be reduced by as much as 40,199 tons carbon dioxide equivalent. Originality/value The PV application on building roof especially from economic perspective is an area which has not been addressed thus far. Khan et al. (2017) studied the power generation potential for PV application on residential buildings in KSA. Asif (2016) also investigated power output potential of PV system in different types of buildings. Dehwas et al. (2018) adopted a detailed approach to determine utilizability of PV on residential building roofs. None of these studies have covered the economics of PV systems. This study attempts to address the gap and contribute to the scholarship on the subject. It targets to determine the power output from different types of building in an urban environment by taking into account building roof conditions. It also provides detailed economic assessment of PV systems. Subsequent environmental savings are also calculated.},

Abstract = {The territorial spatial planning in the new era strengthens the control of different functional spaces and emphasizes integrated and coordinated development of each functional space. Therefore, it is important to monitor the ``structure-function{''} characteristics of water-ecological space based on the context of territorial spatial planning and develop a management and control framework. Based on land use and social statistics, and with the help of ArcGIS analysis, this paper examined the structure and function of the water-ecological space in the Dongting Lake study for 2010, 2015, and 2020, generating a control framework and proposing key initiatives. The main results are as follows: 1) The overall scale of the water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study is over 7,300 km(2). Water bodies had the largest share, followed by coastal terrestrial areas, while the land-water ecotone was the smallest. There was a small decrease in the water ecological space during the study period. Yueyang had the largest overall scale of water ecological space, while Linli had the smallest. 2) The comprehensive function of water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study was about 0.4000, increasing somewhat during the study period. Among the units, the comprehensive function value was highest in Yuanjiang City, while Jincheng City had the lowest. 3) From the structural elements of water ecological space, scientific planning of functional zoning of water ecological space should be carried out and combined with the delineation of ``three zones and three lines.{''} Key initiatives such as multi-scale and multi-level planning and control, use control and access restrictions, determination of water ecological space ownership, pollution control and accountability, and comprehensive water ecological treatment and restoration should be promoted.},

Title = {Grizzly bear selection of recently harvested forests is dependent on forest recovery rate and landscape composition},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {449},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Forests in the early stages of regeneration are valuable habitat for threatened grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations inhabiting the interior mountains of North America, with forest management affecting the timing, prevalence, and quality of such habitats. Forest harvesting can lead to early-seral habitat, however the quality and duration of post-harvest habitat compared to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire), is not known. North American silvicultural practices are mandated to ensure tree regrowth following harvesting, and a rapid rate of growth in managed tree regeneration may lead to a shorter time window during which attractive early-seral habitat is available to bears compared to natural forest disturbances. The distribution of natural disturbances across forested landscapes may also be an important consideration in the response of bears to forest harvesting. In this study, we analyzed grizzly bear habitat selection for 160 collared grizzly bears across 118,000-km(2) (68\% of their known habitat) in Alberta, Canada, using metrics of forest disturbance and recovery derived from a 33-year satellite time series. We developed seasonal resource selection functions to evaluate (1) if selection of recently harvested forests was contingent upon the availability of natural disturbances, (2) how habitat selection within disturbed areas varied across disturbance types, and (3) how habitat suitability changed over time during the first 30 years of forest recovery following various disturbance types. Results showed that, compared to areas not recently disturbed, grizzly bears were up to three times more likely to select for harvested forests when natural disturbances were limited in their home range, while selection of harvested forests was neutral when natural disturbances were abundant. When available, grizzly bears were more likely to select for natural disturbances compared to harvested locations, especially during Hypophagia (spring) and Hyperphagia (fall). Selection of harvested locations was inversely related to forest recovery assessed by spectral analysis and decreased sharply 15-20 years post-harvest, at which point it tended to be lower than pre-disturbance. This study demonstrates the utility of vegetation, disturbance, and recovery metrics derived from satellite time series for enriching our understanding of wildlife habitat selection in dynamic landscapes. Our results also have implications for forest management in regions where grizzly bear habitat availability and selection patterns are important. While rapid forest recovery following harvest is desirable and beneficial for a multitude of ecological and economic objectives, it appears to minimize the period of attractive early-seral habitat for grizzly bears.},

Abstract = {For the last two decades, since the Rio Conference on Environment and Development, land-use planning (LUP) has been carrying the hopes of providing a concrete instrument to translate sustainable development discourses into practice. In the Lao PDR, it is being seen as a way to provide alternatives to swidden agriculture and more recently, as an instrument to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD). However, when assessing the impact of past LUP, many observers have noted the discrepancy between good intentions, as displayed in policy and project documents, and actual implementation due to the limited capacity of local institutions (Lestrelin et al., 2011a). Overcoming such a problem requires an objective analysis of its extent and its potential negative consequences. To avoid blind trust in delusive success stories, evaluation methods assessing the quality of the LUP process (i.e. level of community participation and understanding of LUP activities by local stakeholders) have been designed (Lestrelin et al., 2011b). From the perspective of developing a country-wide monitoring system for participatory land use planning (PLUP), this paper addresses two main research questions: How to assess the quality of a PLUP output, i.e. measuring the gap between principles and practice in PLUP? What can be done to increase the credibility, and therefore the practicality and feasibility, of the proposed land use plans? By analysing land zoning outputs from past and recent PLUP this paper underlines the irrationality of village LUP maps which often appear inconsistent with the principles of land use policies. In general the management of rural landscapes in the uplands of Lao PDR is difficult to grasp due to a tacit agreement between villagers willing to minimize land taxes and district authority lacking proper human and financial resources. Acknowledging the gap between the declared agricultural land from household surveys and what can be observed from satellite or village land use maps, the paper proposes a new approach to increase planning realism while reinforcing local participation in the PLUP process. An innovative participatory platform involving local communities in learning the complexities of LUP through a role-play was proposed by Bourgoin and Castella (2011). The authors argued that a landscape simulation exercise can help disclose the landscape management and livelihood strategies of different stakeholders at different scales. Building on this knowledge, this paper describes a negotiation platform allowing villagers discuss land zoning and management practices. Adaptive and accessible, the method is assisted by a participatory 3D model combined with a village socio-economic and geographic information system providing feedback about cost/benefit associated with each land use plan. Through successive iterations, villagers gradually refine their plans by exploring land use change scenarios. Beside its contribution to enhanced participation in landscape planning, the proposed method, which was successfully tested in six study villages of Viengkham District, can support the introduction of innovative land use systems in the northern uplands of Lao PDR. Furthermore, this instrument can be used to certify land use plans and provide a standard procedure for PLUP implementation.},

Title = {AIRBORNE LIDAR IN SUPPORT OF COASTAL MAPPING AND HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING},
Booktitle = {GEOMATIC SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {175-195},
Abstract = {Tidal zones are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. They play a number of keys roles with respect to the fauna and flora they host by recycling organic matter, and also by providing spawning, hatching and feeding grounds for marine species as well as birds. However they are being strongly impacted by human activities while their social value to mankind is not fully acknowledged. The last two severe oil spills that affected the coastal zone of France (Erika, Prestige) aroused a renewed interest for the coastal zone. This trend was supported by strong incentives by European regulations, namely the Habitats and Water framework directives. This new situation revealed a dramatic lack of knowledge of our tidal areas. Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that uses the return time of backscattered laser light to measure ground elevation with high efficiency and accuracy. The geometry of the airborne system is very precisely controlled by a GPS and an inertial navigation system. The rate of coverage is up to 40 km(2) per hour and the dot density reaches more than one per m(2). Horizontal and vertical accuracies are respectively about 30 cm and 15 cm on bare ground. Over the last few years, the use of LIDAR has become more common in integrated coastal zone management. Detailed mapping of the elevation of tidal areas has brought about advances in many applications, among which: - Hydrodynamic modelling, which is based on fine knowledge of the bathymetry. Modelling is an essential tool to simulate the dispersion and fate of contaminants run off from watersheds into the coastal zone or to assess the trophic capacity of coastal waters with respect to shellfish farming. Modelling can also be used to model sediment removal, transport and deposition. Several LIDAR surveys have recently been carried out in various sites of the French coast where hydrodynamic models using cell size in the range of 30m are operational such as Mont Saint Michel and Morbihan bays. - Tidal habitats mapping needs detailed knowledge of both the relief and facies. Since 2004, the French benthic monitoring network Rebent has been dealing with the detailed inventory of a network of coastal sites. By jointly interpreting elevation data from LIDAR and airborne ortho-imagery with the help of ground truth data, maps were produced describing sediment facies and habitat units to a high level of detail. Combined with a tidal model, a LIDAR terrain model also yields the flooding frequency, a key driver to the presence of sea weed belts or salt marsh vegetation. - Coastal morpho-dynamics are concerned with understanding coastline and seashore changes under natural or human pressure. Natural events include storm surges or sea level rise, while human impact can be from coastal developments or aggregate extraction but also from bio-deposition in shellfish fanning areas. Repeated LIDAR surveys would allow monitoring the rate of erosion/deposition on our coasts, hence providing help to risk management.},

Title = {Vegetation index suites as indicators of vegetation state in grassland and savanna: An analysis with simulated SENTINEL 2 data for a North American transect},

Abstract = {Grasslands and savannas form a heterogeneous and patchy mosaic of spectral properties that are challenging characterization of vegetation states. This study examines the potential for use of suites of vegetation indices (VIs) from the proposed Sentinel 2 sensor to describe vegetation states in grasslands and savannas for a North American transect. Hyperion hyperspectral data from the EO-1 satellite were used to simulate Sentinel 2, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) images for field sites in Alberta, North Dakota and Texas that represent the continuum from short grass prairie to oak savanna and are intermingled with agriculture. Indices representing photosynthetic pigments (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Carotenoid Reflectance Index, Anthocyanin Reflectance Index and Red-Green Ratio), vegetation and landscape water content (Normalized Difference Infrared Index), senescent vegetation and soil (Short Wave Infrared Ratio and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index) and herbaceous biomass (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) were used. There were distinct differences among sites in the relative sensitivity of different VIs depending upon moisture status, tree cover and type of grassland. Simple multi-variate models based on mean values or VIs showed limited ability to predict land cover classes and nominal vegetation states. However, analysis of sample areas using pixels as individual observations within a statistical distribution indicated that subtle variation and gradients within management or land units could be used to characterize fine differences in selected nominal states at each site. Despite some differences in band locations, all VIs except the anthocyanin reflectance index were scalable between Sentinel 2 and MODIS and VIIRS data. A framework for using suites of VIs as indicators of vegetation states that could be applied to the state and transition model approach-applied by the US Natural Resource Conservation Service is described. Land types can be effectively characterized by pixel value distribution histograms, and statistical metrics may be used as indicators of status and change. However, time series are needed to fully capture states and state changes, since grasslands and savannas have such high levels of spectral and phenological variation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Quantitative Precipitation Estimation of Extremes in CONUS With Radar Data},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Constructing an accurate, continental, in-situ-based, kilometer-scale, long-term record of the precipitation field and its spatiotemporal changes remains a significant challenge. Here, we determine the extreme-value behavior of the NEXRAD Stage IV radar-based quantitative precipitation estimate. We find that the climatology of 5-year daily return values in the contiguous United States East of the Rocky Mountains shows only slight variability on spatial scales smaller than similar to 100 km. In light of this finding, we test whether rain-gauge-only daily precipitation data sets can produce accurate extreme-value behavior at spatial scales finer than the spacing between gauges. We find that the 5-year daily return values are accurate at locations far from rain gauges only if the interpolation between gauges is carried out appropriately for extremes. Precipitation statistics derived from in-situ rain gauge data are therefore of sufficient spatial resolution to faithfully capture daily extremes over much of the eastern United States. Plain Language Summary Accurate measurement of the amount of precipitation that falls within a given region and time period is crucial for environmental modeling, climate change research, and resource and risk management. For all of those applications, it is desirable to understand not only how much precipitation falls on average, but also how much precipitation falls during an extreme event, such as a severe storm. Using data from weather radar, we show that certain statistical properties of extreme rainfall are highly correlated on spatial scales up to 100 km over the eastern United States. This means that rain gauge networks, which have typical intergauge spacings of roughly 30 km over the eastern United States, are dense enough to accurately measure these statistical properties. However, it is imperative to interpolate between the rain gauge measurements in a way that explicitly captures extremes if the application of interest requires capturing extremes accurately. Our research represents a step toward constructing an accurate, continental-scale, long-term, high-resolution precipitation data set.},

Title = {Landsat Imagery Spectral Trajectories-Important Variables for Spatially Predicting the Risks of Bark Beetle Disturbance},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests. Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come from forests in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power, even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors, and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model. Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions. The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Estimate of daytime single-layer cloud base height from advanced baseline imager measurements},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Cloud base height (CBH) is an important parameter to describe cloud state and is highly related to the vertical motions in the atmosphere. CBH information is critical for both aviation safety and synoptic analysis. In this study, daytime CBH is estimated directly from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) level lb data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis (ERAS) data using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) machine learning technique. The CBH estimate algorithm, which is named as GETCBH, covers the same areal extent as the full disk of the ABI/GOES-16 and only for single-layer clouds. The 2-years of CBH measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite is used as the label (which is the true value/class of the model output for regression/classification problem in machine learning terminology). A quality flag algorithm using another machine learning technique, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees machine learning technique is developed to provide a confidence level for the CBH estimate. The evaluations show an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.87 km and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) of 0.92 before any quality control. After excluding CBH estimates with low confidence (19.2\% of all samples), the RMSE is reduced to 1.14 km, Pearson's r increases to 0.97, and 96\% of the estimates are within 2 km of the CALIOP results. By analyzing model bias and feature importance, cloud phase information has the biggest impact on the CBH estimate, although all input features have positive impact on the estimate accuracy. Limited by the penetrability of CALIOP, GETCBH is valid for clouds with COD < 8.5. The CBH estimates have reduced accuracy (Pearson's r of 0.88) for optically thin clouds (clouds with cloud optical depth {[}COD] < 0.1) where little cloud information is contained in the ABI measurements, as well as for optically thick clouds (clouds with COD >= 3) where a larger proportion of opaque clouds is excluded. Furthermore, for the GBTCBH model using 9 months of CloudSat measurements as label, the CBH estimates are improved with an RMSE of 1.41 km and Pearson's r of 0.92. In a case study of Hurricane Dorian, CBHs for most of the single-layer clouds are successfully estimated with small errors and flagged with high confidence, for both high and low clouds. Deep convective clouds and multi-layer clouds, both of which are not included in the training, are reasonably flagged as low confidence with large CBH estimate errors. In this particular case, 65\% of cloudy pixels have CBH estimate with high confidence in the scene. Daytime CBH with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution can be derived from ABI measurements using this methodology.},

Title = {3D ground-use optimisation for sustainable urban development planning: A case-study from Earls Court, London, UK},

Volume = {81},

Abstract = {By 2050, almost 70\% of the world's population will live in towns and cities. This places increasing pressure on land to support development whilst minimising environmental impact and providing long-term sustainability. Prior knowledge of the ground at the planning and development stage is needed to assess its suitability to meet planned subsurface uses and avoid subsurface conflicts at an early stage of design. This research tested the development and application of a 3D engineering geological model and its spatial integration with 2D (hydro)geological datasets to support sustainable development decision-making at Earls Court, London, UK. The 3D engineering geological model consists of seven geological layers extending from Made Ground to the top surface of the Chalk Group. The 3D geological model, and 2D datasets derived from it, are combined with 2D geospatial datasets of urban underground space (UUS) indicators to identify potential uses of urban underground space based on its suitability to do so. This is complimented by a qualitative assessment of the potential subsurface interactions between UUS indicator uses and their implications for delivering the sustainability and energy objectives specified in the Earls Court masterplan. Infiltration sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), ground source heat potential and foundation condition potential were chosen as suitable UUS indictors against which to test the outputs of the methodology. Infiltration SuDS potential was assessed using nationally-available (hydro)geological 2D GIS datasets. Ground source heat potential was assessed using national-available 2D datasets and estimates of thermal properties of each geological layer revealed by the 3D geological model. Potentially suitable foundation conditions were assessed using density data from existing ground investigations and depth of suitable geological layers derived from the 3D geological model. The results reveal constraints for the development of rapid infiltration SuDS but opportunities for bespoke design that considers the thickness of overlying permeable sand and gravel. It identifies the susceptibility of the London Clay Formation to potential volume change and ground movement based on an assessment of its plasticity. Closed-loop ground source heat pump opportunities exist depending on site-specific thermal and hydraulic properties and heat exchange design. Opportunities for the use of the Kempton Park Gravel Member for ground source heating and cooling and combined use of thermal regulation and pile design via thermopiles are identified. A qualitative assessment of potential benefits and conflicts between UUS indicator uses reveals that the Kempton Park Gravel Member and London Clay Formation are likely to have the highest, relative, UUS value. The results demonstrate that there is potential to modify the energy and sustainability components of the Earls Court masterplan prior to invasive ground investigation and development. It is further suggested that this approach can be used to compliment research-tested, semi-qualitative means of valuing UUS indicators. The implications of the methodology for mainstreaming UUS into city masterplans is also assessed. It is concluded that opportunities now exist for the integrated 3D and 2D spatial assessment of UUS indicators into city-scale masterplans.},

Abstract = {Maps of coral ecosystems are needed to Support many conservation and management objectives, as well as research activities. Examples include ground-truthing aerial and satellite imagery, characterizing essential habitat, assessing changes, and monitoring the progress of restoration efforts. To address some of these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey developed the Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based sensor package for mapping shallow-water bcnthic environments. ATRIS consists of a digital still camera, a video camera, and an acoustic depth sounder affixed to a moveable pole. This design, however, restricts its deployment to clear waters less than 10 in deep. To overcome this limitation, a towed version has been developed, referred to as Deep ATRIS. The system is based on a light-weight, computer-control led, towed vehicle that is capable of following a programmed diving profile. The vehicle is 1.3 in long with a 63-cm wing span and can carry a wide variety of research instruments, including CTDs, fluorometers, transmissometers, and cameras. Deep ATRIS is currently equipped with a high-speed (20 frames s(-1)) digital camera, custom-built light-emitting-diode lights, a compass, a 3-axis orientation sensor, and a nadir-looking altimeter. The vehicle dynamically adjusts its altitude to maintain a fixed height above the seafloor. The camera has a 29 degrees x 22 degrees field-of-view and captures color images that are 1360 x 1024 pixels in size. GPS coordinates are recorded for each image. A gigabit ethernet connection enables the images to be displayed and archived in real time on the surface computer. Deep ATRIS has a maximum tow speed of 2.6 in s(-1) and a theoretical operating tow-depth limit of 27 in. With an improved tow cable, the operating depth can be extended to 90 in. Here, we present results from the initial sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico and Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, and discuss the utility of Deep ATRIS for mapping coral reef habitats, Several example mosaics illustrate the high-quality imagery that can be obtained with this system. The images also reveal the potential for unobtrusive animal observations; fish and sea turtles are unperturbed by the presence of Deep ATRIS. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (Suppl. 1): 51-63.

Title = {Long Range Correlation in Vegetation Over West Africa From 1982 to 2011},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {119151-119165},
Abstract = {Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) data records offer important sources for long term correlation modelling over West Africa. In this study, we assessed long range correlations in half monthly NDVI records over West Africa from 1982 to 2011 using GIMMS NDVI. In our analysis, we assessed (a) the annual and seasonal trends obtained using Ordinary Linear Regression, (b) the detrended lag-1-autocorrelation C(1), (c) the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) scaling Hurst exponent h and (d) the Multifractal (MF) characteristics of NDVI. Results show that there exist some patterns or trends in the records that persist over time. The value of C(1) for NDVI was obtained as 0.989 is significant at 95\% confidence interval. Consequently, the scaling h values of the Hurst DFA showed that about 37.4, 20.5, 41.7 and 0.5\% of the vegetated areas are anti-correlated (h < 0.5), un-correlated (h = 0.5), correlated (0 :5 < h < 1) and uncorrelated random walk (h = 1), respectively. The trend analysis from Ordinary Least square Regression (OLR) shows that about 54.3, 0.1 and 45.6\% of the vegetated areas are positively, uncorrelated and negatively correlated, respectively. Our findings revealed that the DFA method performed better than OLR and the findings could be useful in identifying areas with improved and degraded vegetation, which cannot be properly captured by the OLR method. Accordingly, the comparison of the MF-DFA results of original data to those of shuffled and surrogate series indicated that the multifractal nature of considered time-series is both from PDF and long-range correlations but arguably, MF due to long range correlation dominates over West Africa. The research is therefore helpful in the formulating crop and environmental management policies that may be used to improve ecosystem management using a long term plan (inter-annual) or short term (inter-seasonal) planning.},

Title = {An integrated economic-ecological index based on satellite-derived carbon sequestration and carbon price: A case study during 2015-2020 in Shaanxi, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Abstract = {Carbon sequestration reflecting vegetation productivity is essential for global carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystems. Exploring the spatial and temporal variation of carbon sequestration and corresponding ecological values yields insights for policy formulation to mitigate carbon emission and achieve carbon neutrality. Hence, taking Shaanxi China as the case study, we developed an integrated index (named C-GDP) based on vegetation carbon sequestration estimated by the CASA model and carbon prices acquired from carbon trading market in China to explore tradeoffs between economic and ecological development. The spatiotemporal distributions of carbon sequestration and C-GDP were characterized using hotspot analysis and variation coefficient during 2015-2020. The estimated carbon sequestrations were assessed with promising accuracy, depicting high values in the south and low values in the north, with provincial averages of 1761.37gC/m2a. Temporally, carbon sequestrations increased with fluctuation between 2015 and 2020, with significant seasonality. Summertime, especially July, has the highest sequestration, while winter is the season with the lowest values. The C-GDP calculated by carbon sequestration and carbon price exhibited a distinct pattern with sequestration, with the highest C-GDP in Central Shaanxi and the lowest in the south. The multi-year provincial-mean C-GDP is 20.44 billion yuan. The C-GDP exhibited an increase trend with miniscule fluctuation, peaking at 23.66 billion yuan in 2020. The results imply the ecological value of carbon sequestration monetizing by carbon prices is much lower than economical value of production, suggesting that strict carbon policies, such as improving carbon prices or taxes, may be warranted for China because of high carbon mitigation costs.},

Abstract = {The economic pressure on the forest fund has led to imbalances, that endanger the sustainable development of local and regional economies. Quantification of these multiplication effects is one of the greatest challenges for public policies in the field of ecosystem protection. In this study we propose the analysis of the dynamics of the forest areas in the territorial administrative units that overlap the Apuseni Mountains, based on a data source processed from satellite images, for the period 2000-2017. The data source is the Global Forest Change database, designed to monitor forest dynamics and in particular forest loss. The raster images processed for the study area were extracted from this database. As a case study, we chose the Apuseni Mountains, which are part of the Western Carpathians, where forest exploitation has been particularly significant in recent years. The forest images were processed and then the forest dynamics was calculated for all administrative units overlapping the analyzed area. The obtained results highlighted the added value of the methodology proposed in the assessment of cut forests in each territorial administrative unit, it also highlights the advantages and limitations given by this spatial data source.},

Title = {Characterizing Spatiotemporal Patterns of Mangrove Forests in Can Gio Biosphere Reserve Using Sentinel-2 Imagery},

Abstract = {Featured Application This study proposes the features of mangrove forest variations in relation to anthropogenic activities under the forms of land use land cover changes around three ecological zones of a Biosphere Reserve area, using Sentinel-2 Imagery and spatial regression approaches that have wide application in natural resources, land use planning, and environmental management. This study aimed at evaluating the spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove forest variations for three ecological zones of the Can Gio biosphere reserve (i.e., core, buffer, and transition zones) and its relation to land use/land cover changes. Time series Sentinel-2 Imagery-which presents the Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained through the Google Earth Engine and Overlap Similarity Algorithm-was used to characterize vegetation cover in the study area. Furthermore, the Cohen's Kappa agreement was applied to examine the accuracy of mangrove classification, and the Mann-Kendal (MK) significance was used to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of mangrove forests. The results showed that an NDVI value greater than 0.3 recorded the reflected signal of mangrove population in the study area with anO-index greater than 0.85. A Cohen's Kappa statistic of agreement of 0.7 and an overall classification accuracy of 83\% was obtained. Regarding the trend in mangrove forest patterns, an increase in area of 669 ha and 579 ha explored at the buffer and core zones, respectively, while the largest declined mangrove area of 350 ha was investigated at the buffer zone, followed by a transition at 314 ha during the study period due to the interconversion of shrimp farming and the expansion of built-up areas. Moreover, the study also described the negative impacts of the sea-encroached urban-tourism zone on mangrove patterns in the foreseeable future. The results from this study will act as a basic fundamental authentic report for local governments in proposing strategies for the shielding of mangrove forests and economic development from negative consequences in foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {The knowledge management, like a strategic resource, has gained great importance for business development and knowledge transfer processes became a key issue in allowing firms to get new sources of information. The study looks at the reality of industrial districts, where, normally, equality and fairness create the conditions upon which firms share their own knowledge. However, often, these contexts, in contrasts to the traditional Marshallian industrial district (Marshall, 1879, Becattini, 1981), are characterized by an asymmetric power relationship among the parties, according to the Hub and Spoke district (Markusen, 1996). The case study of Val d'Agri, the most important Italian oil district, is an example of Hub-and-spoke District, with the dominance of a bigger firm (Eni) to manage all the relationship along the chain. The discovery of the Val d'Agri was made by ENI, in 1988. Purpose - Starting from the description of Val d'Agri district, our paper aims at mapping the local relationships, in order to define the way firms relate along the district value chain, with reference to both their position, and their own ``contractual power{''}; and to understand how firms position, as well as their different contractual power, affect knowledge transfer process within the district. Taking into account the ``Hub and Spoke{''} morphology, we support the idea that knowledge transfer is deeply affected by firms' contractual power, as well as by their position within the district. Explicit knowledge transfer is mainly linked to the development of production process; on the contrary, the transfer of tacit knowledge depends, above all, by the action people place within the district; so, human capital plays a very important role in transferring knowledge through imitation, work mobility and social interaction. Design/methodology/approach - We propose an empirical approach. This work will start providing an analysis of the main characteristics of the relational structure of Val d'Agri, in order to identify the main issues that can impact the development process of knowledge transfer. The study consists of two parts: in the first part, it will develop an analysis of the main national and international literature on the field, from both economic and managerial perspectives; in the second part, an empirical analysis will be developed. For the analysis were contacted about 100 firms of satellite ENI industries (the biggest ones), both the same ENI. Were sent questionnaires for asking questions about the company structure, specialization, the typology of formal relationships exists with the leader, the company's distinctive knowledge, the existence of knowledge management systems. Originality/value - Since the importance that both industrial districts and knowledge transfer have for firms competition, the paper aims at giving a new and valuable framework useful to understand, not only the district dynamics, but also the way knowledge transfer may be fostered among all the firms related along a given value chain. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application puts in evidence the peculiarity of an oil district, because the birth of this form of district is closely related to land resources. In addition, national laws and regulations that govern the exploitation of oil in Italy, create positions of power within the production chain, which alter the relationship between the companies, compared to what happens in the traditional type of Marshallian districts.},

Abstract = {Carbon stable isotope composition of berry must at harvest (delta C-13) is an integrated assessment of plant water status during grape (Vitis viniferaL.) berry ripening. Measurement of delta C-13 of grape juice is proposed as an alternative to traditional measurements of water status to capture the spatial variability of physiological response at the vineyard scale, i.e., zoning. We performed samplings at four different locations in California, United States, with three different cultivars of table and wine grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Crimson-Seedless). Leaf physiology (photosynthesis,A(N), stomatal conductance,g(s)) and stem water potentials (psi(stem)) were routinely measured. The delta C-13 was measured at harvest and strong relationships were found between psi(stem)(R-2= 0.71), stomatal conductance (R-2= 0.71), net carbon assimilation (R-2= 0.59) and WUEi (R-2= 0.53). The role of leaf nitrogen on the signal was assessed by evaluating relationships between leaf nitrogen and WUEi(R-2= 0.54), Ci/Ca (R-2= 0.51), delta C-13 (R-2= 0.44), and psi(stem)(R-2= 0.37). Although nitrogen can be among the environmental factors able to affect the delta C-13 signal, this difference is only observable when variability inNis very large, by pooling different vineyards/varieties, but not at the within-vineyard scale. The utility of delta C-13 was further tested and measured on grape berries sampled on an equidistant grid in a 3.5 ha vineyard where psi(stem)was also measured throughout the field season and used to delineate management zones. Physiological measurements and grape composition were correlated to soil electrical resistivity and satellite-derived vegetation index. The two management zones obtained by delta C-13 or psi(stem)were spatially similar at 67\% and allowed to separate the harvest in two pools having statistically different grape composition (soluble solids, organic acids, and anthocyanin profiles). Zoning by delta C-13 performed as well as zoning by psi(stem)to separate grape phenolic composition, e.g., for selective harvest. Our results provided evidence that delta C-13 of grape must is a reliable and repeatable assessor of plant water status and gas exchange in vineyard systems that are crucial for zoning vineyards, even when irrigated, and for ground-truthing sensor maps in precision viticulture.},

Title = {Micro-Spatial Analysis of Maize Yield Gap Variability and Production Factors on Smallholder Farms},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Site-specific land management practice taking into account variability in maize yield gaps (the difference between yields in the 90th percentiles and other yields on smallholder farmers' fields) could improve resource use efficiency and enhance yields. However, the applicability of the practice is constrained by inability to identify patterns of resource utilization to target application of resources to more responsive fields. The study focus was to map yield gaps on smallholder fields based on identified spatial arrangements differentiated by distance from the smallholder homestead and understand field-specific utilization of production factors. This was aimed at understanding field variability based on yield gap mapping patterns in order to enhance resource use efficiency on smallholder farms. The study was done in two villages, Mukuyu and Shikomoli, with high and low agroecology regarding soil fertility in Western Kenya. Identification of spatial arrangements at 40 m, 80 m, 150 m and 300 m distance from the homestead on smallholder farms for 70 households was done. The spatial arrangements were then classified into near house, mid farm and far farm basing on distance from the homestead. For each spatial arrangement, Landsat sensors acquired via satellite imagery were processed to generate yield gap maps. The focal statistics analysis method using the neighborhoods function was then applied to generate yield gap maps at the different spatial arrangements identified above. Socio-economic, management and biophysical factors were determined, and maize yields estimated at each spatial arrangement. Heterogeneous patterns of high, average and low yield gaps were found in spatial arrangements at the 40 m and 80 m distances. Nearly homogenous patterns tending towards median yield gap values were found in spatial arrangements that were located at the 150 m and 300 m. These patterns correspondingly depicted field-specific utilization of management and socio-economic factors. Field level management practices and socio-economic factors such as application of inorganic fertilizer, high frequency of weed control, early land preparation, high proportion of hired and family labor use and allocation of large land sizes were utilized in spatial arrangements at 150 and 300 m distances. High proportions of organic fertilizer and family labor use were utilized in spatial arrangements at 40 and 80 m distances. The findings thus show that smallholder farmers preferentially manage the application of socio-economic and management factors in spatial arrangements further from the homestead compared to fields closer to the homestead which could be exacerbating maize yield gaps. Delineating management zones based on yield gap patterns at the different spatial arrangements on smallholder farms could contribute to site-specific land management and enhance yields. Investigating the value smallholder farmers attach to each spatial arrangement is further needed to enhance the spatial understanding of yield gap variation on smallholder farms.},

Title = {Global patterns and influencing factors of post-fire land cover change},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {223},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fire, as a strong disturbance type, can exert significant impacts on the biosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere and human society. It can inherently trigger both critical transitions in ecosystems and dramatic changes in land cover. However, the general patterns and possible influencing factors of post-fire land cover change remain largely unclear at a global scale. Obtaining such knowledge is of great value in advancing the understanding of fire ecology and promoting sustainable fire management. Here, we combined satellite observations of long-term ESA CCI land cover (300 m resolution) and burned area data from MODIS collection 6 (500 m resolution) to assess the global post-fire land cover change patterns from 2005 to 2015. The results showed that areas with identified post-fire land cover change accounted for approximately 0.36-0.74\% of the annual global burned areas during the study period and were most common in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and the D.R. Congo. The most common land cover change types in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were ``forest-to-agriculture{''} (31.93\%), ``forest-to-shrubland{''} (26.23\%) and ``agriculture-to-forest{''} (18.74\%), respectively. In addition, the conversion between agriculture and forest, and shrubland and forest, after fire were found to be bidirectional. After assessing 14 fire-related, climatic, topographic, ecological and socioeconomic factors that could potentially influence post-fire land cover change occurrence, burned area size and vegetation cover di-versity were identified as the two strongest predictors, followed by aspect, fire intensity and slope. Our results provide a global overview of post-fire land cover change patterns and offer guidance for developing sustainable fire management policies.},

Title = {Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs): A Case Study from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia},

Abstract = {The topic on Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs) in Malaysia is relatively new and received little attention from geoscientists and engineers. This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury, fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3) interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 \% damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25\% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26 - 50\% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75\% damage/victims/period), and 1.00 (75 - 100\% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are compiled and analyzed with ``Landslide Distribution Map{''} (LDM) to generate a ``Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD){''}. The LDM was produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally, three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 (< 0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability; Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High Vulnerability); and Class 5 (> 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially to be extended with different background environments.

Abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution provides valuable information for quantifying NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions and exposures. This study presents a comprehensive method to estimate average tropospheric NO2 emission strengths derived from 4-year (May 2018-June 2022) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations by combining a wind-assigned anomaly approach and a machine learning (ML) method, the so-called gradient descent algorithm. This combined approach is firstly applied to the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, as a test site, and yields a total emission rate of 1:09 x 1026 molec. s(-1). The ML-trained anomalies fit very well with the wind-assigned anomalies, with an R-2 value of 1.0 and a slope of 0.99. Hotspots of NO2 emissions are apparent at several sites: over a cement plant and power plants as well as over areas along highways. Using the same approach, an emission rate of 1 :99 x 10(25) molec. s(-1) is estimated in the Madrid metropolitan area, Spain. Both the estimate and spatial pattern are comparable with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. Weekly variations in NO2 emission are highly related to anthropogenic activities, such as the transport sector. The NO2 emissions were reduced by 16\% at weekends in Riyadh, and high reductions were found near the city center and in areas along the highway. An average weekend reduction estimate of 28\% was found in Madrid. The regions with dominant sources are located in the east of Madrid, where residential areas and the Madrid-Barajas airport are located. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the NO2 emissions decreased by 21\% in March-June 2020 in Riyadh compared with the same period in 2019. A much higher reduction (62 \%) is estimated for Madrid, where a very strict lockdown policy was implemented. The high emission strengths during lockdown only persist in the residential areas, and they cover smaller areas on weekdays compared with weekends. The spatial patterns of NO2 emission strengths during lockdown are similar to those observed at weekends in both cities. Although our analysis is limited to two cities as test examples, the method has proven to provide reliable and consistent results. It is expected to be suitable for other trace gases and other target regions. However, it might become challenging in some areas with complicated emission sources and topography, and specific NO2 decay times in different regions and seasons should be taken into account. These impacting factors should be considered in the future model to further reduce the uncertainty budget.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper places a college at the centreof a multi-hazard assessment (earthquake, flood and landslide). The college is within a less studied, rural area of Ladakh, North India. Research focusses on a case study (Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) College), close to Leh, Ladakh, and extends to incorporate/apply thinking from/to the wider Ladakh region. The approach adopted, centring on the hazard assessment of a single entity/local area, allows a rapid uptake of hazard recommendations within a college environment planning to continue its existence for decades ahead. A sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) documents the active involvement of college staff and students in the principles of geohazard assessment and the development of student-centric hazard assessments of the college and their home village. SECMOL is a self-sufficient, alternative, college, organised along strong environmentally sustainable principles. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This work has adopted different strategies for different hazards. Fieldwork involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. shape and size of valleys/river channels/valley sides, estimation of vegetation density, measurement of sediment clasts, angle of slopes, assessment of sediment character, stratigraphy of floodplains and identification of vulnerable elements). These data were combined with satellite image analysis to: define river catchment character and flood vulnerability (e.g. using the methodology of Collier and Fox, 2003), examine catchment connectivity, and examine landslip scars and generic terrain analysis. Literature studies and seismic database interrogation allowed the calculation of potential catchment floodwater volumes, and the collation of epicentre, magnitude, depth and date of seismic events, together with recent thinking on the return period of large Himalayan earthquakes. These data were used to develop geological-seismic and river catchment maps, the identification of vulnerable elements, and disaster scenario analyses. Findings This research concludes that SECMOL, and much of the Ladakh region, is exposed to significant seismic, flood and landslide hazard risk. High magnitude earthquakes have return periods of 100s to c. 1,000 years in the Himalayas and can produce intense levels of damage. It is prudent to maximise earthquake engineering wherever possible. The 2010 Leh floods demonstrated high levels of devastation: these floods could severely damage the SECMOL campus if storms were centred close by. This study reveals the connectivity of catchments at varying altitudes and the potential interactions of adjacent catchments. Evacuation plans need to be developed for the college. Northern ridges at SECMOL could bury parts of the campus if mobilised by earthquakes/rainfall. Slope angles can be lowered and large boulders moved to reduce risk. This work reinforces recommendations that relate to building quality and urban/rural planning, e.g. using spatial planning to keep people away from high-risk zones. Practical implications - The frequency of hazards is low, but potential impacts high to very high. Hazard mitigation actions include engineering options for hazardous slopes, buildings to be earthquake-proofed, and evacuation management for large floods. Originality/value Methodologies undertaken in this research are well-tested. Linkages between disciplines are ambitious and somewhat original. The application of this work to a specific college centre site with the capacity to rapidly take up recommendations is novel. The identification of catchment inter-connectivity in this part of Ladakh is novel. This work complements a sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) for community aspects of this study, adding to the novelty value.},

Title = {Preliminary results of GOCE-based height system unification between Greece and Turkey over marine and land areas},

Abstract = {The unification of local vertical datums (LVDs) at a country-wide scale has gained significant attention lately due to the availability of GOCE-based global geopotential models (GGMs) and the unprecedented geoid height accuracies offered. Within a single country, several LVDs may be used, especially in the case of islandic nations. Therefore, the unification of all of them to a single nation-wide LVD is of utmost importance. The same holds for neighboring countries, where the unification of their vertical datums is necessary as a tool of engineering, cross-border collaboration and environmental and risk management projects. The aforementioned set the main scope of the present study, which focuses on the use of GOCE and GOCE/GRACE GGMs in order to investigate the offsets between the Greek and Turkish LVDs. First an evaluation of the latest release 5 GOCE GGMs is carried out, either to their maximum degree or through spectral enhancement with EGM208 and topographic effects. Then, the geopotential value for the Greek and Turkish LVDs is performed, along with different estimates for the marine area of the Aegean Sea where several islands and isles exist with each one realizing its own LVD. The relative offset between the two LVDs was determined and used to provide a direct link between the Greek and Turkish LVDs with the IAG conventional value recently proposed as a global WHS. From the results achieved it was concluded that the spectrally enhanced GOCE GGMs reduce the standard deviation of the differences with GPS/levelling data by 2-4 cm over Turkey and 2 cm for mainland Greece. In terms of the zero-level geopotential determination, the LVD of the Greek mainland is 64.9 cm below the IAG conventional value, while that of Turkey is 9.6 cm above. Finally, it is concluded that in practice each Greek island realizes its own LVD with offsets between them as large as 35 cm. Despite that fact, the spectrally enhanced GOCE GGMs and in particular GOCO05s provides the overall smallest height residuals over the islands, hence the (W) over cap (LVD)(o) based on that can be recommended as the best estimate. In that way, relative offsets with the LVD of mainland Greece can be computed for each island, ranging between -23.8 and 15.5 cm.},

Abstract = {For much of the last two decades, the Central and East European (CEE) economies have experienced a deep structural reform, moving away from a socialist economic system towards a market economy. The political situation of the second half of the 20th century had a significant impact on the economic development and competitiveness of these transition countries, when compared with their Western European counterparts. A vast number of studies have been conducted to analyze the structural changes required for resource-dependent economies to achieve long-term development and to understand the synergies between commodities and diversification. Yet, the dynamics of resource extraction and the resource dependence of regions that have experienced periods of sustained levels of growth have largely been overlooked, especially the Central and Eastern European region. In this context, this article presents an analysis of the level of resource dependence of six countries which joined the European Union between 2004 and 2007. Using data spanning from the year 2000 to 2017, we calculate the Extractives Dependence Index (EDI) of six former Soviet satellite nations and one former Soviet state. Our results indicate that the commodity structure of trade in the six countries which joined the European Union has changed considerably. These countries have reduced their economic dependence on extractive resources by developing their high value-added and technology-intensive sectors. Our findings also reveal that Poland experienced the highest decrease in EDI scores among the six CEE countries.},

Title = {Examining hickory plantation expansion and evaluating suitability for it using multitemporal satellite imagery and ancillary data},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {109},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hickory (Carya cathayensis) plantations in northwestern Zhejiang Province, China, have been extensively expanded in the past three decades due to their high economic value; however, improper management has caused serious soil erosion problems. To better manage hickory plantations, it is necessary to accurately map the spatial distribution of hickory expansion and to evaluate land suitability of current hickory plantations, but little research on these issues has been conducted. This research used bi-temporal Chinese satellite Gaofen-1 images in 2015 (leaf-on and leaf-off) in combination with digital elevation model (DEM) data to develop a land-cover map with emphasis on young and mature hickory plantations using the random forest (RF) approach. The distribution data of hickory plantations in 2015 was then used to extract the spectral signatures of the 2010 Landsat imagery. The extracted spectral signatures were classified into different land covers using cluster analysis. The same approach was used with the Landsat imagery in 2005, 2000, 1995, 1990, and 1985 for mapping hickory dynamic change over time. The maximum entropy-based (MaxEnt) model was then used to evaluate the land suitability of these hickory plantations based on the identified factors from DEM, soil, and climate data. The results indicate that (1) the RF classifier based on multisource data can effectively produce a land-cover map with an overall accuracy of 89.5\%, in particular, producer's and user's accuracies of 88.7\% and 90.2\%, respectively, for mature hickory, and 95.2\% and 88.9\%, respectively, for young hickory plantations; (2) the areas of hickory plantations increased from 157.6 km(2) in 1985 to 528.5 km(2) in 2015 with the highest average annual increase rate of 25.3 km(2) in 2000-2005 and mainly at the cost of coniferous forests, followed by shrub and broadleaf forests; and (3) the MaxEnt model can be effectively used to evaluate suitability for hickory plantations. Three suitability levels-highly suitable, moderately suitable, and marginally suitable-were grouped. The mature hickory forests in 1985 had a higher proportion at the highly suitable level than the expanded hickory plantations between 1985 and 2015. This research provides important results for local governments and farmers to improve the management of young hickory plantations. The approach used in this research may be used for evaluation of land suitability for other cash forests such as Torreya.},

Title = {Financing urban development, three business models: Johannesburg, Shanghai and London},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of which bring new business logics into the production of the built environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of ``financialisation{''} to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive ``business models{''}, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic analytical conversation about the implications of different business models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban development projects.},

Title = {A LANDSAT MSS-derived fire history of Kakadu National Park, monsoonal northern Australia, 1980-94: Seasonal extent, frequency and patchiness},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {1. A 15-year fire history (1980-94) was assembled for Kakadu National Park, a 20 000 km(2) World Heritage property in monsoonal northern Australia, based on interpretation of LANDSAT MSS imagery sampled at least three times over the 7-month dry season. 2. Detailed ground-truthing was undertaken at the end of the early dry season period (May-July) for both 1993 and 1994; ground-truth data were not available for previous years. Overall agreement was greater than 80\% in both years. In sum, these data inspire a relatively high degree of confidence in the interpreted fire history of the Park for any one year, at least at the landscape and habitat scales examined here. 3. An average of 46\% of the Park was found to be burnt each year over the 15 years of records, with 25\% burnt in the early, and 21\% burnt in the late, dry season. The data indicate a pronounced shift from a fire regime dominated by late (typically more intense and potentially extensive) dry season fires up until the mid-1980s, to one dominated by early (typically of low intensity and patchy) dry season fire subsequently. 4. Whereas an average of 55\% of lowland savanna habitats has been burnt annually, 28\% of habitats occupying both sandstone plateau and riverine landforms have been burnt each year. The great majority of burning in relatively fire-sensitive sandstone habitats continues to be in the late dry season. Data indicate a marked increase in the extent of burning on floodplains and in associated fire-sensitive Melaleuca forests and lowland rainforests, from 1990; this increase is attributed to increased herbaceous fuel loads associated with the removal of feral Asian water buffalo. 5. Proximity analyses indicate that slightly more early dry season burning has been undertaken close to roads, and at greater distances from settlements; no proximity differences were discernible for fires late in the dry season. Burning has been concentrated close to lowland drainage lines, both in the early and late dry season. 6. Lowland savanna sites are burnt on average 3 out of 5 years. In contrast, the majority of sandstone plateau and riverine floodplain sites have burnt on average 0-4 times and 0-3 times, respectively, over the 15 years of records. 7. The median size of contiguously burnt areas (patches) has been declining steadily over the 15 years of records, from upwards of 300 ha initially to c. 60 ha in 1994. 8. It is concluded that although the assembled data are imperfect in that they underrepresent wet season burns and very small fires, are prone to positional errors of up to c. 300 m, and because little confidence can be placed in the sequential fire histories for any 1-ha site, they afford an effective means by which the Park's fire management programme can be monitored, its problems identified, and its needs assessed. The demonstrable utility of this programme has led to its recent extension on other significant conservation properties in monsoonal northern Australia; the procedure offers potential for wider adoption in savanna regions generally.},

Title = {Digital assessments of soil organic carbon storage using digital maps provided by static and dynamic environmental covariates},

Abstract = {Understanding the vertical and lateral distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is indispensable for soil use and environmental management because of their vital role in soil quality assessments. Primarily, they are needed in calculating soil organic carbon storage (SOCS). The objective of this research was to provide digital maps of SOC and SOCD variation as well as their uncertainties at multiple standardized depths (H1: 0-5, H2: 5-15, H3: 15-30, H4: 30-60 and H5: 60-100 cm) using a parsimonious model with optimized terrain-related attributes and satellite-derived data. SOCS were evaluated at soil subgroup levels. An area of about 808 km(2) with varying elevation, plant cover and lithology from the Miandoab region, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran was selected as a case study area. A total of 386 soil samples were collected from 104 profiles comprising various soil genetic horizons. A continuous spline function was then fitted to the target properties in advance of creating a dataset at five standard depth intervals (following the GlobalSoilMap project). These were then grouped into three classes including top (H1), middle (H2, H3 and H4) and bottom (H5) depths to ease interpretation. Static and dynamic covariates (30-m resolution) were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and a suite of Landsat-8 spectral imageries, respectively. Four candidate models including stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), random forest (RF), cubist (CU) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) Tree were tested in this study. Finally, the digital maps at 30-m resolution of SOC and SOCD and their uncertainties were prepared using the best-fit model and the bootstrapping method, respectively. Four soil subgroups (Gypsic Haploxerepts, Typic Calcixerepts, Typic Haploxerepts and Xeric Haplocalcids) were identified across the study area. The covariates had variable contributions on the evaluated models. The XGBoost Tree model generally outperformed other models for prediction of SOC and SOCD (R-2 = 0.60, on average). Regardless of soil subgroups, the uncertainty analysis showed that the SOCD map had a low prediction interval range value indicating high accuracy. Additionally, the highest SOCS and SOCD was observed at the top followed by middle and bottom depths in the study area. All subgroups exhibited a decreasing trend of SOCD with increasing depth. A similar trend was also observed for SOCS. The highest SOCD (on average) was observed in Gypsic Haploxerepts (4.71 kg C/m(2)) followed by Typic Calcixerepts (4.46 kg C/m(2)), Typic Haploxerepts (4.45 kg C/m(2)) and Xeric Haplocalcids (4.40 kg C/m(2)). Overall, the SOCS normalized by area within soil order boundaries was greater in Inceptisols than Aridisols across the study area. The findings of this study provide critical information for sustainable management of soil resources in the area for agricultural production and environmental health in the Miandoab region of Iran.},

Title = {Assessment of skin response in T4b breast carcinoma patients post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy},
Journal = {ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Background: Breast cancer patients with skin ulcerations, satellite nodules or Peau d'orange at presentation are classified with stage 4 breast cancer (T4b). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), followed by mastectomy, is the commonly accepted treatment in such patients for fear of adverse outcomes with breast conservation surgery (BCS) and uncertainty over sparing initially involved skin irrespective of the response to chemotherapy. Identifying patients with skin resolution post-NACT can help surgeons in decision-making. Aim: To assess skin response in T4b breast cancer patients post-NACT and find the correlation between various clinical and pathological factors associated with no skin involvement on final histology. Methodology: Records of breast cancer patients managed at the Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, with NACT for T4b breast carcinoma patients who underwent mastectomy were reviewed between January 2014 and December 2018. Final histology was checked for dermal involvement with the tumour. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables for descriptive data, and Pearson's chi-squared and Fischer's exact tests were applied for categorical data. p-value < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: A total of 285 records mentioning skin involvement were reviewed, out of which 111 patients fulfilled the AJCC criterion. The median age at diagnosis of T4b breast cancer was 50 years. The median clinical size pre-chemotherapy was 7 cm. Residual median tumour size on final histology was reported as 1 cm. 78/111 patients showed a postNACT response of 50\% or more, and 43/111 showed a response of more than 90\%. 57 (51.4\%) patients showed skin involvement on final histopathology, while 54 (48.6\%) patients did not. ER negative tumours were more likely to show no dermal involvement (p = 0.006). Residual tumour size of less than 1 cm on final histology (p < 0.05) and nodal stage were significant predictors of dermal response. Conclusion: Approximately half of the T4b breast cancer patients showed resolution of dermal skin involvement post-NACT. ER negative and those with residual tumour size less than 1 cm post-NACT are more likely to show dermal resolution. This can help surgeons plan a BCS or skin sparing mastectomy for such patients who usually end up having a mastectomy.},

Title = {Torrential Hazard Prevention in Alpine Small Basin through Historical, Empirical and Geomorphological Cross Analysis in NW Italy},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Debris flow is one of the most dangerous natural processes in mountain regions and it occur in a wide variety of environments throughout the world. In the Italian Alps, some tens of thousands of damaging debris flow and, in general, torrential floods associated to intense sediment transport in secondary catchments have been documented in the last 300 years. These have caused socio-economic damage, damage to anthropogenic structures or infrastructures and in many cases casualties. Often, in the same basins, the occurrence of debris-flow processes recurs many years later. Prediction can often be spatial and based on the magnitude of the largest known process, while the temporal forecast is the most uncertain. It is also possible to increase the resilience of the population and of the territory. The present study aims at investigating different levels of debris-flow hazard in urban areas on Alpine alluvial fans and proposes a strategy for debris-flow prevention based on historical research and on a simplified analytical approach, methods that also involve relatively low costs. For such analysis, Ischiator stream catchment (ca. 20 km(2)) and its alluvial fan (NW Italy) were selected. This area was partly affected by historical torrential flood associated to intense sediment transport and debris-flow processes. Present-day instability conditions along the slope and the stream network were detected and synthesized through surveys and aerial photo interpretation integrated by satellite images (period 1954-2021). An estimation of the potential amount of moving detritus, referred to as debris flow, was carried out regarding the June 1957 debris-flow event, based on the predictive models. The individual hazard index value was estimated based on different methods. The results indicate that 56\% of the area is exposed to flood associated to intense sediment transport hazard, which fluctuates from high to very high levels; such results are supported by debris-flow historical records. Since today almost half of the settlement (Bagni di Vinadio) is located on potentially risk-exposed areas, the urban evolution policy adopted after the 1957 event failed to manage the risk connection to debris-flow activity.},

Title = {Probabilistic seasonal dengue forecasting in Vietnam: A modelling study using superensembles},
Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002-2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score {[}CRPS] = 66.8, 95\% CI 60.6-148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95\% CI 78.5-80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69\%) than that of the baseline model (54.5\%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95\% CI 102-575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95\% CI 120-168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems. Author summary Why was this study done? A climate-driven dengue early warning system would allow public health decision-makers to design, implement, and target timely interventions to the most at-risk places. Dengue is sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. Therefore, a dengue prediction model driven by seasonal climate forecasts offers a valuable tool for predicting dengue risk in advance. What did the researchers do and find? We developed a superensemble of probabilistic models to predict dengue incidence across Vietnam up to 6 months ahead. The predictive ability of the superensemble was assessed using multiple verification metrics and compared to a baseline model at multiple lead times, seasons, and locations. We found that the model superensemble generated more accurate predictions than the baseline model 1 to 3 months ahead but not 4 to 6 months ahead. The model superensemble, however, was better able to predict outbreaks than the baseline model across all lead times. The predictive ability of the model varied with geographic location, forecast horizon, and time of the year and performed best in the peak season in areas experiencing a high level of transmission. What do these findings mean? While outbreaks of infectious diseases are difficult to predict, particularly several months ahead, model superensembles, which combine multiple climatic drivers with dengue surveillance data at the time of forecast issue date, provide a useful decision-support tool. Early warning systems driven by seasonal climate forecasts could shift dengue control towards a more preventative approach, guiding bespoke and targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of scarce resources.},

Abstract = {One problem during offshore well-test operations, stimulations, and routine workovers are discharges into the air and sea while flaring. These procedures are usually performed by mobile drilling rigs with no storage capacity, and thus, hydrocarbons sequestered must be burned off from the rig flare booms. Another major problem has been the inability of the flare to operate at high flow rates. Because the burning process slows the pace of a test, restricting full flow testing, valuable well information is lost. Flaring of hydrocarbons also represents an economic loss. In the case of oil rigs, for example, flaring not only emits CO2 into the atmosphere but also burns off usable oil. The Crystal Sea well-test vessel was designed to address the problems inherent to flaring and, at the same time, provide cost efficiency by salvaging usable oil during well testing. The success of her initial two jobs on the Statfjord North satellite field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea confirms that sale of the salvaged oil normally lost during the flaring process could generate sufficient economic return to pay for the vessel. In addition, with its capability to receive products at twice the flow rate of conventional methods, the increased accuracy of the technical information obtained from the well test further enhances its value for improved reservoir management.},

Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) have gained importance due to their widespread distribution, their host range and damage potential (Hussey \& Janssen, 2002). A recent survey on root-knot nematodes in Europe by Wesemael et al. (2011) showed that out of the 90 species described so far, 23 have been found in Europe. Furthermore, this survey showed that three species, namely Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria and M. javanica, are the most prevalent in southern European countries and in protected cultivation systems in the northern parts of Europe. These species can cause significant economic losses due to yield and quality reduction on high value crops. Rootknot nematode species are normally identified using morphological features and morphometrics on second-stage juveniles (J2), males, on the perineal patterns of mature females or isozyme phenotyping of females (Hunt \& Handoo, 2009). As the J2 stage is readily available from soil, and identifying this stage is most useful for making appropriate management decisions, several molecular methods, such as the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), satellite DNA probes, sequence characterised amplified regions (SCAR) and real-time PCR assays, have become the preferred method for identification (Blok \& Powers, 2009). However, few of these methods enable the simultaneous identification of several nematode species within one sample.},

Abstract = {Numerous researches have been published on the application of landslide susceptibility assessment models; however, they were only applied in the same areas as the models were originated, the effect of applying the models to other areas than the origin of the models has not been explored. This study is purposed to develop an optimized random forest (RF) model with best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold cross-validation for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and then explore its generalization ability not only in the area where the model is originated but also in area other than the origin of the model. Two typical counties (Fengjie County and Wushan County) in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China, which have the same terrain and geological conditions, were selected as an example. To begin with, landslide inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images, and historical records, and 1 522 landslides were then identified in Fengjie County. 22 landslide-conditioning factors under the influence of topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were prepared. Then, combined with 10-fold cross-validation, three typical ratios of positive-to-negative cells, i.e., 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, were adopted for comparative analyses. An optimized RF model (Fengjie-based model) with the best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold cross-validation was constructed. Finally, the Fengjie-based model was applied to Fengjie County and Wushan County, and the confusion matrix and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value (AUC) were used to estimate the accuracy. The Fengjie-based model delivered high stability and predictive capability in Fengjie County, indicating a great generalization ability of the model to the area where the model is originated. The LSM in Wushan County generated by the Fengjie-based model had a reasonable reference value, indicating the Fengjie-based model had a great generalization ability in area other than the origin of the model. The Fengjie-based model in this study could be applied in other similar areas/countries with the same terrain and geological conditions, and a LSM may be generated without collecting landslide information for modeling, so as to reduce workload and improve efficiency in practice.},

Abstract = {Electricity power supply in remote communities and towns are traditionally and hitherto supplied by diesel generator sets of varying capacities and sizes from few kilowatt to few megawatts. Its proven to be versatile, robust, modular, cheaper capital investment, reliable and easy to operate and maintain. These features are what make diesel generators most preferref choice for generating electric power to power hungry remote communities. The maindrawback, though, is its increasingly high cost of operation and maintenance, largely due to upward trend in the cost of diesel fuel, high cost of engines spare parts plus the inflationary nature of salary and wages of operators. For these reasons, engineers and technologists have for years worked tirelessly to find ways and means to reduce the O \& M costs. One of the novel ideas was to hybrid the conventional diesel generating system with renewable energy resources, such as mini hydro, solar photovoltaic or wind energy. Many prototypes involving severeral configurations of energy resources eg diesel/PV/battery, diesel/wind/battery, diesel/ minihydro/battey have been tested but none has so far has been as successful as SMA/Powercorp's automated Intelligent Power System (IPS). Based on microprocessor hardware, powerful computer software programming and satellite communication technology, the IPS-equipped diesel power station can now now be operated fully automatic with capability of remote control and monitoring. The system is versatile in maximising the use of renewable energy energy resources such as wind, mini hydro or solar thereby reducing very significantly the use of diesel fuel. Operation and maintenance costs also are reduced due to the use of minimum manpower and and increase in fuel efficiency of the engines. The tested and proven IPS technology has been operating successfully for the last ten years in remote diesel stations in Northern Territory, Australia, Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland and its latest and biggest system is the 5 MW diesel /minihydro stations in Sabah, Malaysia. This technology had brought about radical transformation in the ways remote diesel satations are operated and maintained not only in alleviating environmental damages related to diesel generation but also in improving the occupational health and safety of diesel enegines operators. This paper discusses the installation of IPS technology in a local electricity grid powered by multidiesel sets and minihydro machines, in Ranau/Kundasang, Sabah. The drastic system improvement and significant cost savings the system have entailed, have convinced the electric utility of its effectiveness and reliability. Finally, we believe strongly that Ips technology will pave way for modernisation of diesel-based remote power generating station in Malaysia, and elsewhere in other developing countries.},

Abstract = {The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys Stal (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is native to Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea. Its dispersion from Asia to the United States of America and Europe caused serious damage to fruit, vegetables, and high-value crops. In Greece, damages are reported in kiwi orchards in the regions of Pieria and Imathia, which are the main production areas of kiwifruit. Greek kiwifruit production is expected to increase twofold within the next years. The aim of this research is to study the terrain and canopy properties that may have an impact on the development of H. halys populations. Thus, five kiwi orchards in total were selected in the regions of Pieria and Imathia. \& tau;en traps were installed from early June to late October within each selected kiwi orchard-two types of traps at every side of the orchards and the center. The installed traps were examined weekly and the number of the captured H. halys was recorded. During the same days, sentinel satellite images were analyzed to calculate the vegetation index, NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), and NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index). The results showed population variability within the kiwi orchards since the population of H. halys was higher in areas with high NDVI and NDWI values. Additionally, our research revealed that H. halys prefers to develop populations at higher altitudes at both regional and field scales. The results of this research can be used to reduce damages by H. halys in kiwi orchards using different rates of pesticides depending on the prediction of the population size. There are multiple benefits of the proposed practice, such as a reduction in the production cost of kiwifruits, an increase in farmers' profit, and environmental protection.},

Abstract = {Urban green space plays an important role in beautifying the environment, improving the quality of life of residents, and promoting sustainable urban development. Rapid urbanization has led to great changes in the spatial structure and layout of urban green space. It is urgent to put forward the sustainable development strategy of green space through the research on the change of urban green space. Based on the geographical spatial differences of urban green space and integrating the factors of economy, society, industry, land use, and the environment, we constructed a research framework of ``space-supply-demand{''} integration of urban green space by GI and geodetector methods, and we conducted an empirical study on the spatial-temporal changes of urban green space and its driving mechanism in prefecture-level cities along the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China. First, the urban green space along the Yangtze River Economic Belt is concentrated in spatial distribution, while uneven development appears in urban greening among the zones. Second, the influence of different factors on urban green space change varies greatly and can be divided into three types: key factors, important factors, and auxiliary factors. The driving mechanism of the spatial distribution of urban green space supply and demand is quite different, but urban population and commercial service facilities land are their key influence factors, having a comprehensive influence on the spatial-temporal changes of urban green space. Third, the factors are classified into three categories of high, medium, and low levels according to the mean of interacting forces; in particular, the factors of per capita GDP, utility land, industrial smoke (dust) emissions, and other factors have a very strong interactive effect with other factors. Fourth, according to the spatial distribution characteristics of urban green space and its driving mechanism, this paper puts forward planning and policy suggestions, providing reference for other areas to deal with the green space change.},

Abstract = {This article describes a spatial prediction method that predicts the monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly field from the land only data. The land data are from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). The prediction period is 1880-1999 and the prediction ocean domain extends from 60degreesS to 60degreesN with a spatial resolution 5degrees x 5degrees. The prediction method is a regression over the basis of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), The EOFs are computed from the following data sets: (a) the Climate Prediction Center's optimally interpolated sea surface temperature (OI/SST) data (1982-1999); (b) the National Climatic Data Center's blended product of land-surface air temperature (1992-1999) produced from combining the Special Satellite Microwave Imager and GHCN: and (c) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis data (1982-1999). The optimal prediction method minimizes the first-M-mode mean square error between the true and predicted anomalies over both land and ocean. In the optimization process, the data errors of the GHCN boxes are used, and their contribution to the prediction error is taken into account. The area-averaued root mean square error of prediction is calculated. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this EOF prediction method can accurately recover the global SST anomalies during some circulation patterns and add value to the SST bias correction in the early history of SST observations and the validation of general circulation models. Our results show that (i) the land only data can accurately predict the SST anomaly in the El Nino months when the temperature anomaly structure has very large correlation scales, and (ii) the predictions for La Nina, neutral. or transient months require more EOF modes because of the presence of the small scale structures in the anomaly field.

Title = {Low efficiency of large volcanic eruptions in transporting very fine ash into the atmosphere},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Volcanic ash clouds are common, often unpredictable, phenomena generated during explosive eruptions. Mainly composed of very fine ash particles, they can be transported in the atmosphere at great distances from the source, having detrimental socio-economic impacts. However, proximal settling processes controlling the proportion (epsilon) of the very fine ash fraction distally transported in the atmosphere are still poorly understood. Yet, for the past two decades, some operational meteorological agencies have used a default value of epsilon = 5\% as input for forecast models of atmospheric ash cloud concentration. Here we show from combined satellite and field data of sustained eruptions that e actually varies by two orders of magnitude with respect to the mass eruption rate. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the most intense eruptions are in fact the least efficient (with epsilon = 0.1\%) in transporting very fine ash through the atmosphere. This implies that the amount of very fine ash distally transported in the atmosphere is up to 50 times lower than previously anticipated. We explain this finding by the efficiency of collective particle settling in ash-rich clouds which enhance early and en masse fallout of very fine ash. This suggests that proximal sedimentation during powerful eruptions is more controlled by the concentration of ash than by the grain size. This has major consequences for decision-makers in charge of air traffic safety regulation, as well as for the understanding of proximal settling processes. Finally, we propose a new statistical model for predicting the source mass eruption rate with an unprecedentedly low level of uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The transformation of resource-based cities and coordinated regional development are of great value to global urbanization and sustainable economic development in developing countries. Based on Landsat satellite monitoring data and urban economic data, statistical analysis and geospatial model were used to analyze the characteristics of urban development in urban agglomeration in Northeast China from 2000 to 2020, and the influencing mechanism was quantitatively revealed. The results show that the expansion of urban agglomerations rate reached its peak from 2005 to 2010, and then the expansion rate continued to decline. The resources of central cities were concentrated, while the development of sub-central cities was weak. The overall urbanization rate slows down, the scale difference between high-order cities and low-order cities expands, and the regional urban system shifts from balanced development to polarized development. The overall development of urban agglomerations shows a centripetal agglomeration characteristic centered on the Harbin Changchun-Daqing and Central and southern Liaoning Economic belt. Its west expands faster than the East, and its south expands faster than the north. The driving factors of urban agglomeration development are mainly administrative power, followed by market power, external power and weak internal power. From the point of time and space, the external power is on the rise, while the internal power is affected by the industrial adjustment and lacks the staying power. In view of the coordinated development of resource-based cities, this paper proposes to establish the linkage and coordination mechanism of integrated development of urban agglomeration, speed up the construction of unified market system, carry out transformation positioning according to market demand and implement differentiation policy.},

Title = {Vegetation structure and effects of human use of the dambos ecosystem in northern Mozambique},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Niassa National Reserve (NNR) is the most extensive conservation area in Mozambique and the third largest in Africa, encompassing 42,000 km(2) of endemic miombo vegetation. Dambos wetlands occur within the wooded grassland and grassland vegetation of NNR and provide a wide range of Ecosystem Services (ES), including life support for animal species, regulation of water flow and prevention of soil erosion. It also generates income for the livelihoods of local communities by providing land for agriculture and harvesting of non-timber products. The dynamics of these ecosystems is poorly understood despite the contribution of the dambos to global biodiversity and ES. This research is the first preliminary assessment of the vegetation structure and composition of six dambos within NNR, selected using Google Earth, MODIS satellite images and an exploratory field visit. Field data collection was performed using a two-stage systematic sampling approach, along transect lines of 100 x 10m (0.1 ha), perpendicular to the dambos' flow. Square plots of 0.25 m(2) were established for grass survey within the transects where grass vegetation was measured, counted and identified. Data were analyzed with R software. The sociological position of each species was analyzed with regard to the vertical structure while for horizontal structure, the abundance, dominance, frequency and Importance Value Index (IVI) were determined. In order to understand the differences between dambos, evenness (H) and reciprocal of Simpson's heterogeneity index (Hill's N-2) were calculated. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Cluster Analysis were also used to characterize the surveyed species communities. A total of 58 transects (5.8 ha) and 336 subplots were assessed, recording 110 woody and 73 grass species, respectively. The most common tree species were Vitex doniana, Burkea africana, Syzygium cordatum and Annona senegalensis, while for grass vegetation the most abundant species were Andropogon eucomus and Helictotrichon turgidulum. According to the IVI, the most dominant tree and shrub species were V. doniana, Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia, A. senegalensis and S. cordatum. Homogeneity (Hill's N-2 = 18.92) and evenness (H = -4.27) were, on average, low in all dambos. Dambo 2 was the most heterogeneous (Hill's N-2 = 18.21) while dambo 1 was the least heterogeneous (Hill's N-2 = 5.71). Dambo 6 was most equitable (H = -1.35) whereas dambo 2 the least equitable (H = -3.72). Using species abundance and based on PCoA and cluster analysis, four main groups of dambos were identified based mainly on the water gradient, with data variation captured by the first three axes reaching almost 83\%. The p-value (0.42), suggested no significant differences between species communities in the dambos, and thus, human disturbances appear not to be enough to modify dambos microenvironment. Accordingly, the results suggest that human activities, at this level, do not necessarily affect the structure and diversity of dambos in the NNR. The results also suggest that the species A. senegalensis, Combretum psidioides, Crossopteryx febrifuga, Protea nitida, P. maprouneifolia and S. cordatum can be used as indicator dambo species in NNR, with high likelihood of occurrence.

Title = {Evaluation of the Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance Algorithm for Large-Scale Mangrove Classification},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests are of high biological, economic, and ecological importance globally. Growing within the intertidal zone, they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change in addition to being threatened on local scales by over-exploitation and aquaculture expansion. Long-term monitoring of global mangrove populations is therefore highly important to understanding the impact of these threats. However, data availability from satellites is often limited due to cloud cover. This problem can be mitigated using a season-trend modelling approach such as Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD). COLD operates by using every available observation on a pixel-wise basis, removing the need for whole cloud free images. The approach can be used to better classify land cover by taking into account the underlying seasonal variability, and can also be used to extrapolate between data points to obtain more accurate long term trends. To demonstrate the utility of COLD for global mangrove monitoring, we applied it to five study sites chosen to represent a range of mangrove species, forest types, and quantities of available data. The COLD classifier was trained on the Global Mangrove Watch 2010 dataset and applied to 30 years of Landsat data for each site. By increasing the period between model updates, COLD was successfully applied to all five sites (2253 scenes) in less than four days. The method achieved an overall accuracy of 92\% with a User's accuracy of 77\% and a Dice score of 0.84 for the mangrove class. The lowest User's accuracy was for North Kalimantan (49.9\%) due to confusion with mangrove palms. However, the method performed extremely well for the Niger Delta from the 2000s onwards (93.6\%) despite the absence of any Landsat 5 data. Observation of trends in mangrove extent over time suggests that the method was able to accurately capture changes in extent caused by the 2014/15 mangrove die-back event in the Gulf of Carpentaria and highlighted a net loss of mangroves in the Matang Forest Reserve over the last two decades, despite ongoing management. COLD is therefore a promising methodology for global, long-term monitoring of mangrove extent and trends.},

Abstract = {The expansion of terrestrial applications including location-based services and transportation means such as road or train has fostered the design of complex location systems to comply with the needs of these applications. In the frame of the service provision ensured by the application towards a user or an external entity, these location systems are in charge of providing a consolidated information based on the position of one or more mobile platforms. The complexity of the information reported depends on the type of service targeted. It can range from a simple position reporting in the case of a low end asset management, to the provision of a reliable information (e.g. authenticated and with a mastered uncertainty) on the mobile's trajectory for liability critical services such as road charging or Intelligent Transport System (ITS). This wide spectrum of required technical features calls for a new and broader concept at location system level taking into account hybrid solutions in which the use of GNSS technologies is complemented with other technology sensors to improve the robustness and the performance of the solution. Several standards have been generated by different dedicated bodies, in order to support the GNSS market development across the various application domains mentioned above. For instance, 3GPP Location Services (LCS) standards provide minimum performance requirements mainly for Assisted-GNSS in the frame of terrestrial telecommunications and OMA-LOC LPPe (LTE Positioning Protocol Extensions) defines a communication protocol supporting hybridised positioning. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of performance specification for a large number of terrestrial applications (e.g. electronic fee collection, fleet management, container tracking.), including multi-modal applications (i.e. those involving various means of transport), leading to the development and use of sub-optimal GNSS-based systems and solutions. The need to unify the different initiatives by concentrating the positioning-related standardisation effort for terrestrial applications within a single dedicated entity was identified some time ago Accordingly, an initiative triggered by a number of industrial and institutional stakeholders materialized in the frame of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). This initiative is led by the group Satellite Communication and Navigation (SCN) of the Technical Committee Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (TC SES), the main objective being to elaborate a firm and common standard for GNSS-based Location systems. Up to now, the TC-SES has already approved end of 2012 two Technical Reports related to architectures and application inventory which paved the way for the technical specifications to be developed. The present paper provides an overview of this on-going standardisation work, its objectives and the added-value it will bring. In addition, the already approved Technical Specifications will also be presented. Thus, the structure of the targeted standard encompasses the four following specifications: The location system minimum performance requirements, which can be considered as the core of the specification work. These requirements are determined function of the type of location systems (i.e. association of technical enablers), the applicable environmental conditions (depending on the type of application), and finally the type of features needed (e.g. accuracy, authentication, anti-spoofing, robustness to interference). The GNSS-based location system reference architecture including the interface definition, which is expected to capture a generic and modular definition of location systems, thus adaptable to all targeted applications. The data exchange protocol at location system level (covering in particular the handling of the requests from an external application provider and the protocol to ensure proper information delivery). The test specification (including procedure, scenario and data), enabling location system validation versus the previous requirements (protocol and performance). The methodology used to define the perimeter of the above specifications looks for: The definition of terrestrial application classes to be covered by the standard, including the identification of the key requirements (functional and performance) applicable for each application. The inventory of the technological enablers taken onboard in the standard. These enablers are understood as much as sensor technologies (GNSS receivers, Network sensors, inertial sensors, hybridization layer), as system layer features allowing Quality of Service (QoS) improvements (A-GNSS, D-GNSS, RTK, integrity functions, authentication functions). The definition of reference environments, derived from the applications' typical use cases, and which provide the necessary conditions to determine the minimum performance requirements. With the ambition to satisfy a wide range of terrestrial applications, the standard under preparation, once approved, will surely benefit to other standardization groups. Indeed, care is being taken to harmonize the work done under TC SES SCN, with standardisation groups in other domains. Furthermore, it will also be valuable to actors from markets whose specificities do not justify the existence of a dedicated standard. All these stakeholders will thus benefit from a more important variety of solutions, components and functions available, all of them simultaneously compatible to the standard.},

Abstract = {The current work is aimed to realizing land suitability and water use efficiency and determining the optimum land use system. The main aims were to identify the physiographic futures and calculate the crop water requirements for specific crops. The study area was observed through a soil survey inventory in Paris Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt. Ten soil profiles plus a number of auger observations and mini pits were selected to represent the different mapping units. A fieldwork and morphological description were carried out, and soil samples were collected for demonstrating the physical and chemical soil properties. Based on satellite data that can integrate with GIS utility, field work, and laboratory analysis, the physiographic map was generated. The study found that the main land type units are plateaus, hills, dunes, and depression floor. Concerning the second aim, the main land qualities of different mapping units were rated and matched to obtain the current and potential land suitability using automated land evaluation system. This research concluded that the best crops adapted with the soil conditions and could be feasible for economic use are clover, wheat, beans, sugar beet, onions, maize, sunflower, tomato, potato, groundnut, pea, lentil, barley, sesame, and carrots. Crop water requirements were determined in variable rate according to the actual plant requirements using the aid of FAO-Cropwat model. Irrigation schedule and consumptive use of suitable crops were calculated and adopted. The crop water requirements for each selected crop were determined as follow: 828.0, 596.7, 410.3, 679.95, 409.52, 791.60, 712.2, 902.93, 456.55, 529.95, 231.4, 217.95, 303.93, 502.65, and 274.35 mm, respectively.},

WorldView-3, the most advanced VHR sensor, provides spectral data in 16 bands covering the visible to near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040 nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1210-2365 nm) wavelength ranges. It also collects images at unprecedented levels of details using a panchromatic band with 0.3-m of spatial resolution. However, the potential of WorldView-3 at its full spectral and spatial resolution for tropical tree species classification remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of WorldView-3 images acquired in the dry and wet seasons for tree species discrimination in tropical semi-deciduous forests. Classification experiments were performed using VNIR individually and combined with SWIR channels. To take advantage of the sub-metric resolution of the panchromatic band for classification, we applied an individual tree crown (ITC)-based approach that employed pan sharpened VNIR bands and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture features. We determined whether the combination of images from the two annual seasons improves the classification accuracy. Finally, we investigated which plant traits influenced species detection. The new SWIR sensing capabilities of WorldView-3 increased the average producer's accuracy up to 7.8\%, by enabling the detection of non-photosynthetic vegetation within ITCs. The combination of VNIR bands from the two annual seasons did not improve the classification results when compared to the results obtained using images from each season individually. The use of VNIR bands at their original 1.2-m spatial resolution yielded average producer's accuracies of 43.1 +/- 3.1\% and 38.8 +/- 3\% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The ITC -based approach improved the accuracy to 70 +/- 8\% in the wet and 68.4 +/- 7.4\% in the dry season. Texture analysis of the panchromatic band enabled the detection of species-specific differences in crown structure, which improved species detection. The use of texture analysis, pan-sharpening, and ITC delineation is a potential approach to perform tree species classification in tropical forests with WorldView-3 satellite images.},

Abstract = {Geomagnetic storms play a critical role in space weather physics with the potential for far reaching economic impacts including power grid outages, air traffic rerouting, satellite damage and GPS disruption. The LFM-MIX is a state-of-the-art coupled magnetospheric-ionospheric model capable of simulating geomagnetic storms. Imbedded in this model are physical equations for turning the magnetohydrodynamic state parameters into energy and flux of electrons entering the ionosphere, involving a set of input parameters. The exact values of these input parameters in the model are unknown, and we seek to quantify the uncertainty about these parameters when model output is compared to observations. The model is available at different fidelities: a lower fidelity which is faster to run, and a higher fidelity but more computationally intense version. Model output and observational data are large spatiotemporal systems; the traditional design and analysis of computer experiments is unable to cope with such large data sets that involve multiple fidelities of model output. We develop an approach to this inverse problem for large spatiotemporal data sets that incorporates two different versions of the physical model. After an initial design, we propose a sequential design based on expected improvement. For the LFM-MIX, the additional run suggested by expected improvement diminishes posterior uncertainty by ruling out a posterior mode and shrinking the width of the posterior distribution. We also illustrate our approach using the Lorenz `96 system of equations for a simplified atmosphere, using known input parameters. For the Lorenz `96 system, after performing sequential runs based on expected improvement, the posterior mode converges to the true value and the posterior variability is reduced.},

Title = {The CanMars Mars Sample Return analogue mission},
Journal = {PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The return of samples from known locations on Mars is among the highest priority goals of the international planetary science community. A possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3 missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team, and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis. CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015 operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as inverted paleochannels. Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12-21), were conducted with the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020 rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22-39) was implemented without the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the Science Team prioritized 3 for ``return to Earth{''}. Various science autonomy capabilities, based on flight proven or near-future techniques intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016 CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and conditional sequencing were also employed. Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made. Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region, collected out-of simulation, have been analysed using a range of laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering large suites of geological and geochemical survey data. Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook), articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016 activities had 90\% of participants ``somewhat agreeing{''} or ``strongly agreeing{''} that participation in the mission has helped them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {An attempt has been made to analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics of soil erosion vulnerability and soil loss from the forested region in the north-eastern Borneo, Sarawak, Malaysia during the last three decades (1991-2015) using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and geographical information systems (GIS). The components of RUSLE such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope-length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors were grouped into two categories by keeping one set as temporally changing and others as static. Among them the R and C factors are calculated for the years 1991, 2001 and 2015 whereas the K and LS factors are considered for the single time frame. Because of the forested nature of the study area, the P factor is kept constant for the whole analysis. The R factor and C factor is shown changes in values and its distribution over the years, which reflected in the final soil loss and erosion vulnerability map as a change in the rate of erosion and spatial domain. The analysis of three time slices has shown that the maximum value of the soil loss per unit area i.e. at erosion hotspots, is relatively similar throughout at around 1636 to 1744 t/ha/y. This is the result of maximum values of R factor and C factor i.e. high rainfall erosivity combined with lack of vegetation cover in those hotspots, which are generally steeply sloping terrain. The reclassification of annual soil loss map into erosion vulnerability zones indicated a major increase in the spatial spread of erosion vulnerability from the year 1991 to 2015 with a significant increase in the high and critical erosion areas from 2.3\% (1991) to 31.5\% (2015). In 1991, over 84\% of the study area was under low erosion vulnerability class but by the year 2015 only 12\% was under low erosion vulnerability class. Moreover, a dynamic nature in the erosion pattern was found from the year 1991 to 2015 with more linear areas of land associated with higher rate of soil loss and enhanced erosion vulnerability. The linearity in the spatial pattern is correlated with the development of logging roads and logging activities which has been confirmed by the extraction of exposed areas from satellite images of different years of analysis. The findings of the present study has quantified the changes in vegetation cover from dense, thick tropical forest to open mixed type landscapes which provide less protection against erosion and soil loss during the severe rainfall events which are characteristic of this tropical region.},

Title = {SAR-Based Estimation of Above-Ground Biomass and Its Changes in Tropical Forests of Kalimantan Using L- and C-Band},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {Kalimantan poses one of the highest carbon emissions worldwide since its landscape is strongly endangered by deforestation and degradation and, thus, carbon release. The goal of this study is to conduct large-scale monitoring of above-ground biomass (AGB) from space and create more accurate biomass maps of Kalimantan than currently available. AGB was estimated for 2007, 2009, and 2016 in order to give an overview of ongoing forest loss and to estimate changes between the three time steps in a more precise manner. Extensive field inventory and LiDAR data were used as reference AGB. A multivariate linear regression model (MLR) based on backscatter values, ratios, and Haralick textures derived from Sentinel-1 (C-band), ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite's Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 polarizations was used to estimate AGB across the country. The selection of the most suitable model parameters was accomplished considering VIF (variable inflation factor), p-value, R-2, and RMSE (root mean square error). The final AGB maps were validated by calculating bias, RMSE, R-2, and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency). The results show a correlation (R-2) between the reference biomass and the estimated biomass varying from 0.69 in 2016 to 0.77 in 2007, and a model performance (NSE) in a range of 0.70 in 2016 to 0.76 in 2007. Modelling three different years with a consistent method allows a more accurate estimation of the change than using available biomass maps based on different models. All final biomass products have a resolution of 100 m, which is much finer than other existing maps of this region (>500 m). These high-resolution maps enable identification of even small-scaled biomass variability and changes and can be used for more precise carbon modelling, as well as forest monitoring or risk managing systems under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation, forest Degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other programs, protecting forests and analyzing carbon release.},

Abstract = {The adverse effects of the weed flora on the agricultural yield are well documented. In an agro-ecosystem, weed species distribution pattern depends on both surrounding environment and farming practices. This first ever study was designed to compare and determine the weed species richness, distribution pattern and their ecologically meaningful groups in wheat and maize field of Gujrat, Pakistan. In this study, seasonal variation variable and satellite derived measurements like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were calculated for each vegetation sample and their contribution towards explaining variations in the weed species data was tested by using direct unimodal ordination method. Phytosociological data was collected from 50 crop fields (25 each from wheat and maize fields during winter and monsoon season respectively) comprising of 250 sub-samples/plots (size 1 x 1 m) during 2016. The results of Monte Carlo testing and cluster analysis showed that there were four statistically significant weeds groups (i.e. 1. Anagallis-Medicago-Phalaris or AMP-Wheat weed group; 2. Chenopodium-Convolvulus-Vicia or CCV-Wheat weed group; 3. Cyperus Halva-Amaranthus or CMA-Maize weed group; 4. Cannabis-Cynodon-Digera or CCD-Maize weed group). A total of 60 weed species were recorded and the majority of them belongs to Poaceae and Amaranthaceae families. The majority of weed species flowered during monsoon season whereas therophytic life form and microphyllous leaf size categories were the most dominant The highest mean weed diversity, NDVI and NDMI values were recorded for the weed communities of maize fields whereas the higher mean TWI value was recorded for the weed groups of wheat fields, suggesting strong linkage with the local climatic conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis (net effects) suggested that sum of local climatic conditions (seasonality variable) was found to be the most important in controlling the variations in the weed species data followed by longitude and altitude variables and least by the NDVI, NDMI and TWI. It is concluded that effective weed management activities are required to enhance the yield of these two important crops in the area. Thus, further studies related to determination of weed types and their distribution pattern by using factors like fertilization (type, timing, quantity), wheat and maize cultivar, land preparation (types, timing and intensities), soil management, pesticides (usage, type, quantity, quality), irrigation (type like rain-fed, tube-well, canals; timing, quantity), socio-economic and anthropogenic activities, and their relationship with the yield variable on temporal and spatial scales are recommended for this agro-ecosystem of the study area.},

Title = {Forest Fire Susceptibility Zonation in Eastern India Using Statistical and Weighted Modelling Approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recurring forest fires disturb ecological balance, impact socio-economic harmony, and raise global concern. This study implements multiple statistical and weighted modelling approaches to identify forest fire susceptibility zones in Eastern India. Six models, namely, Frequency Ratio (FR), Certainty Factor (CF), Natural Risk Factor (NRF), Bivariate statistical (Wi and Wf), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Logistic Regression (LR) were used in the study. Forest fire inventory (2001 to 2018) mapping was done using forest fire points captured by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. Fire responsible components, namely, topography (which has four variables), climate (5), biophysics (8) and disturbance (4) were used as inputs to the modelling approaches. Multicollinearity analysis was carried out to examine the association and remove the highly-correlated variables before performing the modeling. Validation of model prediction levels was done using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC curve-AUC) value. The results reveal that the areas with west and southwest orientations, and moderate slope demarcate higher susceptibility to forest fire. High precipitation areas with lower temperature but ample solar radiation increase their susceptibility to forest fire. Mixed deciduous forest type with ample solar radiation, higher NDVI, lower NDWI and lower TWI values exhibits higher susceptibility. Model validation shows that LR (with AUC = 0.809) outperforms other models used in the study. To minimize the risk of fire and frame with proper management plans for the study area, susceptibility mapping using satellite imageries, GIS technique, and modelling approaches is highly recommended.},

Abstract = {Background and aims: The objective of this work is to classify mountain wetlands (vegas) in the Central Andes between 28 degrees y 53 degrees S, based on geomorphology and hydrology. In addition, it seeks to characterize and determine the area, height, and slope of the vegas in each typology. M\&M: The determination of the different typologies was carried out based on an integrated biophysical approach at different scales of spatial analysis, where the vegas present in the study area were identified and their link with hydrological and geomorphological aspects. The dominant runoff types, and the geomorphological units were determined. Satellite images ALOS-AVNIR-2, Landsat 5 TM and field data were used. Results: A total of 304 vegas were identified that are determined by the geomorphological unit (river plains, alluvial fan, hillside, undifferentiated foothills, depression without surface discharge with or without water and fault) and the dominant type of runoff (linear surface, mantiform subsurface and subsurface mantiform to superficial linear). Four typologies of vegas are recognized: Riverbank, Hillside, Depression and Fault. The Riverbank and Hillside typologies were dominant in number and area. Eight and slope did not result different between typologies. Conclusions: The vegas present in the Central Andes respond to 4 typologies: Riverbank, Fault, Hillside and Depression. There is a close relationship between vegas, geomorphology and the dominant runoff, allowing their classification and to analyze different management measures. The obtained results are a contribution to the study of ecosystems of high ecological and socio-economic value in the region.},

Title = {Determining critical light and hydrologic conditions for macrophyte presence in a large shallow lake: The ratio of euphotic depth to water depth},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Abstract = {Light determines macrophyte distribution, community composition and biomass in shallow lakes. Therefore, it is vital to determine the critical underwater light climate thresholds for macrophyte degradation and recovery. In this study, we first proposed a novel index, defined as the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to water depth (WD), as a measure of the underwater light supply for macrophytes. The underwater light environment in Lake Taihu (a large, shallow, eutrophic lake) was then characterized based on this index (Z(eu)/WD) using field measurements collected from 2006 to 2013 (8 years x 4 seasons x 32 sites). The distribution of the macrophyte presence frequency (MPF, the number of investigations that identified macrophytes divided by the total number of investigations) was greater than 0.70 in Xukou Bay and East Lake Taihu over the 32 investigations, followed by the other sites distributed in East Lake Taihu. The proportion of macrophyte coverage increased with the increase in Z(eu)/WD. A significant relationship was observed between Zeu/WD and MPF for the 19 sites with macrophytes (r(2) = 0.48, p< 0.001, n = 19). In the region with high nutrient concentrations and serious water pollution, better underwater light conditions are required for the growth of macrophytes. A Z(eu)/WD value of 0.80 can be regarded as the critical underwater light threshold for the growth of macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The region with Z(eu)/WD ranging between 0.57 and 0.80 was usually covered by sparse macrophytes; this region should be vital for macrophyte recovery and environmental management in Lake Taihu. The distribution of Z(eu)/WD was further obtained using MODIS satellite-derived Zeu from June to October in 2003 and 2013. Xukou Bay and Guangfu Bay in the southern part of Lake Taihu could be regarded as potentially crucial regions for the recovery of macrophytes from the perspective of underwater light and nutrient levels.

Title = {Vegetable mapping using fuzzy classification of Dynamic Time Warping distances from time series of Sentinel-1A images},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vegetable production is important because of the food security, diet improvement and socio-economic value. Mapping the location and extent of vegetable fields is therefore important in agricultural policy, food security and farmer support. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a common way to map crops from time series of satellite images. However, as all hard classifications, it does not show the spatial distribution of uncertainty in the classification. In fuzzy classification, where memberships to multiple classes are assigned to each pixel, differ-ences in membership between the first and the runners-up class can be used to assess classification uncertainty at the pixel level. This research formulates a fuzzy classifier based upon Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) distances to map vegetable types from time series of Sentinel-1A SAR images. For each pixel, the TWDTW distances to the classes was normalised by dividing them by the sum of all TWDTW distances to all the classes for that pixel. The normalized distances were then used to compute fuzzy memberships for each pixel to each class, using the Gaussian membership function. Based on these memberships, fuzzy measures such as Confusion Index (CI), Ambiguity Index (AI), fuzziness and fuzzy membership were calculated and different thresholds applied on each of the measures during subsequent defuzzification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the defuzzified output results were 0.86 and 0.83, respectively, which was an improvement with regard to the crisp Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping with SPRING strategy for subsequence searching (TWDTWS) algorithm with 0.73 and 0.68 for overall accuracy and kappa, respectively. This study concludes that this new approach improves classification accuracy in image classification by excluding pixels with high un-certainty, which is especially relevant when only a limited number of classes are sampled and mapped.},

Title = {Role of sunshades in space as a climate control option},

Abstract = {Placing reflectors in the stratosphere or in higher-altitude space to shade sunlight is expected to be a promising geoengineering option for use as a countermeasure against climate change. While the sunshade technology has been evaluated from earth-scientific viewpoints, no study has evaluated when and on what scale it can be deployed from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint, presuming that it is used in combination with CO2 abatement options as a pillar of the mitigation of climatic change. Nor have the contributions of geoengineering research and development to the economics of overall climate control measures been evaluated. Such evaluations are attempted in this study, which focuses on a space-based sunshade technology. As a result, it is recommended that radiative forcing be reduced by 0.8 W/m(2) through the sunshades over a period of approximately a century from the latter half of the 21st century. In this case, an increase in global CO2 emissions by some 15\% is allowed in the former half of the 21st century, and the total climate control cost is reducible by 240 billion constant 2005 US\$ on a present value basis compared to the case in which the sunshades are unavailable. To enjoy the above advantages, the mass of the sunshade stock required to offset the increase in radiative forcing due to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration should be lower than 100 Mt/2xCO(2) assuming a continuous decline in the cost of placing (space-launching) sunshades from 6000 to 1000 US\$/kg over a half-century.

Title = {Undamming the Douro River Catchment: A Stepwise Approach for Prioritizing Dam Removal},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dams provide water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation benefits, but also harm native species by altering the natural flow regime, and degrading the aquatic and riparian habitats. In the present study, which comprised the Douro River basin located in the North of Portugal, the cost-benefit assessment of dams was based upon a balance between the touristic benefits of a dammed Douro, and the ecological benefits of less fragmented Douro sub-catchments. Focused on four sub-catchments (Sabor, Tamega, Coa and Corgo), a probabilistic stream connectivity model was developed and implemented to recommend priorities for dam removal, where this action could significantly improve the movement of potadromous fish species along the local streams. The proposed model accounts for fish movement across the dam or weir (permeability), which is a novel issue in connectivity models. However, before any final recommendation on the fate of a dam or weir, the connectivity results will be balanced with other important socio-economic interests. While implementing the connectivity model, an inventory of barriers (dams and weirs) was accomplished through an observation of satellite images. Besides identification and location of any obstacles, the inventory comprised the compilation of data on surrounding land use, reservoir water use, characteristics of the riparian gallery, and permeability conditions for fish, among others. All this information was stored in a geospatial dataset that also included geographical information on the sub-catchment drainage network. The linear (drainage network) and point (barriers) source data were processed in a computer program that provided or returned numbers for inter-barrier stream lengths (habitat), and the barrier permeability. These numbers were finally used in the same computer program to calculate a habitat connector index, and a link improvement index, used to prioritize dam removal based upon structural connectivity criteria. The results showed that habitat patch connectivity in the Sabor, Tamega and Coa sub-catchments is not dramatically affected by the installed obstacles, because most link improvement values were generally low. For the opposite reason, in the Corgo sub-catchment, obstacles may constitute a relatively higher limitation to connectivity, and in this case the removal of eight obstacles could significantly improve this connectivity. Using the probabilistic model of structural connectivity, it was possible to elaborate a preliminary selection of dams/weirs that critically limit stream connectivity, and that will be the focus of field hydraulic characterization to precisely determine fish movement along the associated river stretches. Future work will also include the implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for dam removal or mitigation of the critical structures, as well to define exclusion areas for additional obstacles.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal variations of soil salinization in China's West Songnen Plain},
Journal = {LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 14},
Abstract = {Preventing soil salinization and improving soil productivity play vital roles in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the premise of which is understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of soil salinity in various ecosystems. To improve regional ecosystem management decisions, we examined the spatial variations and temporal changes of soil salinity in China's West Songnen Plain by separately developing prediction models of soil salinity for vegetated and non-vegetated areas (VEA and NEVA) through the combination of field samples, LANDSAT series images, and the partial least square regression (PLSR) method. Twelve variables, encompassing spectral bands, vegetation, and soil salinity indices, were extracted from LANDSAT satellite images. Among the investigated variables, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), red band, and digital elevation model (DEM) yielded the best results for assessing the soil salinity in VEA. In contrast, the green band and SI2 exhibited the most significant correlation with soil salinity for NEVA. Based on 10-fold cross-validation, models predicted soil salinity with R-2 values of 0.812 and 0.803. Results reveal that the salt-affected areas in the West Songnen Plain were estimated at 1.23 x 10(6) hm(2) in 2016 with evident heterogeneous distribution. Intensively salt-affected area (IA) and moderately salt-affected area (MA) are mainly distributed in the low-lying central and northern regions of the plain. From 1991 to 2016, the salt-affected area experienced a rapid increase followed by a slight decline with a peak in 2000. This suggests effective soil amelioration due to ecological projects and a wetter climate, however, the salt-affected area still had a net increase of 0.32 x 10(6) hm(2). The variation of different salt-affected levels was characterized by an increase in slightly salt-affected area (SA), MA, and IA. Cropland was the dominant land cover type affected by soil salinization, with the affected area expanding from 0.39 x 10(6) hm(2) in 1991 to 0.57 x 10(6) hm(2) in 2016. MA and SA were the dominant levels of soil salinization in grassland, with MA expanding by 1.3-times from 1991 to 2016. Although the area of soil salinization increased from 1991 to 2016, the salt-affected area was reduced, and the salt-affected level was downgraded in some parts of the study area after 2000. These results could provide support for monitoring soil salinization in other regions, with the findings expected to benefit ecosystem conservation and restoration for regional sustainable development and provide support for evaluating SDGs.},

Abstract = {Urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta is the most developed one of three urban agglomerations in China, which consists of Shanghai, some cities located in the south of Jiangsu province and the north of Zhejiang province. Shanghai is an international economic, financial, trade and shipping center, which leads the progress of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. It is a lively region which has the fastest economy growth and the largest economy amount The development of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta has played a very important role in China's sustained and steady economic growth all the while. However, with the economic advancement in urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta, the augment of chemical emissions gases, such as non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), CFCS, CO, NO, NO2, caused the decrease of the amount of O-3. According to the previous research, O-3 had a strongly relationship with ultraviolet radiation (UV), and the depletion of O-3 would cause the increase of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth surface. The ultraviolet radiation has a strong negative ecological effect in many aspects, such as people, animal, plant, biogeochemical cycles and the structure of the ecosystem. In the situation, it is very meaningful for us to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of O-3 and ultraviolet radiation in urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta based on remote sensing data; it can also be very important to analyze the relationship between the ultraviolet radiation and O-3. Government departments can legislate or make planning to protect ozone layer in order to reduce the surface ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface to maintain residents' health and ecosystem according the results of the article. We used the total ultraviolet radiation product of SCIAMACHY (from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2007), the total ozone product of SCIAMACHY (from Jan. 2003 to Sep. 2004) and OMI (from Oct. 2004 to Dec. 2007) to analyze the ultraviolet radiation and total ozone spatiotemporal characteristics reaching the earth surface, as well as the relationship between them in urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. Urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was divided into sixteen cities according the administration management and economy activities. The calculation results revealed that (1) the spatial feature of the annual and seasonal of ultraviolet radiation and the total ozone presented significant regional difference, but the distribution characteristics of them were not the same. The spatial character of ultraviolet radiation in urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was that cities located in the lower latitude had the higher ultraviolet radiation, but had the lower total ozone. However, the cities located in the higher latitude had the lower ultraviolet radiation, but had the higher total ozone. (2) the average value of summer ultraviolet radiation of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was the highest one followed by spring, autumn, and the average value of winter ultraviolet radiation was the lowest; the total ozone of spring of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was the highest followed by summer, winter, and the total ozone of autumn was the lowest. (3) The seasonal change amplitude of ultraviolet radiation was not significant, and the trends were different, while the seasonal change range of total ozone was significant, and the trends were different. (4) The calculation results showed that there were negative correlation between the ultraviolet radiation and total ozone in urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta.},

Abstract = {Food culture is most influenced by the locality of its origin, which will have been one of food acquisition and processing by various means. It is generally agreed, and is the basis of much United Nations, especially Food and Agriculture Organisation strategic development policy, that successful agriculture, horticulture and aquacuiture along with fishing, underpin economically viable and healthy communities with their various food cultures. We also know that this must be in tandem with maternal literacy and operational health care systems. These elements are best represented on a regional basis. There is a growing consumer interest in knowing where one's food comes from as a measure of ``food integrity{''}. However, food production alone can be a precarious business and relate to a lesser or greater extent to local food culture and to trade, which may be complementary or at-odds with each other. Likewise, the local food culture may have its strengths and weaknesses as far as its ability to meet nutritional and health needs is concerned. Local food production may be restricted because of geographical or socio-economic conditions which preclude food diversity, although this may be compensated for by trade. Where food adequacy and diversity is compromised, and soils poor, various macro-nutrient, micronutrient (from animals and plants) and phytonutrient (nutritionally-advantageous food component from plants) deficiencies may be in evidence. These food system problems may be intertwined with food culture - for example, ``rice-based and water-soluble vitamin poor{''}; ``few animal-derived foods like meat, fish, eggs and milk with associated low calcium, vitamin D, Vitamin B-12 and long chain n-3 fatty acid intakes{''}; ``low fruit and vegetable intake with limited carotenoids and other phytonutrients{''}. Geo-satellite surveillance and mopping is identifying such ``hot spots{''}: for regional food problems, as well as hot spots where most of the world's biodiversity is found (1.4\% of land on earth). On the other hand, regional food culture can confer considerable advantage for health and economic development, but does not necessarily do so. The challenge is to respect and retain traditional food knowledge and sustainable food systems, with good governance for food security. There has been a recent awakening of interest and concern about the lack of documentation of traditional and indigenous food cultures which are important not only for their own sake, but for the legacy of food knowledge which they can confer on future generations, provided they are not lost. Hence, the value of a special focus on African food cultures (www.healthyeatingclub.org/Africa), including Rift and Nile Valleys and North West African foods, which are the cradles of human food systems and habits. This is the case too with indigenous foods and food cultures (whether hunter-gatherer or subsistence agriculture); with relatively long-living food cultures in North East Asia, with food cultural distinction and fusion (FHILL and SENECA studies) and with migratory Food Habits. By and large, there is a remarkable resilience and ingenuity of people and their food systems, but monoculture and lack of diversity encourage food system failure.},

Title = {Greening residential quarters in China: What are the roles of urban form, socioeconomic factors, and biophysical context?},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Residential greenspace has great intracity variations. Its driving factors have been widely investigated in Western countries (e.g., in Europe and North America), where residential areas are mostly privately owned, but few studies have examined the determinants of residential greenspace in China, where land is owned by the gov-ernment. Taking the subtropical city of Changsha, China, as an example, this study mapped the percent green cover (PGC) in residential quarters with a fine-resolution satellite image. We also investigated its driving factors measured from multisource geospatial data. The results show that (1) the PGC in the residential quarters showed great spatial variation, with an average of 36.6\% (0-85.7\%) and a standard deviation of 18.3\%. (2) Urban form, biophysical context, and socioeconomic factors together explained 49.18\% of the variation in the PGC, and they independently explained 22.87\%, 11.17\%, and 2.31\% of the variation, respectively. (3) Residential quarter size, PGC in the surrounding buffer zone, residential quarter age, housing value, and population density significantly and positively impact the PGC, while percent building cover, floor area ratio, and distance to city center had significant negative impacts. The strongest positive and negative impacts came from PGC in the surrounding buffer zone and percent building cover, respectively. Socioeconomic factors, the dominant driving factors in Western countries, show little impact on residential PGC. These findings expand our understanding of the intracity variation in greenspace coverage and the driving factors, which sheds light on the effective planning and management of urban greenspaces in China.},

Abstract = {The people of northwestern Alaska have had a long relationship with local populations of Rangifer tarandus. During the last 200 years this relationship has changed from one of subsistence to overexploitation of caribou (the name for wild reindeer in North America), to commercial livestock production of semi domesticated reindeer and now may be returning to a subsistence economy based on caribou. Reindeer were introduced to Alaska in 1892 because of the disappearance of caribou, a subsistence resource. Until recently, reindeer meat and velvet antler production generated significant employment and revenue important to the economies of rural Alaskan communities. However, from 1976 to 1996 the Western Arctic Caribou Herd (WACH) increased from about 75,000 to 463,000 animals. Concurrently, winter range use of the WACH shifted westward onto traditional reindeer ranges of the Seward Peninsula for the first time in over 100 years. This event has produced socio-economic and ecological consequences for the region. Many reindeer herders have lost 75-100 percent of their herds through commingling and out-migration with wild caribou. This loss, amounting to over 17,000 reindeer, represents a potential economic value of millions of dollars. Many herders have adopted new technologies, such as satellite telemetry and intensive herding to salvage what is left of their herds. Here we discuss the role of grazing animals and patterns of human resource use in an Arctic system. We then discuss our findings on the effects and changes in management practices brought about by caribou incursion in the context of the regional economy on the Seward Peninsula.},

Abstract = {Recent flood events along the international border between the USA and Mexico resulted in significant economic damage and loss of human life. The International Boundary and Water Commission, the agency responsible for monitoring US-Mexican flood control levees, had requested funding for maintenance and improvement of these levees. However, the Office of Management and Budget requires agencies to provide benefits or in this case avoided loss estimates to justify the budget request. Due to severe time constraints in the budgetary process there was a need for a rapid assessment of the potential economic impacts from a failure of this ageing flood-control infrastructure. The economic losses avoided by four major flood-control projects on the Rio Grande were estimated using an innovative combination of satellite imagery, geographic information systems, and economic methods. The control projects apply to about 547 km (340 miles) of levees from Caballo Reservoir in New Mexico to Brownsville, Texas, and include several million people, extensive industry, and agricultural production. High resolution imagery was used to identify and quantify potential flood inundation areas, types of land use, and impacts of flood-control infrastructure failure. Value estimates of residential, industrial, and commercial property, and agricultural production at risk were developed from property assessment data, crop enterprise budgets, census data, and community leaders. Damage factors accounting for flood inundation levels and building contents were then used to develop gross economic losses avoided by flood-control infrastructure for each of the different property and land use types in each project area. The baseline analysis indicates that the four projects cumulatively prevent one time losses of US\$322.9 million in flood-control protection.},

Title = {Multi-decadal shoreline change in coastal natural world heritage sites - a global assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Natural World Heritage Sites (NWHS), which are of Outstanding Universal Value, are increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic pressures. This is especially true for coastal NWHS, which are additionally subject to erosion and flooding. This paper assesses shoreline change from 1984 to 2016 within the boundaries of 67 designated sites, providing a first global consistent assessment of its drivers. It develops a transferable methodology utilising new satellite-derived global shoreline datasets, which are classified based on linearity of change against time and compared with global datasets of geomorphology (topography, land cover, coastal type, and lithology), climate variability and sea-level change. Significant shoreline change is observed on 14\% of 52 coastal NWHS shorelines that show the largest recessional and accretive trends (means of -3.4 m yr(-1)and 3.5 m yr(-1), respectively). These rapid shoreline changes are found in low-lying shorelines (<1 m elevation) composed of unconsolidated sediments in vegetated tidal coastal systems (means of -7.7 m yr(-1)and 12.5 m yr(-1)), and vegetated tidal deltas at the mouth of large river systems (means of -6.9 m yr(-1)and 11 m yr(-1)). Extreme shoreline changes occur as a result of redistribution of sediment driven by a combination of geomorphological conditions with (1) specific natural coastal morphodynamics such as opening of inlets (e.g.Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve) or gradients of alongshore sediment transport (e.g.Namib Sea) and (2) direct or indirect human interferences with natural coastal processes such as sand nourishment (e.g.Wadden Sea) and damming of river sediments upstream of a delta (e.g.Danube Delta).The most stable soft coasts are associated with the protection of coral reef ecosystems (e.g.Great Barrier Reef) which may be degraded/destroyed by climate change or human stress in the future. A positive correlation between shoreline retreat and local relative sea-level change was apparent in theWadden Sea. However, globally, the effects of contemporary sea-level rise are not apparent for coastal NWHS, but it is a major concern for the future reinforcing the shoreline dynamics already being observed due to other drivers. Hence, future assessments of shoreline change need to account for other drivers of coastal change in addition to sea-level rise projections. In conclusion, extreme multi-decadal linear shoreline trends occur in coastal NWHS and are driven primarily by sediment redistribution. Future exacerbation of these trends may affect heritage values and coastal communities. Thus shoreline change should be considered in future management plans where necessary. This approach provides a consistent method to assess NWHS which can be repeated and help steer future management of these important sites.},

Abstract = {Connecting the Unconnected or under-connected (CTU) is the holy grail of transforming the lives of over 3 billion people around the globe with wireless Internet who are yet to experience its value in multiple ways. If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be enormous. This white paper from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G and B5G networks in the standardization process, in the development of the use cases, and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed access to Internet as basic human right and has said that these goals cannot be achieved without affordable access to Internet by everyone on this planet. While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost of deployment otherwise achievable by volume. Although difficult to pin down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important. But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create large global projects and influence the network service providers, manufacturers and their governments. This white paper defines the CTU working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems level to bring down the cost of the network in order to be affordable. In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is intermittent. Thus, this white paper identifies a number of technology gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the targeted set of users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation Funds). Finally, the white paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting from the current state to 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.},

Abstract = {To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR) model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters; especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70\% of them were used as the training dataset and 30\% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments.},

Title = {Generating digital terrain model: joint use of airborne lidar data and optical images},
Journal = {TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {The knowledge of an accurate topography is a prerequest for monitoring natural hazards and for environmental management (e.g. hydrologic and erosion models). Remote sensing lidar systems are active sensors which record altimeter data of the Earth's surface as 3D point clouds: from an emitted laser pulse, the receptor detects backscaterred photons from the reflecting target. The altimeter accuracy is often higher than in the case of using stereoscopic conventional techniques, even if the ground density of the data is often lower. Additionnaly, beyond the altimeter information, these data contain spectral information related to the target reflectance in the infra-red domain. Depending on the target geometry, lidar systems can acquire several echos for a single laser pulse. This property is particularly interesting in forests or in areas of urban vegetation since it provides not only the canopy height, but also, under certain conditions, the terrain height under the vegetation layer. Many algorithms have been implemented to sort out the automatic classification problem of 3D point clouds providing ground and off-ground points as well as the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). This is mainly due to the various aspects of landscapes within a global survey which can include urban, forest or mountainous areas. This paper presents the generation of DTMs based on the joint use of optical images and lidar data. The study is focused on rural areas where a large scale mapping is a major issue. We propose an algorithm based on a predictive Kalman filter for which the temporal component is replaced by a spacial indexation. The algorithm consists in analyzing the altimeter distribution of the point cloud of a local area in the local slope frame. We insist on the role of local slopes for determining the ground height especially in case of steep slope terrain. We assume that points of the first altimeter mode (lowest points) belong to the terrain. The mean height of these points correspond to the measured DTM value. The final DTM value at a specific position is obtained by a linear combination between the measured value and the predicted value. The predicted value depends on the neighboring pixels through their respective uncertainties. The slopes are also integrated in the predictive filter. The local slope is estimated by robust M-estimator, based on the local first altimeter mode. The final slope for each site depends on the corresponding neighborhood uncertainties. This process makes the slope estmation more robust. Finally, the predictive Kalman framework provides not only a robust terrain surface, but also an uncertainty for each DTM pixel as well as a map of normal vectors. The local window size is a critical parameter in filtering algorithms. It should be small enough to keep all ground details but large enough to ensure the removal of off-ground objects such as trees or/and buildings. Consequently, we S introduce an adaptation of the local neighborhood based on the integration of image and lidar data within a predictor of high vegetation areas. In this context, we decided to investigate the potential of using raw uncalibrated lidar intensity in case of a joint indice computation, which is generally derived from image-based infrared data. Consequently, lidar intensity and optical images are combined to generate a Hybrid Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (HNDVI). The lidar provides the infrared band whereas the aerial image provides RGB spectral bands. A vegetation mask is then calculated with HNDVI and lidar variance information. In fact, higher values of HNDVI are likely to correspond to vegetated areas and vegetation is described as non-ordered point cloud with a high variance compared to human-made structures. Based on the vegetation mask, the local neighborhood size continuously varies from a predefined minimum distance to an automatically processed upper boundary depending on the vegetated area density. Lidar data have been collected in 2004 by the Institut Frangais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER) over the Morbihan Gulf, France. It has been funded by TOTAL. The entire survey is composed of 230.106 points with intensities and has been acquired with an ALTM (Optech) system 1210. The point density is 0.7 pt/m(2). The lidar wavelength is 1064 nm. Optical images are extracted from the BDOrtho (R) French orthophoto data basis of the Institut Geographique National with a nominal resolution of 0.5 m, but resampled at 2.5 m for the generation of the Hybrid-NDVI image. Conclusive results show the potentiality of a full combination of lidar data and RGB optical images for improving the generation of fine DTMs on rural environments. The filtering process is more robust, DTM are less picked due to vegetation filtering. However, in case of dense vegetation, the window size can be large and the average terrain height may be underestimated. As future work, further area predictors can be developed to adapt the proposed methodology to various landscapes and relieves.},

Title = {Assessment and simulation of land use and land cover change impacts on the land surface temperature of Chaoyang District in Beijing, China},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization is changing the existing patterns of land use land cover (LULC) globally, which is consequently increasing the land surface temperature (LST) in many regions. The present study is focused on estimating current and simulating future LULC and LST trends in the urban environment of Chaoyang District, Beijing. Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method and multispectral Landsat satellite images during the 1990-2018 data period. The cellular automata (CA) and stochastic transition matrix of the Markov model were applied to simulate future (2025) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. The CA model was validated for the simulated and estimated LULC for 1990-2018, with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.83, using validation modules in IDRISI software. Our results indicated that the cumulative changes in built-up to vegetation area were 74.61 km2 (16.08\%) and 113.13 km2 (24.38\%) from 1990 to 2018. The correlation coefficient of land use and land cover change (LULCC), including vegetation, water bodies and built-up area, had values of r = -0.155 (p > 0.005), -0.809 (p = 0.000), and 0.519 (p > 0.005), respectively. The results of future analysis revealed that there will be an estimated 164.92 km2 (-12\%) decrease in vegetation area, while an expansion of approximately 283.04 km2 (6\% change) will occur in built-up areas from 1990 to 2025. This decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely cause a rise of approximately similar to 10.74 degrees C and similar to 12.66 degrees C in future temperature, which would cause a rise in temperature (2025). The analyses could open an avenue regarding how to manage urban land cover patterns to enhance the resilience of cities to climate warming. This study provides scientific insights for environmental development and sustainability through efficient and effective urban planning and management in Beijing and will also help strengthen other research related to the UHI phenomenon in other parts of the world.},

Abstract = {The mapping of soil nutrients is a key issue for numerous applications and research fields ranging from global changes to environmental degradation, from sustainable soil management to the precision agriculture concept. The characterization, modeling and mapping of soil properties at diverse spatial and temporal scales are key factors required for different environments. This paper is focused on the use and comparison of soil chemical analyses, Visible near infrared and shortwave infrared VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy, partial least-squares regression (PLSR), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) images, to inexpensively analyze and predict the content of different soil nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)), pH, and soil organic matter (SOM) in arid conditions. To achieve this aim, 100 surface samples of soil were gathered to a depth of 25 cm in the Wadi El-Garawla area (the northwest coast of Egypt) using chemical analyses and reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. PLSR was used firstly to model the relationship between the averaged values from the ASD spectroradiometer and the available N, P, and K, pH and SOM contents in soils in order to map the predicted value using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and secondly to retrieve N, P, K, pH, and SOM values from OLI images. Thirty soil samples were selected to verify the validity of the results. The randomly selected samples included the spatial diversity and characteristics of the study area. The prediction of available of N, P, K pH and SOM in soils using VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy showed high performance (where R-2 was 0.89, 0.72, 0.91, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively) and quite satisfactory results from Landsat-8 OLI images (correlation R-2 values 0.71, 0.68, 0.55, 0.62 and 0.7, respectively). The results showed that about 84\% of the soils of Wadi El-Garawla are characterized by low-to-moderate fertility, while about 16\% of the area is characterized by high soil fertility.},

Abstract = {The seasonal and occasional movement of wild animals including elephants from one terrestrial habitat to another habitat are very common natural as well as biological habits for the survival of their lives. Around 163 km railway track runs from Siliguri Junction (SGUJ) to Alipurduar Junction (APDJ) within biodiversity hotspot region. According to the report of Forest Department, around 14 prominent and 59 minor elephant corridors have been crisscrossed over the railway track and in between the years 1974 and 2019, nearly 71 elephants are brutally killed due to collision with running trains. The kernel density estimation model is applied to evaluate the spatio-temporal death risk of elephants. To predict the spatial vulnerability or risk of accidental death of elephants, Kernel density estimation analytical algorithms like Bandwidth selection, Intensity, Grid Resolution, Kernel function have been considered. This model considers past accidental deaths data along with secondary data like train speed, fragmentation of elephant habitats, distance of croplands from railway track, human encroachment with electric fencing etc. The anthropogenic activities as well as land use and land cover change have been analysed using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager-OLI (2019) satellite images and digitally processed by EDRAS IMAGINE 16.5(v16.5.0.852) software. Similarly digital thematic maps have also been prepared on ArcGIS 10.3 platform. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) intensity (risk) is computed considering the Elephant Death Risk Score (EDRS) as it takes into account of the first and second order properties. Fixed bandwidth is selected for the whole distribution and it is computed by the nearest neighbour distance mean method. On the basis of calculated tau value, (the mean distance between centroids and nearest neighbour index) Kernel Density map is prepared to show the elephant death risk in term of first order properties and second order properties. The result shows very high and high KD (risk) values ( 0.9799-10.0709) are confined in the eastern and western segments of the SGUJ to APDJ railway line. Therefore, this model helps to take sustainable holistic environmental management of wild animals as well as wild natural habitats in different corners of the globe.},

Abstract = {Background: For nearly five decades long-term studies in rodents have been the accepted benchmark for assessing chronic long-termtoxic effects, particularly carcinogenicity, of chemicals. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have pointed out that the current set of internationally utilized test methods capture only some of the potential adverse effects associated with exposures to these agents over the lifetime. Objectives: In this paper, we propose the adaption of the carcinogenicity bioassay to integrate additional protocols for comprehensive long-term toxicity assessment that includes developmental exposures and long-term outcomes, capable of generating information on a broad spectrum of different end points. Discussion: An integrated study design based on a stepwise process is described that includes the priority end points of the Economic Co-operation and Development and the National Toxicology Program guidelines on carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity and developmental and reproductive toxicity. Integrating a comprehensive set of relevant toxicological end points in a single protocol represents an opportunity to optimize animal use in accordance with the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement). This strategy has the potential to provide sufficient data on multiple windows of susceptibility of specific interest for risk assessments and public health decision-making by including prenatal, lactational, neonatal exposures and evaluating outcomes over the lifespan. Conclusion: This integrated study design is efficient in that the same generational cohort of rats used for evaluating long-term outcomes can be monitored in satellite parallel experiments to measure biomarkers and other parameters related to system-specific responses including metabolic alterations and endocrine disturbances.

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline changes and future forecasting: the case of Kucuk Menderes Delta, Turkiye},

Abstract = {A delta coastal area is one of the most important regions for human use owing to its scenic natural beauty and economic value. However, due to the constant interaction between the land and water environments in this region, it is also one of the most rapidly changing landforms in the world under the impact of natural processes as well as anthropogenic activities. Therefore, the determination and the constant monitoring of these changes spatiotemporally are of great significance in terms of the protection, planning, proper usage, effective management, and sustainability of the delta coast. In this study was aimed to determine the short-term and long-term shoreline changes that occurred between the years 1957 and 2020 along the coast of the Kucuk Menderes Delta and its close surroundings. In addition, the underlying causes were explored, and the future of the shoreline position was forecasted. The shorelines were digitized using seven multi-temporal orthophoto maps based on the high water line indicator. The shoreline changes were analyzed using different statistical methods, namely, the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear Regression Rate (LRR), by employing the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The future position of the shoreline was estimated using the extended Kalman Filter in the DSAS. The analyses revealed that in a period of 63 years, the maximum accretion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR and LRR) were 248.99 m, 3.96 m/year, and 3.65 m/year, respectively, the maximum erosion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR and LRR) were - 142.37 m, - 2.27 m/year, and - 2.19 m/year, respectively, and the delta coastal area had increased by 37.01 ha. It is forecasted that the delta coastal area will expand by 10.63 ha and 16.16 ha from 2020 to 2030 and 2040. If the current conditions that occurred in the last 63 years continue with similar effects, it was forecasted that by the years 2030 and 2040, significant changes would occur in the shoreline such as retreat into the existing facilities/usage areas and decrease of Eleman Wetland area, which would greatly alter the ecology, hydrography, and spatial usage of the delta region.},

Title = {Precision variable rate nitrogen for dryland farming on waterlogging Riverine Plains of Southeast Australia?},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen, invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces crop yields. Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha). Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one year may be poorest in the next. We answer the question: ``Why would a farmer in this district choose to apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment, georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map data for that paddock in many past seasons?{''} We show that soil conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging. If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season, applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable. We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable, fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices. Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1\% increase in yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7\% decrease in applied N. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.},

Title = {Changes in crop type distribution in Zhangye City of the Heihe River Basin, China},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {22-36},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With rapid economic development in China, crops have undergone remarkable changes in both their type and spatial pattern. Timely and accurate information of crop type distribution will help government and agricultural producers quickly understand regional agricultural production conditions to better facilitate appropriate adjustments in planting patterns and policies. Another benefit of acquiring such knowledge of crops is that it should enhance regional agricultural competitiveness, optimize resource allocations, and further guarantee national food security. Towards this end, and using the Zhangye City in the Heihe River Basin as a study area, the present research elaborated upon a methodology to classify crop type distribution based on multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) images. Using this methodology we achieved the spatial distributions of crop types in Zhangye City in 2007 and 2012, and analyzed changes in their distributions over this period. In addition, some landscape indices were calculated to clarify the landscape pattern of crops. The crop conversion potentials in 2017 were modeled using four conversion sub-models of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Generally, the overall accuracy of crop classification in Zhangye was high, at 89.38\%. From 2007 to 2012, the cultivated land area in Zhangye increased from 463.81 x 10(3) ha to 493.89 x 10(3) ha. The sowing area of corn and oilseed rape increased by 39.21 x 10(3) ha and 5.99 x 10(3) ha, respectively, while for wheat and barley the sowing area decreased by 3.61 x 10(3) ha and 9.14 x 10(3) ha, respectively. Considering other crop types as a group, their sowing area decreased by only 2.37 x 10(3) ha. The increase in corn sowing area mainly came from the conversion of other crops to corn, which accounted for 43.09\% of its total sowing area in 2012. Furthermore, corn and oilseed rape showed a tendency of intensive sowing, whereas for wheat and barley the tendency was towards scattered sowing. For the future, corn has high conversion potential in Linze and Gaotai counties of Zhangye, while wheat, barley and oilseed rape have high conversion potentials in Minle and Shandan counties.

Abstract = {Understanding the global carbon (C) cycle is of crucial importance to map current and future climate dynamics relative to global environmental change. A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes. However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based spatially explicit surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans, continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through geostatistical and/ or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE) between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere. Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories. Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling. In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric inversions. This holds for Europe (mean +/- 1 SD: 0.8 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1), positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1 +/- 0.4 PgC yr(-1)), East Asia (1.6 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), South Asia (0.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1)), Australia (0.2 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), and most of the Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of 5.4 +/- 2.0 PgC yr(-1). By contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2 over 2001-2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source of 4.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1). This mismatch of nearly 10 PgC yr(-1) highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second, extensive pCO(2) data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and inland water-atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) and atmospheric inversions, without over-or under-stating bottom-up data credibility. In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2 fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which future emission reductions are proposed.},

Title = {Impact of information technology on the earth sciences},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-319},
Abstract = {The earth sciences went through a major paradigm shift in the 1960s with the understanding that the earth's crust is composed of many crustal plates which are moving relative to each other. This new basic insight quickly led to the solution of many longstanding geological and geophysical problems. The new paradigm allowed earth scientists to construct models that could explain a host of geological phenomena front the formation of mineral deposits and oil and gas accumulations to the controls of earthquakes and volcanism. Information technologies, mainly the rapidly increasing power of mainframe computers allowed the building, testing, and stimulation of these often complex models. Data gathering techniques also improved with the development of, for example, digital reflection seismology which provided much clearer images of the earth's crust, well-logging techniques, and remote sensing of the earth's surface by imaging technologies carried on satellites. Newly available or rapidly developing information technologies are about to propel the earth sciences, especially, the applied earth sciences, into a new era. The component information technologies are now available to allow the earth sciences to move to a dynamic systems view of the world. Currently, available, three-dimensional reflection seismology techniques have resulted in remarkably clear images of portions of the earth's crust. Applied to oil and gas exploration, this has resulted in improved pictures of the structure and form, or architecture, of oil and gas reservoirs. However, with currently available technology we have, at best, only a static picture of the reservoir. Based upon this, geologists and petroleum engineers must infer the dynamics of fluid flow through the reservoir. Newly emerging four-dimensional seismic reflection technology techniques allow repeated imaging of the reservoir and the detection of fluid fronts, from which inferences can be made about the rates and direction of flow and fluid pathways. This is analogous to time-lapse photography, but the cost of such techniques means that the interval between surveys is very long and the inferences yield only quasi-dynamic information. Similar problems exist in understanding the current state and the dynamics of important aquifers which supply water to urban populations and also to active earthquake belts. The capability to understand these and other dynamic systems within the earth is a major challenge to earth scientists and their colleagues in related disciplines. Indeed, the nature of the problems is such that the solutions will not be found by earth scientists alone. Multidisciplinary approaches are needed and the information technologies will enable the sharing of models and concepts between disciplines. The key components of the information technologies that will enable this revolution range from sensor technologies through data management and computation to visualization technologies. Each of these components needs to be linked to the other so that we have a complete feedback from observation through modeling to knowledge building and decision making. Sensor technologies, particularly the rapid advance of fibre optic sensors, will allow the continuous monitoring of many processes within the earth. Recent tests by Chevron have demonstrated that fibre optic sensors can be deployed within oil wells and that the data gathered yields useful information on the changes occurring within the reservoir. In this particular rest, the data gathered was temperature data from a reservoir through which steam is being driven to flush out viscous oil. The temperature data yielded information on the speed of heating through the reservoir and the pathways through which the heat was dispersed. From this type of data we can begin to understand the dynamic behavior of the reservoir. Coupled with the available static models, geologists and engineers can better predict the response of the reservoir to various production schemes. Data gathering, data storage and manipulation/interrogation technologies either exist or are being developed which will allow the scientist and engineer to avoid data overload and focus on extracting information of value from the data. Without these technologies, we are in danger of being overwhelmed by data to the extent that we miss its information content. This is probably the greatest danger of the so-called information age. Visualization technology is very important to the earth sciences, which by their nature require geologists and geophysicists to be able to picture complex three- and even four-dimensional pictures. Previously, the only way to share these complex pictures was through simple two-dimensional charts. Visualization technologies are now advancing rapidly and three-dimensional pictures can be developed, manipulated, and shared between the various disciplines and cultures which now staff the multidisciplinary teams which are necessary to solve the many complex problems we are faced with. The next stage in visualization of complex earth structures is some type of virtual reality. Experiments conducted by Chevron's research staff have shown that it is possible to project complex images on to a plane surface and with the aid of special glasses viewers can see, manipulate and discuss the inferences of a three-dimensional image. Simulation and model building technologies are already very advanced because this is an area which progressed rapidly with the increasing capability of maining-frame computers and workstations. However, critical advances in both simulation technologies and the computational capability and speed of workstation have taken the application of simulation and modeling technology into the bands of the generalist. This is a very important development because it allows models to be built and processes to be simulated that give new insights and lead to intelligent and knowledgeable applications. The role of the specialist will change in this new world of dispersed and readily available technology. Application of this entire suite of information technologies to the understanding of both natural and culturally-induced processes within the earth's crust is the final prize. The complete cycle from data gathering through modeling to knowledge building and improved decisions allows the application of systems and control theory to processes within the earth's crust. This dynamic loop will drive a major paradigm shift in the earth sciences and greatly increase the value of their application and integration with other technical disciplines. The speed with which the vision becomes reality will rely not only on the provision of appropriately robust technology at economic prices but also on the ability of earth scientists and those from companion disciplines to grasp this opportunity and persuade society of the many economic, ecologic and cultural benefits of such an approach.

Title = {Monitoring three-decade dynamics of citrus planting in Southeastern China using dense Landsat records},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Across Southeastern China, the expansion of citrus plantation has underpinned substantial economic development at the expense of forest cover and associated ecosystem services. The high-order complexity of citrus planting dynamics requires more detailed observations. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel monitoring scheme by integrating multi-epoch land cover classification and continuous change detection on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using all available Landsat archives (1986-2018). First, a stable/changed area masking approach was adopted. Then, the GEE-based Continuous Change Detection and Classification (GEE-CCDC) algorithm was applied to detect the timing and position of citrus planting-related land cover changes. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme was validated both spatially and temporally. We applied the proposed scheme in Xunwu, a typical County in Southeastern China where continuous expansion was disrupted by an outbreak of Huanglongbing (HLB, a destructive citrus disease). The validation results indicate that the multiepoch classification effectively identified the stable, abandoned, and newly cultivated areas related to citrus planting. Within these areas, our monitoring of citrus planting dynamics had an overall temporal accuracy of 90.59\% and a mean detection date deviation of 13.21 days (leading). Based on the change detection results, we found a two-stage change pattern, namely a continuous expansion period (1986-2016) followed by a disturbance period (2017-2018). Moreover, almost half of the orchards were cultivated in regions with an elevation and slope of 301-400 m and 11-20 degrees. During the continuous expansion period, a total of 497.85 km(2) natural lands were converted for citrus planting. Affected by the HLB outbreak, both orchard abandonment (114.66 km(2)) and new orchard cultivation (36.87 km(2)) were detected during the disturbance period. The proposed scheme offers a useful tool for cash crops management, and highlights the value of dense satellite data in monitoring the extent of ongoing human appropriation of natural ecosystems at a large scale and long-term.},

Title = {The economic impact of tourism in Central Finland: a regional input-output study},
Journal = {TOURISM REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-547},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional taxes in Central Finland. Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central Finland are quite significant. Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings, consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism jobs are often low paying. Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries. Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism impact studies using the input-output technique have also been conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers involved in regional planning and development.},

Title = {Delta dynamics: Effects of a major earthquake, tides, and river flows on Cienega de Santa Clara and the Colorado River Delta, Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {144-156},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The intertidal portion of Mexico's Colorado River Delta is a dynamic environment subject to complex interactions of tectonic, fluvial, and tidal forces at the head of the Gulf of California. We review the historical interactions of these forces, use sequential satellite images, overflights, ground observations, and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to study the effects of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah Earthquake on changing patterns of tidal inundation within the Delta, and assess effects of these changes to the fluvial/hydrological regime of the Colorado River estuary and nearby Cienega de Santa Clara wetland. The objectives of this study are to highlight for environmental scientists, land managers, and ecological engineers the contribution of tectonic forces in shaping the intertidal Delta environment and to provide information on the effects of the 2010 earthquake which will be of practical value in planning and designing management measures and restoration projects for the estuary and Cienega. The Colorado River estuary is at present blocked by a tidal sand bar which restricts access by marine species to the upper estuary and obstructs the flow of fresh water into the lower estuary. Located 13 km east of the estuary, the Cienega is a 6000 ha wetland supported by agricultural drain water from Arizona and Mexico. South of the Cienega is the Santa Clara Slough, an unvegetated 26,000 ha basin subject to periodic inundation from the northern Gulf's high amplitude tides, which have historically reached the margins of the Cienega several times each year. The El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake ruptured the previously unknown Indiviso Fault which extends into the intertidal zone just west of the Cienega. The Cienega experienced only minor surface deformation having no direct effects to the wetland. Most of the significant ground movement and surface deformation occurred west of the Indiviso Fault adjacent to the estuary, where portions of the intertidal flats underwent extensive liquefaction, northward coseismic displacement and post-seismic subsidence. These surface deformations changed the pattern of tidal inundation, triggering development of a new system of natural tidal channels and creating conditions favorable for installation of projects to restore connectivity between the upper and lower estuary. The changed pattern of tidal inundation may also have contributed to an observed reduction in the occurrence of tidal flooding along the southwestern margin of the Cienega following the earthquake.

Title = {Evaluating rainfall datasets to reconstruct floods in data-sparse Himalayan region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Floods are widespread natural disasters having significant socio-economic impacts and require appropriate modelling and management strategies. Flood modelling is an enduring challenge, especially over the data-sparse mountainous regions such as the Himalayas, due to the lack of accurate rainfall measurements. Global datasets are often employed for flood modelling; however, their applicability over the Himalayan terrain is still uncertain. In this regard, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model is increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates. This work aims at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets, satellite product, and the WRF model to represent heavy rainfall over the Himalayan terrain. Further, these datasets are used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to assess their ability to reconstruct floods in the Himalayan region. A Rainfall-Flood Skill Score (RFSS) is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the region. The range of RFSS can vary from - infinity to 1, with positive values as the desired value. The analysis is conducted over the upstream part of the Upper Ganga Basin, spanning from high elevation mountains to the foothills of the Himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that caused flooding in the region. Quantitative evaluation of rainfall datasets in terms of bias, RMSE, and scale errors shows high spatial variability with different datasets performing differently over various regions of the study area. The topography is observed to influence the performance of rainfall datasets. Based on the error metrics, it is found that the rainfall simulated using the WRF model exhibits least error in high elevation and valley regions of the Himalayas, whereas, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR, in some cases) datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the Himalayas. On forcing the VIC model with these datasets, the WRF model with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest RFSS score of 0.97 among all the datasets and, therefore, considered most suitable for simulating floods in the study region.},

Abstract = {Accurate and timely information on croplands is important for environmental, food security, and policy studies. Spatially explicit cropland datasets are also required to derive information on crop type, crop yield, cropping intensity, as well as irrigated areas. Large area - defined as continental to global - cropland mapping is challenging due to differential manifestation of croplands, wide range of cultivation practices and limited reference data availability. This study presents the results of a cropland extent mapping of 64 countries covering large parts of Europe, Middle East, Russia and Central Asia. To cover such a vast area, roughly 160,000 Landsat scenes from 3351 footprints between 2014 and 2016 were processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We used a pixel-based Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm with a set of satellite data inputs capturing diverse spectral, temporal and topographical characteristics across twelve agroecological zones (AEZs). The reference data to train the classification model were collected from very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) and ancillary datasets. The result is a binary map showing cultivated/non-cultivated areas ca. 2015. The map produced an overall accuracy of 93.8\% with roughly 14\% omission and commission errors for the cropland class based on a large set of independent validation samples. The map suggests the entire study area has a total 546 million hectares (Mha) of net croplands (nearly 30\% of global net cropland areas) occupying 18\% of the study land area. Comparison between national cropland area estimates from United Nations Food and Agricultural Organizations (FAO) and those derived from this work also showed an R-square value of 0.95. This Landsat-derived 30-m cropland product (GFSAD30) provided 10-30\% greater cropland areas compared to UN FAO in the 64 Countries. Finally, the map-to-map comparison between GFSAD30 with several other cropland products revealed that the best similarity matrix was with the 30 m global land cover (GLC30) product providing an overall similarity of 88.8\% (Kappa 0.7) with producer's cropland similarity of 89.2\% (errors of omissions = 10.8\%) and user's cropland similarity of 81.8\% (errors of commissions = 8.1\%). GFSAD30 captured the missing croplands in GLC30 product around significantly irrigated agricultural areas in Germany and Belgium and rainfed agriculture in Italy. This study also established that the real strengths of GFSAD30 product, compared to other products, were: 1. identifying precise location of croplands, and 2. capturing fragmented croplands. The cropland extent map dataset is available through NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at tps://doi.org,10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFSAD/GFSAD30EUMARUMECE.001, while the training and reference data as well as visualization are available at the Global Croplands <https://croplands.org > website, GEE code is accessible at: https://code.earthengine.google.com/1666e8bed34e0ce2b2aaf1235ad8c6bd.},

Abstract = {The developments taking place in Information Technology (IT), particularly, the convergence between computers and communication has made the world a global village.  Indeed competitive advantage would be primarily determined by a nation's or firm's IT infrastructure.  This is all the more compelling in the context of our economic reforms programme where India is all set to get plugged into the global economy.  The shift from analogue to digital technology has brought a major transition which has completely altered the communications landscape.  `'anytime anywhere'' communications based on mobile cellular, satellite and Personal Communication System (PCS) technologies are fast becoming a global reality.  This coupled with the development of `'Information Superhighways'' based on optical fibre is making the integration of voice, data and video available through the Integrated Services Digital Network.  While wireless and optical fibre based local loops loom on the horizon, `the last mile problem' has resulted in the amalgamation of major switching and cable networks in the USA, in order to bring multimedia to tomorrow's home.  It is anticipated that several of these possibilities would become commonplace by the year 2000 and in this context it is extremely important that developing countries like our own, chalk out strategies in order to leapfrog technologies in the most cost effective manner with a view to successfully managing the tremendous changes underway. The output of global electronics reached \$700 billion in 1990 and is expected to reach about \$1.3 trillion by the year 2000.  The value added by the electronics industry is growing at about 6 per cent per year, compared with about 3.8 per cent for all manufacturing industries and 3.1 per cent for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (all in real terms).  At this pace by the year 2000 electronics will account for about 4 per cent of world GDP and 14 per cent of value added in manufacturing.  In comparison, the Indian electronics industry reached an output level of a little over \$ 4 billion in 1992 representing 0.7 per cent of the global electronics industry.  If India were to achieve a production level of \$ 20 billion by the year 2000, this would increase to 1.5 per cent. In the context of the next decade China whose current electronics output is almost 3 times that of India provides a very useful point of reference.  What is alarming is the rate at which electronics applications are growing in China, in TV, telecom and Information Technology (IT).  Thus, China's production of TV sets, both colour and Black \& White, is 5 times that of India; it proposes to install over 3 times the number of telephones by the year 2000; and its IT industry currently is also 3 times of India's.  These in turn provide rapidly improving economies of scale, when compared to those of the Indian electronics industry, thus promoting greater vertical integration, increasing cost competitiveness, makes exports more viable and attracts greater foreign direct investment and technology to feed its burgeoning market.  Consequently, there is an imperative need to provide a strategic vision at this juncture to address the Chinese challenge and to ensure the future health of the Indian electronics industry commensurate with our size and capabilities. The background paper provides the current status of the electronics industry both nationally as well as internationally and the development strategies pursued by different countries.  From these, the major issues in devising an appropriate strategy for future development of the Indian Electronics Industry are derived.  This is to lay the ground work for further deliberation.  The paper is divided into following parts: Development of the Indian Electronics Industry Electronics Industry:  Global Scenario Development Strategies in Selected Economies Issues Relating to Developing the Indian Electronics Industry},

Title = {Linking data of ENSO, NDVI-MODIS and crops yield as a base of an early warning system for agriculture in Cordoba, Argentina},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {By influencing interannual rainfall variability in the Province of Cordoba, Argentina, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also impact on corn and soybean yields at the main rain-fed agricultural production departments. Spectral NDVI data not only capture the environmental impact on vegetation directly, but also can expose it spread all over a region at the same time. As support of an early warning system and decision-making for agriculture, the impact of ENSO on corn and soybean yields anomaly (YA) was analyzed between 2000 and 2017, by using different indicators: SOI, MEI and ONI over the 12 major production departments of Cordoba. Also, NDVI-MODIS data was assessed all over Rio Segundo (RS) territory in the center of Cordoba as a vegetation proxy to depict the agricultural activity in a broad sense. To check signal persistency, the relationship was assessed first using the indicators from July to October prior to the sowing date; and then once the growing season has finished, to show the effective ENSO impact on crops productivity. Persistence of ENSO signal was verified, so that the ENSO influence during the growing season quantified remains or intensifies when is compared to information in advance to the start of crop season. While for SOIGS and MEIGS the correlation with corn yield is significant (p < 0.05) in all Cordoba departments, it is always a little lower for ONIGS. Instead, for soybean only 4 departments show significant relationships when using ONIGS, 5 in the case of MEIGS and it increases to 6 when using SOIGS. The particular response of NDVI anomaly (AND) to ENSO was located and quantified for different indices and periods during the crop season. A consistent relationship was found between ENSO and the NDVI as an indicator of agricultural activity in RS territory but, in any case, the area fraction with a significant condition is quite small. The relationship with NDVI is stronger for SOI particularly when a more extended period is considered that include NDVI data of April and May, at the end of the rainy season. While before the beginning of the growing season SOIA-S and SOIS-O reach a significant relationship with the NDVI accumulated since November to May in 11\% and 10\% of Rio Segundo territory, respectively, the percentage increases to 19\% when SOIGS is used. Finally, all this information was integrated in an unsupervised cartographic scheme that recognizes different responses of crops yield and NDVI to ENSO in the RS territory. Multiple regression models for corn and soybean yield prediction were developed from NDVI and ENSO indicators for each one of the identified productive sectors. Crops yield can be estimated before harvest with good accuracy, making use of the maximum NDVI value and SOI, both before (SOIA-S) and during the growing season (SOIA-S-O-N-D). As NDVI data capture the ENSO influence on agriculture as well as over crop productivity, its incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms the basis of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region.},

Abstract = {Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health care professionals on lifestyle changes to prevent and control hypertension in otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women). Options: For people at risk for hypertension, there are a number of lifestyle options that may avert the condition-maintaining a healthy body weight, moderating consumption of alcohol, exercising, reducing sodium intake, altering intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium, and reducing stress. Following these options will maintain or reduce the risk of hypertension. For people who already have hypertension, the options for controlling the condition are lifestyle modification, antihypertensive medications or a combination of these options; with no treatment, these people remain at risk for the complications of hypertension. Outcomes: The health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure and in morbidity and mortality rates. Because of insufficient evidence, no economic outcomes were considered. Evidence: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period January 1966 to September 1996 for each of the interventions studied. Reference lists were scanned, experts were polled, and the personal files of the authors were used to identify other studies. All relevant articles were reviewed, classified according to study design and graded according to level of evidence. Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular morbidity and premature death caused by untreated hypertension. Benefits, harms and costs: Lifestyle modification by means of weight loss (or maintenance of healthy body weight), regular exercise and low alcohol consumption will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately selected normotensive and hypertensive people. Sodium restriction and stress management will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately selected hypertensive patients. The side effects of these therapies are few, and the indirect benefits are well known. There are certainly costs associated with lifestyle modification, but they were not measured in the studies reviewed. Supplementing the diet with potassium, calcium and magnesium has not been associated with a clinically important reduction in blood pressure in people consuming a healthy diet. Recommendations: (1) It is recommended that health care professionals determine the body mass index (weight in kilograms/{[}height in metres](2)) and alcohol consumption of all adult patients and assess sodium consumption and stress levels in all hypertensive patients. (2)To reduce blood pressure in the population at large, it is recommended that Canadians attain and maintain a healthy body mass index. For those who choose to drink, alcohol intake should be limited to 2 or fewer standard drinks per day (maximum of 14/week for men and 9/week for women). Adults should exercise regularly (3) To reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients, individualized therapy is recommended. This therapy should emphasize weight loss for overweight patients, abstinence from or moderation in alcohol intake, regular exercise, restriction of sodium intake and, in appropriate circumstances, individualized cognitive behaviour modification to reduce the negative effects of stress. Validation: The recommendations were reviewed by all of the sponsoring organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of the fourth International Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They are similar to those of the World Hypertension League and the Joint National Committee, with the exception of the recommendations on stress management, which are based on new information. They have not been clinically tested. Sponsors: The Canadian Hypertension Society, the Canadian Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control at Health Canada, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.},

Title = {A Method for Ground Filtering of Laser Point Cloud and Extraction of Tunnel Wall and Target Sphere},

Abstract = {Objective The quality of tunnel engineering is crucial factor for ensuring traffic operation safety. In this regard, tunnel construction analysis, tunnel deformation monitoring, and tunnel disaster prediction and early warning can be realized by using three-dimensional laser scanner to scan the tunnel regularly or irregularly to generate a point cloud model and then analyze the point cloud data. The segmentation of tunnel wall and target sphere from scanned tunnel laser point cloud scenes is an important part of tunnel 3D reconstruction and is the key technology for realizing the automatic monitoring of tunnel scenes. However, the tunnel 3D point cloud obtained by laser scanning often contains noise points and outliers, a high proportion of which is attributable to the ground points, which are connected with the tunnel wall, in the tunnel point cloud scenes. Direct processing of the tunnel point cloud data affects the extraction and recognition of the target sphere and tunnel wall. Considering the challenge of tunnel ground filtering and the lack of application platforms directly usable to segment the tunnel wall and extract the point cloud of the tunnel target ball, a ground filtering algorithm suitable for tunnel scenes and extraction method of the tunnel wall and target ball are proposed herein. Methods Given that extant point cloud filtering algorithms are not suitable for tunnel point cloud scenes, this paper proposes a ground filtering algorithm based on a combination of RANSAC plane fitting and pass -through filtering based on normal evaluation. A normal estimation process is added to the plane based on RANSAC fitting to ensure that the fitting optimal plane model is on the tunnel ground level. Then, the points below the optimal plane level are filtered out in conjunction with the pass -through filtering to obtain the tunnel ground points. Considering that it is challenging to extract the tunnel wall and target sphere, a segmentation method for laser point cloud on the tunnel wall (from coarse to fine) and a target sphere extraction method are proposed herein. First, the region of interest is extracted from the tunnel feature points, and the noise point clusters of the non -tunnel wall are then filtered out based on the DBSCAN method under constraints so as to obtain the tunnel wall model and possible distribution area of the target ball. The DBSCAN fine segmentation of the possible distribution area of the target ball under constraints is performed to obtain the target ball point clusters, and the nonlinear least squares (NLS) fitting is employed to obtain the ball center coordinates and related parameters of the target ball.Results and Discussions This paper also presents the verification of the effectiveness of the proposed ground filtering algorithm and target ball and tunnel wall extraction method in two tunnel scenes. Table 3 indicates that the proposed ground filtering method is superior to the conventional CSF filtering, slope filtering, and ground filtering methods in terms of the regional growth and elevation change for three types of errors, Kappa coefficient values, and time efficiency values. Thus, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed filtering algorithm in tunnel scenes are demonstrated. Table 3 and Fig. 7 (b) show that the Kappa coefficient value of the proposed filtering algorithm is the highest, indicating its high robustness. As indicated by the results of the fusion comparison experiment, as compared to the RANSAC plane fitting, the fusion of normal estimation, pass-through filtering, and downsampling has a better effect on the ground filtering, and the comprehensive filtering effect is stronger than that of the comparison methods. This paper presents a comparison of the target sphere cluster (DBRTS) obtained by the DBSCAN condition constraint method and the manually intercepted target sphere cluster (Manual) by using ball fitting experiments. The final ball center error and fitting rate verify the effectiveness of the method of obtaining the target sphere and fitting method proposed herein. It is evident from the comparison in Table 4 that among the three target balls, the fitting effect of the proposed method is not as good as that of the NLS fitting. This is because the manually intercepted target ball point cloud retains more target points, and the more the details, the better the fitting effect. However, the proposed method can be employed to automatically obtain the target ball point cloud; this is more applicable and robust than the method of manually intercepting the target ball. Moreover, the spherical center error of DBRTS on the second and third fitting target balls is smaller than that of the NLS fitting method of manually intercepting the target ball; this indicates that the spherical center coordinates of the target ball fitted by this method are closer to the true values. In general, the target sphere point cloud obtained with our method and sphere fitting method proposed in this paper have evident advantages and are applicable in tunnel point cloud scenes.Conclusions Considering the 3D point cloud data of tunnel scenes as the research object, this paper first proposes a ground filtering algorithm that entails a combination of the RANSAC plane fitting method based on normal evaluation and pass-through filtering. This method dynamically adjusts the threshold according to the point cloud scene and realizes adaptive filtering, which has good applicability and robustness. Second, a target sphere and tunnel wall extraction scheme based on DBSCAN constraint conditions and NLS sphere fitting is also proposed. The clustering segmentation is mainly realized using the density property of point cloud. The tunnel wall and target sphere point clusters are extracted by filtering the noise point clusters in the tunnel by standardizing the constraint conditions, and the relevant parameters and distribution are then obtained by fitting the target sphere point clusters based on the NLS sphere. The target sphere point cloud obtained by this method is compared with the manually intercepted target sphere point cloud. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of this method and also highlight the advantages of the NLS sphere fitting, which completed the target sphere extraction task in tunnel scenes. Although the proposed algorithm achieves good results, a few deficiencies still exist. For example, regarding large-scale laser point cloud scenes, adoption of DBSCAN clustering segmentation is time-consuming, and some methods to improve the efficiency of clustering optimization algorithm can be studied in the future.},

Title = {Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Denoising Algorithm Based on Deep Learning},
Journal = {ACTA OPTICA SINICA},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Objective Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) is a kind of sensor to capture microwaves. Its principle is to establish images through the reflection of waveforms, so as to solve the problem that traditional optical remote sensing radars are affected by weather, air impurities, and other environmental factors when collecting images. The most widely used SAR is change detection (CD). CD refers to the dynamic acquisition of image information from a certain target, which includes three steps: image preprocessing, generation of difference maps, and analysis and calculation of difference maps. It is applied to the estimation of natural disasters, management and allocation of resources, and measurement of land topographic characteristics. However, in the process of CD, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images will reduce the performance of CD. Therefore, the image denoising method has become a basic method of preprocessing in CD. How to restore a clean image from a noisy SAR image is an urgent problem to be solved. Methods Traditional denoising algorithms of SAR images generally use the global denoising idea whose principle is to use the global similar information in images to perform processing and judgment. In the case of the high resolution of images, these algorithms need a series of preprocessing such as smoothing and then complete pixel distinction through the neighborhood processing of each image block. The algorithms usually occupy huge computing resources and have certain spatial and temporal limitations in practical applications. In addition, they cannot efficiently complete the denoising task. In terms of deep learning, some algorithms perform well, but there is still room for improvement in network convergence speed, model redundancy, and accuracy. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a denoising algorithm based on a multi-scale attention cascade convolutional neural network (MALNet). The network mainly uses the idea of multi- scale irregular convolution kernel and attention. Compared with a single convolution kernel, a multi-scale irregular convolution kernel has an excellent image receptive field. In other words, it can collect image information from different scales to extract more detailed image features. Subsequently, the convolution kernels of different scales are concat layers in the network, and an attention mechanism is introduced into a concat feature map to divide the attention of the features so that the whole model has a positive enhancement ability for the main features of the image. In the middle of the network, the dense cascade layer is used to further strengthen the features. Finally, the image restoration and reconstruction are realized by network subtraction. Results and Discussions In this paper, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed MALNet model in denoising. The WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR- CNN algorithms are compared with our proposed method. The clear state and complete signs of the denoised images are visually observed. In order to make a fair comparison, we use the default settings of the three algorithms provided by the authors in the literatures. Peak signal-to- noise ratio ( PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and image entropy are used as objective evaluation indexes. The PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy are calculated as error metrics. Three denoising algorithms are compared, and airpoirt, mountain, and coast are selected as verification images. The denoising effects of airport images (Fig. 7), coast images (Fig. 8), and mountain images (Fig. 9) are analyzed. It shows the visual effect comparison of denoising results of different algorithms. In Figs. 7-9, 6 figures are successively noise- free image, noise image, denoised image obtained by WNNM, denoised image obtained by SAR-BM3D, denoised image obtained by SAR-CNN and denoised image obtained by MALNet. It is obvious that the WNNM denoised image has many defects that are not removed completely, and the texture loss is quite serious. SAR-BM3D denoised image retains some details, but the aircraft fuselage is very vague, and the tail part has gotten most of the edge information erased. Although the aircraft wing in the SAR- CNN denoised image is recovered, the whole aircraft at the bottom is still far from the reference image, and the recovered small objects are blurred. It can be seen from Table 3 that the average PSNR value of the proposed MALNet is about 9. 25 dB higher than that of SAR-BM3D, about 0. 75 dB higher than that of SAR-CNN, and about 14. 45 dB higher than that of WNNM. Moreover, in terms of the noise level, MALNet is 0. 01 dB less than that SAR-CNN. The PSNR value of the proposed MALNet model at each noise level is higher than that of other algorithms. Especially, when the noise parameter is 20, the proposed method is 2. 56 dB higher than that of the SAR- CNN algorithm. In terms of structural similarity (Table 4), it can be seen that the SSIM of MALNet is mostly the highest among all methods. Only when the noise parameter is 50, it is slightly lower than that of SAR- CNN, but the average SSIM is still the highest. The average information entropy of the denoised images by the four algorithms is 7. 113492 bit/pixel for WNNM, 6. 842258 bit/pixel for SAR- BM3D, 7. 499375 bit/ pixel for SAR-CNN, and 6. 6917 bit/pixel for MALNet. The proposed algorithm outperforms WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-CNN by 0. 42179 bit/ pixel, 0. 15056 bit/pixel, and 0. 80768 bit/pixel, respectively. Therefore, in terms of the three objective evaluation indexes of PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy, the proposed network in this paper has better denoising performance than other comparison methods. Conclusions In this paper, a new denoising model MALNet is proposed for solving the noise in SAR images. This model uses an end-to-end architecture and does not require separate subnets or manual intervention. The solution includes three modules, i. e., multi-scale irregular convolution module, feature extraction module based on attention mechanism, and feature enhancement module based on dense cascade network. The model also adds batch normalization and global average pooling to improve its adaptability. It can complete convergence without massive data sets. The image data can complete convergence after 150 rounds of training. The training efficiency is outstanding, and the portability is positive. The experimental results show that compared with those of other traditional image denoising algorithms, the PSNR and SSIM of the proposed algorithm are improved by 0. 75 dB-14. 45 dB and 0. 01-0. 16, respectively. The proposed algorithm is superior to other algorithms in image entropy and can better recover the details of images.},

Title = {Spring Migration Ecology of the Mid-Continent Sandhill Crane Population with an Emphasis on Use of the Central Platte River Valley, Nebraska},

Abstract = {We conducted a 10-year study (1998-2007) of the Mid-Continent Population (MCP) of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) to identify spring-migration corridors, locations of major stopovers, and migration chronology by crane breeding affiliation (western Alaska-Siberia {[}WA-S], northern Canada-Nunavut {[}NC-N], west-central Canada-Alaska {[}WC-A], and east-central Canada-Minnesota {[}EC-M]). In the Central Platte River Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska, we evaluated factors influencing staging chronology, food habits, fat storage, and habitat use of sandhill cranes. We compared our findings to results from the Platte River Ecology Study conducted during 1978-1980. We determined spring migration corridors used by the breeding affiliations (designated subpopulations for management purposes) by monitoring 169 cranes marked with platform transmitter terminals (PTTs). We also marked and monitored 456 cranes in the CPRV with very high frequency (VHF) transmitters to evaluate length and pattern of stay, habitat use, and movements. An estimated 42\% and 58\% of cranes staging in the CPRV were greater sandhill cranes (G. c. tabida) and lesser sandhill cranes (G. c. canadensis), and they stayed for an average of 20 and 25 days (2000-2007), respectively. Cranes from the WA-S, NC-N, WC-A, and EC-M affiliations spent an average of 72, 77, 52, and 53 days, respectively, in spring migration of which 28, 23, 24, and 18 days occurred in the CPRV. The majority of the WA-S subpopulation settled in the CPRV apparently because of inadequate habitat to support more birds upstream, although WA-S cranes accounted for >90\% of birds staging in the North Platte River Valley. Crane staging duration in the CPRV was negatively correlated with arrival dates; 92\% of cranes stayed >7 days. A program of annual mechanical removal of mature stands of woody growth and seedlings that began in the early 1980s primarily in the main channel of the Platte River has allowed distribution of crane roosts to remain relatively stable over the past 2 decades. Most cranes returned to nocturnal roost sites used in previous years. Corn residues dominated the diet of sandhill cranes in the CPRV, as in the 1970s, despite a marked decline in standing crop of corn residues. Only 14\% (10 of 74) of PTT-marked migrant cranes stayed at stopovers for >= 5 days before arriving in the CPRV, which limited the contribution of sites south of the CPRV for fat accumulation needed for migration and reproduction. Body masses of cranes (after adjusting for body size {[}an index of fat]) at arrival in the CPRV varied widely among years (1998-2006), indicating the importance of maintaining productive habitats on the wintering grounds to condition cranes for migration and reproduction. Average rates of fat gain by adult females while in the CPRV remained similar from 1978-1979 to 1998-1999 but declined among males. Distances cranes flew to feeding grounds in the CPRV increased as the percentage of cropland planted to soybeans increased and as density of cranes on nocturnal roosts increased. These results suggest that as habitats of limited or no value to cranes increase on the landscape, more flight time and higher maintenance costs may reduce fat storage. An estimated 40\% of diurnal use occurred north of Interstate 80 (I-80) where <= 5\% of lands dedicated to crane conservation are located. Seventy-four and 40\% of PTT-marked EC-M and WC-A cranes had spring migrations that included staging in eastern South Dakota for an average of 11 and 10 days, respectively. Cranes of the NC-N, WA-S, and WC-A subpopulations staged an average of 25, 17, and 12 days in central and western Saskatchewan/eastern Alberta. Females in these affiliations increased their fat reserves after leaving Nebraska by an estimated 450, 451, and 452 g, respectively, underscoring the key role of these staging areas in preparing the 3 subpopulations for reproduction. After departing Nebraska, MCP cranes roosted primarily in basin wetlands. Most of these wetlands are in private ownership and lack adequate protection, emphasizing the need for effective laws and policies to ensure their long-term protection. The continued success of the current management goal of maintaining the MCP at approximately its current size and providing diverse recreational opportunities over a wide area of midcontinent and western North America is predicated on the ability of MCP cranes to continue to store large fat reserves in the CPRV in advance of breeding. For the CPRV to remain a key fat storage site, active channel maintenance (e. g., clearing of woody vegetation) likely will need to continue, along with establishing minimum stream flows. These actions would help ensure nocturnal roosting habitat remains sufficiently dispersed to provide cranes with daily intake of high-energy food adequate for major fat storage and limit risk of high mortality from storms and disease.
