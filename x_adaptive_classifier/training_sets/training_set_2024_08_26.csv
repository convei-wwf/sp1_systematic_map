Where's Woolly? An Integrative Use Of Remote Sensing To Improve Predictions Of The Spatial Distribution Of An Invasive Forest Pest The Hemlock Woolly Adelgid,"Non-native pests and pathogens present serious challenges to the management of forested ecosystems around the world. Early detection of pest and pathogen invasions may allow timely control and prevention methods to be implemented. Species distribution models (SDMs) and remote sensing (RS) methods have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage. However, previous work integrating these two methods has rarely used RS metrics that have biological meaning. We use RS difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, locations using MaxEnt in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DWGNRA). Brightness, greenness, wetness, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for December 1982 and 2010. A difference for each index was created by subtracting the 1982 value from the 2010 value. We compared two models, one using difference indices and the other using 2010 indices along with other ancillary data layers, to determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance. Variables with low importance were removed from both models, leaving NDVI, Wetness, soil, and elevation in the two final models. The difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent, across a number of threshold values. Despite this small difference in accuracy, however, the infected area predicted by the difference model (5.1\% of total area) was approximately 1/2 of that predicted by the single year model (9.6\% of total area). These results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about 50\%, suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach. This method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Land Use Change And Environmental Sustainability: The Case Of Lagos Metropolis,"Land use is a most important factor in the distribution and functioning of ecosystems and benefits derived by man. The Malthusian geometric population growth and continuous demands for food, shelter, clothing, energy and even pleasure has led to depletion of natural resources. Land is limited in supply and its finite nature makes it a scarce resource that cannot meet its demand. The use of land is a reflection of our decisions, which will determine how sustainable our future will be. Detecting land use changes requires timely and accurate information which can be assured by using remotely sensed data and GIS. Analyzing the correlation between land use changes and their impacts is essential for spatial planning at various spatial levels (global, national, regional and local levels). A cursory look at the sporadic growth of the Lagos metropolis reveals an unquestionable exert of pressure on the existing rural land, agricultural and forests resources. This paper examines Spatio-temporal trends in land use and land cover changes in the Lagos Metropolitan region, especially the loss of forest resources and agricultural land to urban development. Landsat images were used to produce land use classification maps for a period spanning sixteen years (1990 and 2006). The study was limited to these two dates due to cost and difficulty of acquiring satellite imageries. The dynamics of land use change and its impact were discussed as major findings. The paper submits that effective spatial planning could minimize the impacts of land use changes that threaten biodiversity and ecosystems though timely and proper monitoring using remotesensing and GIS; it also recommends integrated spatial planning approach and deployment of environmental management plans.

"Characterizing Off-Highway Road Use With Remote-Sensing, Social Media And Crowd-Sourced Data: An Application To Grizzly Bear (Ursus Arctos) Habitat","Characterizing roads is important for conservation since the relationship between road use and ecological impact can vary across species. However, road use is challenging to monitor due to limited data and high spatial-temporal variability, especially for unpaved roads, which often coincide with critical habitats. In this study, we developed and evaluated two methods to characterize off-highway road use across a large management area of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) habitat using: (1) a 'network-based' approach to connect human activity hotspots identified from social media posts and remotely detected disturbances and (2) an 'image-based' approach, in which we modeled road surface conditions and travel speed from high spatial resolution satellite imagery trained with crowd-sourced smartphone data. To assess the differences between these approaches and their utility for characterizing roads in the context of habitat integrity, we evaluated how behavioural patterns of global positioning system (GPS)-collared grizzly bears were related to road use characterized by these methods compared to (a) assuming all roads have equal human activity and (b) using a 'reference' road classification from a government database. The network- and image-based methods showed similar patterns of road use and grizzly bear response compared to the reference, and all three revealed nocturnal behaviour near high-use roads and better predicted grizzly bear habitat selection compared to assuming all roads had equal human activity. The network- and image-based methods show promise as cost-effective approaches to characterize road use for conservation applications where data is not available.","{""Coops, Nicholas C."",""Goodbody, Tristan R.

The Value Of Site-Specific Information And The Environment: Technology Adoption And Pesticide Use Under Uncertainty,"Remote sensing technology offers an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of site-specific information about field characteristics such as pest populations. Coupled with variable rate application technologies, this added information has the potential to provide environmental benefits through reduced pesticide applications. However, producers face a complicated adoption decision because output prices and crop yields are uncertain. A model is developed to examine the potential value of remote sensing information to pesticide applications in an option-value framework under uncertainty. Simulations suggest that remote sensing information could decrease pesticide use, but uncertainty and irreversibility are likely to limit technological adoption by farmers. Potential cost-share subsidies are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Where Have All The People Gone? Enhancing Global Conservation Using Night Lights And Social Media,"Conservation prioritization at large scales is complex, combining biological, environmental, and social factors. While conservation scientists now more often aim to incorporate human-related factors, a critical yet unquantified challenge remains: to identify which areas people use for recreation outside urban centers. To address this gap in applied ecology and conservation, we developed a novel approach for quantifying human presence beyond populated areas by combining social media ""big data"" and remote sensing tools. We used data from the Flickr photo-sharing website as a surrogate for identifying spatial variation in visitation globally, and complemented this estimate with spatially explicit information on stable night lights between 2004 and 2012, used as a proxy for identifying urban and industrial centers. Natural and seminatural areas attracting visitors were defined as areas both highly photographed and non-lit. The number of Flickr photographers within protected areas was found to be a reliable surrogate for estimating visitor numbers as confirmed by local authority censuses (r = 0.8). Half of all visitors' photos taken in protected areas originated from under 1\% of all protected areas on Earth (250 of 27 000). The most photographed protected areas globally included Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks (USA), and the Lake and Peak Districts (UK). Factors explaining the spatial variation in protected areas Flickr photo coverage included their type (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites have higher visitation) and accessibility to roads and trails. Using this approach, we identified photography hotspots, which draw many visitors and are also unlit (i.e., are located outside urban centers), but currently remain largely unprotected, such as Brazil's Pantanal and Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni. The integrated big data approach developed here demonstrates the benefits of combining remote sensing sources and novel geo-tagged and crowd-sourced information from social media in future efforts to identify spatial conservation gaps and pressures in real time, and their spatial and temporal variation globally.","{""Crandall, David"",""Kark, Salit"",""Levin, Noam""}",levin_peopleenhancingglobalconservation_2015,FALSE,Combines Flickr photo frequency with VIIRS night lights to identify conservation priorities… but doesn't assess value,sample_1000,NA,NA
Portability Of Semantic And Spatial-Temporal Machine Learning Methods To Analyse Social Media For Near-Real-Time Disaster Monitoring,"Up-to-date information about an emergency is crucial for effective disaster management. However, severe restrictions impede the creation of spatiotemporal information by current remote sensing-based monitoring systems, especially at the beginning of a disaster. Multiple publications have shown promising results in complementing monitoring systems through spatiotemporal information extracted from social media data. However, various monitoring system criteria, such as near-real-time capabilities or applicability for different disaster types and use cases, have not yet been addressed. This paper presents an improved version of a recently proposed methodology to identify disaster-impacted areas (hot spots and cold spots) by combining semantic and geospatial machine learning methods. The process of identifying impacted areas is automated using semi-supervised topic models for various kinds of natural disasters. We validated the portability of our approach through experiments with multiple natural disasters and disaster types with differing characteristics, whereby one use case served to prove the near-real-time capability of our approach. We demonstrated the validity of the produced information by comparing the results with official authority datasets provided by the United States Geological Survey and the National Hurricane Centre. The validation shows that our approach produces reliable results that match the official authority datasets. Furthermore, the analysis result values are shown and compared to the outputs of the remote sensing-based Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The information derived from different sources can thus be considered to reliably detect disaster-impacted areas that were not detected by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, particularly in densely populated cities.","{""Havas, Clemens"",""Resch, Bernd""}",havas_portabilitysemanticspatialtemporal_2021,FALSE,"Very interesting, looking at tweet analysis as a way to understand natural disasters in near real time, compared to ""official"" products like USGS info.

"Assessing The Influence Of Land-Cover Change And Conflicting Land-Use Authorizations On Ecosystem Conversion On The Forest Frontier Of Madre De Dios, Peru","Despite the many benefits natural forests provide, they are being lost worldwide at unsustainable rates as development frontiers expand. One approach to improving the efficacy of natural forest conservation efforts is to refine local forest conservation policies based on insights from the place-based study of conservation policies and land-use and land-cover change (LULC) dynamics. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, this research explores the dynamics of LULC and conservation policies on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios, Peru. The main objectives of this research are to evaluate the efficacy of designated conservation lands in a rapidly expanding frontier landscape and to assess the effect on ecosystem conversion of granting conflicting land-use designations, such as mining concessions, inside conservation areas. Using statistical matching and a GIS-based analysis of LULC, this research shows that for the period 2006-2011, designated conservation lands on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios significantly reduced ecosystem losses compared to non-conservation lands, but the effect was highly variable across conservation designations. Also, when present, conflicting land-use authorizations inside conservation areas, specifically overlapping mining and agricultural titles, eliminated the policy additionality of designating lands for conservation. This finding demonstrates that authorizing conflicting land-use rights inside conservation areas should be avoided to ensure intended land conservation outcomes. This case study also provides examples of how local forest conservation policies can be improved through detailed and frequent analyses of LULC and conservation policies, particularly in dynamic frontier landscapes where LULC and socio-economic conditions are rapidly changing.

Environmental Indicators Combined With Risk Analysis To Evaluate Potential Wildfire Incidence On The Dadu Plateau In Taiwan,"Wildfire is a common disaster in the world, and it has a considerable impact on the safety of residents and ecological disturbance. Periodic wildfires are an urgent problem to be solved. This research uses big data from relevant departments to extract environmental indicators that affect wildfires, including satellite images, meteorological observations, and field surveys and establishes a risk model for the Spatio-temporal distribution of wildfires based on risk analysis. Previous studies using Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to assess fire severity and distinguish wildfire ruins did not deal with the impact of atmospheric humidity on dNBR values. In this study, an adjustable fire threshold was developed to enable dNBR to improve the accuracy of identifying wildfire locations. Regarding the temporal distribution of wildfire risks, environmental vulnerability cannot specifically reflect the frequency of actual wildfires. If the hazard degree is introduced to calculate the wildfire risk, the coefficient of determination can be increased from 0.49 to 0.79. The verification of the village boundary zone depicts that the risk analysis can effectively show the temporal and spatial distribution of wildfire hotspots. On this basis, a village-level wildfire disaster prevention strategy can be formulated.","{""Chen, Yung-Chau"",""Lin, Chao-Yuan"",""Shieh, Pei-Ying"",""Wang, Po-Cheng"",""Wu, Shao-Wei""}",lin_environmentalindicatorscombinedrisk_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Application Of High-Resolution Stereo Satellite Images To Detailed Landslide Hazard Assessment,"This study investigates and demonstrates the state of the art in remote sensing techniques for detailed landslide hazard assessment applicable to large areas. Since the most common methods of landslide hazard assessment using simple inventories and weighted overlays are heavily dependent on three-dimensional terrain visualization and analysis, stereo satellite images from the IKONOS Very High Resolution (VHR) sensor are used for this study. The DEMs created from IKONOS stereo images appear to be much more accurate and sensitive to micro-scale terrain features than a DEM created from digital contour data with a 2 m contour interval. Pan-sharpened stereo IKONOS images permit interpretation of recent landslides as small as 2-3 m in width as well as relict landslides older than 50 years. A cost-benefit analysis comparing stereo air photo interpretation with stereo satellite image interpretation suggests that stereo satellite imagery is usually more cost-effective for detailed landslide hazard assessment over large areas.

Global Multi-Scale Grid Integer Coding And Spatial Indexing: A Novel Approach For Big Earth Observation Data,"With the exponentially growing earth observation data of specific sensor-determined resolutions and update frequencies, earth observation has irreversibly arrived in the Big Data era, enabling new insights in science and engineering. With great opportunity comes great challenges regarding efficient and effective data management because earth observation data is of different scales and characterized by complexity in spatial relationships related to the real world. To overcome the challenges is crucial for, for instance, data mining, land surveying, and especially emergency mapping for disaster response. To improve the querying efficiency of big earth observation data, we proposed a novel data management approach: Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding and Spatial Indexing. Among our contributions are: (1) proposing Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding Model (GMGICM), which presents clustering property in both the scale dimension and spatial dimension, and theoretically facilitates an efficient querying; (2) deliberately applying GMGICM on multi-scale earth observation data spatial indexing, which results in one-dimensional data index, which can be queried using simple B-tree, inversion, and other one-dimensional indexes; (3) designing a strategy to assure the completeness of spatial querying, which is not well solved by existing grid-based coding models. The advantages of our proposed approach have been demonstrated with both simulated and real remote sensing data, with spatial operation 20 times as fast as Geohash and spatial querying 10 times as fast as Oracle Spatial on average. The proposed approach can be easily adapted for three or higher-dimensional earth observation data and bring potential benefit to all big earth observation data analytic projects.","{""Guo, Congzhou"",""Lai, Guangling"",""Lei, Yi"",""Li, He"",""Qiu, Chunping"",""Tong, Xiaochong"",""Wu, Xiangyu"",""Zhang, Yong"",""Zhang, Yongsheng""}",lei_globalmultiscalegrid_2020,FALSE,"assesses methods for working with big data, but does not assess societal benefits",sample_1000,NA,NA
"Analysis Of Suspended Particulate Matter And Its Drivers In Sahelian Ponds And Lakes By Remote Sensing (Landsat And Modis): Gourma Region, Mali","The Sahelian region is characterized by significant variations in precipitation, impacting water quantity and quality. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of 'values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27\% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.","{""Diawara, Mamadou"",""Grippa, Manuela"",""Kergoat, Laurent"",""Martinez, Jean-Michel"",""Merlet, Sebastien"",""Robert, Elodie"",""Soumaguel, Nogmana""}",robert_analysissuspendedparticulatematter_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Use And Benefits Of Nasa's Recover For Post-Fire Decision Support,"Today's extended fire seasons and large fire footprints have prompted state and federal land-management agencies to devote increasingly large portions of their budgets to wildfire management. As fire costs continue to rise, timely and comprehensive fire information becomes increasingly critical to response and rehabilitation efforts. The NASA Rehabilitation Capability Convergence for Ecosystem Recovery (RECOVER) post-fire decision support system is a server-based application designed to rapidly provide land managers with the information needed to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. This study evaluated the efficacy of RECOVER through structured interviews with land managers (n = 19) who used RECOVER and were responsible for post-fire rehabilitation efforts on over 715 000 ha of fire-affected lands. Although the benefit of better-informed decisions is difficult to quantify, the results of this study illustrate that RECOVER's decision support capabilities provided information to land managers that either validated or altered their decisions on post-fire treatments estimated at over US\$ 1.2 million and saved nearly 800 h of staff time by streamlining data collection as well as communication with local stakeholders and partnering agencies.","{""Lindquist, Eric"",""Lippitt, Frances"",""Schnase, John L."",""Stegner, Tesa"",""Toombs, William"",""Weber, Keith""}",toombs_benefitsnasa'srecoverpost_2018,TRUE,"""Although the benefit of better-informed decisions is difficult to quantify, the results of this study illustrate that RECOVER’s decision support capabilities provided information to land managers that either validated or altered their decisions on post-fire treatments estimated at over $1.2 million (USD) and saved nearly 800 hours of staff time by streamlining data collection as well as communication with local stakeholders and partnering agencies.""",sample_1000,NA,NA
Evaluation Of Earth Observation Systems For Estimating Environmental Determinants Of Microbial Contamination In Recreational Waters,"Public health risks related to the microbial contamination of recreational waters are increased by global environmental change. Intensification of agriculture, urban sprawl, and climate change are some of the changes which can lead to favorable conditions for the emergence of waterborne diseases. Earth observation (EO) images have several advantages for the characterization and monitoring of environmental determinants that could be associated with the risk of microbial contamination of recreational waters in vast territories like Canada. There are a large number of EO systems characterized by different spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolutions. Also, they have different levels of accessibility. In this study, we compared several EO systems for the estimation of environmental determinants to assess their usefulness and their added value in monitoring programs of recreational waters. Satellite images from EO systems WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, SPOT-5/HRG, Landsat-5/TM, Envisat/MERIS, Terra/MODIS, NOAA/AVHRR, and Radarsat-2 were acquired in 2010 and 2011 in southern Quebec, Canada. A supervised classification of these images with a maximum likelihood algorithm was used to estimate five key environmental determinants (agricultural land, impervious surfaces, water, forest, and wetlands) within the area of influence of 78 beaches. Logistic regression models were developed to establish the relationship between fecal contamination of beaches and environmental determinants derived from satellite images. The power prediction of these models and criteria such as accuracy of classified images, the ability of the sensor to detect environmental determinants in the area of influence of beaches, the correlation between the estimated environmental determinants in the area of influence by the sensor with those estimated by very high spatial resolution reference sensors (WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1), and general criteria of accessibility (cost of the images, imaging swath, satellite revisit interval, hours of work, and expertise and material required to process the images) were used to evaluate the EO systems. The logistic regression model establishing the relationship between environmental determinants from Landsat-5/TM images and the level of fecal contamination of beaches is the one which performs best. These images are also those that best meet all of the evaluation criteria. This study showed that environmental determinants like agricultural lands and impervious surfaces present in the area of influence of beaches are those which contribute the most to the microbial contamination of beaches. Our study demonstrated the utility and the added value that EO images could bring to programs monitoring the microbial contamination of recreational waters.

"Comparative Assessment Of Uav And Sentinel-2 Ndvi And Gndvi For Preliminary Diagnosis Of Habitat Conditions In Burunge Wildlife Management Area, Tanzania","Habitat condition is a vital ecological attribute in wildlife conservation and management in protected areas, including the Burunge wildlife management areas in Tanzania. Traditional techniques, including satellite remote sensing and ground-based techniques used to assess habitat condition, have limitations in terms of costs and low resolution of satellite platforms. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI (GNDVI) have potential for assessing habitat condition, e.g., forage quantity and quality, vegetation cover and degradation, soil erosion and salinization, fire, and pollution of vegetation cover. We, therefore, examined how the recently emerged Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform and the traditional Sentinel-2 differs in indications of habitat condition using NDVI and GNDVI. We assigned 13 survey plots to random locations in the major land cover types: three survey plots in grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands, and two in riverine and mosaics cover types. We used a UAV-mounted, multi-spectral sensor and obtained Sentinel-2 imagery between February and March 2020. We categorized NDVI and GNDVI values into habitat condition classes (very good, good, poor, and very poor). We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and linear regression model in R-software. The results revealed higher sensitivity and ability of UAV to provide the necessary preliminary diagnostic indications of habitat condition. The UAV-based NDVI and GNDVI maps showed more details of all classes of habitat conditions than the Sentinel-2 maps. The linear regressions results showed strong positive correlations between the two platforms (p < 0.001). The differences were attributed primarily to spatial resolution and minor atmospheric effects. We recommend further studies to test other vegetation indices.","{""Alward, Richard D."",""Bukombe, John K."",""Kija, Hamza K."",""Mangewa, Lazaro J."",""Munishi, Linus K."",""Nasolwa, Emmanuel R."",""Ndakidemi, Patrick A.""}",mangewa_comparativeassessmentuavsentinel_2022,FALSE,"""The detailed qualitative information observed in the UAV-based VI maps improve managers’ abilities to fulfill near real-time needs in ecological monitoring of wildlife habitats.""

Using Copernicus Sentinel-2 And Sentinel-3 Data To Monitor Harmful Algal Blooms In Southern Chile During The Covid-19 Lockdown,"During the southern summer of 2020, large phytoplankton blooms were detected using satellite technology in Chile (western Patagonia), where intensive salmonid aquaculture is carried out. Some harvesting sites recorded massive fish mortalities, which were associated with the presence of the dinoflagellate species Cochlodinium sp. The bloom included other phytoplankton species, as Lepidodinium chlorophorum, which persistently changed the colour of the ocean to green. These blooms coincided with the government-managed emergency lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Local in situ sampling was slowed down. However, imagery from the Copernicus programme allowed operational monitoring. This study shows the benefits of both Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 satellites in terms of their spectral, spatial and temporal capabilities for improved algal bloom monitoring.

Combined Use Of Local And Global Hydro Meteorological Data With Hydrological Models For Water Resources Management In The Magdalena-Cauca Macro Basin - Colombia,"Reanalysis and earth observation data have enormous potential to support water resources management, particularly in river basins where data availability is poor or where available stations are unequally distributed. Despite this potential, these datasets continue to be underused around the world. In this article, we combine a recently established global water resources reanalysis that was developed within the EartH2Observe research project, and in-situ data in the Magdalena Cauca Macrobasin in Colombia. Through rigorous hydrological modelling we evaluate the contribution of this new information to the derivation of water availability indices used to support water policy and management. Results confirm the complementarity of the reanalysis, with water management indices derived from the reanalysis data showing good comparison to values obtained using in-situ data only. Indeed, the estimation of simple indices such as an Aridity Index and a Water Regulation Index show to be a suitable method for assessing and comparing the different reanalysis datasets. We also explore the value of the reanalysis and earth observations datasets in the study of climate and land use change scenarios in the basin. While considering the associated uncertainties, results show that on average rainfall is projected to increase in the basin and thus available water resources. Deforestation will increase the water balance due to lower evapotranspiration. However, reduced fog deposition in deforested cloud forest areas will lead to a decrease in the water balance. The promising results of the comparison have bolstered the confidence of the national hydro-meteorological agency to include the evaluated reanalysis datasets in the national water resources evaluation, complementing available in-situ datasets.","{""Arboleda, Pedro"",""Burke, Sophia"",""Duque, Nicolas"",""Garcia, Camila"",""Kaune, Alexander"",""Lopez, Patricia"",""Rodriguez, Erasmo"",""Sanchez, Ines"",""Vega, Carolina"",""Werner, Micha"",""Zamora, David""}",rodriguez_combinedlocalglobalhydro_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Can Remote Sensing Fill The United States' Monitoring Gap For Watershed Management?,"Remote sensing has been heralded as the silver bullet in water quality modeling and watershed management, and yet a quantitative mapping of where its applicability is likely and most useful has not been undertaken so far. Here, we combine geospatial models of cloud cover as a proxy for the likelihood of acquiring remote scenes and the shortest time of travel to population centers as a proxy for accessibility to ground-truth remote sensing data for water quality monitoring and produce maps of the potential of remote sensing in watershed management in the United States. We generate several maps with different cost-payoff relationships to help stakeholders plan and incentivize remote sensing-based monitoring campaigns. Additionally, we combine these remote sensing potential maps with spatial indices of population, water demand, ecosystem services, pollution risk, and monitoring coverage deficits to identify where remote sensing likely has the greatest role to play. We find that the Southwestern United States and the Central plains regions are generally suitable for remote sensing for watershed management even under the most stringent costing projections, but that the potential for using remote sensing can extend further North and East as constraints are relaxed. We also find large areas in the Southern United States and sporadic watersheds in the Northeast and Northwest seaboards and the Midwest would likely benefit most from using remote sensing for watershed monitoring. Although developed herein for watershed decision support in the United States, our approach is readily generalizable to other environmental domains and across the world.","{""Kumar, Saurav"",""Kumar, Swetha Madhur"",""Sridharan, Vamsi Krishna""}",sridharan_remotesensingfillunited_2022,TRUE,"Looks at cloud cover, distance to population, and five metrics of risk where RS can play a role",sample_1000,NA,NA
Space Technology For Disaster Management : Data Access And Its Place In The Community,"The ways in which remotely sensed data can be used to manage and alleviate the consequences of natural disasters have never been fully exploited. If prediction of impending disaster is to be useful, those affected by catastrophe and those who come to their aid must work together. A global strategy based on a vision for disaster management will fail if those affected by hazards are not involved in their own disaster preparation, relief efforts and rehabilitation. Local people are experts in ground knowledge; all that is needed is for those with expertise in remote sensing to pass on their skills, knowledge and data in a way that can be understood and valued. To do this, those threatened by catastrophe must understand how disaster relates to their lives, how satellite data can be used with confidence to prepare for local hazards and how to apply information that can help lessen the effects of catastrophe. This can be achieved by making available remotely sensed images with simple explanations that enhance vegetation, topography and geology. With timely, reliable information, preventive measures can be taken; surface features identified on satellite images can guide refugee placement and hazards can be anticipated and contained.

Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland By Coupling Optical And Synthetic Aperture Radar Remote Sensing,"Plastic Mulching (PM) is criticized for causing environmental problems in spite of the benefits to increase crop yield. Accurate map of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) is demanded to monitor the usage of plastic mulches and to mitigate its environmental damages. However, mapping PMF with remote sensing data over large scale is still technically challenging due to its variable spectral characteristic. This paper proposed a Random Forest (RF) workflow to map PMF by coupling multi-resource satellite observations, including high- and medium- resolution optical imageries and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries. Under the context of two typical PMF regions, Jizhou and Guyuan, China, we test the performance of the proposed method. Results indicated that coupling optical and SAR remote sensing data improved the mapping accuracy significantly. There were different strategies for optimal data coupling. Coupling of three data, which are the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) data, Landsat-8 data and Radarsat-2 data, generated the highest mapping accuracy. Besides, coupling the GF-1 data with SAR data produced better accuracy than coupling the Landsat-8 data with SAR data. Compared with the accuracies derived from the coupling of two data (such as coupling GF-1 data with Radarsat-2 data and coupling Landsat-8 data with Radarsat-2 data), coupling the three data improved the overall accuracies by 0.39 to 4.93%. Compared with the mapping accuracy produced from Radarsat-2 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling increased by 20.96 and 26.06%, respectively, in Jizhou and Guyuan. When compared with the mapping accuracy of GF-1 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling improved by 4.77% both in Jizhou and Guyuan. In general, contribution of optical remote sensing data was greater than that of SAR data for mapping PMF. Whereas, the SAR data also made great contribution to improve the mapping accuracy of PMF.

Historical Eco-Environmental Quality Mapping In China With Multi-Source Data Fusion,"Since the initiation of economic reforms and opening up, China has witnessed an unprecedented rate of development across all sectors. However, the country has also experienced severe ecological damage, surpassing that of many other nations. The rapid economic growth has come at the expense of the environment, revealing a significant lack of coordination between urbanization and eco-environmental protection in China. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and continuous historical dataset of Chinaâ€™s eco-environmental quality (EEQ) based on remote sensing, allowing for the analysis of spatial and temporal changes. Such data would provide objective, scientific, and reliable support for Chinaâ€™s eco-environmental protection and pollution prevention policies, while addressing potential ecological risks resulting from urbanization. To achieve this, the entropy value method is employed to integrate multi-source remote sensing data and construct an evaluation system for Chinaâ€™s EEQ. Historical data from 2000 to 2017 is plotted to illustrate Chinaâ€™s EEQ over time. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) The entropy method effectively facilitates the construction of Chinaâ€™s eco-environmental quality assessment system. (2) From 2000 to 2017, approximately 39.7% of Chinaâ€™s regions witnessed a decrease in EEQ, while 60.3% exhibited improvement, indicating an overall enhancement in EEQ over the past eighteen years. (3) The Yangtze and Yellow River basins experienced improved EEQ due to Chinaâ€™s ecological restoration projects. (4) The future EEQ in China demonstrates a subtle positive trend across diverse contexts. This study departs from conventional approaches to EEQ evaluation by leveraging the advantages of multivariate remote sensing big data, including objectivity, timeliness, and accessibility. It provides a novel perspective for future eco-environmental quality evaluation.

The Role Of Remote Sensing Data And Methods In A Modern Approach To Fertilization In Precision Agriculture,"The precision fertilization system is the basis for upgrading conventional intensive agricultural production, while achieving both high and quality yields and minimizing the negative impacts on the environment. This research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning. While conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present. Their disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, lack of robustness regarding the properties of input soil sample values and requirements for extensive cost-and time-expensive soil sampling were addressed. Specific conventional (ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighted) and modern machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, decision trees) were evaluated according to their popularity in relevant studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection over the past decade. As a shift towards increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, an overview of state-of-the-art remote sensing methods for improving precise fertilization was completed, with the accent on open-data and global satellite missions. State-of-the-art remote sensing techniques allowed hybrid interpolation to predict the sampled data supported by remote sensing data such as high-resolution multispectral, thermal and radar satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imagery in the analyzed studies. The representative overview of conventional and modern approaches to precision fertilization was performed based on 121 samples with phosphorous pentoxide (P2 O5 ) and potassium oxide (K2 O) in a common agricultural parcel in Croatia. It visually and quantitatively confirmed the superior prediction accuracy and retained local heterogeneity of the modern approach. The research concludes that remote sensing data and methods have a significant role in improving fertilization in precision agriculture today and will be increasingly important in the future.

Deep Learning-Based Monitoring Sustainable Decision Support System For Energy Building To Smart Cities With Remote Sensing Techniques,"In modern society, energy conservation is an important consideration for sustainability. The availability of energy-efficient infrastructures and utilities depend on the sustainability of smart cities. The big streaming data generated and collected by smart building devices and systems contain useful information that needs to be used to make timely action and better decisions. The ultimate objective of these procedures is to enhance the cityâ€™s sustainability and livability. The replacement of decades-old infrastructures, such as underground wiring, steam pipes, transportation tunnels, and high-speed Internet installation, is already a major problem for major urban regions. There are still certain regions in big cities where broadband wireless service is not available. The decision support system is recently acquiring increasing attention in the smart city context. In this article, a deep learningâ€“based sustainable decision support system (DLSDSS) has been proposed for energy building in smart cities. This study proposes the integration of the Internet of Things into smart buildings for energy management, utilizing deep learning methods for sensor information decision making. Building a socially advanced environment aims to enhance city services and urban administration for residents in smart cities using remote sensing techniques.

From Forest Dynamics To Wetland Siltation In Mountainous Landscapes: A Rs-Based Framework For Enhancing Erosion Control,"Human activities have caused a significant change in the function and services that ecosystems have provided to society since historical times. In mountainous landscapes, the regulation of services such as water quality or erosion control has been impacted by land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially the loss and fragmentation of forest patches. In this work, we develop a Remote Sensing (RS)-based modelling approach to identify areas for the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) (i.e., natural forest conservation and restoration) that allow reducing the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to siltation in mountainous regions. We used time series Landsat 5TM, 7ETM+, 8OLI and Sentinel 2A/2B MSI (S2) imagery to map forest dynamics and wetland distribution in Picos de Europa National Park (Cantabrian Mountains, northern Spain). We fed RS-based models with detailed in situ information based on photo-interpretation and fieldwork completed from 2017 to 2021. We estimated a forest cover increase rate of 2 ha/year comparing current and past LULC maps against external validation data. We applied this forest gain to a scenario generator model to derive a 30-year future LULC map that defines the potential forest extent for the study area in 2049. We then modelled the distribution of wetlands to identify the areas with the greatest potential for moisture accumulation. We used an S2 mosaic and topography-derived data such as the slope and topographic wetness index (TWI), which indicate terrain water accumulation. Overall accuracy scores reached values of 86\% for LULC classification and 61\% for wetland mapping. At the same time, we obtained the potential erosion using the NetMap software to identify potential sediment production, transport and deposition areas. Finally, forest dynamics, wetland distribution and potential erosion were combined in a multi-criteria analysis aiming to reduce the amount of sediment reaching selected wetlands. We achieved this by identifying the most suitable locations for the conservation and restoration of natural forests on slopes and in riparian areas, which may reduce the risk of soil erosion and maximise sediment filtering, respectively. The results show a network pattern for forest management that would allow for controlling erosion effects across space and time at three levels: one, by reducing the load that originates upslope in the absence of forest cover; two, by intersecting runoff at watercourses related to sediment transport; and three, by a lack of former barriers, by trapping erosion near to the receiving wetland systems, main river axes and contributing streams. In conclusion, the proposed methodology, which could be transferred to other mountain regions, allows to optimise investment for erosion prevention and wetland conservation by using only very specific areas of the landscape for habitat management (e.g., for NBS implementation).","{""Alvarez-Martinez, Jose Manuel"",""Barquin, Jose"",""Hernandez-Romero, Gonzalo"",""Perez-Silos, Ignacio"",""Silio-Calzada, Ana"",""Vieites, David R.""}",hernandezromero_forestdynamicswetlandsiltation_2022,FALSE,"Satellite-based RO data to classify LULC, which enables identification of LULC dynamics and prioritization of nature-based solutions for conservation and resource management.

Mapping Floristic Gradients Of Forest Composition Using An Ordination-Regression Approach With Landsat Oli And Terrain Data In The Central Hardwoods Region,"Mapping forest properties with supervised remote sensing has historically and increasingly remained vital to research and management efforts, and the demand for such products will only increase as better tools and data increase the usability of such maps. Multispectral imagery by the Landsat program has been an invaluable resource for forest type characterization for several decades. As an alternative to traditional classification approaches dominating these efforts, we instead employed an ordination-regression approach to mapping forest composition as floristic gradients across a âˆ¼5000-km2 forestland in southeastern Ohio's Central Hardwoods. Plot data (n = 699 plots; 99 species/genera) from a comprehensive sample of both overstory and understory woody plants across structurally- (open to closed canopy) and topographically-variable forest conditions were projected onto a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination solution. Floristic gradients, via their ordination scores, were related to spectral reflectance provided by a multitemporal Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (OLI) image and various terrain variables using Random Forests models. Approximately 61%, 49%, and 25% of the floristic variation among the three axes of the NMDS ordination were related to the remotely-sensed variables during regression modeling. The axes were predicted onto three images and merged to a RGB color composite for the final floristic gradient map, displaying multivariate vegetation variation across the landscape in terms of variation in color. The color values, by referencing ordination space position within the original solution, provide a statistical approximation of the taxonomic composition of individual forest stands in relation to the plot data. We found this approach highly effective and an attractive alternative to traditional classifications. It is time-efficient, more realistic in that compositional turnover is expressed in continuous fields rather than arbitrary breaks, and less subjective, overcoming the generalization problem inherent in categorizing vegetation assemblages a priori. Moving forward, our model will be a valuable tool in developing suitable management options on individual forest stands for the restoration of desired species, adapting to a changing climate, and improving wildlife habitat in forestlands across the Central Hardwoods.

"Value Of Insar For Monitoring Land Subsidence To Support Water Management In The San Joaquin Valley, California","Land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction in California's San Joaquin Valley has been occurring for many decades. In situ monitoring of subsidence in this large geographic area has historically been limited. The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) sought the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's assistance for satellite- and aircraft-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) monitoring of subsidence during the 2012-2016 drought. InSAR was successful in cost-effectively providing first-ever synoptic measurement of land subsidence over the entire San Joaquin Valley. The purpose of the monitoring was screening or hotspot detection of impact areas affecting critical water infrastructure. Long-term cumulative land subsidence has substantially reduced the conveyance capacity of sections of major valley canals and the monitoring revealed that subsidence rates observed during the drought ranked with maximum historically observed rates, highlighting risks to water infrastructure. InSAR also identified new and rapidly emerging hotspots adjacent to critical water infrastructure. The success of the InSAR monitoring for drought response resulted in CDWR's decision to subsequently provide InSAR data as technical assistance to local agencies required to comply with recent state groundwater management legislation.","{""Bekaert, David P.

Global Flood Mapper: A Novel Google Earth Engine Application For Rapid Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Sar,"Timely and accurate information about the extent of floodwater is critical for emergency planning and disaster management efforts. Despite the advances in computational resources and in the field of remote sensing, there is a clear gap that restricts the disaster community from leveraging the technological resources in real time, which impedes on-ground response efforts. To bridge this gap, this paper makes two contributions. First, the paper presents a new web application, the Global Flood Mapper (GFM) that allows the user to generate flood maps quickly and without getting into technical intricacies. To derive the flood extent from Sentinel-1 satellite data, the pre-flood collection is considered as base and anomaly cells in the during-flood image(s) are identified using Z-Score values. Second, it advances an existing flood mapping method to (a) Map the peak of the floods by combining ascending and descending scenes when necessary, and (b) Check for false positives in hilly terrains by adding slope and elevation mask parameters. By comparing our results with Sentinel-2 MSI derived flood maps and field photographs, we show that the GFM can generate flood maps with precision. The GFM can be used to map and download the extent of multiple flood events of an area as vector data (.kml format), which can be a critical input for flood modeling and risk and impact assessments. The GFM shall enable first responders and practitioners across the globe to overcome technical barriers and lack of computational resources to map the extent of inundation during and after floods.","{""Malladi, Teja"",""Tripathy, Pratyush""}",tripathy_globalfloodmappergoogle_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Normalizing Land Surface Temperature For Environmental Parameters In Mountainous And Urban Areas Of A Cold Semi-Arid Climate,"Normalization of land surface temperature (LST) relative to environmental factors is of great importance in many scientific studies and applications. The purpose of this study was to develop physical models based on energy balance equations for normalization of satellite derived LST relative to environmental parameters. For this purpose, a set of remote sensing imagery, meteorological and climatic data recorded in synoptic stations, and soil temperatures measured by data loggers were used. For modeling and normalization of LST, a dual-source energy balance model (dual-EB), taking into account two fractions of vegetation and soil, and a triple-source energy balance model (triple-EB), taking into account three fractions of vegetation, soil and built-up land, were proposed with either regional or local optimization strategies. To evaluate and compare the accuracy of different modeling results, correlation coefficients and root mean square difference (RMSE) were computed between modeled LST and LST obtained from satellite imagery, as well as between modeled LST and soil temperature measured by data loggers. Further, the variance of normalized LST values was calculated and analyzed. The results suggested that the use of local optimization strategy increased the accuracy of the normalization of LST, compared to the regional optimization strategy. In addition, no matter the regional or local optimization strategy was employed, the triple-EB model out-performed consistently the dual-EB model for LST normalization. The results show the efficiency of the local triple-EB model to normalize LST relative to environmental parameters. The correlation coefficients were close to zero between all of the environmental parameters and the normalized LST. In other words, normalized LST was completely independent of the environmental parameters considered by this research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Wetland Landscape Spatio-Temporal Degradation Dynamics Using The New Google Earth Engine Cloud-Based Platform: Opportunities For Non-Specialists In Remote Sensing,"The complex nature of coupled human-natural systems often hinders the identification of forces and mechanisms causing observed environmental changes. The analysis of long-term time series can allow better understanding of those interactions and hence inform more adapted restoration and management programs. However, long-term time series of ground-measured vegetation variables are often not readily available due to the tediousness of the work and the financial and time investment required, especially for large-scale wetland systems. Remote sensing can help overcome this issue by providing more than 40 years of Earth cover images, but until recently the processing and analysis of these images was restricted to experts in remote sensing. The new Google Earth Engine (GEE) opens the remote sensing information mine to engineers or scientists without advanced knowledge in the field, including easy access to petabytes of publicly available remote sensing data and their spatial analysis in the cloud. To illustrate its capabilities, we used GEE to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the human-impacted Tempisque watershed with its severely degraded downstream Palo Verde wetland in northwest Costa Rica. We detail the processing and analysis steps to facilitate replication to any other case study. After defining the boundary of a study area, any user can generate a list and a video of the Landsat and MODIS images available for the area, NDVI maps, and a time series of the NDVI values spatially aggregated over the study area or a set of previously delineated polygons. One of the challenges we address is discriminating between the multitude of image collections available in the GEE catalog for vegetation mapping. We evaluate and compare the results obtained from five selected Landsat and MODIS image collections and identify the collections that give the best quality results for our case study. We conclude that MODIS is more appropriate for this tropical region because of the higher temporal resolution and hence higher probability to record cloud-free images. NDVI time series from Landsat images demonstrate a significant number of missing values. Landsat maps of NDVI suggest that the entire watershed and protected wetland witnessed an overall increase in vegetation greenness and hence cover since 1986, matching the abandonment of cattle ranching and the known degradation of the wetland by cattail invasion. Within-season vegetation variability can be tracked using MODIS images despite their coarser spatial resolution, showing high variability linked to precipitation patterns in this region. This GEE application illustrates new opportunities for biosystems engineers and other scientists to integrate historical vegetation and land cover data into comprehensive datasets to understand human impacts on ecosystems, and provides the guidance to do so.","{""Alonso, A."",""Kennedy, R.

"Active Fire Monitoring Of Thailand And Upper Asean By Earth Observation Data: Benefits, Lessons Learned, And What Still Needs To Be Known","This paper describes the history of active fire monitoring of Thailand and Upper ASEAN (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam) by Earth Observation Data, including benefits, lessons learned, and the unknowns. Satellite remote sensing offers a unique potential for mapping and monitoring fires at large spatial scales. Active fire information from satellites is one of the fundamental data in mitigating the smoke haze effect; therefore, active fire monitoring has become an essential tool for daily fires and smoke haze control, management, and mitigation in Thailand. The three critical sources of active fire hotspot information used in Thailand and elsewhere include (a) NASAâ€™s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS); (b) the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), Active Fire Alert System; and (c) the Colorado School of Mines VIIRS NightFire Alert System. On their own, satellite-derived active fire information is insufficient, but the combination of satellite-derived data and traditional fire monitoring from ground-based methods can work well. Adding advanced geostationary fire detection is needed as a next step to enable fire suppression teams to reach fires as quickly as possible, resulting in much more efficient and safer fire control.

Development Of A Hydrological Telemetry System In Bago River,"Hydrological monitoring is one of the key aspects in early warning systems that are vital to flood disaster management in flood-prone areas such as Bago River Basin in Myanmar. Thousands of people are affected due to the perennial flooding. Owing to the increasing pressure of rapid urbanization in the region and future climate change impacts, an early warning system in the basin is urgently required for disaster risk mitigation. This paper introduces the co-establishment of the telemetry system by a group of stakeholders. The co-establishment of the system through intensive consultations, proactive roles in responsibility sharing, and capacity building efforts, is essential in developing a base platform for flood forecasting and an early warning system in the basin. Herein, we identify the key challenges that have been central to the participatory approach in co-establishing the system. We also highlight opportunities as a result of the ongoing process and future impact on the disaster management system in the basin. We also highlight the potential for scientific contributions in understanding the local weather and hydrological characteristics through the establishment of the high-temporal resolution observation network. Using the observation at Zaung Tu Weir, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite estimates were assessed. Near real-time and standard versions of both satellite estimates show potential utility over the basin. Hourly aggregation shows slightly higher than 40% probability of detection (POD), on average, for both satellite estimates regardless of the production type. Thus, the hourly aggregation requires correction before usage. The results show useful skills at 60% POD for standard GSMaP (GSMAP-ST), 55% POD for near real-time GSMaP (GSMAP-NR), and 46% POD for GPM, at 3-hourly aggregations. Six-hourly aggregations show maximum benefit for providing useful skill and good correspondence to gauge the observation with GSMAP-ST showing the best true skill score (TSS) at 0.54 and an equitable threat score (ETS) at 0.37. While, both final run GPM and GSMAP-NR show lower POD, TSS, and ETS scores. Considering the latency of near real-time satellite estimates, the GSMAP-NR shows the best potential with a 4-hour latency period for monitoring and forecasting purposes in the basin. The result of the GSMAP-NR does not vary significantly from the GSMAP-ST and all GPM estimates. However, it requires some correction before its usage in any applications, for modeling and forecasting purposes. Â© 2018, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.","{""Acierto, R.

Management Recommendation Generation For Areas Under Forest Restoration Process Through Images Obtained By Uav And Lidar,"Evaluating and monitoring forest areas during a restoration process is indispensable to estimate the success or failure of management intervention and to correct the restoration trajectory through adaptive management. However, the field measurement of several indicators in large areas can be expensive and laborious, and establishing reference values for indicators is difficult. The use of supervised classification techniques of high resolution images, combined with an expert system to generate management recommendations, can be considered promising tools for monitoring and evaluating restoration areas. The objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration, which were monitored by two different remote sensors: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A. (recently acquired by Suzano S.A.), in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, near infrared) on UAV and LiDAR data compositions (intensity image, digital surface model, digital terrain model, normalized digital surface model). The monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes: Canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated. An expert system was developed in ArcGIS to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes, and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images. There was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers. The most frequent management recommendation was ""weed control + plant seedlings"" (34%) for all evaluated methods. The image monitoring methods suggested by this study proved to be efficient, mainly by reducing the time and cost necessary for field monitoring and increasing the accuracy of the generated management recommendations.

Diagnosing Irrigation Performance And Water Productivity Through Satellite Remote Sensing And Secondary Data In A Large Irrigation System Of Pakistan,"Irrigation policy makers and managers need information on the irrigation performance and productivity of water at various scales to devise appropriate water management strategies, in particular considering dwindling water availability, further threats from climate change, and continually rising population and food demand. In practice it is often difficult to access sufficient water supply and use data to determine crop water consumption and irrigation performance. Energy balance techniques using remote sensing data have been developed by various researchers over the last 20 years, and can be used as a tool to directly estimate actual evapotranspiration, i.e., water consumption. This study demonstrates how remote sensing-based estimates of water consumption and water stress combined with secondary agricultural production data can provide better estimates of irrigation performance, including water productivity, at a variety of scales than alternative options. A principle benefit of the described approach is that it allows identification of areas where agricultural performance is less than potential, thereby providing insights into where and how irrigation systems can be managed to improve overall performance and increase water productivity in a sustainable manner. To demonstrate the advantages, the approach was applied in Rechna Doab irrigation system of Pakistan's Punjab Province. Remote sensing-based indicators reflecting equity, adequacy, reliability and water productivity were estimated.

Open-Source Processing And Analysis Of Aerial Imagery Acquired With A Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial System To Support Invasive Plant Management,"Remote sensing by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is a dynamic evolving technology. UAS are particularly useful in environmental monitoring and management because they have the capability to provide data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, data acquisition costs are lower than those of conventional methods such as extensive ground sampling, manned airplanes, or satellites. Small fixed-wing UAS in particular offer further potential benefits as they extend the operational coverage of the area under study at lower operator risks and accelerate data deployment times. Taking these aspects into account, UAS might be an effective tool to support management of invasive plant based on early detection and regular monitoring. A straightforward UAS approach to map invasive plant species is presented in this study with the intention of providing ready-to-use field maps essential for action-oriented management. Our UAS utilizes low-cost sensors, free-of-charge software for mission planning and an affordable, commercial aerial platform to reduce operational costs, reducing expenses with personnel while increasing overall efficiency. We illustrate our approach using a real example of invasion by Acacia mangium in a Brazilian Savanna ecosystem. A. mangium was correctly identified with an overall accuracy of 82.7\% from the analysis of imagery. This approach provides land management authorities and practitioners with new prospects for environmental restoration in areas where invasive plant species are present.","{""Buttschardt, Tillmann K."",""Heringer, Gustavo"",""Lehmann, Jan R.

The Value Of Remotely Sensed Vs. Field-Surveyed Habitat Structure For Predicting Bird Abundance: A Case Study In Traditional Orchards,"Understanding environmental effects on the distribution and abundance of species is central to ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology. This led to the development of species distribution models (SDMs) that relate spatial variation in occurrence and abundance to environmental variables. So far, SDMs rarely considered habitat structure, as a major determinant of bird distributions. While remote sensing increasingly provides high-resolution measures of habitat structure, certain structural variables affecting bird abundance still need to be measured with field surveys. In this study, we compare the value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance. Specifically, we analysed abundance data for nine bird species of traditional orchards in South-Western Germany. 'Remote sensing SDMs' related abundance to structural variables obtained by aerial photogrammetry of individual orchard trees. Alternative 'field survey SDMs' related bird abundance to detailed field surveys of the species composition and pruning state of orchard trees. Additionally, both remote sensing and field survey SDMs included climate and land use variables. Accounting for detailed habitat structure improved abundance predictions for seven of nine study species compared to models only incorporating climate and land use. The impact on model performance differed between remotely sensed and field-surveyed variables: the former improved abundance models for most (n = 7) bird species, whereas the latter had more variable impact, decreasing model performance for five species. The remotely sensed variable with strongest effects was overall tree density, which positively affected abundance of seven species.

Spectral Matching Based On Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization: A New Method For Terrestrial Water Body Extraction Using Multi-Temporal Landsat 8 Images,"Terrestrial water, an important indicator of inland hydrological status, is sensitive to land use cover change, natural disaster and climate change. An accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface water distribution. In this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered. These parameters are sufficiently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for different conditions. By contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions. Eight test sites covering various water types in different climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficients (KC), commission error (CE) and omission error (OE). The results show that: (1) SMDPSO achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) SMDPSO has lower OE but higher CE than the supervised method, which means that SMDPSO is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) SMDPSO has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as DEM. In addition, a case of flooding in northeastern China is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of SMDPSO in water inundation mapping. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisfies the requirements of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management.","{""Jia, Kai"",""Jiang, Weiguo"",""Li, Jing"",""Tang, Zhenghong""}",jia_spectralmatchingbaseddiscrete_2018,FALSE,"Improved method for water detection, but not valued",sample_1000,NA,NA
Dynamic Partitioning Of Tropical Indian Ocean Surface Waters Using Ocean Colour Data - Management And Modelling Applications,"Over the past few decades, partitioning of the surface ocean into ecologically-meaningful spatial domains has been approached using a range of data types, with the aim of improving our understanding of open ocean processes, supporting marine management decisions and constraining coupled ocean-biogeochemical models. The simplest partitioning method, which could provide low-latency information for managers at low cost, remains a purely optical classification based on ocean colour remote sensing. The question is whether such a simple approach has value. Here, the efficacy of optical classifications in constraining physical variables that modulate the epipelagic environment is tested for the tropical Indian Ocean, with a focus on the Chagos marine protected area (MPA). Using remote sensing data, it was found that optical classes corresponded to distinctive ranges of wind speed, wind stress curl, sea surface temperature, sea surface slope, sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic currents (Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Tukey honestly significantly different tests, alpha = 0.01). Between-class differences were significant for a set of sub-domains that resolved zonal and meridional gradients across the MPA and Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge, whereas between-domain differences were only significant for the north-south gradient (PERMANOVA, alpha = 0.01). A preliminary test of between-class differences in surface CO2 concentrations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 demonstrated a small decrease in mean pCO(2) with increasing chlorophyll (chl), from 418 to 398 ppm. Simple optical class maps therefore provide an overview of growth conditions, the spatial distribution of resources - from which habitat fragmentation metrics can be calculated, and carbon sequestration potential. Within the 17 year study period, biotic variables were found to have decreased at up to 0.025\%a(-1) for all optical classes, which is slower than reported elsewhere (Mann-Kendall-Sen regression, alpha = 0.01). Within the MPA, positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions and negative Southern Oscillation Indices were weakly associated with decreasing chl, fluorescence line height (FLH), eddy kinetic energy, easterly wind stress and wind stress curl, and with increasing FLH/chl, sea surface temperature, SSH gradients and northerly wind stress, consistent with reduced surface mixing and increased stratification. The optical partitioning scheme described here can be applied in Google Earth Engine to support management decisions at daily or monthly scales, and potential applications are discussed.","{""Schwarz, Jill N.""}",schwarz_dynamicpartitioningtropicalindian_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Assessing The Role Of Climate And Resource Management On Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem Changes In Arid Environments With The Landsat Archive,"Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary relationship studies. This work is supporting land and water managers for evaluation of GDEs with respect to climate, groundwater, and resource management. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Revisiting The Environmental Kuznets Curve For City-Level Co2 Emissions: Based On Corrected Npp-Viirs Nighttime Light Data In China,"With the increasing trend of global warming, the Chinese government faces tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R-2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers. This study could be considered the first to simulate CO2 emissions at the provincial and city levels in China based on a NPP-VIIRS nighttime light model to explore the associated geographical distribution characteristics and potential influencing factors.

Assessment Of The Utility Of Remote Sensing Techniques For Monitoring Compliance With Direct Payment Programs,"The public-interest direct payment program involves providing direct payments to agricultural producers and rural residents through public funds, premised on performing public functions such as environmental conservation, stable food supply, and maintaining rural communities via agricultural activities. Scientific estimation of crop cultivation areas and production levels is crucial for formulating agricultural policies linked to regulating food supply, which increasingly impacts the national economy. Conducting comprehensive on-site inspections for compliance monitoring of direct payment programs has shown very low efficiency in relation to budget and time. The expansion of areas subject to compliance monitoring and various challenges in on-site inspections necessitate streamlining current monitoring methods and devising effective strategies. As a solution, the application of Remote Sensing technology and spatial information utilization, allowing swift acquisition of necessary information for policies without overall on-site visits, is being discussed as an efficient compliance monitoring method. Therefore, this study evaluated the potential use of remote sensing for improving operational efficiency in monitoring compliance with public-interest direct payment programs. Using satellite images during farming seasons in Gimje and Hapcheon, vegetation indices and spatial variations were utilized to identify cultivated areas, presence of mixed crops, validated against on-site inspection data.

Incorporating Water Quantity And Quality Modelling Into Forest Management,"Under the authority of the Millar Western Forest Products Ltd. (MWFP) Forest Management Agreement, the company has the right to harvest trees, grow trees, manage the forest and plan activities that assure forest productivity and industry profitability without jeopardizing the quality of the environment. Thus, as part of obtaining provincial government approval, the company has to submit a Detailed Forest Management Plan that includes a comprehensive assessment of the environmental implications of forestry operations and the mitigation of impacts. Forest management planning for environmental sustainability will become more and more difficult with increased land use pressures from other industries, agriculture and recreation. Therefore, the planning process will require increasingly more sophisticated modelling tools to identify and avoid significant impacts. The Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project proposes a hybrid modelling tool that relies on inexpensive remote sensing data, with few ground truthing requirements, to model streamflow, suspended solids and nutrients in streams on the Boreal Plain. Incorporating modelling tools into the MWFP planning process provides MWFP additional strategies to operate in an environmentally sensitive manner. Thus, the company can maintain an allowable cut, while ensuring that ecological and physical values are considered.","{""Li, Xiangfei"",""Nour, Mohamed H."",""Prepas, Ellie E."",""Putz, Gordon"",""Smith, Daniel W."",""Watson, Brett M.""}",li_incorporatingwaterquantityquality_2008,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Combining Passive Acoustics And Environmental Data For Scaling Up Ecosystem Monitoring: A Test On Coral Reef Fishes,"Ecological surveys of coral reefs mostly rely on visual data collected by human observers. Although new monitoring tools are emerging, their specific advantages should be identified to optimise their simultaneous use. Based on the goodness-of-fit of linear models, we compared the potential of passive acoustics and environmental data for predicting the structure of coral reef fish assemblages in different environmental and biogeographic settings. Both data types complemented each other. Globally, the acoustic data showed relatively low added value in predicting fish assemblage structures. The predictions were best for the distribution of fish abundance among functional entities (i.e., proxies for fish functional groups, grouping species that share similar eco-morphological traits), for the simplest functional entities (i.e., combining two eco-morphological traits), and when considering diet and the level in the water column of the species. Our study demonstrates that Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) improves fish assemblage assessment when used in tandem with environmental data compared to using environmental data alone. Such combinations can help with responding to the current conservation challenge by improving our surveying capacities at increased spatial and temporal scales, facilitating the identification and monitoring of priority management areas.","{""Bruggemann, J.

The Emerging Role Of Satellite Rainfall Data In Improving The Hydro-Political Situation Of Flood Monitoring In The Under-Developed Regions Of The World,"The systematic decline of in situ networks for hydrologic measurements has been recognized as a crucial limitation to advancing hydrologic monitoring in medium to large basins, especially those that are already sparsely instrumented. As a collective response, sections of the hydrologic community have recently forged partnerships for the development of space-borne missions for cost-effective, yet global, hydrologic measurements by building upon the technological advancements since the last two decades. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art on flood monitoring in medium and large ungauged basins where satellite remote sensing can facilitate development of a cost-effective mechanism. We present our review in the context of the current hydro-political situation of flood monitoring in flood-prone developing nations situated in international river basins (IRBs). Given the large number of such basins and the difficulty in acquisition of multi-faceted geophysical data, we argue that the conventional data-intensive implementation of physically based hydrologic models that are complex and distributed is time-consuming for global assessment of the utility of proposed global satellite hydrologic missions. A more parsimonious approach is justified at the tolerable expense of accuracy before such missions begin operation. Such a parsimonious approach can subsequently motivate the identified international basins to invest greater effort in conventional and detailed hydrologic studies to design a prototype flood forecasting system in an effort to overcome the hydro-political hurdles to flood monitoring. Through a modeling exercise involving an open-book watershed concept, we demonstrate the value of a parsimonious approach in understanding the utility of NASA-derived satellite rainfall products. It is critical now that real-world operational flood forecasting agencies in the under-developed world come forward to collaborate with the research community in order to leverage satellite rainfall data for greater societal benefit for inhabitants in IRBs.","{""Hong, Yang"",""Hossain, Faisal"",""Katiyar, Nitin"",""Wolf, Aaron""}",hossain_emergingrolesatelliterainfall_2007,FALSE,"Focuses on a model for watersheds, the ""open book"" watershed idealization, rather than the EO data that might go into the model",sample_1000,NA,NA
Competition And Burn Severity Determine Post-Fire Sapling Recovery In A Nationally Protected Boreal Forest Of China: An Analysis From Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery,"Anticipating how boreal forest landscapes will change in response to changing fire regime requires disentangling the effects of various spatial controls on the recovery process of tree saplings. Spatially explicit monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery through moderate resolution Landsat imagery is a popular technique but is filled with ambiguous information due to mixed pixel effects. On the other hand, very-high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery accurately measures crown size of tree saplings but has gained little attention and its utility for estimating leaf area index (LAI, m2/m2) and tree sapling abundance (TSA, seedlings/ha) in post-fire landscape remains untested. We compared the explanatory power of 30 m Landsat satellite imagery with 0.5-m WorldView-2 VHR imagery for LAI and TSA based on field sampling data, and subsequently mapped the distribution of LAI and TSA based on the most predictive relationships. A random forest (RF) model was applied to assess the relative importance and causal mechanisms of spatial controls on tree sapling recovery. The results showed that pixel percentage of canopy trees (PPCT) derived from VHR imagery outperform all Landsat-derived spectral indices for explaining variance of LAI (R2VHR = 0.676 vs. R2Landsat = 0.427) and TSA (R2VHR = 0.508 vs. R2Landsat = 0.499). The RF model explained an average of 55.5% (SD = 3.0%, MSE = 0.382, N = 50) of the variation of estimated LAI. Understory vegetation coverage (competition) and post-fire surviving mature trees (seed sources) were the most important spatial controls for LAI recovery, followed by burn severity (legacy effect), topographic factors (environmental filter) and nearest distance to unburned area (edge effect). These analyses allow us to conclude that in our study area, mitigating wildfire severity and size may increase forest resilience to wildfire damage. Given the easily-damaged seed banks and relatively short seed dispersal distance of coniferous trees, reasonable human help to natural recovery of coniferous forests is necessary for severe burns with a large patch size, particularly in certain areas. Our research shows the VHR WorldView-2 imagery better resolves key characteristics of forest landscapes like LAI and TSA than Landsat imagery, providing a valuable tool for land managers and researchers alike.

Demonstration Of A Modular Prototype End-To-End Simulator For Aquatic Remote Sensing Applications,"This study introduces a prototype end-to-end Simulator software tool for simulating two-dimensional satellite multispectral imagery for a variety of satellite instrument models in aquatic environments. Using case studies, the impact of variable sensor configurations on the performance of value-added products for challenging applications, such as coral reefs and cyanobacterial algal blooms, is assessed. This demonstrates how decisions regarding satellite sensor design, driven by cost constraints, directly influence the quality of value-added remote sensing products. Furthermore, the Simulator is used to identify situations where retrieval algorithms require further parameterization before application to unsimulated satellite data, where error sources cannot always be identified or isolated. The application of the Simulator can verify whether a given instrument design meets the performance requirements of end-users before build and launch, critically allowing for the justification of the cost and specifications for planned and future sensors.

National Forest Carbon Inventories: Policy Needs And Assessment Capacity,"Previous research has identified the importance of the role of land cover in the global carbon cycle. In particular, forests have been identified as a significant carbon sink that can mitigate the rate of global climate change. Policy makers are faced with complex and difficult challenges in getting timely and useful information in monitoring global forest resources. Recent advances in the tools and methods of forest carbon accounting have produced new, innovative approaches to forest-based carbon inventories. But it is important as new tools are developed that scientists understand the needs of policy makers and that policy makers understand the capabilities and limitations of forest inventory methods. This paper explores four different policy applications that rely, or could benefit from, national carbon inventories. The goal is to help build a bridge between the communities of climate policy makers and scientists specialized in forest carbon inventories. To this end, we pursue three specific objectives: First we provide an overview for policy makers about approaches to forest carbon inventories, paying particular attention to the contributions of remote sensing technologies. Second, we outline the issues particularly relevant to forest inventory scientists who are interested in responding to public policy needs. We then discuss the tradeoffs between information cost, accuracy, precision, transparency and timeliness that need to be balanced in long-term monitoring of forest carbon. Finally, the article concludes with a series of observations and recommendations for the implementation of forest carbon inventories as increasingly central components of global climate change policy.

Remote Sensing Of Soil And Water Quality In Agroecosystems,"Mismanagement of soil and water resources may not only contribute to an escalation of global poverty but also jeopardize ecosystem services, with significant costs to the environment. Although not concentrated within one geographic location (3,500 million hectares), an equivalent of approximately 24 % of the earth's land surface is degraded land, and about 2 billion people (one third of the global population) lack access to safe and affordable water for domestic purposes. It is therefore critical to develop strategies targeted at the root causes of these problems. However, to do so would require a rapid and reliable information system that has been elusive because of the complexity of the environment and the limitations of the existing tools. The increased availability and development of remote sensing and geographic data analysis tools have opened up new possibilities for exploring and monitoring environmental variables influencing key land use and soil management options.

Understanding The Spatio-Temporal Behaviour Of The Sunflower Crop For Subfield Areas Delineation Using Sentinel-2 Ndvi Time-Series Images In An Organic Farming System,"The study investigates the suitability of time series Sentinel-2 NDVI-derived maps for the subfield detection of a sunflower crop cultivated in an organic farming system. The aim was to understand the spatio-temporal behaviour of subfield areas identified by the K-means algorithm from NDVI maps obtained from satellite images and the ground yield data variability to increase the efficiency of delimiting management zones in an organic farming system. Experiments were conducted on a surface of 29 ha. NDVI time series derived from Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithm for rapidly delineating the sunflower subfield areas were used. The crop achene yields in the whole field ranged from 1.3 to 3.77 t ha-1 with a significant within-field spatial variability. The cluster analysis of hand-sampled data showed three subfields with achene yield mean values of 3.54 t ha-1 (cluster 1), 2.98 t ha-1 (cluster 2), and 2.07 t ha-1 (Cluster 3). In the cluster analysis of NDVI data, the k-means algorithm has early delineated the subfield crop spatial and temporal yield variability. The best period for identifying subfield areas starts from the inflorescences development stage to the development of the fruit stage. Analyzing the NDVI subfield areas and yield data, it was found that cluster 1 covers an area of 42.4\% of the total surface and 50\% of the total achene yield; cluster 2 covers 35\% of both surface and yield. Instead, the surface of cluster 3 covers 22.2\% of the total surface with 15\% of achene yield. K-means algorithm derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI images delineates the sunflower subfield areas. Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithms can improve an efficient assessment of subfield areas in sunflower crops. Identifying subfield areas can lead to site-specific long-term agronomic actions for improving the sustainable intensification of agriculture in the organic farming system.","{""Marino, Stefano""}",marino_understandingspatiotemporalbehaviour_2023,FALSE,Sentinel NDVI for monitoring crops,sample_1000,NA,NA
An Open Data And Citizen Science Approach To Building Resilience To Natural Hazards In A Data-Scarce Remote Mountainous Part Of Nepal,"The citizen science approach has gained momentum in recent years. It can enable both experts and citizen scientists to co-create new knowledge. Better understanding of local environmental, social, and geographical contexts can help in designing appropriate plans for sustainable development. However, a lack of geospatial data, especially in the context of developing countries, often precludes context-specific development planning. This study therefore tests an innovative approach of volunteer citizen science and an open mapping platform to build resilience to natural hazards in the remote mountainous parts of western Nepal. In this study, citizen scientists and mapping experts jointly mapped two districts of Nepal (Bajhang and Bajura) using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. Remote mapping based on satellite imagery, capacity building, and mobilization of citizen scientists was performed to collect the data. These data were then uploaded to OSM and later retrieved in ArcGIS to produce a usable map that could be exploited as a reference resource for evidence-based decision-making. The collected data are freely accessible to community members as well as government and humanitarian actors, and can be used for development planning and risk reduction. By piloting in two communities of western Nepal, we found that using open data platforms for collecting and analyzing location-based data has a mutual benefit for researchers and communities. Such data could be vital in understanding the local landscape, environmental risk, and distribution of resources. Furthermore, they enable both researchers and local people to transfer technical knowledge, collect location-specific data, and use them for better decision-making.","{""Baskota, Preshika"",""Buytaert, Wouter"",""Khadka, Prakash"",""Liu, Wei"",""Parajuli, Binod Prasad"",""Paul, Jonathan D."",""Pudasaini, Uttam"",""Roniksh, B.

Input Data Resolution Affects The Conservation Prioritization Outcome Of Spatially Sparse Biodiversity Features,"Detailed spatial data are an essential part of land use planning and decision-making. Their spatial resolution sets limitations to their use, as coarse datasets are not suitable for detecting small-scale phenomena. In this study, we explored the effects of spatial resolution on the ecological outcome of a conservation prioritization process in Zonation software. Our study area was in Evo, southern Finland, covering a mosaic of managed and conserved forests. We produced the feature layers describing the forest characteristics using high-resolution remote sensing datasets, object-based mapping methods, and forest site type data. We found that increasing the resolution above the 16 m baseline resolution resulted in substantial errors. The conservation errors were the highest for rare features related to European Aspen, whereas the common features related to dominant tree species could benefit from the growth of cell size. We conclude that adequate spatial resolution is a prerequisite for efficient conservation prioritization, and that the size and spatial distribution of the features affect the resolution requirements.","{""Heinaro, Einari"",""Kujala, Heini"",""Kumpula, Timo"",""Mayra, Janne"",""Mikkonen, Ninni"",""Tanhuanpaa, Topi""}",tanhuanpaa_inputdataresolutionaffects_2023,TRUE,"""Our focus was not on the accuracy of state-of-the-art object-based methods, but on the effect their output detail has on conservation outcomes.""",sample_1000,NA,NA
Is Acoustic Tracking Appropriate For Air-Breathing Marine Animals? Dugongs As A Case Study,"Marine animals face increased pressure through expanded shipping and recreational activities. Effective conservation and management of large species like marine mammals or sea turtles depend on knowledge of movement and habitat use. Previous studies have used data collected from either satellite or acoustic telemetry but rarely both. In this study, data from satellite and acoustic technologies were used to: determine the efficacy of satellite and acoustic telemetry to define dugong movement patterns; compare the benefits and limitations of each approach; examine the costs of each approach in relation to the amount and type of data provided; and relate telemetry data to the boundaries of a Go Slow area designed to protect dugongs and turtles from vessel strike within an urbanised coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). Twenty-one dugongs were captured in seagrass habitats on the Eastern Banks of Moreton Bay in July-September 2012 and July 2013 and fitted with GPS and acoustic transmitters. Both satellite and acoustic telemetry produced reliable presence and movement data for individual dugongs. When the dugongs were within the range of the acoustic array, there was relatively good correspondence between the overall space use measures derived from GPS and acoustic transmitters, demonstrating that acoustic tracking is a potentially valuable and cost-effective tool for monitoring local dugong habitat use in environments equipped with acoustic receiver arrays. Acoustic technology may be particularly useful for species that establish home ranges with stable residency especially near large urban or port environs.

Success Stories Of Satellite Radar Altimeter Applications,"For nearly three decades, satellite nadir altimeters have provided essential information to understand primarily ocean but also inland water dynamics. A variety of parameters can be inferred via altimeter measurements, including sea surface height, sea surface wind speeds, significant wave heights, and topography of land, sea ice, and ice sheets. Taking advantage of these parameters with the long record of altimeter data spanning multiple decades has allowed a diverse range of societal applications. As the constellation of altimeter satellites grows, the proven value of the missions to a diverse user community can now be demonstrated by highlighting a selection of verifiable success stories. In this paper, we review selected altimeter success stories that incorporate altimetry data, alone or in conjunction with numerical models or other Earth observations, to solve a key societal problem. First, we define the problem or the key challenge of each use case, and then we articulate the uptake of the successful altimeter-based solution. Our review revealed steady progress by scientific and stakeholder communities in bridging the gap between data availability and their actual uptake to address a variety of applications. Highlighting these altimeter-based success stories can serve to further promote the widespread adoption of future satellite missions such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission scheduled for launch in 2022. Knowledge of the breadth of current utility of altimeter observations can help the scientific community to demonstrate the value in continuing radar altimeter and similar missions, particularly those with expanded capabilities, such as SWOT.","{""Eldardiry, Hisham"",""Hossain, Faisal"",""Srinivasan, Margaret"",""Tsontos, Vardis""}",eldardiry_successstoriessatelliteradar_2022,FALSE,"Great examples of ""success stories""",sample_1000,NA,NA
Cost-Effective Disaster-Induced Land Cover Analysis: A Semi-Automatic Methodology Using Machine Learning And Satellite Imagery,"This study introduces a cost-effective and automated methodology to swiftly and accurately gauge disaster-induced land cover changes, harnessing satellite imagery and machine learning. Using open-source platforms like Google Earth Engine, the approach streamlines training sample generation and assesses diverse machine learning algorithms on pre- and post-disaster Landsat images. The innovation lies in its semi-automatic training sample generation methodology, reducing time and manual effort for accurate land cover mapping and addressing the challenge of crafting training samples in disaster settings. The methodology was tested on the 2010 Chilean earthquake and tsunami, revealing a 45% increase in sediment cover and a 15% reduction in water cover, underlining vast landscape alterations. SVM stood out for its consistent accuracy. To validate the methodological robustness and broaden its applicability, we replicated the procedures using diverse land cover collection, including ESA WorldCover 10 m and Dynamic World. This comprehensive validation encompassed varied catastrophic events, extending the methodologyâ€™s relevance beyond its original scope. The consistent findings across different scenarios underscored the methodâ€™s robustness and underscored its potential for broader utilization. This streamlined, cost-effective approach suits multiple land cover products, setting the stage for constant Earth feature monitoring. In light of escalating natural disasters, the synergy of machine learning and geospatial technology spotlighted here offers promising avenues for improved disaster preparedness and response.

Ecological Environment Dynamic Monitoring And Driving Force Analysis Of Karst World Heritage Sites Based On Remote-Sensing: A Case Study Of Shibing Karst,"The evaluation and monitoring of the ecological environment quality of heritage sites can help provide sustainable and healthy development strategies for heritage management organizations. In this study, an ecological evaluation model based on the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was used to measure the ecological environment of the Shibing Karst World Heritage Site and its buffer zone and the Moran index and geographic probe model were combined to quantify the ecological environment. The results show that, (1) from 2013 to 2020, the ecological environment quality of the heritage site and buffer zone was moderate to high and the mean RSEI values in the three periods studied were 0.720, 0.723 and 0.742, showing an overall upward and improving trend; (2) ecological environment quality grades of moderate and good accounted for more than 70\% of the area, the distribution pattern of ecological environment quality is significantly better at the heritage site than in the buffer zone and the southwest is better than the northeast; (3) the Moran index increased from 0.600 in 2013 to 0.661 in 2020, residing in the first and third quadrants, respectively, with significantly spatial aggregation; and (4) greenness and humidity were shown to play a positive feedback role on the ecological environment quality and the spatial influence ability of humidity and dryness was greater. Overall, the RSEI is an effective method of evaluating and monitoring the ecological environment quality of heritage sites, the ecological environment quality of the Karst heritage site in Shibing is in a steady state of improvement and the relevant departments of heritage conservation need to further coordinate the relationship between conservation and development to promote the sustainable development of the heritage site and provide effective solutions for the monitoring of other Karst World Heritage sites.","{""Shen, Chuhong"",""Xiao, Hua"",""Xiong, Kangning"",""Zhang, Juan"",""Zhang, Ning""}",zhang_ecologicalenvironmentdynamicmonitoring_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Role Of Satellite And Decentralized Strategies In Water Resources Management,"Existing and projected water shortages and related factors have helped focus attention on the need for water reuse. With recent technological advances in wastewater treatment, it is now possible to produce reclaimed water of any quality. Thus, the use of reclaimed water will depend on the reuse opportunities and the cost of the required infrastructure. Historically, centralized wastewater treatment facilities have served the needs of organized societies since the mid 1800s. However. as there are limited options for expansion of most existing centralized facilities, the use of satellite and decentralized wastewater management systems offers significant advantages including being close both to the source of wastewater generation and to potential water reuse applications. The comparative advantages of satellite and decentralized wastewater management systems for a number of water reuse applications are presented and discussed in this paper. Selected case Studies are presented to demonstrate the utility of satellite and decentralized wastewater management. Specific issues associated with the application of such systems in existing and in new developments are examined and discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Role Of Remote Sensing In The Development Of Smart Indicators For Ecosystem Services Assessment,"Human beings benefit from a wide range of goods and services from the natural environment that are collectively known as ecosystem services. However, rapid natural habitat loss, overexploitation and climate change is causing accelerating losses of populations and species, with largely unknown consequences on ecosystem functioning and the sustainable provision of ecosystem services. It is crucial, therefore, to develop a suite of indicators of the health and status of ecosystems, to monitor and quantify services delivery and to facilitate policy responses to stop and reverse negative trends. An effective framework to facilitate the development of suitable indicators is by using the SMART approach, which defines five criteria that could be applied to set monitoring and management goals, which are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-sensitive. Remote sensing provides a useful data source that can monitor ecosystems over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although the development and application of landscape indicators (vegetation indices, for example) derived from remote sensing data are comparatively advanced, it is acknowledged that a number of organisms and ecosystem processes are not detectable by remote sensing. This paper explores several approaches to overcome this limitation, by examining the strong affinity of species with dominant habitat structures and through the coupling of remote sensing and ecosystem process models using examples drawn from a number of important ecosystems.

Lake Nasser Evaporation Reduction Study,"This study aims to evaluate the reduction of evaporation of Lake Nasser's water caused by disconnecting (fully or partially) some of its secondary channels (khors). This evaluation integrates remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, aerodynamic principles, and Landsat7 ETM+ images. Three main procedures were carried out in this study; the first derived the surface temperature from Landsat thermal band; the second derived evaporation depth and approximate evaporation volume for the entire lake, and quantified evaporation loss to the secondary channels' level over one month (March) by applied aerodynamic principles on surface temperature of the raster data; the third procedure applied GIS suitability analysis to determine which of these secondary channels (khors) should be disconnected. The results showed evaporation depth ranging from 2.73 mm/day at the middle of the lake to 9.58 mm/day at the edge. The evaporated water-loss value throughout the entire lake was about 0.86 billion m(3) /month (March). The analysis suggests that it is possible to save an approximate total evaporation volume loss of 19.7 million m(3) / month (March), and thus 2.4 billion m(3) /year, by disconnecting two khors with approximate construction heights of 8 m and 15 m. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS are useful for applications in remote locations where field-based information is not readily available and thus recommended for decision makers remotely planning in water conservation and management.

Three Most Widely Used Gnss-Based Shoreline Monitoring Methods To Support Integrated Coastal Zone Management Policies,"Shoreline monitoring is essential for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). It provides the necessary information needed to manage the settlement of coastal areas, establishes guidelines for management of socioeconomic activities within the coastal areas, provides information necessary for recovery actions of beach regeneration, and provides a reference baseline for studies related to climate change in coastal zones. Shoreline monitoring methods are largely dependent on goals, costs, implementation, and applicability. For monitoring of short coastal shorelines (e.g., tens to hundreds of kilometers), global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based methods are emerging as low-cost approaches that offer rapid, weather-independent, and quickly updatable products that could benefit policy makers when high costs of traditional methods, such as photogrammetry and remote sensing, are of concern. However, various GNSS methods applicable to shoreline monitoring exist, making it difficult for decision makers to choose a suitable approach. Using a case study of the Pernambuco State ICZM in Brazil, this study evaluates three of the most commonly used GNSS-based shoreline monitoring methods, that is, relative kinematic (RK), real-time kinematic (RTK), and precise point positioning (PPP) methods. It also provides a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and limitations. The results highlight the issues and important considerations in choosing an economically viable GNSS method for mapping shoreline changes, particularly for supporting ICZM policies.","{""Awange, J.

Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys were carried out in conjunction with a light detection and ranging survey in 2007. These data were combined with various satellite remote-sensing data and field observations to produce a number of maps, including maps of landforms and surface materials. These latter maps were used to assess the value of the AEM data, identify potential surface and sub-surface flow pathways and map potential recharge on the Murray River floodplain surface.

Mapping Landscape-Scale Peatland Degradation Using Airborne Lidar And Multispectral Data,"Context: An increased interest in the restoration of peatlands for delivering multiple benefits requires a greater understanding of the extent and location of natural and artificial features that contribute to degradation. Objectives: We assessed the utility of multiple, fine-grained remote sensing datasets for mapping peatland features and associated degraded areas at a landscape-scale. Specifically, we developed an integrated approach to identify and quantify multiple types of peatland degradation including: anthropogenic drainage ditches and peat cuttings; erosional gullies and bare peat areas. Methods: Airborne LiDAR, CASI and aerial image datasets of the South West UK, were combined to identify features within Dartmoor National Park peatland area that contribute to degradation. These features were digitised and quantified using ArcGIS before appropriate buffers were applied to estimate the wider ecohydrologically affected area. Results: Using fine-scale, large-extent remotely sensed data, combined with aerial imagery enabled key features within the wider expanse of peatland to be successfully identified and mapped at a resolution appropriate to future targeted restoration. Combining multiple datasets increased our understanding of spatial distribution and connectivity within the landscape. An area of 29Â km2 or 9.2% of the Dartmoor peatland area was identified as significantly and directly ecohydrologically degraded. Conclusions: Using a combination of fine-grained remotely sensed datasets has advantages over traditional ground survey methods for identification and mapping of anthropogenic and natural erosion features at a landscape scale. The method is accurate, robust and cost-effective particularly given the remote locations and large extent of these landscapes, facilitating effective and targeted restoration planning, management and monitoring.

Atmospheric Remote Sensing Using Global Navigation Satellite Systems: From Formosat-3/Cosmic To Formosat-7/Cosmic-2,"The world's first Global Positioning System Radio Occultation (GPS-RO) constellation, the joint Taiwan-U.S. Formosa Satellite No. 3 - Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere & Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC) has demonstrated the value of GPS-RO data in terrestrial weather, space weather, and climate study. The RO measurement technique was dubbed as ""the most accurate and stable thermometer in space"" because of its high accuracy, high vertical resolution, and high stability, which does not require calibration. Since its launch in 2006, FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC has accumulated over 6.9 million atmospheric and 4.6 million ionospheric RO sounding profiles. Encouraged by the success of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC, Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the planning for the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 mission in 2008 as a follow-on program to FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC. The FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 satellite constellation, consisting of six small satellites, was successfully launched in June, 2019 as the world's first operational RO satellite constellation focusing over the tropics. After fourteen years in service, providing valuable data to operational and research communities, FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC was officially decommissioned ten months after FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 has been sent to space, and replaced by the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2. As expected, the first results from FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 showed positive impact on operational weather prediction and has observed interesting phenomenon in the ionosphere. In this paper, we will summarize the progress from FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 up to date. Â© 2021 Chinese Geoscience Union. All rights reserved.","{""Chen, S. Y."",""Chen, Y. H."",""Chu, C. H."",""Fong, C.

"Mapping Daily Evapotranspiration At Field Scale Using The Harmonized Landsat And Sentinel-2 Dataset, With Sharpened Viirs As A Sentinel-2 Thermal Proxy","Accurate and frequent monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) at sub-field scales can provide valuable information for agricultural water management, quantifying crop water use and stress toward the goal of increasing crop water use efficiency and production. Using land-surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, along with surface reflectance data describing albedo and vegetation cover fraction, surface energy balance models can generate ET maps down to a 30 m spatial resolution. However, the temporal sampling by such maps can be limited by the relatively infrequent revisit period of Landsat data (8 days for combined Landsats 7 and 8), especially in cloudy areas experiencing rapid changes in moisture status. The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, as a good complement to the Landsat system, provide surface reflectance data at 10-20 m spatial resolution and 5 day revisit period but do not have a thermal sensor. On the other hand, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) provides TIR data on a near-daily basis with 375 m resolution, which can be refined through thermal sharpening using S2 reflectances. This study assesses the utility of augmenting the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset with S2-sharpened VIIRS as a thermal proxy source on S2 overpass days, enabling 30 m ET mapping at a potential combined frequency of 2-3 days (including Landsat). The value added by including VIIRS-S2 is assessed both retrospectively and operationally in comparison with flux tower observations collected from several U.S. agricultural sites covering a range of crop types. In particular, we evaluate the performance of VIIRS-S2 ET estimates as a function of VIIRS view angle and cloud masking approach. VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals (MAE of 0.49 mm d(-1) against observations) generally show comparable accuracy to Landsat ET (0.45 mm d(-1)) on days of commensurate overpass, but with decreasing performance at large VIIRS view angles. Low-quality VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals linked to imperfect VIIRS/S2 cloud masking are also discussed, and caution is required when applying such data for generating ET timeseries. Fused daily ET time series benefited during the peak growing season from the improved multi-source temporal sampling afforded by VIIRS-S2, particularly in cloudy regions and over surfaces with rapidly changing vegetation conditions, and value added for real-time monitoring applications is discussed. This work demonstrates the utility and feasibility of augmenting the HLS dataset with sharpened VIIRS TIR imagery on S2 overpass dates for generating high spatiotemporal resolution ET products.","{""Anderson, Martha C."",""Gao, Feng"",""Hain, Christopher"",""Knipper, Kyle R."",""Kustas, William P."",""Xue, Jie"",""Yang, Yang"",""Yang, Yun""}",xue_mappingdailyevapotranspirationfield_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Broadband, Red-Edge Information From Satellites Improves Early Stress Detection In A New Mexico Conifer Woodland","Multiple plant stresses can affect the health, esthetic condition, and timber harvest value of conifer forests. To monitor spatial and temporal dynamic forest stress conditions, timely, accurate, and cost-effective information is needed that could be provided by remote sensing. Recently, satellite imagery has become available via the RapidEye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in five broad bands, including the red-edge region (690-730. nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We tested the hypothesis that broadband, red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll a. +. b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, blue, and near infrared band reflectance spectra. We analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 RapidEye scenes of a piÃ±on-juniper woodland in central New Mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by girdling. We found that the Normalized Difference Red-Edge index (NDRE) allowed stress to be detected 13. days after girdling - between and 16. days earlier than broadband spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI traditionally used for satellite based forest health monitoring. We conclude that red-edge information has the potential to considerably improve forest stress monitoring from satellites and warrants further investigation in other forested ecosystems.

Possibility Investigation Of Tree Diversity Mapping Using Landsat Etm+ Data In The Hyrcanian Forests Of Iran,"Lack of data often limits understanding and management of biodiversity in forested areas. Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DVI, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2, ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R2 = 0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran.

Applications And Research Using Remote Sensing For Rangeland Management,"Rangelands are grasslands, shrublands, and savannas used by wildlife for habitat and livestock in order to produce food and fiber. Assessment and monitoring of rangelands are currently based on comparing the plant species present in relation to an expected successional end-state defined by the ecological site. In the future, assessment and monitoring may be based on indicators of ecosystem health, including sustainability of soil, sustainability of plant production, and presence of invasive weed species. USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are actively engaged in developing quantitative, repeatable, and low-cost methods to measure indicators of ecosystem health using remote sensing. Noxious weed infestations can be determined by careful selection of the spatial resolution, spectral bands, and timing of image acquisition. Rangeland productivity can be estimated with either Landsat or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data using models of gross primary production based on radiation use efficiency. Lidar measurements are useful for canopy structure and soil roughness, indicating susceptibility to erosion. The value of remote sensing for rangeland management depends in part on combining the imagery with other spatial data within geographic information systems. Finally, ARS scientists are developing the knowledge on which future rangeland assessment and monitoring tools will be developed.","{""Anderson, G. L."",""Booth, D. T."",""Clark, P.

"Food, Water, And Fault Lines: Remote Sensing Opportunities For Earthquake-Response Management Of Agricultural Water","Earthquakes often cause destructive and unpredictable changes that can affect local hydrology (e.g. groundwater elevation or reduction) and thus disrupt land uses and human activities. Prolific agricultural regions overlie seismically active areas, emphasizing the importance to improve our understanding and monitoring of hydrologic and agricultural systems following a seismic event. A thorough data collection is necessary for adequate post-earthquake crop management response; however, the large spatial extent of earthquake's impact makes challenging the collection of robust data sets for identifying locations and magnitude of these impacts. Observing hydrologic responses to earthquakes is not a novel concept, yet there is a lack of methods and tools for assessing earthquake's impacts upon the regional hydrology and agricultural systems. The objective of this paper is to describe how remote sensing imagery, methods and tools allow detecting crop responses and damage incurred after earthquakes because a change in the regional hydrology. Many remote sensing datasets are long archived with extensive coverage and with well-documented methods to assess plant-water relations. We thus connect remote sensing of plantwater relations to its utility in agriculture using a post-earthquake agrohydrologic remote sensing (PEARS) framework; specifically in agro-hydrologic relationships associated with recent earthquake events that will lead to improved water management.

Observation Of Pm2.5 Using A Combination Of Satellite Remote Sensing And Low-Cost Sensor Network In Siberian Urban Areas With Limited Reference Monitoring,"The lack of reference ground-based PM2.5 observation leads to large gaps in air quality information, particularly in many areas of the developing world. This study investigated a new solution for urban air-quality monitoring in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. We developed an observation-based method by combining satellite remote-sensing techniques and a newly established low-cost sensor network to estimate long-term PM2.5 concentrations over Krasnoyarsk, a highly industrialized Siberian city. First, a physical model was developed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using satellite remote-sensing with the aid of ground-based meteorological and radiosonde observations. Observations from the ground-based sensor network were then used to calibrate the deviations in the satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations. The results show that the satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations obtained by our physical model were in good agreement with the sensor observations (R = 0.78 on the monthly scale). The deviation in satellite-derived annual PM2.5 concentrations resulted from data restrictions that occurred at noon and data loss in winter were identified as 20% and 30%, respectively. The regional transport of smoke from forest wildfires increased PM2.5 concentration to 150 Î¼g/m3 in the summer 2018. The average PM2.5 concentrations in the urban districts could reach 35 Î¼g/m3, which far exceeded the World Health Organization air quality guideline. These results underscore the good ability of our new method to determine PM2.5 concentrations in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. Use of sensor and meteorological observations greatly improved satellite detection of PM2.5 concentration. In addition, our method has the potential for global application to improve determination of PM2.5 concentrations, especially in sparsely monitored regions.

Future Perspectives Of Earth Observation: Indian Scenario,"Civilian Earth Observation programmes have demonstrated the utility of space-based data to a variety of users-specifically those associated with the natural resources management. Its future will depend upon how the systems meet the demand of monitoring global environment; mapping, charting and geodesy; long-term global change research and assessment; monitoring and managing the renewable and non-renewable resources and national security applications. The future Earth Observation Systems (EOS) will have to take into consideration the aspects relate to the globalisation and standardisation of programmes world-over; data continuity and the need to monitor processes rather than events. Technological changes are also going to re-define many of the concepts of observation from space and issues like spatial resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution may no more be a concern for observation systems. In the Indian context, with the launch of IRS-1C, in December 1995, user services have been significantly enhanced. Presently, plans are onway to define the continuity to these missions. A broad analysis has been done of the observation needs of the future and also what has been achieved today and suggestions are made for the future observation systems design and implementation. The need analysis has been done keeping in mind the global change applications; mapping and cartographic applications; natural resources and environmental management applications etc. The paper discusses the strategy adopted for assessing the future requirements and also for defining the future Indian missions. Based on this evaluation and also the need for identifying low-cost, quick turn-around, application specific solutions, candidate payloads for the continuation series have been defined. These candidate payloads cater to a majority of the application needs and specific gap-areas would be taken care of. A decade profile of Indian Remote Sensing missions has been defined which addresses the concept of continuity, operational missions and the advanced missions up to 2005.

Integrating Drone Imagery With Existing Rangeland Monitoring Programs,"The recent availability of small and low-cost sensor carrying unmanned aerial systems (UAS, commonly known as drones) coupled with advances in image processing software (i.e., structure from motion photogrammetry) has made drone-collected imagery a potentially valuable tool for rangeland inventory and monitoring. Drone-imagery methods can observe larger extents to estimate indicators at landscape scales with higher confidence than traditional field sampling. They also have the potential to replace field methods in some instances and enable the development of indicators not measurable from the ground. Much research has already demonstrated that several quantitative rangeland indicators can be estimated from high-resolution imagery. Developing a suite of monitoring methods that are useful for supporting management decisions (e.g., repeatable, cost-effective, and validated against field methods) will require additional exploration to develop best practices for image acquisition and analytical workflows that can efficiently estimate multiple indicators. We embedded with a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field monitoring crew in Northern California, USA to compare field-measured and imagery-derived indicator values and to evaluate the logistics of using small UAS within the framework of an existing monitoring program. The unified workflow we developed to measure fractional cover, canopy gaps, and vegetation height was specific for the sagebrush steppe, an ecosystem that is common in other BLM managed lands. The correspondence between imagery and field methods yielded encouraging agreement while revealing systematic differences between the methods. Workflow best practices for producing repeatable rangeland indicators is likely to vary by vegetation composition and phenology. An online space dedicated to sharing imagery-based workflows could spur collaboration among researchers and quicken the pace of integrating drone-imagery data within adaptive management of rangelands.

"Cross-Scale Sensing Of Field-Level Crop Residue Cover: Integrating Field Photos, Airborne Hyperspectral Imaging, And Satellite Data","Conservation tillage practices can bring benefits to agricultural sustainability. Accurate spatial and temporal resolved information of field-scale crop residue cover, which reflects tillage intensity, is highly valuable for evaluating the outcomes of government conservation programs and voluntary ecosystem service markets, as well as facilitating agroecosystem modeling to quantify cropland biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing has the potential to cost-effectively detect crop residue cover, however, existing regional-scale studies were limited by insufficient ground truth data, scale mismatch between coarse satellite pixels and ground data, and the lack of key spectral data for detecting crop residues. Therefore, this study developed an innovative cross-sensing framework to integrate proximal sensing, airborne hyperspectral imaging, and satellite Earth Observation through deep learning to quantify field-level crop residue cover fractions at the regional scale. Specifically, we have collected intensive ground orthographic photos and conducted airborne hyperspectral surveys at corn and soybean fields of Champaign and nearby counties in Illinois, the heartland of the U.S. Corn Belt. Through semi-automatic labeling aided by ResNet-50 and superpixel image segmentation, we obtained 6719 records of ground residue fractions. With these ground data, we developed the 1-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) model using airborne hyperspectral reflectance, which has 0.5 m spatial resolution and 3â€“5 nm spectral resolution from 400 to 2400 nm, to predict residue fractions. By applying the CNN model to airborne pixels, we augmented â€œground truthâ€ data of crop residues and further combined them with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) satellite data to quantify regional residue fractions at 30 m resolution. Results show that airborne hyperspectral imagery with CNN can accurately detect residue fractions (R2 = 0.82, relative RMSE = 11.73%) to effectively generate quasi â€œground truthâ€ data to support satellite upscaling to all fields. With independent ground data for testing, we found that the ground-airborne-satellite integrative framework achieved better predictions in estimating crop residue cover (R2 = 0.67, relative RMSE = 17.53%) than the conventional ground-satellite upscaling (R2 = 0.22, relative RMSE = 32.09%). We also found that the shortwave infrared wavelengths, particularly 2100â€“2300 nm, are vital for predicting crop residue cover. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data have a comparable capability to track residue fractions due to similar shortwave infrared wavelengths. This study highlights the high accuracy of hyperspectral imaging to detect agroecosystem tillage management practices and the advantages of cross-scale sensing to cost-effectively integrate multi-source data to quantify field-level agroecosystem variables across scales.

Satellite Sensors And Retrieval Algorithms Of Atmospheric Methane,"Significance Global climate governance and greenhouse gas emission reduction are of great urgency. The volume fraction of atmospheric methane (CH4) has been rising continuously since the industrial revolution and is now averaging about 1895.7x10(-9) globally. In addition, since the global warming potential of CH4 is about 27-30 times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), the monitoring of atmospheric CH4 becomes the focus and hotspot of carbon emission reduction. Satellite remote sensing features fast detection speed, wide coverage, and rich information. It can conduct continuous and stable observations of atmospheric CH4 with high temporal and spatial resolution and high precision on a global scale and can provide verification and support for the ""bottom-up"" emission inventory. Relying on the rapid development of satellite detection technology and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a large number of satellites with CH4 detection capabilities have emerged in the past two decades. The detection technology has become more mature with increasingly higher detection accuracy. Additionally, corresponding algorithms of various satellite sensors have also made a huge leap forward. Rapid advances in both sensors and algorithms enable us to better monitor the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric CH4 and its impact on climate change. With the purpose to promote the further development of CH4 satellite remote sensing and retrieval research and realize the dual carbon target, it is necessary to summarize and discuss the existing research progress and future development trends, which can provide scientific and technological support for China's low-carbon sustainable development. Progress Firstly, the development of atmospheric CH4 satellites and sensors is reviewed and introduced. Early sensors mainly rely on the thermal infrared band of about 8 mu m for CH4 detection, and typical representatives include IMG, AIRS, and IASI (Table 1). Subsequently, a series of passive short-wave infrared sensors represented by SCIAMACHY, TANSO-FTS, and TROPOMI are developed. They rely on CH4 characteristic bands near 1.6 mu m and 2.3 mu m for detection and are more sensitive to changes in near-surface CH4 concentration. Among them, the high-resolution imaging spectral sensors and platforms represented by GHGSat, AHSI, and MethaneSAT also take advantage of their high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution to monitor the CH4 point source emissions. There is no doubt that new energy is injected into the development of CH4 satellite remote sensing (Table 2). In recent years, active detection represented by the methane remote sensing lidar mission (MERLIN) has also developed rapidly, effectively making up for the shortcomings of passive remote sensing detection with improved detection efficiency. Subsequently, the principles, application conditions, and retrieval accuracy of different sensor algorithms are summarized. From the early DOAS algorithm, proxy algorithm, and PPDF algorithm, to the most commonly employed full-physical algorithm with the highest precision at this stage, the physical algorithms have been continuously improved with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. The full-physical algorithms represented by NIES-FP, UoL-FP, RemoTeC, RemoTAP, IAPCAS, and FOCAL have an accuracy of 6x10(-9). At the same time, with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence, various new algorithms, such as neural network algorithms, are also emerging, which can almost complete the real-time retrieval of CH4. These methods have also brought breakthroughs to CH4 retrieval. Conclusions and Prospects In the future, CH4 detection satellite sensors will continue to develop toward the goal of high temporal and spatial resolution, high precision, high accuracy, and continuous observation. Many high- performance satellites such as MethaneSAT, Sentinel-5, and CO2M are under planning (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the construction of the satellite network should be stepped up to meet the demands of CH4 global high-precision detection. Correspondingly, new requirements are put forward for the accuracy, coverage, and calculation speed of CH4 observation data and retrieval products. For the most accurate full- physical algorithm at present, the adoption of more accurate forward radiative transfer models and prior information, collaborative retrieval and correction of clouds and aerosols, and multi-satellite joint retrieval and verification are all important means for algorithm improvement. With the accelerated global climate governance and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, more and more countries have formulated and implemented a series of CH4 emission reduction measures, and China has also proposed the dual carbon target, which is steadily advancing. However, the issues of climate governance and carbon emissions are very complex, and to some extent have even become the focus of competition among countries. In this context, the development of China's atmospheric CH4 satellite remote sensing cannot be slackened and should be highly valued and vigorously developed to seize opportunities. China has deployed the launch of the next-generation carbon satellite task, which will implement the main passive observation, and significantly broaden the range of detection time and space. Finally, the spatial and temporal resolution is improved to promote an effective amount of data and realize the full range of high-precision detection, thus providing a solid foundation and strong support for realizing a dual carbon target.","{""Fan Cheng"",""Gu Haoran"",""Han Yinghui"",""He Zhuo"",""Li Zhengqiang"",""Ma Jinji"",""Qin Kai"",""Shi Zheng"",""Xu Wenbin"",""Zhang Hao"",""Zhang Ying"",""Zhang Yuanxun"",""Zheng Yang"",""Zhu Jun"",""Zuo Jinhui""}",hezhuoandlizhengqiangandfanchengandzhangyingandshizhengandzhengyangandguhaoranandmajinjiandzuojinhuiandhanyinghuiandzhangyuanxunandqinkaiandzhanghaoandxuwenbinandzhujun_satellitesensorsretrievalalgorithms_2023,FALSE,how did ChatGPT do a summary then???

Extending The Utility Of Modis Daily Snow-Cover Products Through Snow-Cover Prediction Of Cloud-Obscured Areas In Idaho's Big Lost River Basin (Usa),"Increasing demand for water resources in the Western United States has given rise to many conflicts and has increased the need for more accurate and timely water management decisions. Snow-Covered Area (SCA) is an important hydrologic variable for both volumetric and daily stream flow forecasting. Satellite data provide the ideal way to map snow cover in mountain regions; however, the utility of these datasets have been limited due to the large number of scenes that are contaminated with cloud cover. To improve the utility of these datasets for the snowmelt season, in particular the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Daily Snow-Cover Product dataset, a new procedure was developed to predict snow-cover in cloud-obscured areas using a snow-occurrence map technique. Results show that this method effectively increases the usefulness of the MODIS Snow-Cover product in mapping the daily evolution of snow cover extent in the Big Lost River Basin located in southeastern Idaho.","{""Hruska, Ryan C."",""Lee, Randy""}",hruska_extendingutilitymodisdaily_2008,FALSE,"Improves utility of MODIS data for estimating snow cover, using a logic algorithm.

Automatic Parameter Optimization For Support Vector Regression For Land And Sea Surface Temperature Estimation From Remote Sensing Data,"Land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) are important quantities For many, environmental models. Remote sensing is a source of information for their estimation on both regional and global scales. Many algorithms have been devised to estimate LST and SST from satellite data, most of which require a priori information about the surface and the atmosphere. A recently proposed approach involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Based on satellite data and corresponding in situ measurements, they generate an approximation of the relation between them, which can subsequently he used to estimate unknown surface temperatures from additional satellite data. Such a strategy requires the user to set several internal parameters. In this paper, a method is proposed for automatically setting these parameters to quasi-optimal values in the sense of minimum estimation errors. This is achieved by minimizing a functional correlated to regression errors (i.e., the ""span-bound"" upper bound on the leave-one-out (1,00) error) which can be computed by using only the training set, without need for a further validation set. In order to minimize this functional, Powell's algorithm is adopted, since it is applicable also to nondifferentiable functions. Experimental results yielded by the proposed method are similar in accuracy to those achieved by cross-validation and by a grid search for the parameter configuration which yields the best test-set accuracy. However, the proposed method gives a dramatic reduction in the computational time required, particularly when many training samples are available.","{""Moser, Gabriele"",""Serpico, Sebastiano B.""}",moser_automaticparameteroptimizationsupport_2009,FALSE,Algorithm for tuning parameters,sample_1000,NA,NA
Grassland Wildfires In The Southern Great Plains: Monitoring Ecological Impacts And Recovery,"Devastating wildfires in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas in 2016 and 2017 resulted in significant social, economic, and environmental losses, with the agricultural sector among those severely affected. Several satellite-based indices were evaluated as potential monitoring tools for post-wildfire ecological recovery and management of grasslands. All indices evaluated provided useful information and indicated rapid vegetation recovery from wildfire. The Leaf Water Stress Index (LSWI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) showed a distinct response to the wildfire events, and differentiated between burned and unburned areas throughout the post-wildfire growing seasons better than the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI). In particular, the LSWI may provide a useful tool for mapping the footprint of wildfire, with potential utility for organizations that provide post-fire recovery resources. The GPP, which estimates the biomass productivity of vegetation, can provide information to livestock operators to guide the re-stocking of cattle in the aftermath of wildfire. In sum, satellite-based proxies can provide timely information both to characterize a wildfire's footprint and to guide post-fire grazing management in a manner that balances short term needs for forage with long-term productivity and ecological function.","{""Brown, David"",""Robertson, Shelby"",""Steiner, Jean L."",""Teet, Stephen"",""Wang, Jie"",""Wetter, Jeffrey"",""Wu, Xiaocui"",""Xiao, Xiangming"",""Zhou, Yuting""}",steiner_grasslandwildfiressouthernplains_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Understanding Large-Scale Deforestation In Southern Jinotega, Nicaragua From 1978 To 1999 Through The Examination Of Changes In Land Use And Land Cover","Nicaragua, home to the largest remaining extent of rainforest in Central America (total surface area) and to a significant indigenous population, has lost approximately half of its forest cover since 1950. This major and rapid loss of forest cover has been explained as the consequence of an eastward moving agricultural frontier that cuts through the region of Jinotega. If the current deforestation rate continues, the country could lose its remaining forest cover over the course of the next two decades; therefore, it is essential that the dynamics and relationships of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) in this region are understood. To examine LUCC in Nicaragua over time, Landsat imagery from the southern portion of the region of Jinotega, taken in 1978, 1987, and 1999 was utilized. A remote-sensing method, supervised classification, which allows for the grouping of spectrally similar values for each year, followed by an image change detection analysis (postclassification comparison) was conducted. Groundtruthing (field validation) was conducted in 2006 to validate the data, which yielded increasing overall accuracy rates of 71.68% for 1978, 82.35% for 1987, and 84.38% for 1999. The classification and change detection results showed that if the agricultural cultivation overtook this region, it happened before 1978. Therefore, the possibility that either deforestation did not actually occur along an agricultural frontier or that it was located further east exists; this would be an interesting subject for future studies. There was, however, clear evidence of increased forest cover from 1987 to 1999 near the urban center, correlating with the enforced reforestation law in the city of Jinotega. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Comparison Of Petiole Nitrate Concentrations, Spad Chlorophyll Readings, And Quickbird Satellite Imagery In Detecting Nitrogen Status Of Potato Canopies","Nitrogen (N) management is critical in optimizing potato yield and quality and reducing environmental pollution. Six N rates from 34 to 270 kg ha(-1), and different timing of N application were used in a 3-year field experiment to contrast SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter and QuickBird satellite imagery data against the conventional petiole sampling technique for assessing canopy N status. Overall treatment variations in SPAD readings were consistent with those in petiole nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations. However, the ability of the SPAD meter to detect treatment differences varied with growth stage and growing season. Severe N deficiency was detected about I month after emergence with SPAD readings, but as early as 2 weeks after emergence with petiole NO3-N concentrations. Petiole NO3-N concentrations tended to differentiate more treatment variations than SPAD readings at all growth stages except at hilling. N deficiency was detected with QuickBird image-derived vegetation indices (VIs) at the hilling stage in 2002, but not in 2003. At the post-hilling stage, treatment differences in VI values were minimal and insignificant except very late in the growing season. SPAD meters could be used as an indirect method for detecting N deficiency at the hilling stage when making supplemental N applications, but they are not as sensitive as the petiole sampling method. The sensitivity of QuickBird imagery to canopy N variations needs to be further tested with more pixel data. However, cloud interference and high cost of images could limit the use of QuickBird data in making timely management decisions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Application Of The Metric Model For Mapping Evapotranspiration Over The Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India","This study is an attempt to estimate the spatial distribution of daily evapotranspiration (ET) in the Indian part of the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve by utilizing the (Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high resolution with internalized Calibration (METRIC) model. Landsat 8 OLI satellite image was used to run the METRIC model and calculate ET to explain the overall surface energy balance in the area under the present climatic conditions. The result obtained shows that, the ET minimum value ranges from 6.874 mm/day in cropland to a maximum of 12.321 mm/day in the forest and water bodies. We used a (ETrF) value of 1 for forests since the forest surface temperature was lower than the air temperature, resulting in a negative sensible heat flow. The use of METRIC energy balancing procedures for validation purposes using Landsat imagery shows that the per hourly, monthly, and yearly ET estimations acquired using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer) data may be effectively reproduced. The research includes a novel component that verifies the efficacy of this technique for water conservation, as well as satellite-based technology, which offers effective and efficient tools for integrated evapotranspiration estimation.","{""De, Aakash"",""De, Tarun Kumar"",""Mondal, Ismail"",""Thakur, Sandeep""}",mondal_applicationmetricmodelmapping_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Effect Of An Environmental Flow On Vegetation Growth And Health Using Ground And Remote Sensing Metrics,"Understanding the effectiveness of environmental flow deliveries along rivers requires monitoring vegetation. Monitoring data are often collected at multiple spatial scales. For riparian vegetation, optical remote sensing methods can estimate growth responses at the riparian corridor scale, and field-based measures can quantify species composition; however, the extent to which these different measures are duplicative or complementary is important to understand when planning monitoring programmes with limited resources. In this study, we analysed riparian vegetation growth in the delta of the Colorado River in response to an experimental pulse flow. Our goal was to compare ground-based measurements of vegetation structure and composition with satellite-based Landsat radiometric variables, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We made this comparison in 21 transects following the delivery of 131.8 million cubic meters (mcm) of water in the stream channel during the spring of 2014 as a pulse flow and 38.4 mcm as base flows. Vegetation cover increased 14\% and NDVI increased 0.02 (15\%) by October 2015, and both variables returned to pre-pulse flow values in October 2016. Observed changes in vegetation structure and composition did not persist after the second year. The highest increase in vegetation cover in October 2014 and October 2015 resulted from species that could respond rapidly to additional water such as reeds (Arundo donax and Phragmites australis), cattail (Typha domingensis), and herbaceous plants. Dominant shrubs, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea), both indicative of nonrestored habitats showed variable increases in cover, and native trees (Salicaceae family) presented low increases (1\%). The strong NDVI-vegetation cover relationship indicates that NDVI is appropriate to detect changes at the riparian corridor scale but needs to be complemented with ground data to determine the contributions by different species to the observed trends.","{""Flessa, Karl W."",""Glenn, Edward P."",""Gomez-Sapiens, Martha M."",""Jarchow, Christopher J."",""Nagler, Pamela L."",""Shafroth, Patrick B.""}",gomezsapiens_effectenvironmentalflowvegetation_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Coastal Wetlands Of The Northern Gulf Of California: Inventory And Conservation Status,"1. Above 28 degrees N, the coastline of the northern Gulf of California is indented Lit frequent intervals by negative or inverse estuaries that are saltier at their backs than at their Mouths due to the lack of freshwater inflow. These 'esteros' total over 215000 ha in area and encompass mangrove marshes below 29 degrees N and saltgrass (Distichlis palmeri) marshes north of 29 degrees N. An additional 6000 ha of freshwater and brackish wetlands are found in the Colorado River delta where fresh water enters the interticial zone. 2. The mangrove marshes in the Gulf of California have been afforded some degree of protected status in Mexico, but the northern saltgrass esteros do not have priority conservation status and are increasingly becoming development targets for resorts, vacation homes and aquaculture sites. 3. We conducted an inventory of the marshes using aerial photography and satellite images, and evaluated the extent and type of development on each marsh. We reviewed the available literature on the marshes to document their vegetation types, and ecological functions in the adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems. 4. Over 95\% of the mangrove marshes have been developed for shrimp fanning. However, the farms are built adjacent to, rather than in, the marshes, and the mangrove stands are still mostly intact. 5. The majority of saltgrass marshes above the mangrove line are still relatively unspoiled. However, resort and Vacation home development is taking place on land Surrounding them. 6. We recommend a system of protected reserves incorporating the pristine wetlands, along with water quality management and buffer zones For the more developed esteros. The saltgrass marshes should be considered for conservation protection, similar to the protection given to the Southern mangrove marshes whose Value has already been recognized.

"Biodiversity And Health: Lessons And Recommendations From An Interdisciplinary Conference To Advise Southeast Asian Research, Society And Policy","Southeast Asia is an economic, biodiverse, cultural and disease hotspot. Due to rapid socio-economic and environmental changes, the role of biodiversity and ecosystems for human health ought to be examined and communicated to decision-makers and the public. We therefore summarized the lessons and recommendations from an interdisciplinary conference convened in Cambodia in 2014 to advise Southeast Asian societies on current research efforts, future research needs, and to provide suggestions for improved education, training and science-policy interactions. First, we reviewed several examples of the important role of ecosystems as 'sentinels' in the sense that potentially harmful developments for human health become first apparent in ecosystem components. Other ecosystem services which also benefit human well-being are briefly summarized. Second, we summarized the recommendations of the conference's roundtable discussions and added recent developments in the science-policy interface. The recommendations were organized along five themes: Ethical and legal considerations; implementation of the One Health approach; education, training, and capacity building; future research priorities; and potential science-policy interactions. While the role of biodiversity for human health needs further research, especially for zoonoses and emerging diseases, many direct and indirect benefits to human health are already apparent, but have yet to filter down to the science-policy interface in order to influence legislation and enforcement. Therefore, efforts to strengthen the interface in Southeast Asia should become a high priority in order to strengthen the health and resilience of Southeast Asian societies.

Research On Anti-Shadow Tree Detection Method Based On Generative Adversarial Network,"High-scoring remote sensing imaging has widely been applied in most management of agriculture and forestry, especially to monitor and evaluate crops and forest resources on a large scale. Nevertheless, there is a great challenge to the accuracy of single tree identification and detection during the image acquisition, due mainly to the fact that the shadow area is inevitably formed by the light. The shadow areas in the remote sensing images can be assumed as a kind of noise in the image sampling. As such, the degradation of high-resolution parameters can cause image distortion after post-processing. In this study, an anti-shadow tree detection method was proposed to detect the single tree with shadow interference using a generative adversarial network (GA-Faster RCNN). This framework consisted of a Faster RCNN network and a tree generator. The Faster RCNN network was mainly used for the tasks of feature extraction and detection. The tree generator was utilized to process the shadows in tree detection. The adversarial generation strategy was adopted by the tree generator to learn generating the minimum feature information characterizing trees. The generator was first trained separately and then put into the Faster RCNN network to finally lock its parameters. Two parts were then trained end-to-end to further improve the tree recognition ability of the network. The GA-Faster RCNN was also compared with 3 state-of-the-art methods, including region-growing, progressive cascaded convolutional neural network, and Faster RCNN on three test areas with shadows. Test area 1 presented a lot of shadows of trees, where the canopy density of trees was very high. Test area 2 showed fewer tree shadows and lower canopy closure, compared with test area 1. The shades of trees and the canopy density of trees in test area 3 were between those in test area 1 and 2. Results demonstrated that the GA-Faster RCNN achieved the highest harmonic average of precision and recall (F1) on the test area 1, 2, and 3, which were 78.4%, 91.6%, and 81.7%, respectively. The average F1 of three test areas was 84.7% for the GA-Faster RCNN, 6.2 percentage point higher than that of Faster RCNN. The user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) of GA-Faster RCNN were also the highest among four methods, where UA was 79.8%, 95.0%, 85.3%, and PA was 77.0%, 88.5%, and 78.4% on test area 1, 2, 3, respectively. Moreover, a significance analysis, McNemar, was performed to eliminate the interference of experimental errors and other factors. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference between the three comparison methods and GA-Faster RCNN. The shadow misrecognition rate SR (proportion of the count of shadows misrecognized as trees to the count of total recognized trees) of GA-Faster RCNN was compared with that of Faster RCNN on test area 1, in order to clarify the effect of the mask on tree identification. Although the SR of GA-Faster RCNN was 13.8%, higher than that of Faster RCNN (8.6%), the UA and the number of missed tree identification were both better than those of Faster RCNN. Therefore, the GA-Faster RCNN behaved significant advantages over the other identification. In addition, the GA-Faster RCNN can still maintain the detection stability, when using different feature extraction networks, including ResNet101, ResNet50, and DenseNet. Consequently, the adversarial generative training strategy is highly suitable for learning the minimum feature information characterizing trees, while effectively reducing the interference of shadows, indicating the promising practical value for higher accuracy of tree detection.

Evaluating The Eco-Environment Benefit Of Land Reclamation In The Dump Of An Opencast Coal Mine,"Land reclamation significantly affects the ecological and environmental conditions of mining areas. However, quantifying the exact effects is difficult because of the lack of reliable data. The estimation of eco-environment benefit contributes to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by land reclamation and to provide useful information for policy-makers concerned with sustainable development. The aim of this study is to investigate variations in eco-environment benefit in response to land use changes during land reclamation. The West dump, one of the earliest regions to implement ecological restoration in Liaoning Province, is selected as the study area. The widely used methods for eco-environment benefits based on the land use change were proposed and applied to the West dump in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The total eco-environment benefits in study areas were 0.98 million dollars in 2004, 1.39 million dollars in 2009, and 1.43 million dollars in 2014, with an increase of 0.41 million dollars from 2004 to 2009 mainly because of the increasing areas of artificial woodland and reclaimed cropland. The combined eco-environment benefits of artificial woodland, improved grassland, and reclaimed cropland were over 90\% of the total benefits. Soil formation and protection, biodiversity protection, and gas regulation were the top three functions with high eco-environment benefits, contributing about half of the total eco-environment benefits. The results suggest that future studies estimating eco-environment benefits should pay more attention to ecosystems in fragile ecological regions where various human interferences happen frequently. All of the abovementioned results made the techniques of estimation of the eco-environment benefit of land reclamation are more meaningful in guiding the future exploitation and reclamation of mining areas.","{""Wang, Jing"",""Wang, Qiubing"",""Wei, Zhongyi""}",wang_evaluatingecoenvironmentbenefit_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

In total, 14 major sites were identified under hydroponics with a total area of 5.6Â ha. The accuracy of hydroponics was assessed using precision and recall with the F1 score of 0.94. Around six sites of hydroponics were also validated with the independent high-resolution Google Earth image. This study demonstrates the utility of spatial statistics technique and high-resolution data for hotspot analysis of hydroponics farming. The method can be adopted for making plans and policies to identify locations for the commercialization of hydroponics farming, which could assist in food security, employment and farmerâ€™s livelihood and has the potential to meet the second sustainable development goal (SDG).

Drought Risk Assessment And Monitoring Of Ilocos Norte Province In The Philippines Using Satellite Remote Sensing And Meteorological Data,"Drought has been known to be a natural hazard reflecting geographic and climatic characteristics. Satellite technology advancements have benefited drought assessment and monitoring to formulate plans for dealing with this slow-onset disaster. However, combining satellite remote sensing (RS) and meteorological data for drought monitoring is lacking in the literature. This study uses satellite RS and meteorological-based drought indicators to assess drought risk in the Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Data analysis included the retrieval of vegetation conditions using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) were calculated to account for climatic variabilities. Results revealed that the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient decreased by -2 dB in the cropland area, indicating crop growth irregularities compared to grassland areas. These irregularities were supported by Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) strong fluctuations during the two-year observation period. A significant coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.60) between the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient and Sentinel-2 NDVI was observed for the study area. On the one hand, only KBDI significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.60) with the cropland area's RS data-derived drought indicators. These results revealed RS data variability for drought risk management but are still valuable for developing an early warning system.","{""Alonzo, Christian Albert"",""Galabay, Joanna Mae"",""Macatangay, Margadrew Nicole"",""Magpayo, Mark Brianne"",""Ramirez, Ryan""}",alonzo_droughtriskassessmentmonitoring_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Summer Absorption Characteristics, Spatial Distribution And Source Analysis Of Cdom In Zhoucun Reservoir In Huaihe Catchment","Based on the data of the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from 24 surface water samples collected from Zhoucun Reservoir in Huaihe Catchment, we analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of CDOM absorption coefficient, investigated the correlation between CDOM absorption coefficient and environmental parameters, and explored the possible source of CDOM in the reservoir. The samples collected from the reservoir were categorized into three different groups (storage port, transition region and main reservoir area), the absorption coefficients (a(355) and a*(355)) had a decrease process from the storage port to main reservoir area, while the S value exhibited an increased trend. Meanwhile, significantly negative correlations of the value of S240-500 were found with a(355) and a*(355), respectively, which may have implications for the remote sensing estimation of CDOM in this study. A significantly negative correlation between a(355) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was conducive to the establishment of DOC remote sensing inversion model, and relationships between a(355) and aph(440) implied the potential contribution of phytoplankton metabolism and degradation products to the CDOM pool in the Zhoucun Reservoir. These results on the CDOM analysis made a significant contribution to the management of the Reservoir in the future.

Contribution Of Remote Sensing To Wildfire Trend And Dynamic Analysis In Two Of Ghana's Ecological Zones: Guinea-Savanna And Forest-Savanna Mosaic,"Background: Two of Ghanaâ€™s ecological zonesâ€”Guinea-savanna zone (GSZ) and Forest-savanna mosaic zone (FSZ)â€”are practically homologous in terms of structure and floristic composition, with some differences. The various sub-ecosystems that make up these areas are being depleted and losing their natural values due to various threats. There is little understanding about the fire trends in these areas due to a lack of data and poor accessibility to existing fire statistics. This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of the trends of area burned and active fire in the Guinea-savanna and Forest-savanna mosaic zones in order to inform policy-makers about sustainable management options. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire (MDC14ML) and burned-area (MCD64A1) products to characterize the fire regime in terms of seasonality, intensity, density, burned area, frequency, and trends during the study period of 2001 to 2021. Results: This study indicated that fire activity started in October and peaked in December (GSZ) and January (FSZ). The mean proportion burned was approximately 39.95% (burned area of 2659.31 km2; FSZ) and 60.05% (burned area of 3996.63 km2: GSZ), while the frequency was approximately 42.87% (1759.95 of active fires; FSZ) and 57.13% (2345.26 of active fires: GSZ). In 2018, GSZ recorded the largest burned area (19 811.2Â km2, which represents an average of 825.5Â km2 of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 4719 active points detected. FSZ recorded its greatest burned area in 2015 (8727.4Â km2; which represents an average of 363.6Â km2 of the total area burned from 2001 to 2021) with 5587 active points recorded. In addition, it was found that specific times of the day (1000 h to 1420 h) recorded the majority of burned areas. In overview, between 2001 and 2021, burned areas increased by an average of 1.4 km2 (FSZ) and 4.6 km2 (GSZ), and the number of active fires increased by an average of 4.7 (FSZ) and 4.4 (GSZ) active fires per km2. Conclusions: In conclusion, burned areas and active fires are increasing in both ecological zones. This study demonstrated the relevance of remote sensing to describe spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence in Ghana and highlighted the need for fire control and fuel management by the policies and institutions (e.g., Ghana National Fire and Rescue Service) in these important and vulnerable zones (GSZ and FSZ). This is especially true in the Forest-savanna mosaic zone, which is increasingly affected by the disasters of wildfires and records more active fires than GSZ, indicating that this zone is becoming more and more vulnerable. Therefore, rigorous continuous monitoring is essential, and collaboration between organizations fighting for the conservation of natural resources in the field is strongly recommended.

The Establishment Of Sperm Morphology Satellite Training Laboratories In Africa,"Discrepancies in the results of semen analysis can be caused by a variety of factors, for example, a microscope for semen analysis can be situated in the practice of an urologist, cytologist or microbiologist, or even in a health care office in the countryside in a developing country. The study aimed to evaluate the (i) sperm morphology assessment skills of the participants who attended WHO seminology workshops and (ii) to appraise the possibility of using trained technologists to set up satellite training facilities in their own area. The Centre for Research in Reproductive Health, Ogun State University Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) initiated training sessions in their area. Subsequently, 16 technologists were trained in three sessions. Papanicolaou-stained slides, supplied by Tygerberg were used as test material. Pre- and post-training results were used to calculate the mean percentage of normal cells as well as the percentage deviation from the reference laboratory. The mean percentage normal spermatozoa recorded by the Nigerian trainees during pre-training evaluations differed by 38% from the reference value, compared with a post-training difference of 16% (P < 0.001).

Joint Use Of Monitoring And Modelling,"There is much to gain in joining monitoring and modelling efforts, especially in the present process of implementing the European Water Framework Directive. Nevertheless, it is rare to see forces combined in these two disciplines. To bring the monitoring and the modelling communities together, a number of workshops have been arranged with discussions on benefits and constraints in joint use of monitoring and modelling. The workshops have been attended by scientists, water managers, policy makers as well as stakeholders and consultants. Emphasis has been put on data availability and accessibility, remote sensing and data assimilation techniques, monitoring programmes and modelling support to the design or optimisation of these as well as potential benefits of using supporting modelling tools in the process of designing Programmes of Measures by impact assessment etc. The way models can support in extrapolation in time and space, in data analysis, in process understanding (conceptual models), in accessing correct interaction between pressures and impacts etc. have also been elaborated. Although practitioners have been open-minded to the presented ideas, they are somewhat reluctant towards how to implement this in their daily work.

Fuel Type Classification Using Airborne Laser Scanning And Sentinel 2 Data In Mediterranean Forest Affected By Wildfires,"Mediterranean forests are recurrently affected by fire. The recurrence of fire in such environments and the number and severity of previous fire events are directly related to fire risk. Fuel type classification is crucial for estimating ignition and fire propagation for sustainable forest management of these wildfire prone environments. The aim of this study is to classify fuel types according to Prometheus classification using low-density Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data, Sentinel 2 data, and 136 field plots used as ground-truth. The study encompassed three different Mediterranean forests dominated by pines (Pinus halepensis, P. pinaster y P. nigra), oaks (Quercus ilex) and quercus (Q. faginea) in areas affected by wildfires in 1994 and their surroundings. Two metric selection approaches and two non-parametric classification methods with variants were compared to classify fuel types. The best-fitted classification model was obtained using Support Vector Machine method with radial kernel. The model includes three ALS and one Sentinel-2 metrics: the 25th percentile of returns height, the percentage of all returns above mean, rumple structural diversity index and NDVI. The overall accuracy of the model after validation was 59\%. The combination of data from active and passive remote sensing sensors as well as the use of adapted structural diversity indices derived from ALS data improved accuracy classification. This approach demonstrates its value for mapping fuel type spatial patterns at a regional scale under different heterogeneous and topographically complex Mediterranean forests.","{""Domingo, Dario"",""Echeverria, Maite"",""Garcia-Martin, Alberto"",""Hoffren, Raid"",""Ibarra, Paloma"",""Teresa Lamelas, Maria"",""de la Riva, Juan""}",domingo_fueltypeclassificationairborne_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Research On Optimization Of 3d Tourism Virtual Crossover Scene Based On Semantic Perception Analysis,"The objective of this paper is to optimize the scene of tourism virtual perception space. Based on the abstract method of semantic feature points, the computing model of semantic perception of single-cultural landscape and multi-cultural landscape is established. Using the digital elevation model, an empirical study on the semantic perception of cultural landscape in the western Tombs of Qing Dynasty is carried out. Taking the traditional Chinese culture of the site selection of royal tombs and the feudal hierarchy represented as the semantic criteria, eighteen feature points were extracted from two representative tomb cultural landscapes from different landscape perspectives, and the corresponding weight coefficients were assigned to each feature point from different landscape perspectives; based on the results of perceptual degree calculation, the semantic mining of the existing sightseeing routes is carried out and the optimization scheme is designed.

Mapping Forest Cover And Estimating Soil Organic Matter By Gis-Data And An Empirical Model At The Subnational Level In Mexico,"Forests play an essential role in climate change as they are the terrestrial ecosystems that store the highest C content in their soils and biomass. Despite this, the lack of information at the subnational level hinders their proper management and conservation. This study aimed to identify the extension and distribution of forests and to develop an empirical model for the spatial prediction of soil organic matter (SOM) in Ixtacamaxtitlan, Puebla, Mexico, based on environmental variables generated through Geographical Information Systems. A supervised classification in Landsat 8 images was used to define the forest cover, and environmental variables related to topography, climate and vegetation were generated. Finally, a Multiple Linear Regression model validated with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to examine the relationships between the covariates and the SOM and estimate its content in forest. The results show that the forest cover extension is 41\%, with an overall accuracy of 97.7\%. The model shows a good fit (R-cv(2) = 0.69, RMSEcv = 1.53). The mean of SOM was 5.2\%, and upper values were consistent with higher altitude, precipitation and cooler temperature. Estimating SOM content in forest areas is essential in developing planning strategies at the subnational level to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.","{""Arroyo, Itzel"",""Castelan, Rosalia"",""Tamariz-Flores, Victor""}",arroyo_mappingforestcoverestimating_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Multi-Scenario Simulation Of Land Use And Land Cover Based On Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: The Case Of Coastal Special Economic Zones In China,"Urban land-use change simulations without considering the sustainable planning policies, especially in special economic park highly concerned by planners, might lack the reliability and availability.

Remote Sensing Monitoring Of Changes In Winter Wheat Area In North China Plain From 2001 To 2011,"The North China Plain is the major producing area for winter wheat in China. It is also amongst the global hotspots in terms of severe water scarcity. The monitoring and mapping of winter wheat in an efficient and accurate manner is of great significance for effective policy management on both agriculture and water resources in the North China Plain. Remote sensing technology has been proved to be a practical and feasible method for agricultural crop area extraction in previous researches. In this study, a multi-source remote sensing monitoring system was built, in order to quickly and accurately extract the spatial and temporal information of winter wheat in the North China Plain. Specifically, a spectral curve library for winter wheat was constructed, using MODIS EVI time-series data and two TM images in 2011; and the uniform rules were formulated for the identification of winter wheat, with the combination of phenology calendar in each province in the North China Plain. The spatial and temporal changes of areas planting with winter wheat in 2001-2011 in the North China Plain were extracted using the above uniform rules, and its patterns were analyzed at the grid level, the county level and the province level, respectively. The results showed that: 1) The classification accuracy of winter wheat extracted by the multi-source remote sensing monitoring system was good at the grid scale, and the overall accuracies were stable in 2001-2011, with the values ranging between 74.80% in 2001 and 78.14% in 2011; at the county level, area planting with winter wheat extracted by the multi-source remote sensing monitoring system in 2011 agreed well with the statistics, with the determination coefficient R2 of 0.89 and the root mean square error RMSE of 1.29Ã—104 hm2; the error between the above two data sets was 11.31% in 2011. 2) Area planting with winter wheat in the North China Plain continued to increase in 2001-2011, and it was 156.05Ã—104 hm2 (14.96%) more in 2011 than that in 2001; in 2001-2006, areas planting with winter wheat all increased in four provinces including Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui, and it continued to increase in Shandong and Henan in 2006-2011, while weak reductions occurred in Jiangsu and Anhui at the same time; in comparison, areas planting with winter wheat all represented significant decline in volatility in 2001-2011 in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. 3) There was an obvious ""increase in the south and decrease in the north"" pattern for spatial and temporal changes of areas planting with winter wheat in 2001-2011 across the North China Plain; the spatial expansions of winter wheat were mainly spotted in the middle and southern part of the North China Plain, including the Southwest Shandong Plain, the Jiaolai Plain, the East Henan Plain and the North Anhui Plain, while shrinkages of winter wheat were mainly found in the northern part of the North China Plain, including the plain areas of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. The spatial pattern of changes in areas planting with winter wheat could be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of water resources, and it was also likely to be associated with the increasing opportunity cost of agricultural labor forces, the benefit changes of winter wheat and the agricultural subsidy policy. However, the major driving forces and their driving mechanisms deserved deep analysis. This study can provide useful information for decision makings on crop planting structure adjustment, food security guarantee and water management optimization, and can also be used as a reference for large-scale and long-time monitoring of spatial and temporal information of crop planting areas with remote sensing data as the main data source.

Landscape And Local Site Variables Differentially Influence Pollinators And Pollination Services In Urban Agricultural Sites,"Urbanization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as agricultural and semi-natural habitats are converted into landscapes dominated by built features. Urban agricultural sites are a growing component of urban landscapes and have potential to serve as a source of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provisioning in urban areas. In 19 urban agricultural sites, we investigated how surrounding land cover and local site variables supported bees and pollination services. We found the abundance of bees differentially responded to landscape and local scale variables depending on body size and nesting habit. Large-bodied bees, Bombus and Apis species, were positively associated with increasing amounts of impervious cover, while the abundance of small-bodied soil nesting Halictus species increased as the proportion of flower area, a local variable, increased. Bee richness declined with increasing levels of impervious cover, while bee community composition changed along a gradient of increasing impervious cover. Pollination services, measured at each site using sentinel cucumber plants, declined as hardscape, a local variable, increased. To improve bee conservation and pollination services in urban agricultural sites, our results suggest urban planning strategies should minimize impervious cover at large spatial scales while land managers should focus locally on incorporating floral resources, which increases food and nesting resources especially for smaller bee species. Local site design coupled with regional urban planning can advance the success of urban agriculture, while benefiting biodiversity by creating opportunities for pollinator conservation in urban landscapes.","{""Bennett, Ashley B."",""Lovell, Sarah""}",bennett_landscapelocalsitevariables_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Development Of Methodology To Prioritise Wildlife Pathogens For Surveillance,"We developed and evaluated a methodology to prioritise pathogens for a wildlife disease surveillance strategy in New Zealand. The methodology, termed 'rapid risk analysis' was based on the import risk analysis framework recommended by the Office Internationale des Epizooties (OIE), and involved: hazard identification, risk estimation, and ranking of 48 exotic and 34 endemic wildlife pathogens. The risk assessment was more rapid than a full quantitative assessment through the use of a semi-quantitative approach to score pathogens for probability of entry to NZ (release assessment), likelihood of spread (exposure assessment) and consequences in free-living wildlife, captive wildlife, humans, livestock and companion animals. Risk was estimated by multiplying the scores for the probability of entry to New Zealand by the likelihood of spread by the consequences for free-living wildlife, humans and livestock. The rapid risk analysis methodology produced scores that were sufficiently differentiated between pathogens to be useful for ranking them on the basis of risk. Ranking pathogens on the basis of the risk estimate for each population sector provided an opportunity to identify the priorities within each sector alone thus avoiding value-laden comparisons between sectors. Ranking pathogens across all three population sectors by summing the risk estimate for each sector provided a comparison of total risk which may be useful for resource allocation decisions at national level. Ranking pathogens within each wildlife taxonomic group using the total risk estimate was most useful for developing specific surveillance strategies for each group. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Land-Use Change, Habitat Connectivity, And Conservation Gaps: A Case Study Of Shorebird Species In The Yellow River Delta Of China Using The Invest Model And Network Analysis","Coastal wetlands form a transition zone between terrestrial and marine environments and provide important ecosystem services. Land-use change in the coastal zone has a substantial effect on habitat connectivity and biodiversity. However, few studies have characterized the effects of land-use change on coastal habitat connectivity. We conducted remote sensing analysis, modeling with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model, geospatial analysis, and habitat connectivity analysis to evaluate historical spatiotemporal changes in the habitat quality and habitat connectivity of migratory shorebirds in the Yellow River Delta, which is an important stopover site along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway migratory route. Several high- and medium-quality areas have been converted to industrial mining and mariculture sites because of land reclamation. The probability of connectivity decreased by -66.7\% between 1975 and 2020.

"Soil Erosion Risk Assessment Of Hilly Terrain Through Integrated Approach Of Rusle And Geospatial Technology: A Case Study Of Tirap District, Arunachal Pradesh","Present study was carried out in Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh characterized by mountainous terrain coupled with torrential rainfall. Forests and agriculture land cover are exposed to varied level of anthropogenic and deforestation activities. All these have augmented into pronounced soil erosion thereby negatively impacting the socio- economy of the rural population. Topographic, management, soil and landuse factors were among the most important drivers influencing the soil erosion. Keeping above in account, present study emphasizes the applicability of geospatial technology coupled with field data to estimate soil erosion rate which could be helpful in developing suitable management plan. Numerous empirical models are available for estimating soil erosion; however, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system framework was applied in the current study due to its robustness and simplicity. RUSLE factors such as erosivity of rainfall (RE), erodibility of soil (ES), slope length (LS), crop management (CM) and conservation practice (CP) were calculated using available data. Rainfall erosivity factor was 323.8 MJ mm/ha/h/year. ES factor ranged from 0.16 to 0.28 Mg h/MJ/mm and LS factor ranges between 0 and 44.62. NDVI derived crop management factor ranges between 0 and 1.7. Conservation practice factor values ranged from 0.004 to 1. The annual soil loss was modeled using different factors of RULSE model and soil loss was predicted (1.38-59.05 ton per hectare). Keeping threshold value of soil erosion (<10 ton per hectare) in account, most part of the study area is suitable for agriculture practices however, emphasis on suitable soil and water conservation measures are perquisite for sustainable environment management.","{""Bordoloi, Reetashree"",""Das, Biswajit"",""Pandey, Pankaj K."",""Paul, Ashish"",""Tripathi, Om Prakash""}",das_soilerosionriskassessment_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Performance Of Fire Danger Indices And Their Utility In Predicting Future Wildfire Danger Over The Conterminous United States,"Predicting current and future wildfire frequency and size is central to wildfire control and management. Multiple fire danger indices (FDIs) that incorporate weather and fuel conditions have been developed and utilized to support wildfire predictions and risk assessment. However, the scale-dependent performance of individual FDIs remains poorly understood, which leads to large uncertainty in the estimated fire sizes under climate change. Here, we calculate four commonly used FDIs over the conterminous United States using high-resolution (4 km) climate and fuel data sets for the 1984-2019 period. The relationships of these four FDIs to the observed wildfire sizes show that higher values of FDIs correlate to larger total fire sizes; this correlation is more robust at larger spatial scales. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the daily minimum relative humidity and precipitation are the most important drivers of the annual mean fire danger. In the instances of extreme fire danger, wind speed becomes a critical factor and should be considered in the calculation of the FDI. To assess the impact of climate change on future fire size, we calculate the present-day and end-of-century FDIs using the 12 km regional climate model simulations. The four FDIs generally predict consistent changes in future fire potential, suggesting an overall higher fire potential in conjunction with a prolonged wildfire season in future climate. Regionally, the four FDIs also reveal similar seasonal patterns as the enhancement arises mostly in spring and summer over the southwest US while in summer and fall over the northern and eastern US.","{""Feng, Yan"",""Wang, Jiali"",""Wright, Daniel B."",""Yu, Guo""}",yu_performancefiredangerindices_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Time Ring Data: Definition And Application In Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Urban Expansion And Forest Loss,"Remote sensing can provide spatio-temporal continuous Earth observation data and is becoming the main data source for spatial and temporal analysis. Remote sensing data have been widely used in applications such as meteorological monitoring, forest investigation, environmental health, urban planning, and water conservancy. While long-time-series remote sensing data are used for spatio-temporal analysis, this analysis is usually limited because of the large data volumes and complex models used. This study intends to develop an innovative and simple approach to reveal the spatio-temporal characteristics of geographic features from the perspective of remote sensing data themselves. We defined an efficient remote sensing data structure, namely time ring (TR) data, to depict the spatio-temporal dynamics of two common geographic features. One is spatially expansive features. Taking nighttime light (NTL) as an example, we generated a NTL TR map to exhibit urban expansion with spatial and temporal information. The speed and acceleration maps of NTL TR data indicated extraordinary expansion in the last 10 years, especially in coastal cities and provincial capitals. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province, Shandong Province, and Jiangsu Province exhibited fast acceleration of urbanization. The other is spatially contractive features. We took forest loss in the Amazon basin as an example and produced a forest cover TR map. The speed and acceleration were mapped in two 10-year periods (2000-2010 and 2010-2020) in order to observe the changes in Amazon forest cover. Then, combining cropland TR data, we determined the consistency of the spatio-temporal variations and used a linear regression model to detect the association between the acceleration of cropland and forest. The forest TR map showed that, spatially, there was an apparent phenomenon of forest loss occurring in the southern and eastern Amazon basin. Temporally, the speed of forest loss was more drastic between 2000 and 2010 than that in 2010-2020. In addition, the acceleration of forest loss showed a dispersed distribution, except for in Bolivia, which demonstrated a concentrated regional acceleration. The R-squared value of the linear regression between forest and cropland acceleration reached 0.75, indicating that forest loss was closely linked to the expansion of cropland. The TR data defined in this study not only optimized the use of remote sensing data, but also facilitated their application in spatio-temporal integrative analysis. More importantly, multi-field TR data could be jointly applied to explore the driving force at spatial and temporal scales.","{""Bao, Haijun"",""Li, Xinhu"",""Liu, Xin""}",liu_timeringdatadefinition_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Current Barriers And Factors Of Success In The Diffusion Of Satellite Services In Europe,"Satellite services benefit civil society by helping tackle challenges such as climate change, the digital divide, etc. They have the potential to deliver concrete benefits to European society through innovative services supporting economic, societal and environmental policies. Such benefits can trigger increased public support for space in Europe. However, this potential has yet to be achieved. This paper argues that technological bias, the diversity of interests and initiatives among stakeholders and their individual actions do not always serve their collective objective to ensure wide diffusion of satellite services. It draws on theories of diffusion of innovation and on its authors' participatory work with the space and the user communities and at their interface in an effort to help diffuse satellite services within civil society. One of the major causes of insufficient service diffusion is the weakness of the interface between the space and user communities; some of factors that currently contribute to this state of affairs are the space community's over-reliance on publicly financed, technical demonstration projects as solutions to service diffusion; insufficient coordination by public authorities of innovation policies and programmes with other public policies and objectives; and an insufficient integration of satellite services within users' culture, traditional tools and services. The discussion allows for conclusions to be drawn on how the system of stakeholders could function better in order for satellite services to be successfully diffused in Europe.

The Smart Grid - State-Of-The-Art And Future Trends,"This paper introduces Smart Grid and associated technical, environmental and socio-economic, and other non-tangible benefits to society, and articulates the need for the concept and the fact that it is a dynamic interactive, real-time infrastructure that responds to the challenges of designing and building the power system of the future, rather than being simply a marketing term. To illustrate the diversity of terminology, the paper compares an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) definition with that suggested by a study group of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Next, a paper sponsored by the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) that cites three example definitions to highlight the diversity of views of Smart Grid is briefly reviewed. Early misconceptions and characterizations of Smart Grid are discussed as a prelude to addressing challenging issues that motivate developing and implementing related innovative technologies, products and services. The paper then discusses the potential promise of the Smart Grid, which is embedded in its often-cited attributes of efficiency, accommodating, quality focus, enabling and self-healing to name some. The paper then addresses some of the often-cited impediments to accepting Smart Grid which are based on concerns and issues confronting its forward progress, adoption and acceptance. Distribution Automation (DA) and embedded intelligence are discussed emphasising self-healing, optimizing operation and facilitating recreation and recovery from abnormal events. Functional and integration requirements of Distributed Energy Resources (DER,) are detailed. Smart Consumption Infrastructure elements of Distribution Management Systems (DMS,) Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI,) Smart Homes (SH), and Smart Appliances (SA,) are discussed. Following the introductory section, this paper summarizes contributions included in the double issue 42(3-4) of the Electric Power Components and Systems Journal. To begin, papers are offered discussing smart grid activities in China, India, and the development of a Smart Grid roadmap for the US State of Kentucky. The approaches of each of these cases reflect the diversity of policy initiatives in these jurisdictions. Two state of the art reviews are given next. The first considers distribution network active management and future development trends in technologies and methods, where centralized and decentralized management frameworks and applying agent-based coordination are discussed. The second offers a review of smart home technologies and the goals of an energy management system (SHEMS). This section is concluded by a letter providing an overview of recent and expected advances nanotechnology applications in Smart Grid. Following the state of the art review section, ten papers offering new and innovative research approaches and results are included. These papers cover Smart Grid topics such as real-time energy control approach for smart home energy management systems, optimal operation of energy- efficient buildings with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, energy management and control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, voltage-frequency control of a voltage source inverter (VSI) in a smart islanded microgrid, smart generation scheduling for wind-thermal-pumped storage systems, optimized power system restoration, robust data transmission upon compressive sensing, data fusion for wide-area oscillation monitoring, satellite based GPS synchronized monitoring systems, stability in Smart Grid with emerging renewable energy techno- logies.

Integration Of Remotely Sensed And Model Data To Provide The Spatial Information Basis For Sustainable Landuse,"Sustainable development is by now generally accepted as the paramount objective of environmental policy. Environmental applications of Earth observation, on the other hand, have been successfully demonstrated over a wide range of monitoring activities, mostly with the aim of describing the spatial distribution and time course of geophysical parameters and land surface structures. With landuse structures being of major influence on the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems, and being also a highly suitable object of Earth observation, it is still an open question, however, in which way Earth observation data can be processed and integrated to provide an approximate indicator of sustainability. Based on an ecological sustainability model developed by Ripl and his co-workers at Berlin Technical University, this question was investigated in the framework of the joint project ""Development of a Land-Water-Management Concept to Decrease Matter Losses to Open Waters"" (Stor project), which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology. Present results may be summarized as follows: 1. Apart from hydrological point measurements, there are several spatial parameters which are of indicative value as to sustainability, especially the spatio-temporal distribution of biomass, surface temperature, and precipitation. 2. To provide the spatial information basis for enhanced efficiency of immediate measures such as reforestation, agricultural extension etc., a global information system (GIS) concept was developed and demonstrated which is based on a landuse/vegetation classification derived from Landsat TM data, a digital evaluation mode (DEM) and a relief dependent water distribution model (WDM). Further implications such as the organisation of information systems which are to serve sustainability strategies are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Rapid Eco-Physical Impact Assessment Of Tropical Cyclones Using Geospatial Technology: A Case From Severe Cyclonic Storms Amphan,"The tropical cyclones are very destructive during landfall, generating high wind speeds, heavy intensive rainfall, and severe storm surges with huge coastal inundations that have massive socioeconomic and ecological catastrophic effects on human beings and the economic well-being. The sizable ecological effects of cyclonic storms cannot be ignored because of the uncertainty of impact, intensity induced by a warming ocean, and sea level rise. The Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan which falls under the category five classifications under the scheme of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), on the basis the maximum sustained wind speeds gusting up to 168 km/h affected parts of West Bengal and Odisha in India, and south-west Bangladesh between May 16 and 20, 2020. In this work, we have focused on the coastal districts of Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore in Odisha, Purba Medinipur, and South Twenty-Four Parganas in West Bengal, India and, Khulna, Barisal division of Bangladesh that have been seriously affected by the Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan. The objective of the study is to analyze the eco-physical assessment of tropical cyclone Amphan using geospatial technology. Therefore, shoreline change detection and enhance vegetation index have been used in this research work to systematically analyze the eco-physical impact parameters of Cyclonic Storm Amphan using ortho-rectified Landsat 8/OLI imagery and MODIS dataset of USGS with high spatial resolutions of 30-500 m. The result highlights that about 60.33\% of the total transects of the study area was eroded, but only 24.99\% of the total transects experienced accretion, and 14.68\% of the total transects depicted stability. The scientific study will benefit coastal managers and policymakers in formulating action plans for coastal zone management, natural resilience, and sustainable future development.","{""Debnath, Manasi"",""Goswami, Shreerup"",""Kar, Dipika"",""Mishra, Manoranjan"",""Sahu, Netrananda""}",mishra_rapidecophysicalimpact_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
A Robust Stochastic Approach In Correcting The Trmm Precipitation Product And Simulating Flood Features,"Logical management and decision-making on water resources require reliable weather variables, where precipitation is considered the main weather variable. Accurate estimation of precipitation is the most important topic in hydrological studies. Due to the lack of a dense network and low temporal and spatial resolution levels at ground-level rain gauges, especially in developing countries, remote sensing methods have been used widely. In recent years, a combination of satellite-ground data on precipitation has led to a more accurate insight into precipitation and improved hydrological model performance. In this study, the Kosar Dam Basin in the Khuzestan province of Iran is selected as the research zone. The TRMM satellite data is used on 50 events to analyze the satellite precipitation data. Copula theory is then employed to check the uncertainties of precipitation estimation, and new precipitations are generated through original data and bias errors. A comparison of the results of the improved TRMM, which was bias-corrected by Gaussian copula, and ground-based rainfall demonstrated the efficacy of this method, with nearly 104\% and 51\% improvement in the CC and RMSE performance indicators, respectively. The HEC-HMS model was used to simulate flood features based on copula-corrected precipitation over different quartiles (10\%, 30\%, 50\%, 70\%, and 90\%) and rainfall duration (3, 6, 9, and 24 h). The obtained R-factor values show that the associated uncertainty decreases with rainfall duration, down to 46 and 20\% for discharge peak and volume, respectively. In general, the copula approach is a robust approach to improve the accuracy of the TRMM precipitation product for simulating hydrological processes.","{""Asadollah, Seyed Babak Haji Seyed"",""Hemmati, Naeim"",""Neshat, Aminreza"",""Sharafati, Ahmad""}",asadollah_robuststochasticapproachcorrecting_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Identification Of Secondary Functional Areas And Functional Structure Analysis Based On Multisource Geographic Data,"Obtaining high-precision information on functional areas is very important in urban spatial management. It has become common to integrate social perception data and high-resolution remote sensing images to identify functional areas. Based on Point of Interest (POI) data, a scoring evaluation model is constructed to identify functional zones in built-up areas. Two weight values in the model, the POI area weight and normalized kernel density value, are used in the calculation of the impact score. Functional areas are identified by the proportion of the influence score associated with each function type. The information corresponding to 10 first-level and 29 s-level functional areas is obtained by integrating the classification results for natural attributes in high-resolution images and the social attribute functional areas in the scoring evaluation model. The overall accuracy is 87.2\%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.86. The spatial structure characteristics of functional areas are analyzed based on spatial syntax, the location entropy index and so on. The main functions of each street core area and high-selectivity area are consistent with the function types, are associated with high location entropy index values and coincide with distribution centres with various functions. This study is conducive to enhancing urban spatial planning, management and decision support.","{""Feng, Pengfei"",""Jia, Feixue"",""Su, Fenzhen"",""Wang, Jing"",""Wang, Ninghao"",""Yan, Jinfeng""}",yan_identificationsecondaryfunctionalfunctional_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Dynamic Monitoring Of Environmental Quality In The Loess Plateau From 2000 To 2020 Using The Google Earth Engine Platform And The Remote Sensing Ecological Index,"The Loess Plateau is a typical ecologically sensitive area that can easily be perturbed by the effects of human activities and global climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to monitor the environmental quality in the LP quickly and accurately. To reveal the spatio-temporal changes in environmental quality in the LP from 2000 to 2020, we used the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products on the Google Earth Engine platform and constructed the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) through principal component analysis (PCA). Then, Sen-Mann-Kendall methods were applied to determine the changing trend of the environmental quality of the LP. Finally, natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the environmental quality were probed using a geographical detector model. The results showed that: (1) the average RSEI values in 2000, 2010 and 2020 were 0.396, 0.468 and 0.511, respectively, displaying an upward trend from 2000 to 2020, with a growth rate of 0.005 year(-1). The overall environment quality was moderate (0.4-0.6). (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the environmental quality was excellent in the southeast and poor in the northwest of the LP. The areas with improved environmental quality (84.51\%) were located in all the counties, whereas the areas with degraded environmental quality (8.11\%) occurred in the north and southeast of the study area. (3) Greenness, heat, wetness, dryness and land use types were prominent factors affecting RSEI throughout the study period; additionally, the total industrial gross domestic product showed a growing influence. The contribution of multi-factor interaction was stronger than that of single factors. The results will provide a reference and a new research perspective for local environmental protection and regional planning.","{""Gao, Meiling"",""Gong, Enjun"",""Hu, Haitang"",""Li, Zhenhong"",""Long, Huiling"",""Yang, Guijun"",""Yang, Liping"",""Yu, Chen"",""Zhang, Jing""}",zhang_dynamicmonitoringenvironmentalquality_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
A New Dynamic Approach For Statistical Optimization Of Gnss Radio Occultation Bending Angles For Optimal Climate Monitoring Utility,"Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based radio occultation (RO) is a satellite remote sensing technique providing accurate profiles of the Earth's atmosphere for weather and climate applications. Above about 30 km altitude, however, statistical optimization is a critical process for initializing the RO bending angles in order to optimize the climate monitoring utility of the retrieved atmospheric profiles. Here we introduce an advanced dynamic statistical optimization algorithm, which uses bending angles from multiple days of European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) short-range forecast and analysis fields, together with averaged-observed bending angles, to obtain background profiles and associated error covariance matrices with geographically varying background uncertainty estimates on a daily updated basis. The new algorithm is evaluated against the existing Wegener Center Occultation Processing System version 5.4 (OPSv5.4) algorithm, using several days of simulated MetOp and observed CHAMP and COSMIC data, for January and July conditions. We find the following for the new method's performance compared to OPSv5.4: 1.) it significantly reduces random errors (standard deviations), down to about half their size, and leaves less or about equal residual systematic errors (biases) in the optimized bending angles; 2.) the dynamic (daily) estimate of the background error correlation matrix alone already improves the optimized bending angles; 3.) the subsequently retrieved refractivity profiles and atmospheric (temperature) profiles benefit by improved error characteristics, especially above about 30 km. Based on these encouraging results, we work to employ similar dynamic error covariance estimation also for the observed bending angles and to apply the method to full months and subsequently to entire climate data records.

Domain Recognition For Land Use Spatial Fractal Feature Based On Genetic Algorithm,"The spatial pattern of land use is one of the most profound human-induced alterations to the Earth's surface. Its change can lead to severe problems in urban ecological environments, such as heavy traffic, the heat island effect, and the spread of epidemics. An accurate examination of urban land use characteristics is helpful both in understanding quantitatively and comprehensively urban land use spatial patterns, and in discovering the potential rules of urban land use change. Because of its advantages in describing randomness and self-similarity, the fractal dimension has been used widely to analyze spatial patterns, and great achievements have been made in recent decades. However, the scale domain is largely ignored when the value of the fractal dimension is used to explain spatial patterns. To some extent, this leads inevitably to analysis uncertainty, because the spatial self-similarity characteristics of land use exist within a specific scale range rather than across a geographic scale range. Hence, the identification of the scale domain related to the fractal dimension is more important than the computation itself. In addressing this problem, this paper presents a model for scale domain recognition, based on a genetic algorithm, to provide a meaningful range of fractal features existing in nature. Its objective function is to minimize the average from the sum of squared residuals that is derived from the result of the fitting of a scale-free region using discrete points. It can improve the computation accuracy of the fractal dimension significantly. Because of its abundant water resources, this study took the scale domain of the water fractal feature in Wuchang district as an example. A cloud-free image obtained by the Quickbird satellite, was classified and used to extract land use information by using a combination of the decision tree method and supervised classification. A general framework and three genetic operators for the scale domain recognition of the land use spatial fractal feature were designed to identify the scale domain of the radius of the fractal dimension for water. To validate our model, its results were compared with three other methods used commonly for scale domain recognition: the artificial judgment method, the correlation coefficient method, and the strengthening coefficient method. The results indicate that different scale-less bands are derived by the four methods of scale domain identification. The scale-less band of the correlation coefficient method is significantly wider than that obtained by using the other three models. This results in a relatively small determination coefficient, indicating low accuracy. The genetic algorithm has the narrowest scale-less band and the best degree of statistical fitness of the four methods. Based on standard deviation, the four models can be ranked in the following descending order: the artificial judgment method (0.22), the correlation coefficient method (0.16), the strengthening coefficient method (0.13), and the genetic algorithm (0.08). Accordingly, the radius of the fractal dimension of water changes with the different scale-less bands derived from these four methods. The radius dimension derived from the genetic algorithm is 1.285, which suggests that the trend of the spatial distribution characteristics becomes gradually weaker moving from the center to the surroundings. This agrees with the spatial distribution of water information derived from the satellite image of Wuchang district. It reveals that it is critically important and imperative to promote the genetic algorithm for accurate identification of the scale domain of the fractal dimension. These findings are helpful for urban management departments in determining land use change, but also they provide a scientific reference for urban land use planning to ensure that land resources are used effectively.","{""Chen, X.

"Ecosystem Service Loss In Response To Agricultural Expansion In The Small Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China: Process, Driver And Management","Converting natural ecosystems to cultivated land, driven by human activities, has been considered a significant driver of limiting the delivery of ecosystem services (ES). The ES loss in the past was mainly caused by agricultural activities that have been taken to meet people's needs in Northeast China. Quantifying historical declining ecosystem service values is essential to facilitate sustainable development. In this study, remote sensing images were used to investigate the history of cultivated land expansion over the last five decades. Additionally, ES variations caused by agricultural expansion since 1965 were quantified in the Small Sanjiang Plain (SSP), Northeast China. From the results, cultivated land expanded from 3.97\% of the total SSP area to 66.40\% from 1965 to 2015 (approximately 898.23 million ha), of which paddy field expanded drastically from 0\% to 55.93\%. Variations in cultivated land resulted in a loss of ecosystem service values by 11,893.85 million dollars, of which 62.98 million dollars were caused by the internal conversion between cultivation during 1965-2015. Agricultural expansion accelerated the export of agricultural products function, while it decreased almost all other functions, especially hydrological regulation and freshwater supply function. For future sustainability of the SSP, some suggestions, such as restoring natural ecosystems, planting trees between cultivated land, coculture systems, and winter-flooding of paddy rice were provided in our study.","{""Chen, Jing"",""Yan, Fengqin"",""Yu, Lingxue"",""Zhang, Shuwen""}",chen_ecosystemservicelossresponse_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Green Spaces As An Indicator Of Urban Health: Evaluating Its Changes In 28 Mega-Cities,"Urban green spaces can yield considerable health benefits to urban residents. Assessing these health benefits is a key step for managing urban green spaces for human health and wellbeing in cities. In this study, we assessed the change of health benefits generated by urban green spaces in 28 megacities worldwide between 2005 and 2015 by using availability and accessibility as proxy indicators. We first mapped land covers of 28 megacities using 10,823 scenes of Landsat images and a random forest classifier running on Google Earth Engine. We then calculated the availability and accessibility of urban green spaces using the land cover maps and gridded population data. The results showed that the mean availability of urban green spaces in these megacities increased from 27.63% in 2005 to 31.74% in 2015. The mean accessibility of urban green spaces increased from 65.76% in 2005 to 72.86% in 2015. The increased availability and accessibility of urban green spaces in megacities have brought more health benefits to their residents.

Cropwatch Agroclimatic Indicators (Cwais) For Weather Impact Assessment On Global Agriculture,"CropWatch agroclimatic indicators (CWAIs) are a monitoring tool developed by the CropWatch global crop monitoring system in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; www.cropwatch.com.cn, Wu et al Int J Digital Earth 7(2):113-137, 2014, Wu et al Remote Sens 7:3907-3933, 2015). Contrary to most other environmental and agroclimatic indicators, they are ""agronomic value-added"", i.e. they are spatial values averaged over agricultural areas only and they include a weighting that enhances the contribution of the areas with the largest production potential. CWAIs can be computed for any time interval (starting from dekads) and yield one synthetic value per variable over a specific area and time interval, for instance a national annual value. Therefore, they are very compatible with socio-economic and other variables that are usually reported at regular time intervals over administrative units, such as national environmental or agricultural statistics. Two of the CWAIs are satellite-based (RAIN and Photosynthetically Active radiation, PAR) while the third is ground based (TEMP, air temperature); capitals are used when specifically referring to CWAIs rather than the climate variables in general. The paper first provides an overview of some common agroclimatic indicators, describing their procedural, systemic and normative features in subsequent sections, following the terminology of Binder et al Environ Impact Assess Rev 30:71-81 (2010). The discussion focuses on the systemic and normative aspects: the CWAIs are assessed in terms of their coherent description of the agroclimatic crop environment, at different spatial scales (systemic). The final section shows that the CWAIs retain key statistical properties of the underlying climate variables and that they can be compared to a reference value and used as monitoring and early warning variables (normative).","{""Chen, Bo"",""Feng, Xueliang"",""Gommes, Rene"",""Li, Zhongyuan"",""Wu, Bingfang"",""Zeng, Hongwei"",""Zhang, Ning""}",gommes_cropwatchagroclimaticindicatorscwais_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

Ningbo Atmospheric Environment Analysis And Regulating Countermeasure Based On Urban Climatic Map,"Rapid urbanization has changed the urban climate and environment. As a result, many climatic and environmental problems have emerged. Valid urban climatic environment analysis and regulating countermeasures are required in order to cope with and mitigate these issues. An urban climatic map provides important guidance for the planning and regulation of the urban climatic environment. Based on a traditional urban climatic map, this research proposes a new method of building an urban climatic map that considers all seasons and multiple environmental elements. The urban area in Ningbo City, with its complicated underlying surfaces and obvious seasonal climate characteristics, was used as a case study. The technical means, including remote-sensing inversion, spatial analysis of geographical information system (GIS), and mesoscale numerical model simulation, were comprehensively applied to conduct a multi-season analysis and evaluation of the urban thermal load, air pollution, ventilation potential, wind field, and overall urban climatic environment. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the urban thermal load and air pollutants is characterized by significant seasonal and spatial differences in the principal elements of the formation of an urban climatic environment. Ningbo City is affected by both thermal load and air pollution in spring and summer, affected only by air pollution in the winter, and only slightly affected by both thermal load and air pollution in the autumn. The spatial patterns of ventilation potential are similar in all seasons. Remarkable seasonal and spatial differences are presented, as the wind environment is complex and subject to change. By conducting an overall analysis on urban climatic environments, we found that areas with high and middle values of urban climatic environment are mainly distributed in forests, croplands, and water bodies. Areas with a high risk of urban climatic environment are located in the heavy chemical industrial zones along the coast of Beilun District, Zhenhai District, as well as the southern part of Hangzhou Bay. Areas with an intermediate risk of urban climatic environments are found in the regions where large amounts of industrial factories are clustered, such as the eastern Jiangbei District, eastern and western sides of Yinzhou District, Cixi urban area, and northeast part of the Fenghua urban area. Based on the above analysis, the planning schemes of urban ventilation channels and the regulating countermeasures of climatic environments are further proposed. These include two first-class ventilation channels, five second-class ventilation channels, three third-class bidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by land-sea breezes, twelve third-class unidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by land-sea breezes, thirteen third-class unidirectional ventilation channels which are impacted by mountain-valley breezes, and seven types of countermeasures for urban climatic environment regulation. The method of building an urban climatic map considering all seasons and multiple environmental factors raised by this research is applicable to the analysis and evaluation research of the monsoon climate zones with complicated climatic environments. It may also improve urban thermal load and atmospheric environmental quality and ease the problems of urban climatic environments in all seasons. It may do so through ventilation channel planning and formulating and implementing relevant regulatory countermeasures so as to provide support for urban environmental protection, meteorological and planning departments, and promote sustainable urban development and the construction of an ecological city.

A Survey Of Natural Aggregate Properties And Characteristics Important In Remote Sensing And Airborne Geophysics,"Natural aggregate is vital to the construction industry. Although natural aggregate is a high volume/low value commodity that is abundant, new sources are becoming increasingly difficult to find and develop because of rigid industry specifications, political considerations, development and transportation costs, and environmental concerns. There are two primary sources of natural aggregate: (1) exposed or near-surface bedrock that can be crushed, and (2) deposits of sand and gravel. Remote sensing and airborne geophysics detect surface and near-surface phenomena, and may be useful for detecting and mapping potential aggregate sources; however, before a methodology for applying these techniques can be developed, it is necessary to understand the type, distribution, physical properties, and characteristics of natural aggregate deposits. The distribution of potential aggregate sources is closely tied to local geologic history. Conventional exploration for natural aggregate deposits has been largely a ground-based operation, although aerial photographs and topographic maps have been extensively used to target possible deposits. Today, the exploration process also considers factors such as the availability of the land, space and water supply for processing, political and environmental factors, and distance from the market; exploration and planning cannot be separated. There are many physical properties and characteristics by which to judge aggregate material for specific applications; most of these properties and characteristics pertain only to individual aggregate particles. The application of remote sensing and airborne geophysical measurements to detecting and mapping potential aggregate sources, however, is based on intrinsic bulk physical properties and extrinsic characteristics of the deposits that can be directly measured, mathematically derived from measurement, or interpreted with remote sensing and geophysical data.

"The Livable Urban Landscape: Gis And Remote Sensing Extracted Land Use Assessment For Urban Livability In Changchun Proper, China","Despite the popularity of the term urban livability, it is often used by different groups under different circumstances. A broader understanding of urban livability is that it concerns the quality of life in any human living environment. The World Health Organization, among many others, suggests a four-dimension assessment system based on the concepts of convenience, amenity, health and safety that can be used to evaluate any cities' potential livability. Following this proposal, the current study taps into the power of GIS and Remote Sensing technologies to generate a set of urban livability evaluating indicators via extracted land use information. Using the city proper of Changchun, Jilin Province of China as an example, the study extracts fifteen individual land use indicators from topographic maps and a remote sensing imagery. A principal component analysis-based approach was used to build an urban livability index with the fifteen indicators. Furthermore, with detailed examination of relevant studies, national documents and local fieldwork, this research also establishes potential benchmark values for all fifteen livability evaluating indicators for comparison purposes. Results suggest that slightly more than half of Changchun's city proper is above the livability benchmark in the framework of the current study. Residents' access to parks and open spaces is a major lagging factor for the city proper's livability. The study provides an alternative of quantifiable and verifiable approach for sustainable urban planning, especially from a land use policy perspective.","{""Fu Bo"",""Yu Danlin"",""Zhang Yaojun""}",fuboandyudanlinandzhangyaojun_livableurbanlandscapegis_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Classification Of Hurricane Hazards: The Importance Of Rainfall,"A new hazard index is presented to estimate and rank hurricane severity according to a storm's damage and death toll after landfall on the continental United States. The index uses three characteristic meteorological aspects of hurricanes: wind, torrential rainfall, and storm surge, each with an individual subindex. Rainfall is identified as an important and frequently dominant hazard in terms of damage and death toll, but is not included in any current hazard scales or indices. The new rainfall subindex adopts rainfall intensity, stormrainfall area, and the forward speed of the system to estimate the rainfall hazard. The new hazard index, applied to recent U.S. hurricanes (2003-12), has better skill than existing scales in terms of ranking the severity of the events by both damage and death toll. Further, the index can provide good quantitative estimates of dollar values for damage and death toll, whereas previous models provide only a scale or ranking.

Impacts Of Modern Mechanised Skidding On The Natural And Cultural Heritage Of The Polish Carpathian Mountains,"The aim of the research was to determine the scale and forms of logging road impacts on the natural environment and residual cultural heritage of Ruthenian Highlanders that characterise the Polish part of the north-eastern Carpathians. To this end, we used LiDAR-derived DEM to detect and map forest roads and skid trails, and to estimate road density, in 60 forest divisions sampled at random from among the 2639 km2 of forest managed in the above region by the State Forests National Forest Holding. The determined road network was then validated by GPS ground control. Supplementary, detailed LiDAR data were used to detect features of the past cultural landscape, and to determine the interference in that due to contemporary logging roads. Overall skidder traffic was estimated on the basis of a thorough analysis of State Forests documents, including legal acts, guidelines, management plans, detailed databases and maps of planned cuts. LiDAR data proved to be an adequate tool in the mapping of the network of logging roads present under the tree canopy, although it slightly underestimates road density in a densely vegetated, post-landslide topography. Our LiDAR-assessed density of Carpathian logging roads (at 108.5â€“140.7 m haâˆ’1, including skid trails) is nevertheless among the highest reported in the literature, and one that far exceeds recommended values. Spatial pattern analysis further revealed the unfavourable phenomenon of multiple parallel roads forming contiguous areas of disturbed soil and constituting dispersal paths for invasive plants. Many examples of cultural remains being run over and destroyed by skidders could also be reported. The observed process of log extraction is one of the least sustainable aspects to forest management in the Carpathians, and our results emphasise very clearly the need for rules to support the preservation of cultural heritage in forested areas, as well as improved tools by which skidding practices can be monitored.

Monitoring Of Nitrogen Concentration In Soybean Leaves At Multiple Spatial Vertical Scales Based On Spectral Parameters,"Nitrogen is a fundamental component for building amino acids and proteins, playing a crucial role in the growth and development of plants. Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) serves as a key indicator for assessing plant growth and development. Monitoring LNC provides insights into the absorption and utilization of nitrogen from the soil, offering valuable information for rational nutrient management. This, in turn, contributes to optimizing nutrient supply, enhancing crop yields, and minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Efficient and non-destructive estimation of crop LNC is of paramount importance for on-field crop management. Spectral technology, with its advantages of repeatability and high-throughput observations, provides a feasible method for obtaining LNC data. This study explores the responsiveness of spectral parameters to soybean LNC at different vertical scales, aiming to refine nitrogen management in soybeans. This research collected hyperspectral reflectance data and LNC data from different leaf layers of soybeans. Three types of spectral parameters, nitrogen-sensitive empirical spectral indices, randomly combined dual-band spectral indices, and ""three-edge"" parameters, were calculated. Four optimal spectral index selection strategies were constructed based on the correlation coefficients between the spectral parameters and LNC for each leaf layer. These strategies included empirical spectral index combinations (Combination 1), randomly combined dual-band spectral index combinations (Combination 2), ""three-edge"" parameter combinations (Combination 3), and a mixed combination (Combination 4). Subsequently, these four combinations were used as input variables to build LNC estimation models for soybeans at different vertical scales using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The results demonstrated that the correlation coefficients between the LNC and spectral parameters reached the highest values in the upper soybean leaves, with most parameters showing significant correlations with the LNC (p < 0.05). Notably, the reciprocal difference index (VI6) exhibited the highest correlation with the upper-layer LNC at 0.732, with a wavelength combination of 841 nm and 842 nm. In constructing the LNC estimation models for soybeans at different leaf layers, the accuracy of the models gradually improved with the increasing height of the soybean plants. The upper layer exhibited the best estimation performance, with a validation set coefficient of determination (R-2) that was higher by 9.9\% to 16.0\% compared to other layers. RF demonstrated the highest accuracy in estimating the upper-layer LNC, with a validation set R2 higher by 6.2\% to 8.8\% compared to other models. The RMSE was lower by 2.1\% to 7.0\%, and the MRE was lower by 4.7\% to 5.6\% compared to other models. Among different input combinations, Combination 4 achieved the highest accuracy, with a validation set R-2 higher by 2.3\% to 13.7\%. In conclusion, by employing Combination 4 as the input, the RF model achieved the optimal estimation results for the upper-layer LNC, with a validation set R-2 of 0.856, RMSE of 0.551, and MRE of 10.405\%. The findings of this study provide technical support for remote sensing monitoring of soybean LNCs at different spatial scales.","{""Chen, Guofu"",""Cui, Shihao"",""Li, Zhijun"",""Limami, Anis"",""Liu, Yuchen"",""Sun, Tao"",""Wang, Zhangkai"",""Xie, Weihao"",""Yang, Wanli"",""Zhang, Fucang"",""Zhang, Zhitao"",""Zhao, Yizheng"",""Zhu, Zhiheng""}",sun_monitoringnitrogenconcentrationsoybean_2024,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Changemask: Deep Multi-Task Encoder-Transformer-Decoder Architecture For Semantic Change Detection,"Multi-temporal high spatial resolution earth observation makes it possible to detect complex urban land surface changes, which is a significant and challenging task in remote sensing communities. Previous works mainly focus on binary change detection (BCD) based on modern technologies, e.g., deep fully convolutional network (FCN), whereas the deep network architecture for semantic change detection (SCD) is insufficiently explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task encoder-transformer-decoder architecture (ChangeMask) designed by exploring two important inductive biases: sematic-change causal relationship and temporal symmetry. ChangeMask decouples the SCD into a temporal-wise semantic segmentation and a BCD, and then integrates these two tasks into a general encoder-transformer-decoder framework. In the encoder part, we design a semantic-aware encoder to model the semantic-change causal relationship. This encoder is only used to learn semantic representation and then learn change representation from semantic representation via a later transformer module. In this way, change representation can constrain semantic representation during training, which introduces a regularization to reduce the risk of overfitting. To learn a robust change representation from semantic representation, we propose a temporal-symmetric transformer (TST) to guarantee temporal symmetry for change representation and keep it discriminative. Based on the above semantic representation and change representation, we adopt simple multi-task decoders to output semantic change map. Benefiting from the differentiable building blocks, ChangeMask can be trained by a multi-task loss function, which significantly simplifies the whole pipeline of applying ChangeMask. The comprehensive experimental results on two large-scale SCD datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of ChangeMask in SCD. Besides, to demonstrate the potential value in real-world applications, e.g., automatic urban analysis and decision-making, we deploy the ChangeMask to map a large geographic area covering 30 km2 with 300 million pixels.

Mapping River Bathymetry With A Small Footprint Green Lidar: Applications And Challenges,"Airborne bathymetric Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems designed for coastal and marine surveys are increasingly sought after for high-resolution mapping of fluvial systems. To evaluate the potential utility of bathymetric LiDAR for applications of this kind, we compared detailed surveys collected using wading and sonar techniques with measurements from the United States Geological Survey's hybrid topographic/bathymetric Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL). These comparisons, based upon data collected from the Trinity and Klamath Rivers, California, and the Colorado River, Colorado, demonstrated that environmental conditions and postprocessing algorithms can influence the accuracy and utility of these surveys and must be given consideration. These factors can lead to mapping errors that can have a direct bearing on derivative analyses such as hydraulic modeling and habitat assessment. We discuss the water and substrate characteristics of the sites, compare the conventional and remotely sensed river-bed topographies, and investigate the laser waveforms reflected from submerged targets to provide an evaluation as to the suitability and accuracy of the EAARL system and associated processing algorithms for riverine mapping applications.

"Spatiotemporal Patterns Of Ecosystem Service Value Changes And Their Coordination With Economic Development: A Case Study Of The Yellow River Basin, China","By integrating multiple remote sensing data sources this study accurately assesses the spatiotemporal characteristics of changes in ecosystem service values (ESVs) in the Yellow River Basin from 2000 to 2015 through Theil-Sen median trend analysis and the Mann-Kendall test. The stability and continuity of the ESVs were comprehensively characterized using coefficients of variation and the Hurst exponent. The degree of coherence between ESVs and economic growth (represented by gross domestic product GDP) on the same temporal and spatial scales was analyzed using ecological-economic coordination (EEC) models. The results show that (1) from 2001 to 2015 the total ESV and the ESV per unit area in the Yellow River Basin generally showed a U-shaped pattern (decreasing slightly then increasing rapidly). (2) The areas with increasing ESVs made up approximately 55.6% of the total area of the river basin. The areas with a decreasing pattern were mainly in the west and north of the Yellow River Basin. (3) The stability and continuity of the ESVs showed a clustered, compact distribution. (4) The most common level of EEC was slightly uncoordinated followed by slightly coordinated and highly coordinated. The proportion of coordinated areas was relatively higher in cultivated land and the lowest in built-up land. Â© 2020 by the authors.

Evaluation Of A Ubiquitous And Interoperable Computerised System For Remote Monitoring Of Ambulatory Post-Operative Pain: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: For economic reasons, i.e., to reduce costs of in-hospital patient accommodations, constant pressure has been applied in recent years to increase the percentage of ambulatory surgeries. Effective control of post-operative pain after ambulatory surgery is challenging to all health professionals. Computerised systems are being implemented more frequently for remote patient monitoring, including during the at-home post-operative period. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of delivering a computerised system, developed in-house, for remote pain monitoring. It evaluates the user-friendliness of the system and the extent of patient compliance. Finally, a comparative assessment of the system is made with respect to the quality of pain treatment in ambulatory surgery. METHODS: The participants included 32 adults, aged 18-75, randomly assigned to a control group or to a computerised treatment group. The primary treatment outcome was measured by pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) reported several times per day during a five-day monitoring period, using an electronic pain diary combined with a web-based personal health record. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated the feasibility and suitability of the proposed system for pain management. Its handling was user-friendly, without requiring advanced skill or prior experience. In addition, the results showed that the guidance of health care professionals is essential to patients' satisfaction and positive experience with the system. There were no significant group differences with respect to improvements in the quality of pain treatment; however, this can be explained by the low pain scores registered in both groups, related to the type of surgical interventions recruited and the degrees of pain that are easily treated. To evaluate the benefits from a patient-centred perspective, studies of major ambulatory surgeries or of patients in chronic pain, including oncologic and non-oncologic pain resistant to treatment, are necessary.

Forest Fire Monitoring Using Airborne Optical Full Spectrum Remote Sensing Data,"Forest fire is one of the major forest disturbances, which directly affects forest ecosystem structure, carbon cycle, even global climate change. In recent years, the technical progresses of aerial platforms and onboard sensors have effectively improved the capability of airborne remote sensing to detect and monitor forest fires. As a result, many forest fire applications have been carried out with airborne data, including the forest fuel assessment, evaluation of forest fire potential and prevention, forest fire monitoring and situation evaluation during firefighting, post-fire damage assessment, ecosystem management and restoration. This paper introduces an integrated airborne remote sensing system, i.e., Chinese Academy of Forestry's LiDAR, Thermal, CCD and Hyperspectral (CAF-LiTCHy) airborne observation system. The CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system is equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner, thermal infrared camera, CCD camera and hyperspectral scanner and can obtain the corresponding data, simultaneously. The parameters of these sensors and the data processing scheme were described to show the advanced and scientific nature of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system. Moreover, the detailed ""image - spectral - temperature - height"" information of forest benefits the aforementioned applications. Here, the Xichang '3.30 Forest Fire' in Sichuan Province was selected as a case study to test the capability of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system in post-fire survey and disaster assessment. The burn severity levels can be interpreted from the high spatial resolution CCD image directly. Meanwhile, the LiDAR-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM) shows the different burn severities of the canopy in spatial and vertical structural level. The vegetation indices calculated from hyperspectral image indicate that the pigment content and water content of canopy decrease simultaneously. The thermal information shows a higher temperature in high burn severity areas than other areas due to lots of charcoals from fire. Finally, with the combination of the CCD, CHM, spectral and thermal temperature information, the distribution of burn severity levels of the study area was mapped. The CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system can obtain forest fire information and offer fire-related parameters effectively. The design of CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system is advanced and scientific, and the acquired data are in high resolution, multiple dimensions and good geo-location consistency. The efficiency and stability for airborne data collection provide rapid response for fire events. Furthermore, the CAF-LiTCHy airborne observation system has the potential to provide support for fire prevention, fire risk forecast and early warning, firefighting decision-making, post-fire damage assessment and ecological restoration.

Mapping Spatial Variability Of Foliar Nitrogen In Coffee (Coffea Arabica L.) Plantations With Multispectral Sentinel-2 Msi Data,"Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting factor to coffee development and productivity. Therefore, development of rapid, spatially explicit and temporal remote sensing-based approaches to determine spatial variability of coffee foliar N are imperative for increasing yields, reducing production costs and mitigating environmental impacts associated with excessive N applications. This study sought to assess the value of Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands and vegetation indices in empirical estimation of coffee foliar N content at landscape level. Results showed that coffee foliar N is related to Sentinel-2 MSI B4 (R-2 = 0.32), B6 (R-2 = 0.49), B7 (R-2 = 0.42), B8 (R-2 = 0.57) and B12 (R-2 = 0.24) bands. Vegetation indices were more related to coffee foliar N as shown by the Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index - IRECI (R-2 = 0.66), Relative Normalized Difference Index- RNDVI (R-2 = -0.48), CIREI (R-2 = 0.28), and Normalized Difference Infrared Index - NDII (R-2 = 0.37). These variables were also identified by the random forest variable optimisation as the most valuable in coffee foliar N prediction. Modelling coffee foliar N using vegetation indices produced better accuracy (R-2 = 0.71 with RMSE = 0.27 for all and R-2 = 0.73 with RMSE = 0.25 for optimized variables), compared to using spectral bands (R-2 = 0.57 with RMSE = 0.32 for all and R-2 = 0.58 with RMSE = 0.32 for optimized variables). Combining optimized bands and vegetation indices produced the best results in coffee foliar N modelling (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.23). All the three best performing models (all vegetation indices, optimized vegetation indices and combining optimal bands and optimal vegetation indices) established that 15.2 ha (4.7\%) of the total area under investigation had low foliar N levels (<2.5\%). This study demonstrates the value of Sentinel-2 MSI data, particularly vegetation indices in modelling coffee foliar N at landscape scale.

"Application Of Gis And Remote Sensing In Morphometric Analysis Of River Basin At The South-Western Part Of Great Ganges Delta, Bangladesh","Analysing the morphometric parameters is the most expedient and parsimonious way of representing the hydrologic and physiographic attributes of river basins. The present study attempts to measure the morphometric parameters for assessing the understanding of morphological, hydrological, and physiographic properties of the south-western part of the Ganges delta. Parameters were analysed from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission's (SRTM) maps and total of eight linear, six areal, eight relief, and five drainage texture parameters have taken with hypsometric analysis for the four major rivers and two tributary river basins. The values of linear parameter denote that most of the streams (82\%) fall in first order, and other orders have homogeneous underline materials. The aerial parameters represent low peak discharge and the upper region is less vulnerable to flood. The relief parameter values show that the entire basin has low surface runoff and they are less erosional (slope < 3.97 degrees). The drainage density indicates the coarser nature and circularity ratio (0.08) represents the elongated shape. The southern portion of the basin has a greater flood potential and hypsometric index (0.49) shows the entire basin is in mature stage of formation. These results would be helpful for reckoning the watersheds for drainage management and environmental planning for ecological management and sustainable development.","{""Amin, F. M.

Accuracy Evaluation Of Et And Its Components From Three Remote Sensing Et Models And One Process Based Hydrological Model Using Ground Measured Eddy Covariance And Sap Flow,"Evapotranspiration (ET) and its components, transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (Es) are crucial to understand hydrological cycle and effective water loss in water resource management. Remote sensing models and process based hydrological models are two kinds of effective methods for evaluating ET and its partitions. Although the ability of remote sensing models to simulate ET has been widely verified, there is limited verification of ET components, especially T, which is the major component of ET. This research used ET obtained from eddy covariance system and T obtained from sap flow observation in an apricot orchard of north China to evaluate the accuracy of ET and its components from three remote sensing models (PT-JPL, PML, and SWH) and a processbased hydrological model (SHAW). The results showed that after calibrations, all the four models satisfactorily simulated total ET particularly at annual level. Among them, the PML model had the best fit efficiency, with the most satisfied R2 and NSE values. The PT-JPL estimated average ET was the most accurate, with the slope nearest to 1.0. While for the simulation of T, SHAW model had a better performance owing to the fact that SHAW model simulate plant transpiration using changes in soil water content. The average T/ET of the models for the growing season was close to the observed value of 0.70, except that the T/ET of SWH is high due to the lack of Ei calculation. Furthermore, nearly all the three remote sensing models underestimated ET in the dry spring and overestimated ET in the rainy summer. In comparison with the process-based SHAW model, it is suggested that remote sensing ET relies more heavily on the seasonal change of meteorological factors such as precipitation but less capable in reflecting the gradually delaying process of soil moisture in the dry season. Therefore, it is indicated that for future improvement of remote sensing ET models, adjustment of soil water availability in a much longer term is suggested at least for semi-humid and semi-arid ecosystems.","{""Han, Shumin"",""Hao, Xiaohua"",""Li, Huilong"",""Li, Xiaojin"",""Yang, Yanmin"",""Yang, Yonghui"",""Zhou, Xinyao""}",li_accuracyevaluationcomponentsremote_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Humans Alter Habitat Selection Of Birds On Ocean-Exposed Sandy Beaches,"Aim Resource-selection functions (RSFs) can quantify and predict the density of animal populations across heterogeneous landscapes and are important conservation tools in areas subject to human disturbance. Sandy beach ecosystems have comparatively low habitat heterogeneity and structural relief in the intertidal zone, but intense human use. We aimed to develop predictive RSFs for birds on ocean-exposed sandy beaches at two spatial scales, 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale), and to test whether habitat selection of birds that commonly use the surfbeachdune interface is influenced by the rates of human activities. Location Moreton and North Stradbroke Island, eastern Australia. Methods Avifauna and human activities were mapped on three sandy beaches covering 79 km of coastline for 15 months. Habitat characteristics of the surfbeach-dune interface were derived from remote sensing and ground surveys. RSFs were developed for 12 species of birds at two spatial scales: 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale). Results At local (25 ha) and landscape scales (250 ha), dune dimensions and the extent and type of vegetation structure were important predictors of bird density. Adding the frequency of human activities improved the predictive power of RSFs, suggesting that habitat selection of birds on beaches is modified by human use of these environments. Human activities occurred mostly in the mid-to lower intertidal zone of the beach, overlapping closely with the preferred habitats of Silver Gulls (Larus novaehollandiae), Pied Oystercatchers (Haematopus longirostris), Red-capped Plovers (Charadrius ruficapillus) and endangered Little Terns (Sternula albifrons). Main conclusions In addition to demonstrating the appropriateness of RSFs to the surf-beach-dune interface, our results stress the need for systematic conservation planning for these ecosystems, where ecological values have traditionally been subsidiary to the maintenance of sand budgets and erosion control.","{""Meager, Justin J."",""Nielsen, Tara"",""Schlacher, Thomas A.""}",meager_humansalterhabitatselection_2012,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Economic Evaluations Of Remote Patient Monitoring For Chronic Disease: A Systematic Review,"Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review and summarize economic evaluations of noninvasive remote patient monitoring (RPM) for chronic diseases compared with usual care. Methods: A systematic literature search identified economic evaluations of RPM for chronic diseases, compared with usual care. Searches of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and EconLit using keyword synonyms for RPM and economics identified articles published from up until September 2021. Title, abstract, and full-text reviews were conducted. Data extraction of study characteristics and health economic findings was performed. Article reporting quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. Results: This review demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of RPM was dependent on clinical context, capital investment, organizational processes, and willingness to pay in each specific setting. RPM was found to be highly cost-effective for hypertension and may be cost-effective for heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There were few studies that investigated RPM for diabetes or other chronic diseases. Studies were of high reporting quality, with an average Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards score of 81%. Of the final 34 included studies, most were conducted from the healthcare system perspective. Eighteen studies used cost-utility analysis, 4 used cost-effectiveness analysis, 2 combined cost-utility analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis, 1 used cost-consequence analysis, 1 used cost-benefit analysis, and 8 used cost-minimization analysis. Conclusions: RPM was highly cost-effective for hypertension and may achieve greater long-term cost savings from the prevention of high-cost health events. For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, cost-effectiveness findings differed according to disease severity and there was limited economic evidence for diabetes interventions.

Changes In Rice Cultivation Affect Population Trends Of Herons And Egrets In Italy,"The breeding populations of colonial herons, egrets and allied waterbirds in Northwestern Italy increased since 1972, when a long-term monitoring was initiated, up to the end of the 20 degrees century. Populations of continental importance for some heron species were concentrated mostly in the district of intensive rice cultivation, where the paddies offered wide foraging opportunities. After 2000, new cultivation techniques caused a progressive reduction in paddy flooding. We found a significant relationship between the post-2000 decrease in the number of nests of the three most abundant species of waterbirds, Grey Heron, Little Egret and Black-crowned Nightheron, and the diminishing extent of paddy flooding estimated on satellite-derived images. On the other hand, outside the paddies district the same three species continued to increase or remained mostly stable. The recent agronomic changes in the paddies of Northwestern Italy compromise their role as surrogates of natural wetlands and their importance for environmental conservation. The spread of dry rice fields, and the consequent loss of their value for conservation of aquatic biodiversity, call for a revision of the regulations and incentives to farmers under the Common Agriculture Policy by the European Union and by local authorities. Return to early-submerged rice fields and adoption of environmental-friendly practices, such as the creation of compensatory wetlands, should become mandatory for rice to maintain its status as ""green"" crop.","{""Boncompagni, Eleonora"",""Cardarelli, Elisa"",""Delle Monache, Daniele"",""Fasola, Mauro"",""Morganti, Michelangelo"",""Pellitteri-Rosa, Daniele"",""Ranghetti, Luigi""}",fasola_ricecultivationaffectpopulation_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Land Use Classification From Social Media Data And Satellite Imagery,"Detailed urban land use classification plays a highly important role in the development and management of cities and in the identification of human activities. The complexity of the urban system makes its functional zoning a challenge, which makes such maps underutilized. A detailed land use classification encompasses both the natural land features and the classification of structures closely related to human activities. The use of satellite imagery to classify land use can effectively benefit the recognition of natural objects, but its performance demands significant improvement in the recognition of social functions due to the lack of information regarding human activities. To identify such activities in an urban area, we added Point of Interests (POI) data. This dataset contains both geographical tags and attributes that describe human activities. However, it has an uneven spatial distribution, with gaps in coverage being readily apparent. This paper proposes a land use classification framework using satellite imagery and data from social media. The proposed method employs a kernel density estimation to handle the spatial unevenness of POI data. The solution of mixed programming of MPI and OpenMP was adopted to parallel the algorithm. The results are compared to data compiled manually by means of human interpretation. Considering the example of Wuhan city, results show that the overall accuracy of land use type classification is 86.2\%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.860. It is demonstrated that using both POI and satellite images, a detailed land use map can be created automatically with satisfactory robustness.","{""An, Ying"",""Chen, Bo"",""Wang, JunJue"",""Ye, Yaqin"",""Zhong, Yingqiang""}",ye_landclassificationsocialmedia_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Retrieving Crop Albedo Based On Radar Sentinel-1 And Random Forest Approach,"Monitoring agricultural crops is of paramount importance for preserving water resources and increasing water efficiency over semi-arid areas. This can be achieved by modelling the water resources all along the growing season through the coupled waterâ€“surface energy balance. Surface albedo is a key land surface variable to constrain the surface radiation budget and hence the coupled waterâ€“surface energy balance. In order to capture the hydric status changes over the growing season, optical remote sensing becomes impractical due to cloud cover in some periods, especially over irrigated winter crops in semi-arid regions. To fill the gap, this paper aims to generate cloudless surface albedo product from Sentinel-1 data that offers a source of high spatio-temporal resolution images. This can help to better capture the vegetation development along the growth season through the surface radiation budget. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was implemented using Sentinel-1 backscatters as input. The approach was tested over an irrigated semi-arid zone in Morocco, which is known by its heterogeneity in term of soil conditions and crop types. The obtained results are evaluated against Landsat-derived albedo with quasi-concurrent Landsat/Sentinel-1 overpasses (up to one day offset), while a further validation was investigated using in situ field scale albedo data. The best model-hyperparameters selection was dependent on two validation approaches (K-fold cross-validation â€˜k = 10â€™, and holdout). The more robust and accurate model parameters are those that represent the best statistical metrics (root mean square error â€˜RMSEâ€™, bias and correlation coefficient â€˜Râ€™). Coefficient values ranging from 0.70 to 0.79 and a RMSE value between 0.0002 and 0.00048 were obtained comparing Landsat and predicted albedo by RF method. The relative error ratio equals 4.5, which is acceptable to predict surface albedo. Â© 2021 by the authors.","{""Amazirh, A."",""Bouras, E. H."",""Chehbouni, A."",""Er-Raki, S."",""Olivera-Guerra, L.

Spectral Diversity Metrics For Detecting Oil Pollution Effect On Biodiversity In The Niger Delta,"Biodiversity monitoring in the Niger delta has become pertinent in view of the incessant spillages from oil production activities and the socio-economic impact of these spillages on the inhabitants who depend on the resources for their livelihood. Conventional methods of post-impact assessments are expensive, time consuming, and cause damage to the environment, as they often require the removal of affected samples/specimens for laboratory analysis. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space while using the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). The SVH proposes that the species diversity of a sampled area is linearly correlated with the variability of spectral reflectance of the area. Several authors have tested the SVH on various land cover types and spatial scales; however, the present study evaluated the validity of the SVH against the backdrop of oil pollution impact on biodiversity while using vascular plant species as surrogates. Species richness and diversity indices were computed from vegetation data collected from polluted and non-polluted transects. Spectral metrics that were derived from Sentinel 2 bands and broadband vegetation indices (BVIs) using various algorithms, including averages, spread, dimension reduction, and so on, were assessed for their ability to estimate vascular plants species richness and diversity. The results showed significant differences in vegetation characteristics of polluted and control transects (H = 76.05, p-value = < 0.05 for abundance and H = 170.03, p-value < 0.05 for richness). Spectral diversity metrics correlated negatively with species data on polluted transects and positively on control transects. The metrics computed using Sentinel 2A bands and vegetation indices proved to be sensitive to changes in vegetation characteristics following oil pollution. The most robust relationship was observed between the metrics and indices on control transects, whereas the weakest relationships were observed on polluted transects. Index-wise, the Simpson's diversity index regressed better with spectral metrics (R2 > 0.5), whereas the Chao-1 richness index regressed the least (R2 < 0.5).

Estimating Impacts Of Plantation Forestry On Plant Biodiversity In Southern Chile-A Spatially Explicit Modelling Approach,"Monitoring the impacts of land-use practices is of particular importance with regard to biodiversity hotspots in developing countries. Here, conserving the high level of unique biodiversity is challenged by limited possibilities for data collection on site. Especially for such scenarios, assisting biodiversity assessments by remote sensing has proven useful. Remote sensing techniques can be applied to interpolate between biodiversity assessments taken in situ. Through this approach, estimates of biodiversity for entire landscapes can be produced, relating land-use intensity to biodiversity conditions. Such maps are a valuable basis for developing biodiversity conservation plans. Several approaches have been published so far to interpolate local biodiversity assessments in remote sensing data. In the following, a new approach is proposed. Instead of inferring biodiversity using environmental variables or the variability of spectral values, a hypothesis-based approach is applied. Empirical knowledge about biodiversity in relation to land-use is formalized and applied as ascription rules for image data. The method is exemplified for a large study site (over 67,000 km(2)) in central Chile, where forest industry heavily impacts plant diversity. The proposed approach yields a coefficient of correlation of 0.73 and produces a convincing estimate of regional biodiversity. The framework is broad enough to be applied to other study sites.","{""Braun, Andreas Christian"",""Koch, Barbara""}",braun_estimatingimpactsplantationforestry_2016,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Land Use And Land Cover Change Dynamics And Perceived Drivers In Rangeland Areas In Central Uganda,"Sustainable rangeland management requires understanding the nature of human-ecosystem interactions and local communities' perspectives regarding evolving changes. This study integrated perceptions from the local community and remote sensing to characterize the extent and drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the rangelands of Nakasongola district in Central Uganda. The aim of the study was to determine the perceived drivers of land use and land cover change in of Nakasongola district in the Central Uganda district to support decision making for present and future rangeland management. Satellite imagery for 1985, 1995, 2005, 2015 and 2021 were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and analyzed to determine the LULC dynamics. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to obtain perceived drivers of LULC. Results showed that by 1985 grassland covered 31.7\%, wetlands 26.4\%, woodland 11.5\% and farmland 7.2\% of the total land area. However, by 2021, farmland covered 35.8\% of the total land area, wetland 21.6\% and had reduced to grassland 18.5 percent. Future LULC projections using a Markov chain model showed that farmland cover will increase by 13.85\% while grassland cover will further decline by 9.89\% in 2040. Wood fuel extraction, subsistence farming, population growth and overgrazing were perceived as key drivers of LULC change. Both remote sensing techniques and local perceptions were in agreement with the identification of patterns and perceived drivers revealing the inherent value of tacit knowledge resident within the community. This knowledge in addition to remotely sensed information can thus be tapped by the decision leaders to better guide interventions aimed at securing better rangeland health and management.","{""Egeru, Anthony"",""Kuule, Derick Ansyijar"",""Magaya, Paul John"",""Mwesigwa, Gordon Yofesi"",""Nyombi, Kenneth"",""Okurut, Isaac Tom"",""Ssentongo, Benard"",""Tabuti, John Robert Stephen""}",kuule_landlandcoverchange_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Spatial And Temporal Analysis Of Fires Detected By Modis Data In Northern Iran From 2001 To 2008,"Fire, a natural disaster, has significant effects on ecosystems and plays a major role in deforestation, and it is a major source of trace gases, aerosols and carbon fluxes. Remote sensing is a valuable data source to investigate different phases of fire management. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been designed to include specific characteristics for fire detection. It provides global coverage every 1 to 2 days. MODIS for forest fire monitoring has high detection accuracy, high radiometric resolution, moderate spatial resolution modes, and a high saturation level. Fires occur repeatedly in Iranian forests during the summer time. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports, 0.06\% of Iran's forests burn every year. Fire season in the northern part of Iran is from May until the end of October. The results show that 86.21\% of the fires detected by MODIS from 2001 to 2008 occurred in cropland, grass land and plain regions. Most of these fires occurred in the eastern regions of the Mazandaran Sea. A correlation of 0.76 exists between the fire frequency and the rainfall. Areas with precipitation lower than 1000 mm experienced 86.01\% of the fires. Most of the fires occurred at elevations below 500 m from mean sea level (MSL). The fire frequency has a correlation of 0.58 with the average monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Temporal analysis from 2001 to 2008 shows that most of the fires occurred in June.","{""Ardakani, Ali S."",""Mansourian, Ali"",""Mohammadzadeh, Ali"",""Zoej, Mohammad J.

Spatio-Temporal Differentiation Of Landscape Pattern Evolution And Its Ecological Security In Karst Areas: A Case Study Of Trough Valley In Northeast Guizhou Province,"Landscape ecological security can reflect the relationship between regional ecological protection and economic development. It is of great significance to understand the pressure on the ecological environment and alleviate the contradiction between human and land. Based on the remote sensing image of 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2017 as the data source combined with field survey to verify the images, we used the ArcGIS and landscape pattern index method to construct landscape ecological security index to analyze the evolution of landscape pattern and the spatio-temporal differentiation laws of ecological security in the trough valley area. Therefore, an environment-friendly land use combination model is proposed. The results were as follows: (1) from 2005 to 2017, the overall landscape pattern of trough valley area presented fragmentation, the number of landscape patches increased, the landscape pattern changed from single regularization and simplification to complex and mixed type, the diversity increased and the spatial heterogeneity enhanced. With the variation of time, the overall landscape ecological security in karst trough valley showed an upward trend,the Ecological Security Index (ESI) of the western and eastern trough valleys increased from the trough basin to the two sides of the hillside, while the middle trough valley increased from the hillside to the trough basin. (2) At a research scale of 200 m,the global positive correlation of ESI in the western trough valleys is the most significant, and its Moran's I value showed a trend of first increased and then decreased,but the middle and eastern troughs were the opposite.The spatial agglomeration pattern of ESI in karst trough valley area was mainly manifested as high-high and low-low value agglomeration areas, and the spatial agglomeration degree was higher, while the distribution of high-low and low-high agglomeration areas was less and its change was not obvious.(3) The landscape agglomeration distribution pattern is influenced by low topographic relief and low slope that presents similar trend of inverted ""U"" shape, while the elevation is opposite. (4) The landscape pattern of karst trough valley area can increase the landscape ecological security by expanding the land use combination pattern of â€œwoodland-shrub woodland-grasslandâ€. (5) The spatio-temporal differentiation of landscape pattern and its ecological security is the result of the joint action of the local natural environment, social economy and policies. We can provide scientific reference for regional scientific decision-making by analyzing the driving mechanism of multiple factors on landscape pattern and ecological security evolution trend of trough valley area.

Massachusetts Roadmap To Net Zero: Accounting For Ownership Of Soil Carbon Regulating Ecosystem Services And Land Conversions,"The state of Massachusetts (MA) has passed comprehensive climate change legislation and a roadmap of achieving Net Zero emissions in 2050, which includes the protection of environmental resources (e.g., soil) and green space across the state. Soil resources are an integral part of the land cover/land use. They can be a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of the conversion of ""low disturbance"" land covers (e.g., evergreen forest, hay/pasture) to ""high disturbance"" land covers (e.g., low-, medium-, and high-intensity developed land). These often ""invisible"" GHG emissions can be considered as ""negative externalities"" and ""external costs"" because of the difficulty in assigning ownership to the emissions. The combination of remote sensing and soil information data analysis can identify the ownership associated with GHG emissions and therefore expand the range of policy tools for addressing these emissions. This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for MA by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. The results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions, which can be linked to ownership. The state of MA can use these remote sensing tools and publicly available data to quantify and value GHG emissions based on property ownership, therefore ""internalizing"" the costs of these emissions for a cost-effective climate mitigation policy.","{""Hao, Zhenbang"",""Lin, Lili"",""Mikhailova, Elena A."",""Post, Christopher J."",""Post, Gregory C."",""Schlautman, Mark A."",""Zurqani, Hamdi A.""}",mikhailova_massachusettsroadmapnetaccounting_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Study On Monitoring Spad Values For Multispatial Spatial Vertical Scales Of Summer Maize Based On Uav Multispectral Remote Sensing,"Rapid acquisition of chlorophyll content in maize leaves is of great significance for timely monitoring of maize plant health and guiding field management. In order to accurately detect the relative chlorophyll content of summer maize and study the responsiveness of vegetation indices to SPAD (soil and plant analyzer development) values of summer maize at different spatial vertical scales, this paper established a prediction model for SPAD values of summer maize leaves at different spatial scales based on UAV multispectral images. The experiment collected multispectral image data from summer maize at the jointing stage and selected eight vegetation indices. By using the sparrow search optimized kernel limit learning machine (SSA-KELM), the prediction models for canopy leaf (CL) SPAD(CL) and ear leaf (EL) SPAD(EL) were established, and a linear fitting analysis was conducted combining the measured SPAD(CL) values and SPAD(EL) values on the ground. The results showed that for SPAD(CL), the R-2 of the linear fitting between the predicted values and measured values was 0.899, and the RMSE was 1.068. For SPAD(EL), the R-2 of linear fitting between the predicted values and the measured values was 0.837, and the RMSE was 0.89. Compared with the model established by the partial least squares method (PLSR), it is found that the sparrow search optimized kernel limit learning machine (SSA-KELM) has more precise prediction results with better stability and adaptability for small sample prediction. The research results can provide technical support for remote sensing monitoring of the chlorophyll content of summer maize at different spatial scales.","{""Cui, Hongwei"",""Ji, Jiangtao"",""Li, Nana"",""Li, Yuchao"",""Ma, Hao"",""Zhang, Haolei"",""Zhao, Xinbo""}",ji_studymonitoringspadvalues_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Introducing A Map Of Soil Base Cation Concentration, An Ecologically Relevant Gis-Layer For Amazonian Forests","Soil maps are crucial for habitat and species distribution modeling under present and future conditions, thereby providing relevant background information for conservation planning. In Amazonia, soil conditions are highly heterogeneous, which has important implications for the distribution and dynamics of the area's exceptional biodiversity. Unfortunately, available soil maps for this region suffer from inaccuracies and lack of ecologically relevant variables. Here, we develop a map of the sum of exchangeable base cation concentration (SB) in the surface soil by applying machine learning to a comprehensive set of over 10,000 field data points of SB values directly measured from soil samples or inferred using indicator plant species occurrences. As predictors, we used rasters of soil type probabilities, elevation, biomass and reflectance values from Landsat satellite images. Random Forest (RF) models were trained and tested using two different cross-validation strategies. We also assessed in which areas the map was more reliable using the area of applicability approach and compared the results with two other soil layers. The best predictors of SB variation were Landsat bands 7, 4 and 3, elevation, and proba-bility of Histosols. The regional patterns observed across Amazonia were consistent with current geological understanding; lower SB values tended to occur in central Amazonian soils and higher values in western Amazonian soils, with considerable variation within each region. The model was found applicable over most of the Amazonian biome, especially in non-inundated (terra-firme) forest, but not over coastal areas, floodplains of major rivers and wetlands, which were poorly represented in the training data. Our new SB map over performed previous SB map and represent an accurate and ecologically meaningful variable. It is available as a digital GIS layer and can be used in habitat mapping and in modeling the current or future distributions of biological communities and species. This will advance general understanding of Amazonian biogeography and help in conservation planning.","{""Chaves, P. P."",""Quesada, C.

Real-Time River Monitoring Supports Community Management Of Low-Flow Periods,"Increasing pressure on river catchment water resources has heightened the need for real-time monitoring data for water management agencies and users. This study investigates the capability to develop a technical basis for water co-management at the catchment scale. A web application (dashboard) was created that displayed real-time data for weather, soil water, river flow and water quality at high spatial and temporal resolutions, including streamflow and rainfall forecasts. A method to predict stream water temperature was developed and tested using an interactive table for visualisation of complex data. The dashboard was used to provide information and alerting to water users in an agricultural catchment, through the Ringarooma Water Users Group (RWUG) in NE Tasmania, Australia. The dashboard was updated several times per day using telemetry and data platform services, and accessed by RWUG members mainly during periods of low flow when water extraction restrictions can be applied. Irrigators gained an improved understanding of streamflow behaviour in response to weather variability, and water extractions and releases, and developed abilities to voluntarily manage the water resource as three sub-groups. The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) collaborated with the RWUG in this adaptive management approach, as enabled by the Ringarooma River Catchment Water Management Plan, and later informed a new Ministerial Policy for â€˜Water Resource Management During Extreme Dry Conditionsâ€™. Group management was assisted by using alerts sent through the existing DPIPWE text messaging service. Results showed that stakeholder understanding of technical information and scenario implications using the sensor-based dashboard increased capacity of irrigators to make decisions that improve production and social outcomes, while considering environmental values. This study demonstrates that the information provided through the dashboard enabled a high level of community and inter-agency co-operation, demonstrating potential to apply this management approach in other catchments.

Prioritization Of Subwatershed Through Morphometric Analysis Of Amaravathi Watershed Using Geoinformatic Techniques,"Prioritization of subwatersheds in a river basin using morphometric parameters is one of the elegant approaches for the development of watersheds and its management. The concept of prioritization plays a key role in identifying areas which require immediate intervention for natural resources conservation plans in the subwatershed level. In this study, an attempt has been made to prioritize subwatershed based on morphometric parameters using remote-sensing and GIS techniques to understand the role of channel network on the geo-hydrological behavior of Amaravathi watershed. This study also describes geology, geomorphology, and soil characteristics of the watershed. The ASTER DEM data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were utilized to prepare thematic maps such as drainage, stream order, watershed, and drainage density map. The drainage morphometric analysis was performed through linear, aerial, and relief aspects. The predominantly dendritic drainage pattern is noticed and Amaravathi watershed, which has been divided into 31 subwatersheds. Prioritization of subwatershed was carried out based on compound parameter analysis by adding the values of linear and shape parameters of each subwatershed. In this study, it is observed that out of 31 subwatersheds, 10 fall in high priority (SWS-1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 21, 23), 10 fall in medium priority (SWS-2, 3, 12, 13, 17, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31), and the remaining 11 fall in low priority (SWS-7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 24, 26, 28, 30). Hence, the high priority subwatersheds are possible for soil erosion. In connection to that, we suggest that the high-priority subwatersheds should take precaution methods to avoid the future hazard.

Procedures Of Soil Farming Allowing Reduction Of Compaction,"Evaluation of new technologies using guidance systems is very important and can help producers with choosing the right equipment for their applications. Without using satellite navigation during field operations, there is a tendency for passes to overlap. That results in waste of fuel and pesticides, longer working times and also environmental damage. When utilising satellite guidance for field operations, there is a close connection with controlled traffic farming (CTF) as well. CTF is currently a quite quickly developing farming system based on fixed layout of machinery passes across a field. Tracks precisely set out for a machine's tyres in the field could be a tool for minimising soil compaction risk which is another threat to the environment. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy of currently available guidance systems for agricultural machines. Real pass-to-pass errors (omissions and overlaps) in a field were measured. Consequently, comparison between observed guidance systems was made regarding final working accuracy. Further, intensity of machinery passes, percentage of wheeled area and repeated passes in fields were monitored. These measurements were made in fields under real operating conditions using a conventional tillage system with ploughing and also a conservation tillage system, both systems with randomly organized traffic. Finally, the same parameters were monitored in fields where fixed machinery tracks were used for all operations and passes but only under a conservation tillage system. Pass-to-pass accuracy was measured for the evaluation of different guidance systems. Size of missed areas or overlaps was evaluated statistically. Concerning intensity of machinery passes and total field area affected by machinery passes, the following facts were found out. The experiments with randomized traffic showed a significant difference of the parameters mentioned above between a conventional tillage system with ploughing and a conservation tillage system. Wheeled area was 86 and 64\%, respectively which proves benefits of conservation tillage. The experiments with a fixed track system showed that the total run-over area by machinery tyres decreased even more (up to 31\%) in comparison to randomized traffic in a field (only fields under conservation tillage system were monitored and evaluated). The following statements based on our results can be made. The navigation and therefore possibility for better accuracy of machinery passes in fields together with permanent machinery tracks utilization could help with soil condition improvement and also energy savings which would result from that. The CTF system will help with further development of a system for soil compaction protection which is currently a real necessity.","{""Hula, J."",""Kroulik, M."",""Kumhala, F."",""Kviz, Z."",""Loch, T.""}",kroulik_proceduressoilfarmingallowing_2011,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Conservation Planning For The Extraordinary And Endangered Spesbona Damselfly,"The damselfly Spesbona angusta is one of the world's rarest insects, is Red Listed as Endangered, and occurs today at only one known locality in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. It has some unusual characteristics, including rapid and reversible colour change in both sexes, and a larva with frilled lamellae that lives in a micro-habitat free of competitors and large anisopteran enemies. We define here the characteristics of its habitat and record some other unusual behavioural traits, including the adult male's ability to sail on the water surface, very strong site selection for oviposition, and female approach to males, all in the context of its conservation. We used satellite imagery to determine the location of habitats within its locality. We further used infrared imagery to identify warmer and cooler habitats within the area. Details of its occurence were mapped, based on observational data acquired throughout the flight season. From this, we were able to establish that its population moves around its locality, and we also establish its environmental requirements for conservation. We also indicate its umbrella value for representing two other threatened odonate species, Endangered Proischnura polychromatica and Vulnerable Syncordulia legator, as well as some other CFR endemic odonates. Conservation of this species requires continual monitoring and removal of invasive alien trees as a priority. Translocation should also be considered as various risks to this one locality are high.

Classification And Density Inversion Of Wetland Vegetation Based On The Feature Variables Optimization Of Random Forest Model,"Taking the coastal wetland of the Yangtze River Estuary as the research area, the random forest model was used to classify the vegetation of wetland. Besides the vegetation index and water index extracted from Landsat-8 OLI image, the seasonal difference value of vegetation index based on plant phenology characteristics was proposed in this paper as the optimization of feature variables to analyze the spatial characteristics of vegetation distribution in the coastal wetland of the Yangtze River Estuary. Bassd on the vegetation classifications, the multiple linear regression model combined with the field data was used to estimate the vegetation density of the Spartina alterniflora, which was an invasive species occupying the largest area. It is indicated that the proposed multi-temporal data combined with the optimization of feature variable of random forest model can be used to conveniently analyze the spatially vegetation distributions in wetland. Compared with the maximum likelihood classification method, the proposed method in this paper greatly enhances the classification accuracy with an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the classification results increasing from 78.35% and 0.72 to 86.02% and 0.82, respectively. The proposed method is proved to be applicable for solving the problem of ""same spectrum for different surface features"" in the study of wetland plant community distributions.

"Linking Landscape Pattern, Ecosystem Service Value, And Human Well-Being In Xishuangbanna, Southwest China: Insights From A Coupling Coordination Model","Landscape pattern, ecosystem service value (ESV), and human well-being are closely related. Determining the link between the three is significant to the realization of regional sustainable development. However, the relationship is complex and vulnerable to multiple factors, many of which remain unknown. This study used remote sensing imagery of Xishuangbanna to map land-use in 1996, 2003, 2010, and 2016 and used landscape metrics to quantify landscape pattern changes. This research evaluated changes to ESV using the benefit transfer method and evaluated changes in human well-being using the evaluation index system and the entropy weight method. A coupling coordination model was used to analyze the coupling coordination state of the three, and the grey correlation method was used to determine key factors involved in the coupling mechanism. The results show that: (1) Forest, rubber, and tea are the main land-use types, with the area of forest decreasing, the area of rubber presenting an inverted V-shape change trend, the area of tea presenting an N-shape change trend, and the transformation of a large quantity of forest land into rubber and tea plantations. (2) The landscape pattern has become more fragmented, and connectivity and stability are in decline. (3) Climate regulation, water regulation, and erosion prevention are the main ecosystem services and, from 1996 to 2016, total ESV decreased by 3.53 billion yuan, mainly due to the decrease in forest ESV. Meanwhile, across the region, the area of high value decreased, and the area of median value increased, with a distribution trend of high value in the north and low value in the south. (4) The level of human well-being continues to rise. (5) The link between landscape pattern, ESV, and human well-being was relatively strong, and the coupling coordination degree first increased and then decreased, changing from grudging coordination to primary coordination and then dropping to a state of near maladjustment. Patch density and food production are the key coupling effect factors of landscape pattern and ESV on human well-being, respectively. The study results provide a reference for regional land-use policy and economic decision-making. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Spatiotemporal Variation Of Ndvi In Anhui Province From 2001 To 2019 And Its Response To Climatic Factors,"This paper intends to clarify that the spatial and temporal evolutionary patterns of regional vegetation and their relationship with climate form a premise of ecological conservation and environmental governance, and play an important role in maintaining regional ecosystem balance and promoting sustainable development. Based on measured data collected from NDVI remote sensing products and meteorological stations, NDVI variation in Anhui Province from 2001 to 2019 was determined through trend analysis and measurement methods involving coefficient of variation and Hurst index; in addition, the response to climatic factors was also explored. It was concluded that, firstly, in terms of spatiotemporal analysis, the interannual variation of NDVI in Anhui Province showed an increasing trend with a rate of 0.024/10 a, while the monthly variation showed a weak bimodal pattern, with the highest value in August and the lowest value in January. Furthermore, NDVI in Anhui Province showed significant spatial heterogeneity, with high values concentrated in mountainous regions in southern Anhui and Dabie Mountain region, and low values concentrated in the hilly areas of Jianghuai and areas along the Yangtze River. At the same time, the overall spatial variation of NDVI showed an increasing trend, and the areas with extremely significant and significant improvement in vegetation coverage accounted for 54.69\% of the total area of Anhui Province. Secondly, in terms of the analysis on variation characteristics, the variation of NDVI in Anhui Province was generally stable, with an average CV coefficient of variation of 0.089, which, however, was quite different in different regions; meanwhile, the future trend of NDVI variation in the study areas was mostly in a random manner. Thirdly, the response of NDVI in Anhui Province to climatic factors showed significant spatial heterogeneity. NDVI was found to be positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature; in general, the impact of precipitation on NDVI was greater than that of temperature. In the 19 years studied, NDVI in Anhui Province showed an increasing trend; and climate, topography and human activities led to heterogeneous spatial distribution of vegetation. Therefore, in the future, the evolutionary trend of vegetation will be relatively random, and NDVI will be more greatly affected by temperature, than by precipitation.","{""Chang, Zhu"",""Chen, Donghua"",""Chen, Jian"",""Han, Weijie"",""Li, Hu"",""Liu, Saisai"",""Wang, Zuo"",""Ye, Lizao""}",han_spatiotemporalvariationndvianhui_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
A Qualitative Study Of Health-Care Personnel's Experience Of A Satellite Pharmacy At A Hiv Clinic,"Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate how health-care personnel at a HIV clinic perceived conventional pharmacies in Sweden and whether the decentralization of pharmaceutical services to the HIV clinic had led to an improved collaboration between other health-care professionals and pharmacists. Methods: Doctors and nurses who had regular contacts with HIV patients and the satellite pharmacy were interviewed. The interviews were semi-structured, using open questions and was analysed according to the phenomenographic approach. Results: The respondents perceived the existing co-work between conventional pharmacies and other health care professionals as limited. The availability of the satellite pharmacy enabled the health care professionals to understand the pharmacys' way of working, and to increase trust in the pharmacy staff. Collaboration was hence developed between the professions, leading to a consistent way of informing the patients about their HIV drugs, thereby avoiding contradictory information. The pharmacist also became involved in adherence promoting activities at the clinic. The perceived benefits for the patients were considered to be convenience and preservation of privacy as well as a better basis for safe and appropriate drug utilisation. Conclusion: Conventional pharmacies were shown to have several disadvantages in serving the HIV infected population. The health care professionals found the novel approach of dispensing HIV drugs at the clinic valuable. The approach led to increased communication and trust between the health care professions, and enhanced teamwork in medication management.","{""Baretta, K"",""Lindblad, Ã…MK"",""SÃ¶dergÃ¥rd, BMH"",""Tully, MP""}",sodergard_qualitativestudyhealthcare_2005,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Modeling And Analyzing Supply-Demand Relationships Of Water Resources In Xinjiang From A Perspective Of Ecosystem Services,"Water shortage is one bottleneck that limits economic and social developments in arid and semi-arid areas. As the impacts of climate change and human disturbance intensify across time, uncertainties in both water resource supplies and demands increase in arid and semi-arid areas. Taking a typical arid region in China, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, as an example, water yield depth (WYD) and water utilization depth (WUD) from 2002 to 2018 were simulated using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and socioeconomic data. The supply-demand relationships of water resources were analyzed using the ecosystem service indices including water supply-demand difference (WSDD) and water supply rate (WSR). The internal factors in changes of WYD and WUD were explored using the controlled variable method. The results show that the supply-demand relationships of water resources in Xinjiang were in a slight deficit, but the deficit was alleviated due to increased precipitation and decreased WUD of irrigation. WYD generally experienced an increasing trend, and significant increase mainly occurred in the oasis areas surrounding both the Junggar Basin and Tarim Basin. WUD had a downward trend with a decline of 20.70\%, especially in oasis areas. Water resources in most areas of Xinjiang were fully utilized and the utilization efficiency of water resources increased. The water yield module in the InVEST model was calibrated and validated using gauging station data in Xinjiang, and the result shows that the use of satellite-based water storage data helped to decrease the bias error of the InVEST model by 0.69x10(8) m(3). This study analyzed water resource supplies and demands from a perspective of ecosystem services, which expanded the scope of the application of ecosystem services and increased the research perspective of water resource evaluation. The results could provide guidance for water resource management such as spatial allocation and structural optimization of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas.","{""Li Feng"",""Li Yaoming"",""Liu Tie"",""Xin Qinchuan"",""Yin Zun"",""Zhou Xuewen""}",lifengandliyaomingandzhouxuewenandyinzunandliutieandxinqinchuan_modelinganalyzingsupplydemand_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Influence Of Data Source And Species Distribution Modelling Method On Spatial Conservation Priorities,"Aim Species distribution models are an important conservation tool; however, performance can vary with factors including data inputs and modelling method. Model outputs are often under-evaluated for explanatory and predictive capacity. Our aim was to evaluate the capacity of existing data for seven small mammal species to provide useful inferences for management planning. Location Bathurst and Melville (collectively the Tiwi) Islands, Northern Territory, Australia. Methods We developed species distribution models (SDMs) with generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs) using survey data (351 sites) of small mammals, with two sets of environmental predictors: (a) field-study measurements and (b) available remotely sensed rasters. Predictive capacity of models was evaluated using percentage of deviance explained (\%DE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We used Marxan to evaluate the influence of different model and data types as input for identifying spatial priorities. Results Field-informed SDMs performed well across both modelling methods, with relatively high test AUC values (mean = 0.82, range = 0.64-0.97) and test \%DE (mean = 22.5\%, range = 3.5\%-65.8\%). Remotely sensed models performed relatively poorly, with lower test AUC values (mean = 0.7, range = 0.56-0.86) and lower test \%DE (mean = 8.9\%, range = 0.03\%-24.9\%). A notable exception was remotely sensed models for Melomys burtoni (AUC = 0.85 \& 0.86, \%DE = 23.3\% \& 24.9\%, Bathurst and Melville respectively). Marxan site irreplaceability rankings demonstrated low to marginal agreement using field-informed and remotely sensed inputs (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.3), and similarly, using GLM and BRT model inputs (0.29). Main conclusions The occurrence of small mammals on the Tiwi Islands can be reasonably explained with field-informed variables, but not with remotely sensed alternatives. Different models lead to different conservation priorities. Our work emphasizes the importance of thoroughly testing SDMs prior to decision-making.","{""Elith, Jane"",""Firth, Ronald S.

Global Dam Watch: Curated Data And Tools For Management And Decision Making,"Dams, reservoirs, and other water management infrastructure provide benefits, but can also have negative impacts. Dam construction and removal affects progress toward the UN sustainable development goals at local to global scales. Yet, globally-consistent information on the location and characteristics of these structures are lacking, with information often highly localised, fragmented, or inaccessible. A freely available, curated, consistent, and regularly updated global database of existing dams and other instream infrastructure is needed along with open access tools to support research, decision-making and management needs. Here we introduce the Global Dam Watch (GDW) initiative (www.globaldamwatch.org ) whose objectives are: (a) advancing recent efforts to develop a single, globally consistent dam and instream barrier data product for global-scale analyses (the GDW database); (b) bringing together the increasingly numerous global, regional and local dam and instream barrier datasets in a directory of databases (the GDW directory); (c) building tools for the visualisation of dam and instream barrier data and for analyses in support of policy and decision making (the GDW knowledge-base) and (d) advancing earth observation and geographical information system techniques to map a wider range of instream structures and their properties.Our focus is on all types of anthropogenic instream barriers, though we have started by prioritizing major reservoir dams and run-of-river barriers, for which more information is available. Our goal is to facilitate national-scale, basin-scale and global-scale mapping, analyses and understanding of all instream barriers, their impacts and their role in sustainable development through the provision of publicly accessible information and tools. We invite input and partnerships across sectors to strengthen GDW's utility and relevance for all, help define database content and knowledge-base tools, and generally expand the reach of GDW as a global hub of impartial academic expertise and policy information regarding dams and other instream barriers.","{""Beames, Penny"",""Belletti, Barbara"",""Brauman, Kate A."",""De Felice, Luca"",""Higgins, Jonathan"",""Januchowski-Hartley, Stephanie R."",""Lehner, Bernhard"",""Mandle, Lisa"",""Mazany-Wright, Nick"",""Mulligan, Mark"",""Thieme, Michele"",""Wang, Jida"",""Wen, Qingke"",""Yang, Xiao"",""Zarfl, Christiane"",""de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia"",""van Soesbergen, Arnout""}",mulligan_globaldamwatchcurated_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Controlling Established Invaders: Integrating Economics And Spread Dynamics To Determine Optimal Management,"P>We review studies that address economically optimal control of established invasive species. We describe three important components for determining optimal invasion management: invasion dynamics, costs of control efforts and a monetary measure of invasion damages. We find that a management objective that explicitly considers both costs and damages is most appropriate for determining economically optimal strategies, but also leads to large challenges due to uncertainty in components of the management problem. To address uncertainty, some studies have included stochasticity in their models; others have quantified the value of information or focused on decision-making with limited information. Our synthesis shows how invasion characteristics, such as costs, damages, pattern of spread and invasion and landscape size, affect optimal control strategies and goals in systematic ways. We find that even for simple questions, such as whether control should be applied at the centre of an invasion or to satellite patches, the answer depends on the details of a particular invasion. Future work should seek to better quantify key components of this problem, determine best management in the face of limited information, improve understanding of spatial aspects of invasion control and design approaches to improve the feasibility of achieving regional control goals.","{""Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca S."",""Hastings, Alan""}",epanchinniell_controllingestablishedinvadersintegrating_2010,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Assessment Of Land Use Change In The Wetland Of Barotse Floodplain, Zambezi River Sub-Basin, Zambia","River floodplains such as the Barotse Flood Plain (BFP) in Western Zambia, provide a large number of ecosystem services and economic value for the inhabitants. Yet, in spite of its importance, the Floodplain has been vulnerable to land use change threatening wetland degradation albeit it being a Ramsar Cultural Heritage Site. This study aimed at determining the extent of land use change in the wetland of BFP in the selected years between 1980 and 2020 using Landsat data, then identifying and assessing drivers of land use change using survey data sets. In this study we hypothesized to determine the past and present status and change drivers of unprotected wetlands using a hybrid approach to help guide environment managers on the conservation of wetlands in a holistic manner. It also measured the relationship between drivers of land use change and observed land use changes pattern in the wetland of BFP. The study used an integrated research approach that involved utilizing combined methods of data collection and analysis. Both secondary and primary data sources were used. Primary data was collected using interview schedule, key informants' interviews, Participatory Rural Appraisal and field observations. The Raosoft random sample calculator was used to determine the sample size of heads of households from 9 districts within the margins of Barotse Floodplain. Then, a proportional sample size per district of 270 was calculated. The study found that there was an average land use change of 24.3\% and 0.78 annual change rate in the wetland of BFP in the years of 1984, 1996, 2004 and 2015. The land use classes annual change rates between 1984 and 2015 were: forest/woody vegetation (0.32), grassland (0.07), water (0.02), annually flooded land (0.11) and bare land (0.26). The delineated land cover area classes (forest/woody vegetation, grassland, water, annually flooded land and bare land) have been reducing except for bare land that was increasing in areal coverage. Water class had the greatest negative percentage change (decrease) of 0.04 between 1984 and 2015. While the class of bare land class had greatest positive change (increase) of 8.3 percent in the period of 1984 and 2015. It was found that from 1990 to 2016, there was precipitation variation the years between 1981 and 2016 where the lowest was 571.7 mm in 2016, highest 1 579 mm in 2008 and the average amount of rainfall in the same period was 879.5 mm. Therefore, in some years there was excessive rainfall and scant rainfall in other years, which affected hydrology in the wetland and consequently affecting its ecosystem functions. The study found that land use change was driven by climate variability (48.5\%), infrastructure development (20.7\%), technology (7.8\%), demography (18.5\%), and agriculture (4.4\%) using an integrated approach. Other land use changes such as the construction of a road bridge across the floodplain have contributed to wetland deterioration. The study further found that there was a relationship of 0.266 between driving forces of land use change and observed land use changes pattern. Therefore, the study demonstrated and provided new data that indicated the extent of land use change and its drivers using integrated research approach. The study recommends strategies such as environmental education and land use planning to resolve the problem of land use changes, in order to contribute to sustainable wetland management.","{""Banda, Arnold Mahonko"",""Banda, Kawawa"",""Chomba, Machaya"",""Nyambe, Imasiku Anayawa"",""Sakala, Enock""}",banda_assessmentlandchangewetland_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"An Extraction, Analysis, And Prioritization Of Asna River Sub-Basins, Based On Geomorphometric Parameters Using Geospatial Tools","The Asna river basin is located in Hingoli and Nanded districts of Marathwada region of Maharashtra. A geomorphometric analysis is an important method for the investigation and management of natural resources of watershed. The geomorphometric analysis of Asna river basin classifies three sub-basins that have been delineated using GIS and remote sensing through measurements of linear, aerial, and relief aspects. The Asna river basin comprises an area of 1187km(2) with seventh-order drainage pattern. As per Strahler classification, the upper part of the basin shows dendritic to sub-dendritic and the lower part exhibits parallel to sub-parallel drainage pattern. The total numbers of stream segments are 2422 and length of streams is 2187.92km. The bifurcation value ranges from 1.26 to 5.58 indicating that there are no structural disturbances. The form factor value (0.49) indicates that the shape of the basin is moderately circular. The high values of drainage density, stream frequency, and low infiltration number indicate the high runoff due to impermeable lithology. The slope of the basin varies from 1 to 32.2\%, terrain elevation ranges from 333 to 551m, and overall relief of the basin is 218m amsl. River sub-basin prioritization has an immense importance in natural resource management, especially in semi-arid regions. The present study is an attempt to prioritize the sub-basins of Asna river based on geomorphometric parameters. The weightage is assigned to different morphometric parameters of sub-basins based on erosion potential. The Asna river sub-basins have been classified into three categories as high, medium, and low on the basis of priorities for soil and water conservation. It is confirmed that sub-basin I is characterized as highly vulnerable to erosion and has high sedimentation load; sub-basin II has low priority, i.e., very low erodibility; and sub-basin III is of moderate type. The morphometric analysis and prioritization methods can be applied to hydrological studies in surface as well as subsurface water, climatic studies, rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharging sites, and watershed management.","{""Mukate, Shrikant"",""Panaskar, Dipak"",""Sahu, Uday"",""Wagh, Vasant""}",sahu_extractionanalysisprioritizationasna_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Albedo Impact On The Suitability Of Biochar Systems To Mitigate Global Warming,"Biochar application to agricultural soils can change the surface albedo which could counteract the climate mitigation benefit of biochar systems. However, the size of this impact has not yet been quantified. Based on empirical albedo measurements and literature data of arable soils mixed with biochar, a model for annual vegetation cover development based on satellite data and an assessment of the annual development of surface humidity, an average mean annual albedo reduction of 0.05 has been calculated for applying 30-32 Mg ha -1 biochar on a test field near Bayreuth, Germany. The impact of biochar production and application on the carbon cycle and on the soil albedo was integrated into the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a modeled pyrolysis based biochar system via the computation of global warming potential (GWP) characterization factors. The analysis resulted in a reduction of the overall climate mitigation benefit of biochar systems by 13-22% due to the albedo change as compared to an analysis which disregards the albedo effect. Comparing the use of the same quantity of biomass in a biochar system to a bioenergy district heating system which replaces natural gas combustion, bioenergy heating systems achieve 99-119% of the climate benefit of biochar systems according to the model calculation.

Application Of Landsat-Derived Ndvi In Monitoring And Assessment Of Vegetation Cover Changes In Central Serbia,"This paper evaluates the application of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the monitoring and assessment of temporal vegetation cover changes (from 2006 to 2014) in three municipalities of Central Serbia: Topola, Jagodina and KurÅ¡umlija. Additionally, special focus is placed on the analysis of the forest areas and the possible use of NDVI in the forest management sector. Results of the NDVI applied through Idrisi software identify all vegetation cover types and their typical values for presented case studies and observed periods. Obtained results for Serbian case studies indicate two major observations outlined for the investigated period. It was noticed that vegetation cover is experiencing a certain decrease, and that certain discrepancies exists between the NDVI and official forest area statistics for certain municipalities. The study outlines the positive outcomes of the applied remote sensing techniques, especially for southern Serbian municipalities where illegal logging activities are pronounced. Hence, this method proved very promising for countries performing national forest inventories, such as Serbia, providing local forest managers with several essential up-to-date information about vegetation cover changes on an annual basis.

Canopy Adjustment And Improved Cloud Detection For Remotely Sensed Snow Cover Mapping,"Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30-40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas. Plain Language Summary Mapping snow cover extent informs water resources stored in the winter snowpack, providing important information for planning how and when to utilize available water. Tree canopies shield the forest floor and hinder the determination of snow-covered area in vegetated terrain from above, where satellites view the Earth's surface. Moreover, satellites that scan the surface (like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) are most often not directly overhead, and as the view from the satellite to the surface slants, trees obscure a greater portion of the land surface that a satellite can ""see,"" especially where trees are tall, adding uncertainty to the satellite-based maps. This effect is greatest in forests where 30-40\% of the land area is covered by tree canopy and has little effect in very dense forests where most of the forest floor is obscured already. Here we present a method to accommodate the stretched and hidden forest footprint when a satellite is not directly overhead. A new method for identifying snow-mapping errors caused by clouds is also presented by flagging unusually large changes in the non-snow surfaces over sequential images. These methodological advancements are important because snow-melt water comprises a major portion of the water supply in many regions where humans live.","{""Dozier, Jeff"",""Hill, Alice F."",""Lutz, James A."",""Painter, Thomas H."",""Raleigh, Mark S."",""Rittger, Karl""}",rittger_canopyadjustmentimprovedcloud_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Streamflow Regionalization Considering Water Balance With Actual Evapotranspiration Estimated From Remote Sensing,"Streamflow regionalization is a technique used in areas where hydrological data are scarce or nonexistent. Although numerous studies have been conducted with the aim of improving this technique, unsatisfactory results are still evident. This study, therefore, aims to propose and evaluate the performance of a new explanatory variable for regionalization, which represents the streamflow formation process and considers the actual evapotranspiration (ETR) obtained from remote sensing products. For this purpose, the regional regression method was used to estimate long-term mean streamflow and minimum flow with 90\% of permanence in time. The explanatory variables were the precipitated volume (Peq), precipitated volume minus the empirical value of 750 mm (Peq(750)), water balance for each segment of the water course (WBeq), and water balance for each hydrologically homogenous region (WBeqM). These variables were obtained using a combination of drainage area, precipitation, and ETR. The ETR was estimated using two remote sensing products: MOD16 and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model. The models of streamflow regionalization were evaluated by statistical, physical, and risk analyses. The study was applied for Grande River basin. All the variables, with the exception of Peq, presented good statistical performance, good representativeness of regionalized streamflows, and safe estimates for the planning and management of water resources. The WBeq(G) was the most recommended variable for streamflow regionalization in Grande River basin, because it considers variations in edaphoclimatic and vegetative conditions along the basin. This work contributes to improving the predictive capacity of the streamflow through a method that is potentially applicable to other areas of study, allows easy physical interpretation, utilizes easily obtained variables, and represents the streamflow formation process.

Monitoring Needs To Transform Amazonian Forest Maintenance Into A Global Warming-Mitigation Option,"Two approaches are frequently mentioned in proposals to use tropical forest maintenance as a carbon offset. One is to set up specific reserves, funding the establishment, demarcation, and guarding of these units. Monitoring, in this case, consists of the relatively straightforward process of confirming that the forest stands in question continue to exist. In Amazonia, where large expanses of tropical forest still exist, the reserve approach has the logical weakness of being completely open to ""leakage"": with the implantation of any given reserve, the people who would have been deforesting in the reserve area will probably continue to clear the same amount of forest somewhere else in the region. The second approach is through policy changes aimed at reducing the rate of clearing, but not limited to specific reserves or areas of forest. This second approach addresses more fundamental aspects of the tropical deforestation problem, but has the disadvantages of not assuring the permanence of forest and of not resulting in a visible product that can be convincingly credited to the existence of the project. In order for credit to be assigned to policy change projects, functioning models of the deforestation process must be developed that arc capable of producing scenarios with and without different policy changes. This requires understanding the process of deforestation, which depends on monitoring in order to have information as a time series. Information is needed both from satellite imagery and from on-thc-ground observations on who occupies the land and why the observed changes occur. Monitoring must be done by individual property if causal factors are to be identified reliably; this is best achieved using a database in a Geographical Information System (GIS) that includes property boundaries. Once policy changes arc made in practice, not only deforestation but also the policies themselves must be monitored. Decrees and laws are not the same as changes in practice; the initiation and continued application of changes must therefore be confirmed regularly. The value of carbon benefits from Amazonia depends directly on the credibility and transparency of monitoring. The great potential value of carbon maintenance in Amazonia should provide ample reason for Amazonian countries to strengthen and increase the transparency of their monitoring efforts.

Water Use Efficiency-Based Multiscale Assessment Of Ecohydrological Resilience To Ecosystem Shifts Over The Continent Of Africa During 1992-2015,"The spatial-temporal representation is a crucial key for understanding at what extent terrestrial ecosystems can maintain their structure and functions and recover from various ecosystem shifts (drought/wet). Hence, it is vital for sustainable ecosystem management, adaptation, and mitigation practices. This study assessed ecohydrological resilience to ecosystem shifts at contrast water-limited and well-watered regions at multiple scales (i.e., country scale, basin scale, climate type scale, and land cover scale) over Africa during the period 1992-2015, based on Standard Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) and water use efficiency (WUE) at ecosystem scales, which was obtained from satellite-derived evapotranspiration (ET) and simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) using the Carnegie-ames-stanford approaches (CASA) model. SEDI values indicated that 11 years were characterized by dry conditions, while 13 were wetter years during 1992-2015. WUE, ET, and GPP values indicated increased tendencies mostly in central to central west of African continent. The ecohydrological resilience exhibited that about 68.78\% of African terrestrial ecosystems were highly, moderately, or slightly resilient, and about 31.22\% were not resilient to ecosystem shifts with 11.28\% vulnerably exposed to high risk of ecosystem shift and severely nonresilient. The extent areas exposed to severe ecohydrological nonresilience are distributed in Savannas and barelands land cover types, temperate-dry summer-hot summer (Csa), climate type, Mediterranean South Coast (B14), African-North interior (B3), and Red Sea-Golf of Aden Coast (b5) basins; and the four countries, namely, Egypt, Mauritania, Niger, and Tunisia. These findings may provide insightful scientific information about vulnerable regions for policy making and ecosystem management and increase the necessary awareness for taking reasonable adaptation mechanisms, such as afforesting open lands to increase the area of vegetation cover (i.e., choosing the drought or wet-tolerant plant species) and water conservation and management measures to ensure the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems under ecosystem shifts over the African continent.","{""Bofana, Jose"",""Chen, Baozhang"",""Dilawar, Adil"",""Karamage, Fidele"",""Kayiranga, Alphonse"",""Measho, Simon"",""Ndayisaba, Felix"",""Nthangeni, Winny"",""Sun, Shaobo"",""Trisurat, Yongyut"",""Tuankrua, Venus"",""Wang, Fei"",""Zhang, Huifang""}",kayiranga_waterefficiencybasedmultiscale_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Spatial Flood Forecasting Modeling Under Lack Of Data Using Rs And Optimized Support Vector Machine: A Case Study Of The Zahedan Watershed,"This research was conducted with the aim of producing flood susceptible area maps of the Zahedan catchment in Iran during lack of data using remote sensing. To determine the factors to be included in the model, factors identified in previous studies were prepared using remote sensing and were evaluated by the information gain ratio (IGR) method and the multicollinearity diagnostic test, and ultimately 10 factors with the highest IGR values were chosen as the most effective factors in the region. The flood inventory map was produced by processing the Sentinel-1 satellite data. The gathered data were used to map flood susceptibility maps with the SVM model optimized with IWO and ACO. The prediction accuracy of the models was evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). While both optimization algorithms are effective in improving the performance of SVM, the hybrid of SVM with IWO shows the best performance in terms of statistical measures and Friedman test results. The results of the study confirm the good performance of the proposed models in spatial prediction of flood susceptible areas. Since over half of the urban lands of the city of Zahedan are at moderate to very high risk of flooding, this area needs more attention in terms of flood prevention and control measures.

Estimating The Conservation Value Of Protected Areas In Maritime Canada For Two Species At Risk: The Olive-Sided Flycatcher (Contopus Cooperi) And Canada Warbler (Cardellina Canadensis),"The Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi) and Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) are threatened landbirds in Canada and parts of the U.S. Both species are subjects of recent conservation and management interest. Protected areas are a key tool for managing populations of species at risk, and Canadian national parks may serve as important refuges in an increasingly fragmented landscape. However, the potential role that Canadian national parks may play in the recovery of these species is unclear. We used the Boreal Avian Modelling Project point count database to build Poisson log-linear models using forward stepwise variable selection to predict population density and distribution of these two threatened species in four national parks in Maritime Canada. We also predicted population density in areas of equivalent size in the same ecoregions outside the parks for comparison. Because forested wetlands, a key habitat for these species in this region, are difficult to represent with available spatial data, we tested the effectiveness of different remote sensing products. We tested GIS layers based on aerial photography wetlands (WETLANDS), depth to water table (WETNESS), and WETNESS as interacted with forest cover from aerial photography (WETxFOR). The best-performing models for the Olive-sided Flycatcher used WETxFOR, whereas WETNESS performed best for the Canada Warbler. Anthropogenic disturbance and proximity to roads had a negative effect on predicted density for both species. Protected areas showed slightly higher Olive-sided Flycatcher population densities than nearby areas, but not so for the Canada Warbler. Our results provide the first population density and population size estimates for these species in these parks, and novel information on the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on predicted population density. These results can inform conservation and management in this region and our approach can be replicated in other regions to support ongoing recovery efforts.","{""Bayne, Erin M."",""Fontaine, Trish"",""Hache, Samuel"",""Mazerolle, Dan"",""Solymos, Peter"",""Staicer, Cindy"",""Westwood, Alana R.""}",westwood_estimatingconservationprotectedmaritime_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Predicting The Current And Future Potential Spatial Distribution Of Endangered Rucervus Eldii Eldii (Sangai) Using Maxent Model,"Ecological factors that control the species distribution patterns at various spatiotemporal scales will get affected by climate change. To combat the situation, in the past few decades geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing have been widely used by the researchers in the field of wildlife and habitat suitability modeling. The main objective of this study is to map and predict the current and future habitat suitability potential of Rucervus eldii eldii in Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP) using MaxEnt. Presence location data of the species, topographic factors, and bio-climatic variables were used as input in the MaxEnt software to map current habitat suitability potential. To map the habitat suitability potential for future, two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for the years 2050 and 2070 were used. The model returned an average AUC value of 0.944 which indicates the model to be sensitive and descriptive. Isothermality and precipitation in the wettest quarter were found to be two most significant variables. The suitable range of precipitation in the wettest quarter for Rucervus eldii eldii varies from 1365 to 1410Â mm with an optimal value of 1405Â mm and isothermality from 46.43 to 46.6% with an optimal value of 46.5%. Current habitat suitability results of the model show 0.45 km2 of the area under no potential, 29.25 km2 of the area under least potential, 8.29 km2 of the area under moderate potential, 9.21 km2 of the area under good potential, and 8.82 km2 of the area under high potential. Both RCPs for the years 2050 and 2070 show the decreasing trend in the area under high suitability potential and increasing trend under no suitability potential. The results of this study can provide aid in the management and protection of Rucervus eldii eldii.

Uav-Based Partially Sampling System For Rapid Ndvi Mapping In The Evaluation Of Rice Nitrogen Use Efficiency,"Rapid acquisition and mapping of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values is essential for a timely evaluation of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in sustainable agriculture. The zonal nutrient management techniques for sustainable agriculture require timely and efficient NDVI data collection and analysis capabilities, - a need that is still rarely addressed. However, as with the use of manned aircraft, the primary limitation of established unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging technologies is the limited time window for large-area data collection. Furthermore, as the spatial resolution increases, the post-processing time generally becomes longer. To overcome problems associated with the need for rapid data acquisition and post-processing, we have developed a UAV-based sensor system called the Accurate and Speed Scanner (AS-Scanner). The data acquisition accuracy and NDVI mapping speed of the system were assessed. According to the results of a ground-level experiment, the mean absolute error (MAE) between the reflectance data of the AS-Scanner and the corresponding data of the ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer is less than 1.11\%. Furthermore, results of a plot-level experiment suggest that the NDVI values of a raw point cloud from AS-Scanner-based UAV platform (AS-NDVI) and UAV-mounted Mica-Sense RedEdge camera (REG-NDVI) are highly correlated (0.54 < R-2 < 0.57, p < 0.01). In a map-level experiment, the interpolated, 15 m x 15 m pixel size AS-NDVI values were in good agreement with the REG-NDVIs over a 4.01 ha (40100 m(2)) rice field (0.55 < R-2 < 0.65, p < 0.01). The average processing times of the inverse distance weighted (IDW, 0.45 s), kriging linear (KL, 0.73 s), and nearest neighbor (NN, 1.05 s) interpolations of the AS-Scanner data prove that it is possible to efficiently create NDVI maps using data from the sensor. Besides, the effect of the varying solar irradiance values on the AS-NDVIs was analyzed under varied illumination conditions. Moreover, the AS-NDVIs were also used to assess the NUE in a paddy rice field at the panicle stage. The results show that nutrients can be effectively assessed using AS-Scanner data. Despite some disadvantages such as the potential of NDVI value saturation over dense canopies, the AS-Scanner provides a method for quickly obtaining reasonable spatial resolution crop information for agricultural nutrient monitoring and management. This also offers the potential to reduce environmental pressure which may be caused by untimely estimation of NUE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on Quick Bird high resolution remote sensing image data, as well as point cloud data measured in the sample, this paper describes the 3D green quantity, ecological service function and ecological value of the green space system in Xingqing Palace Park of Xi an city quantitatively, by differential method. The quantitative analysis method can be used for the scientific evaluation of urban green space ecosystem in northwest of China and other ecologically fragile areas, which can provide scientific basis for urban green space ecosystem planning and promote the sustainable development of urban and rural human settlement environment. The results show that Xi an Xingqing Palace Park has a high three-dimensional green quantity, it is 149 602. 856 m3. Besides, the order of ecological service function of xingqing Palace Park s green space system is as follows, carbon sequestration> oxygen release > dust retention> sulfur dioxide absorption. And the contribution rate of carbon sequestration benefit is the highest, which has obviously improved the urban ecological environment. Meanwhile, the total value of ecological service functions of carbon sequestration, oxygen release, dust retention and sulfur dioxide absorption in xingqing Palace Park reached 705 412. 466 yuan per year, with the value proportion of 77. 27 %, 0.08%, 3.97% and 18. 68 %, respectively.

The Chronos Mission: Capability For Sub-Hourly Synoptic Observations Of Carbon Monoxide And Methane To Quantify Emissions And Transport Of Air Pollution,"The CHRONOS space mission concept provides time-resolved abundance for emissions and transport studies of the highly variable and highly uncertain air pollutants carbon monoxide and methane, with sub-hourly revisit rate at fine (similar to 4 km) horizontal spatial resolution across a North American domain. CHRONOS can provide complete synoptic air pollution maps (""snapshots"") of the continental domain with less than 10 min of observations. This rapid mapping enables visualization of air pollution transport simultaneously across the entire continent and enables a sentinel-like capability for monitoring evolving, or unanticipated, air pollution sources in multiple locations at the same time with high temporal resolution. CHRONOS uses a compact imaging gas filter correlation radiometer for these observations, with heritage from more than 17 years of scientific data and algorithm advances by the science teams for the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on NASA's Terra spacecraft in low Earth orbit. To achieve continental-scale sub-hourly sampling, the CHRONOS mission would be conducted from geostationary orbit, with the instrument hosted on a communications or meteorological platform. CHRONOS observations would contribute to an integrated observing system for atmospheric composition using surface, suborbital and satellite data with atmospheric chemistry models, as defined by the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites. Addressing the U.S. National Academy's 2007 decadal survey direction to characterize diurnal changes in tropospheric composition, CHRONOS observations would find direct societal applications for air quality management and forecasting to protect public health.","{""Arellano, Jr., Avelino F."",""Edwards, David P."",""Francis, Gene"",""Neil, Doreen"",""Valle, Tim"",""Worden, Helen M.""}",edwards_chronosmissioncapabilityhourly_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Forest Road Detection Using Deep Learning Models,"Forest roads are the primary infrastructure facilities of forestry activities. Identifying the forest roads that can be used after a disaster is very important for management of disasters such as fire, flood, and landslide as well as for strengthening of the forest road infrastructure. In this context, forest road extraction from orthophoto images has become a hot research topic in the field of remote sensing image analysis. Deep learning methods stand out in many fields that require remote sensing and these methods lead to very successful results compared with traditional methods. Recently, deep learning methods are applied frequently in road extraction. The aim of the present study was forest road network extraction from high resolution orthophoto images based on deep learning. Four different deep learning models have been used in the study which are AlexNet, ResNet-50, InceptionResNet-V2 and U-Net. First, the images in the dataset were subject to re-processing after which the deep learning models were trained separately. Secondly, values of overall accuracy, precision, recall, Dice coefficient, intersection over union, and test time were calculated for these trained network models over the validity dataset. Finally, the acquired results were compared and forest road segmentation inferences were visualized thus putting forth the accuracy at which the deep learning models used can extraction the forest roads. The results show that ResNet-50 and InceptionResNet-V2 semantic segmentation models can be used accurately and efficiently for forest road extraction.","{""Caliskan, Erhan"",""Sevim, Yusuf""}",caliskan_forestroaddetectiondeep_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Gis-Based Environmental Database For Assessing The Mine Pollution: A Case Study Of An Abandoned Mine Site In Morocco,"Morocco with important mining activities is increasingly concerned about impacts of mining on the environment. In Morocco, there are approximately 200 abandoned mine sites which vary from small scale underground mines to large scale open-pit mines. Some of these mines, with reactive tailings and waste rocks, are problematic. Indeed, Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) pollution from abandoned mines is responsible for soil and water contamination, land resources degradation, changes in landscapes, habitat destruction and human health hazards. In the current case study about the abandoned Kettara mine site, the impact of the old mining activity is assessed by the design and elaboration of an environmental database which will be supported by Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. This database includes multidisciplinary data related to geochemistry, hydrochemistry, hydrology, land cover, geology and climates. The current research demonstrated the efficiency of integrating multidisciplinary data and using GIS technologies when assessing the environmental impact of abandoned mines and forecasting how the pollution is occurred. The obtained results show that in addition to the soil, the surface water and groundwater of the Kettara mine are also contaminated by pollutants which were previously released from mine wastes by AMD action. The sulphate content and the Electrical Conductivity (EC) of the surface water and groundwater are high. The average values for surface water are: sulphate approximate to 7920 mg/L and EC approximate to 256851 mu S/cm. However, in groundwater they are: sulphate approximate to 2088 mg/L and EC approximate to 631 mu S/cm. These values exceed the guidelines for drinking water quality prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) 600 mg/L and 1500 mu S/cm for sulphate and EC respectively. The developed GIS based environmental database will serve as a reference study for other abandoned mine sites. Finally, it will be employed for the establishment of a web-based GIS Decision Support System which will assist decision makers in assessing and monitoring the occurred mine pollution.

"Assessment Of Soil Erosion Risk Using Rusle Model, Sateec System, Remote Sensing, And Gis Techniques: A Case Study Of Navroud Watershed","Soil erosion is a major environmental threat to soil health, natural resources, and sustainable agriculture. Appropriate knowledge of dynamic factors affecting soil erosion is crucial for effective decision-making in watershed management and soil conservation practice. The present study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of annual soil loss (SL) and sediment yield (SY) in the Navroud watershed from the years 2000 to 2018 using remotely-sensed data, GIS-integrated RUSLE Model, and the GIS-based SATEEEC model. For this purpose, models' factors including rainfall erosivity factor (R), crop management factor (C), soil erodibility factor (K), and topographic factor (LS) were prepared. In addition, to boost the performance of the models, the R factor was modified by applying the effect of the snowmelt-runoff erosivity factor (SR). Long-term suspended sediment load records were used to validate the models' results at the outlet of the watershed. RUSLE model showed that mean annual SL rates in the Navroud basin ranged from 0 to over 100 ton ha(-1) year(-1) with average values of 5.39 and 14.95 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and total rainfall-runoff erosivity (TR) factor as the sum of R and SR factors, respectively. However, for the SATEEC model, SL ranged from 0 to 144 and 0 to 461 with slightly higher average values of 6.2, and 16.76 ton ha(-1) year(-1) using the R factor and TR factor, respectively. In general, the performance of the RUSLE and SATEEC models was low (R-2 = 0.39-0.44, NSE = - 0.05, 0.15) when the R factor was used as the only erosive factor in simulating SL. However, a notably better estimation of SL and SY was observed when the TR factor was used instead of the R factor (R-2 = 0.77-0.75, NSE = 0.33-0.36). It can be concluded that RUSLE showed slightly better results than SATEEC in the Navroud watershed, and also the use of the SR factor in calculating the erosive factor has led to a notable improvement in the models' simulation. In conclusion, these findings highlight not only the need to consider the SR factor in the models' simulation, especially in mountainous regions but these results can also assist in the implementation of effective conservation practices to reduce soil erosion risk in the Navroud watershed.","{""Asadi, Hossein"",""Bahrami, Hosseinali"",""Fallah, Mahboobeh""}",fallah_assessmentsoilerosionrisk_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Multiple Environmental Drivers For The Patagonian Forest-Dwelling Beetles: Contrasting Functional And Taxonomic Responses Across Strata And Trophic Guilds,"changes in forest-dwelling beetle communities. However, the effects of multiple environmental factors can be complex to detect in ecosystems that offer a broad variety of microhabitats for a great variety of beetle species. This is the case in Patagonian temperate forests, where the use of remote sensing provides an opportunity to evaluate the sensitivity of beetle species to environmental changes. Here, we identified the environmental drivers of forest-dwelling beetle communities in the ground and canopy of 34 north Patagonian-forest landscapes. We analyzed the associations of the taxonomic and functional diversity of five trophic guilds with 30 remote-sensing variables of landscape structure, composition, and disturbances; vegetation and soil properties; and climate and physical variables. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify trophic guilds responding similarly to predictors. Segmented regression analysis was used to evaluate functional redundancy from taxonomic-functional richness relationships. A total of 583 species (23,848 individuals) of beetles were recorded for both strata. The effects of environmental variables were heterogeneous across strata and guilds. Canopy beetles were especially sensitive to early successional conditions, and canopy attributes, but also benefited from the canopy openness. Forest specialists of the ground and canopy responded differently to environmental variables. Ground-dwelling beetles were mostly affected by fires, human modifications, edge closeness, high temperatures, and soil properties, responding weakly to canopy properties.

Globalized Poverty And Environment: 21st Century Challenges And Innovative Solutions,"This book reviews the key conceptions and economic theories of poverty, explains poverty-environment nexus, and finally offers innovative socio-economic and scientific geospatial solutions for the 21st Century. The book makes it possible for our readers to understand poverty thorough a concise review of the major theoretical economic frameworks, measures of poverty, and points out the need to understand rural-urban dichotomy of poverty. We find the theories and measures to be less-than perfect and therefore point out the need to treat these measures and theories as convenient tools lacking perfect accuracy and utmost scientific reliability. It follows then that the supposedly knowledgeably crafted poverty reduction and environmental preservation solutions are inherently imperfect. The economic solutions proposed in this book transcend extant humdrum macroeconomic and policy measures targeting poverty and environmental issues. We point to a new paradigm in which private sector and other stakeholders can create new and inclusive markets where value is co-created and shared. Above all, this book offers timely state-of-the-art geospatial solutions targeting the most pressing global problems of water, e.g., the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions to estimate changes in stored water in the water-poverty-environment nexus, pollution, agriculture and disaster management, where geospatial techniques are applied under strong environmental impact assessment regulatory regimes. ""This book provides a good summary of economic theories of poverty as well as a vivid depiction of the state of environmental degradation in the world. People often work separately on different issues that are, in fact, closely intertwined. The principle of holism is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and I believe that this joint-venture of two experts on poverty and environment has produced something more than a sum of two separate monographs on the issues. Various points raised in this volume are worth heeding when we think of formulation and implementation of a truly effective post-MDGs development agenda.

Estimating Grassland Parameters From Sentinel-2: A Model Comparison Study,"Grassland plays an important role in German agriculture. The interplay of ecological processes in grasslands secures important ecosystem functions and, thus, ultimately contributes to essential ecosystem services. To sustain, e.g., the provision of fodder or the filter function of soils, agricultural management needs to adapt to site-specific grassland characteristics. Spatially explicit information derived from remote sensing data has been proven instrumental for achieving this. In this study, we analyze the potential of Sentinel-2 data for deriving grassland-relevant parameters. We compare two well-established methods to calculate the aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI), first using a random forest regression and second using the soilâ€“leaf-canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model. Field data were recorded on a grassland area in Brandenburg in August 2019, and were used to train the empirical model and to validate both models. Results confirm that both methods are suitable for mapping the spatial distribution of LAI and for quantifying aboveground biomass. Uncertainties generally increased with higher biomass and LAI values in the empirical model and varied on average by a relative RMSE of 11% for modeling of dry biomass and a relative RMSE of 23% for LAI. Similar estimates were achieved using SLC with a relative RMSE of 30% for LAI retrieval, and a relative RMSE of 47% for the estimation of dry biomass. Resulting maps from both approaches showed comprehensible spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass distributions. Despite variations in the value ranges of both maps, the average estimates and spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass were very similar. Based on the results of the two compared modeling approaches and the comparison to the validation data, we conclude that the relationship between Sentinel-2 spectra and grassland-relevant variables can be quantified to map their spatial distributions from space. Future research needs to investigate how similar approaches perform across different grassland types, seasons and grassland management regimes.

Quantification Of Soil Erosion In Small Watersheds On The Loess Plateau Based On A Modified Soil Loss Model,"The technology of slope vegetation system stability enhancement is an important part of the comprehensive ecological security improvement in small watersheds area of the Loess Plateau. The results of the comprehensive soil erosion improvement in the sub-basin are used to give an evaluation of the effectiveness of the gully slope vegetation restoration project. Soil erosion quantification distribution in the Sheep Sap Gully sub-basin of the Loess Plateau hilly gully area was simulated and explored by combining the modified universal soil loss equation RUSLE model with GIS and RS spatial information technology. The quantitative values of LS factor were extracted using DEM data, the R factor of rainfall erosion force was calculated using meteorological monitoring station data around this region, the K factor of erosion resistance was obtained based on the soil survey database, and the C factor and P factor of soil and water conservation measures were obtained by combining MODIS image data and previous research experience. The study concluded that (1) The erosion area ratio within the study area is 36.33\%; (2) The quantitative grading standard of the pattern, the size of the erosion distribution area at all levels is ranked as light>moderate>very strong>strong>intense; (3) Under the conditions of land use and vegetation cover, strong erosion is mostly found in farming areas with sparse vegetation, while weak erosion is found in areas with lush vegetation such as forests and grasslands; (4) In terms of spatial distribution, erosion is greater in the south-western part of the basin than in the north-eastern part, and there is also strong erosion in the south-western part. The results of the study provide a reference for research into integration and synthesis of ecological security technologies for gully and slope management projects.

Quantitative Estimation Of Soil Salinity Using Uav-Borne Hyperspectral And Satellite Multispectral Images,"Soil salinization is a global issue resulting in soil degradation, arable land loss and ecological environmental deterioration. Over the decades, multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing have enabled efficient and cost-effective monitoring of salt-affected soils. However, the potential of hyperspectral sensors installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate and map soil salinity has not been thoroughly explored. This study quantitatively characterized and estimated field-scale soil salinity using an electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment and a hyperspectral camera installed on a UAV platform. In addition, 30 soil samples (0 similar to 20 cm) were collected in each field for the lab measurements of electrical conductivity. First, the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values measured by EMI were calibrated using the lab measured electrical conductivity derived from soil samples based on empirical line method. Second, the soil salinity was quantitatively estimated using the random forest (RF) regression method based on the reflectance factors of UAV hyperspectral images and satellite multispectral data. The performance of models was assessed by Lin's concordance coefficient (CC), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the soil salinity of three study fields with different land cover were mapped. The results showed that bare land (field A) exhibited the most severe salinity, followed by dense vegetation area (field C) and sparse vegetation area (field B). The predictive models using UAV data outperformed those derived from GF-2 data with lower RMSE, higher CC and RPD values, and the most accurate UAV-derived model was developed using 62 hyperspectral bands of the image of the field A with the RMSE, CC, and RPD values of 1.40 dS m(-1), 0.94, and 2.98, respectively. Our results indicated that UAV-borne hyperspectral imager is a useful tool for field-scale soil salinity monitoring and mapping. With the help of the EMI technique, quantitative estimation of surface soil salinity is critical to decision-making in arid land management and saline soil reclamation.","{""Fu, Tingting"",""Hu, Jie"",""Jiang, Qingsong"",""Peng, Jie"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wang, Fei"",""Xu, Dongyun"",""Zhao, Ruiying"",""Zhou, Yin""}",hu_quantitativeestimationsoilsalinity_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Evaluating The Rate Of Change And Predicting The Future Scenario Of Spatial Pattern Using Markov Chain Model: A Study From Baghmundi Cd Block Of Purulia District, West Bengal","In the era of twenty-first century, the endless demands of human have promoted land use land cover (LULC) change, and its understanding is more essential for proper management and future planning towards the sustainable development. An analysis of LULC is made for the Baghmundi Community Development (C.D.) Block of Purulia district of West Bengal, India to observe the changes over time. The Landsat images of 1972, 1992, 1999, 2009 and 2019 are taken to prepare the LULC maps using RS and GIS techniques. Moreover, the Markov chain model is computed to estimate LULC change of 2039. Thematic maps of different years show several changes in LULC. An accuracy assessment of the classifications of LULC of the years 1999, 2009 and 2019 is calculated as 81.32\%, 81.36\% and 80.16\% respectively. The kappa coefficient is also computed for the same years to understand the level of agreement between classified LULC type and ground level LULC type. The values of kappa coefficient are 0.76 for 1999, 0.77 for 2009 and 0.75 for 2019.

Synthetic Aperture Radar Image And Its Despeckling Using Variational Methods: A Review Of Recent Trends,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has drawn significant interest from the remote sensing community due to its ability to provide high-resolution images irrespective of weather and illumination conditions. It has numerous applications in a variety of fields, including military surveillance, geological exploration, disaster management, and mapping of natural phenomena like climate change, forest management, and volcanic eruptions. The image acquired by coherent sensors such as SAR is corrupted by granular multiplicative noise, also known as speckle. It has an adverse influence on the visual interpretation of SAR images and prevents the use of various post-processing tasks. Despeckling addresses the removal of such noise from SAR images while preserving the image details. This work provides a brief summary of the theory, applications, speckle statistics, performance measures, and recent developments in despeckling filters using variational methods for SAR images.

Land Use Changes From Unconventional Gas Development In Public Lands Of The Fayetteville Shale,"Changes in drilling practices in the oil and gas industry have opened new regions to energy development across much of the United States, including areas that have large holdings of public lands of high conservation value. Using satellite images and GIS techniques, we measured public land use changes in the Fayetteville Shale, a region in north-central Arkansas that has undergone rapid natural gas development in the last 10 years. These public lands showed less development of gas infrastructure compared to the larger gas field, which is mostly privately owned. Gas activities led to less natural forest loss and edge habitat creation in public lands compared to private lands. However, one large public land property (Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area) showed much more development compared to the overall gas field (about 20\% higher). This disparity was most likely due to differences in regulation and controversial leases that were allowed for this wildlife management area early in the Fayetteville Shale development. These results show that natural gas development can occur around public lands of high conservation value without large land use and habitat impacts, but we suggest such an outcome relies upon effective management practices and wise decision-making by public officials. In the case of Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area, strategic well-pad and pipeline placement could have substantially reduced impact to natural areas.","{""Cox, A.

Quantifying The Sensitivity Of Ephemeral Streams To Land Disturbance Activities In Arid Ecosystems At The Watershed Scale,"Large areas of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and located in arid regions of the southwestern United States are being considered for the development of utility-scale solar energy facilities. Land-disturbing activities in these desert, alluvium-filled valleys have the potential to adversely affect the hydrologic and ecologic functions of ephemeral streams. Regulation and management of ephemeral streams typically falls under a spectrum of federal, state, and local programs, but scientifically based guidelines for protecting ephemeral streams with respect to land-development activities are largely nonexistent. This study developed an assessment approach for quantifying the sensitivity to land disturbance of ephemeral stream reaches located in proposed solar energy zones (SEZs). The ephemeral stream assessment approach used publicly-available geospatial data on hydrology, topography, surficial geology, and soil characteristics, as well as high-resolution aerial imagery. These datasets were used to inform a professional judgment-based score index of potential land disturbance impacts on selected critical functions of ephemeral streams, including flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitat value, and groundwater recharge. The total sensitivity scores (sum of scores for the critical stream functions of flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitats, and groundwater recharge) were used to identify highly sensitive stream reaches to inform decisions on developable areas in SEZs. Total sensitivity scores typically reflected the scores of the individual stream functions; some exceptions pertain to groundwater recharge and ecological habitats. The primary limitations of this assessment approach were the lack of high-resolution identification of ephemeral stream channels in the existing National Hydrography Dataset, and the lack of mechanistic processes describing potential impacts on ephemeral stream functions at the watershed scale. The primary strength of this assessment approach is that it allows watershed-scale planning for low-impact development in arid ecosystems; the qualitative scoring of potential impacts can also be adjusted to accommodate new geospatial data, and to allow for expert and stakeholder input into decisions regarding the identification and potential avoidance of highly sensitive stream reaches.

Accuracy Assessment Of National Land Cover Database Shrubland Products On The Sagebrush Steppe Fringe,"Remotely sensed data products depicting physical and ecological attributes of a landscape are becoming invaluable tools in wildlife and rangeland management. However, if such geospatial tools and data layers are to be used in management, their accuracy and appropriateness for such use needs to be vetted and validated. We assessed accuracy of two National Land Cover Database (NLCD) shrubland products for use in western South Dakotaâ€”percent sagebrush and sagebrush heightâ€”by comparing them to ground-truthed data. Western South Dakota sagebrush communities are an ecotone between sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and grassland. This ecotone is typified by shorter- and lower-density sagebrush than interior sagebrush steppe ecosystem. This distinction could make it difficult to remotely detect and map sagebrush in this area. We determined NLCD correlations with ground estimates of sagebrush canopy cover (r = 0.17) and sagebrush height (r = 0.40). The NLCD percent sagebrush accurately predicted sagebrush presence âˆ¼73â€’76% of the time once resampled to 100-m pixels and 50-m mean values, respectively. Cohen's kappa values were estimated to determine if the ground-truthed and remoted-sensed data were in agreement when determining sagebrush presence. Kappa values were 0.26 Â± 0.06 and 0.28 Â± 0.06 for mean values within 50-m and resampled 100-m pixels, respectively, indicating a â€œfairâ€ level of agreement between the ground-truthed and remote-sensed data types when determining presence of sagebrush. The NLCD data sufficiently described the presence of sagebrush in South Dakota, which is useful for estimating geographic distributions of sagebrush obligate species, species distribution models in which presence or absence of sagebrush is of interest, or mapping the occurrence of sagebrush in South Dakota. Inaccuracies of the NLCD shrubland products in predicting sagebrush height and sagebrush canopy cover may limit their utility as continuous variables in species distribution models, habitat selection, and suitability models or when assessing rangeland quality in South Dakota.

Advances In Large-Scale Flood Monitoring And Detection,"The last decades have seen a massive advance in technologies for Earth observation (EO) and environmental monitoring, which provided scientists and engineers with valuable spatial information for studying hydrologic processes. At the same time, the power of computers and newly developed algorithms have grown sharply. Such advances have extended the range of possibilities for hydrologists, who are trying to exploit these potentials the most, updating and re-inventing the way hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are carried out. A variety of research fields have progressed significantly, ranging from the evaluation of water features, to the classification of land-cover, the identification of river morphology, and the monitoring of extreme flood events. The description of flood processes may particularly benefit from the integrated use of recent algorithms and monitoring techniques. In fact, flood exposure and risk over large areas and in scarce data environments have always been challenging topics due to the limited information available on river basin hydrology, basin morphology, land cover, and the resulting model uncertainty. The ability of new tools to carry out intensive analyses over huge datasets allows us to produce flood studies over large extents and with a growing level of detail.

Multi-Structure Joint Decision-Making Approach For Land Use Classification Of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Cnns,"Land use classification of high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images is a challenging and prominent problem in which pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made amazing achievements. However, single-structured pretrained CNNs have limitations to obtain high classification accuracy. Besides, each pretrained CNNs has different classification ability to classify land use. Therefore, taking advantages of different pretrained CNNs is essential for land use classification. In this study, we propose a novel classification approach based on multi-structure joint decision-making strategy and pretrained CNNs. The basic idea is to apply three CNNs to classify land use separately with the final classification results achieved by joint decision-making strategy. The proposed approach comprises of three steps. First, we create a new fully connected layer and Softmax classification layer. We combine them with the convolutional layers of AlexNet, Inception-v3, and ResNet18. AlexNet also includes the first two layers of fully connected layers. Secondly, we train these designed CNNs to converge by momentum-driven stochastic gradient descent. Thirdly, we utilize joint decision-making strategy to obtain the final prediction results by combining the prediction results of these designed CNNs. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the UC Merced land use, AID, NWPU-45, OPTIMAL-31 datasets and further compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. The benefits of the proposed approach are threefold. First, the multi-structure network maximizes different pretrained CNN structures to extract rich convolution features. Secondly, it could remarkably improve the classification accuracy of indistinguishable land use types of the HRRS images. Thirdly, it has great potential on small dataset with more land use types. The proposed CNN based on multi-structure joint decision approach achieves accurate and reliable land use classification with these benefits.

A Novel Haze Removal Computing Architecture For Remote Sensing Images Using Multi-Scale Retinex Technique,"One of the major degradation arise in the satellite images is poor weather conditions (i.e., haze). Haze is an environmental distortion which significantly affect and minimize the efficiency of remote sensing image interpretation. To tackle this complication, this research work introduced a new approach named as multi-scale retinex histogram equalization with U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal (MSRHE with U-Net DOPT) scheme. In this scheme, multi-scale retinex technique is applied to eliminate ambient atmospheric light value of inhomogeneous information and retain only object surface reflection but they suffer from dark tone. So, of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization is employed to brighten the image tone with limited contrast level. Then the enhanced image is restored using U-Net Dense Optimized Pyramidal technique which deeply extract the feature information with dragonfly optimized ReLU activation unit to enhance the system efficiency. This resolved criteria can greatly improve the image efficiency to generate haze-free image. At the same time, the techniques such as dark channel prior (DCP) method, urban remote sensing haze removal (URSHR) method were employed to comparatively analysed with MSRHE with U-Net DOPT. Three parameters such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), feature similarity (FSIM) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were employed to quantitatively estimate the test (query) result. The experimental result concludes that the proposed technique works well when compared with other classic approaches.","{""Pazhani, A.

An Iot System And Modis Images Enable Smart Environmental Management For Mekong Delta,"The smart environmental management system proposed in this work offers a new approach to environmental monitoring by utilizing data from IoT stations and MODIS satellite imagery. The system is designed to be deployed in vast regions, such as the Mekong Delta, with low building and operating costs, making it a cost-effective solution for environmental monitoring. The system leverages telemetry data collected by IoT stations in combination with MODIS MOD09GA, MOD11A1, and MCD19A2 daily image products to develop computational models that calculate the values land surface temperature (LST), 2.5 and 10 (mu m) particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10) in areas without IoT stations. The MOD09GA product provides land surface spectral reflectance from visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths to determine land cover types. The MOD11A1 product provides thermal infrared emission from the land surface to compute LST. The MCD19A2 product provides aerosol optical depth values to detect the presence of atmospheric aerosols, e.g., PM2.5 and PM10. The collected data, including remote sensing images and telemetry sensor data, are preprocessed to eliminate redundancy and stored in cloud storage services for further processing. This allows for automatic retrieval and computation of the data by the smart data processing engine, which is designed to process various data types including images and videos from cameras and drones. The calculated values are then made available through a graphic user interface (GUI) that can be accessed through both desktop and mobile devices. The GUI provides real-time visualization of the monitoring values, as well as alerts to administrators based on predetermined rules and values of the data. This allows administrators to easily monitor the system, configure the system by setting alerting rules or calibrating the ground stations, and take appropriate action in response to alerts. Experimental results from the implementation of the system in Dong Thap Province in the Mekong Delta show that the linear regression models for PM2.5 and PM10 estimations from MCD19A2 AOD values have correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.68, and RMSEs of 4.11 and 5.74 mu g/m(3), respectively. Computed LST values from MOD09GA and MOD11A1 reflectance and emission data have a correlation coefficient of 0.82 with ground measurements of air temperature. These errors are comparable to other models reported in similar regions in the literature, demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed system.","{""Pham, Danh Phan Hong"",""Pham, Tran Vu"",""Pham-Quoc, Cuong"",""Phan, Vu Hien"",""Qureshi, Kashif Naseer""}",phan_iotsystemmodisimages_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Research On Ecological Spatial Planning Method In High-Density Area Under The Urban Regeneration Vision: A Case Study Of A Three-Dimensional Greening Plan On Xiamen Island,"High-density areas are facing the problems of a lack of eco-space and fragmented layouts due to rapid urbanization. This study, in analyzing the main issues in the planning domain, proposes that roof greening as a complementation can be integrated into urban green systems, and aims to construct an eco-space network in a high-density city area with a deteriorated ecological environment and shortage of land resources. The present study uses Xiamen Island as the research area, and utilizes geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing technology to establish the status of the area and plan the space database by using remote sensing data, field surveys, questionnaires, departmental data, and planning texts. From the three aspects of existing research combing, comprehensive benefits, and urban development appeal analysis, this study summarized the impact factors of roof greening implementation potential, integrated planning divisions, and building classifications to establish a method of assessing implementation potential; we assessed the potential of roof greening implementation in the study area, and achieved eco-space network planning combined with urban green-space systems by taking ""global space, key areas, and multidimensional networks"" into consideration. The results indicated that 1) ecological structure, urban function optimization, public service demand, environmental improvement demand, architectural characteristics, and architectural property ownership as the evaluation elements of potential for roof greening implementation, including the urban ecological framework, urban functional structure, landscape upgrade demand, building renovation demand, urban internality degree, heat island intensity, microclimate environment, building height, building age, building type, and architectural property attributes as key evaluation factors. 2) In 2016, the roof greening rate of buildings on Xiamen Island was only 2%, with more than half attached to residential buildings and urban villages. Commercial, public, and industrial buildings had a lot of potential space for roof greening, and among the remaining buildings, 81.3% were suitable for roof greening. 3) The first step of the study was to explore the method of planning the eco-space network in the high-density urban area. Next, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and GIS, we aimed to build a research method for optimizing an eco-space network with multiple functions, in order to prevent the urban environmental damage and ecological disaster caused by high-intensity development and high-risk agglomeration.

"Spatial Distribution Of Palm Swamp Through Supervised Classification Of Satellite Images Of Ucayali Region, Peru","Palm swamps are ecosystems with a predominant presence of the palm Mauritia flexuosa, which provides important socio-economic and environmental benefits to the inhabitants of the Peruvian Amazon. The objective of this study is to determine the extent of palm swamp forest in the Ucayali region, Peru, through the supervised classification method of satellite images generated by the LANDSAT 8 Earth Observation satellite through the OLI-TIRS sensor, corresponding to Ucayali region in 2017. We visually interpreted the combination of bands 5 (Near Infrared (NIR), with wavelengths of 0.85 - 0.88 Î¼m), 6 (Short Wave Infrared 1 (SWIR 1), with wavelengths of 1.57 - 1.65 Î¼m) and 2 (Blue, with wavelengths of 0.45 - 0.51 Î¼m) to obtain the map of palm swamp forest with an interpretation scale of 1:100 000 and a minimum mapping area of 5.00 ha. We determined a coverage of 65 120.04 ha of palm swamp forest in the Ucayali region. Identifying the location and net area of palm swamp forests in the Ucayali region will allow further understanding of their potential benefits, management and utilization of fruits, environmental services and also information for better management in the context of climate change.

Identifying Trends In Land Degradation In Non-Equilibrium Rangelands,"1. Change in environmental conditions in the complex non-equilibrium rangelands of arid Australia is difficult to monitor. We show how trends in rangeland condition can be identified from changes over time in the pattern of vegetation growth across gradients of differing grazing intensity. 2. Grazing intensity was measured indirectly using distance from water. Vegetation growth was derived from remotely sensed vegetation index values before and after large rainfalls, The amount of growth was adjusted for initial vegetation cover to give a standard measure of vegetation response. 3. A vegetation response ratio was derived by comparing areas less than 4 km from water with benchmark areas further away. Systematic changes in this ratio over time indicate a trend. 4. Ratio values from test areas suggested decline, improvement and no change, consistent with recent management history. 5. The method can be applied where the whole area is affected by grazing and relatively pristine benchmarks are unavailable. It could therefore be useful in the semi-arid rangelands where paddocks are smaller than in the arid part of Australia. It also has possible uses in the rangelands of Africa and the Americas. There is potential for applying the method to traditional grazing systems as well as to commercial pastoralism. 6. The method is cheaper and more effective than other techniques and increases the capacity of grazing gradient-based monitoring schemes for arid and semi-arid areas.","{""Bastin, GN"",""Chewings, VH"",""Pickup, G""}",pickup_identifyingtrendslanddegradation_1998,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Impacts Of Socioeconomic Factors On Cropland Transition And Its Adaptation In Beijing, China","Over the past decades, croplands in China experienced rapid losses as a result of nationwide urbanization, industrialization, socioeconomic development, and implementation of ecological projects. These developments were driven by continuous economic reforms and environmental protection policies. Croplands are precious land resources influenced by overpopulation in China. Cropland losses threaten national food security. This study analyzed spatial patterns of cropland changes, driving forces, and its adaptation. Object-based approach was adopted to accurately measure cropland changes using remote sensing data. Conversion matrix and statistical regression model were used to explore impacts of socioeconomic factors on cropland changes. A case study on Beijing revealed that cropland in Beijing decreased by 47% in the past 35Â years. Primary driving forces in cropland loss included urban expansion, implementation of ecological projects, orchard plantation, and water resource protection. Increased migration and economic development resulted in urban expansion. To promote sustainable development and to meet demands of urban and environmental protection, cropland adaptation was performed by increasing value-added commercial crop plantation, improving crop yield, and reducing cultivation intensity for effective water consumption.

Siamixformer: A Fully-Transformer Siamese Network With Temporal Fusion For Accurate Building Detection And Change Detection In Bi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images,"Building detection and change detection using remote sensing images can help urban and rescue planning. Moreover, they can be used for building damage assessment after natural disasters. Currently, most of the existing models for building detection use only one image (pre-disaster image) to detect buildings. This is based on the idea that post-disaster images reduce the model's performance because of the presence of destroyed buildings. In this paper, we propose a siamese model, called SiamixFormer, which uses pre- and post-disaster images as input. Our model has two encoders and has a hierarchical transformer architecture. The output of each stage in both encoders is given to a temporal transformer for feature fusion in a way that query is generated from pre-disaster images and (key, value) is generated from post-disaster images. To this end, temporal features are also considered in feature fusion. Another advantage of using temporal transformers in feature fusion is that they can better maintain large receptive fields generated by transformer encoders compared with CNNs. Finally, the output of the temporal transformer is given to a simple MLP decoder at each stage. The SiamixFormer model is evaluated on xBD, and WHU datasets, for building detection and on LEVIR-CD and CDD datasets for change detection and could outperform the state-of-the-art.","{""Ghaderi, Foad"",""Mohammadian, Amir""}",mohammadian_siamixformertransformersiamesenetwork_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Estimating The Economic Value And Economic Return Of Irrigation Water As A Sustainable Water Resource Management Mechanism,"Estimating the economic value of irrigation water in monetary terms is a crucial water management tool to address water scarcity, shortage, and overuse problems. This study seeks to couple remote-sensing-based, biophysical water productivity with empirical economic valuation of water to estimate irrigation water's near real-time economic value and the gross return that farmers can earn from using the irrigation water. The study was done at the Koga large-scale community-managed irrigation scheme in the Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. Water productivity based on open sources remotely sensed data (WaPOR) datasets and Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) were used to analyze near real-time crop water productivity (CWP), and determine irrigation water's economic value. Results showed that the average CWP was 1.08 kg/m(3). Farmers were willing to pay 0.074 US\$/m(3), which ranged from 7.5 to 23.5\% of their gross benefit from irrigation water. The study evidenced that coupling the remote-sensing-based CWP data with an empirical analysis of farmers' willingness to pay for irrigation water can generate an agreeable estimate of the economic value of irrigation water and showed the income generated from the irrigation business. Therefore, the method and result help to plan a suitable water pricing modality, which enhances sustainable irrigation management and water productivity.","{""Alamirew, Tena"",""Bashe, Tsigemariam"",""Dejen, Zeleke Agide""}",bashe_estimatingeconomiceconomicreturn_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Value Of Experimental Approaches In Migration Biology,"The past several decades have ushered in a golden age in the study of migration biology, leading to a wealth of descriptive articles that characterize various aspects of migration and its implications for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. However, relatively few studies have adopted an experimental approach to the study of migration, and fewer still have combined lab and field experiments to glean insights into the mechanisms underlying variation in migration behavior and success. Understanding the proximate and ultimate causes of migration timing, energy allocation and optimization, migration success, and fitness is important to aid the conservation and management of wildlife populations by establishing appropriate protections or managing environmental conditions that influence migration. With recent technological advances and miniaturization of animal-borne electronic tracking devices, as well as ground-, water-, and space-based telemetry infrastructure, researchers have the tools necessary to experimentally test hypotheses central to the mechanics of migrations and individual variation therein. By pairing physiological measurements, molecular analyses, and other approaches within an experimental framework, there is the potential to understand not only how animal migrations function but also what differentiates successful migrations from failed migrations and the associated fitness implications. Experimental approaches to migration biology are particularly important, as they will help us to better comprehend and hopefully predict animal responses to environmental and anthropogenic changes by isolating confounding variables that challenge inferences from observations.","{""Aarestrup, Kim"",""Birnie-Gauvin, Kim"",""Cooke, Steven J."",""Crossin, Glenn T."",""Guglielmo, Christopher G."",""Lennox, Robert J."",""Norris, D.

"The Spatial Characteristics And Relationships Between Landscape Pattern And Ecosystem Service Value Along An Urban-Rural Gradient In Xi'an City, China","The spatial structure and function of Xi'an city is significantly affected by urbanization, a factor which can be considered as the main driver of landscape pattern and ecosystem service change. Due to these changes are a response to urban land use and land cover (LULC), remote sensing images are interpreted by the method of supervised classification and visual interpretation to obtain the LULC data for research on landscape pattern index (LPI) and ecosystem service value (ESV) of Xi'an city, China. Combined with urban planning theory, concentric buffer zones were used to explore the characteristics and relationships between LPIs and ESVs along an urban-rural gradient. Ten landscape indices and nine ecosystem service types were selected to analyze the correlation and construct multiple linear regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate the problem of multi-collinearity in the process of model construction. Results indicate that the highest landscape fragmentation was mainly distributed in the urban-rural fringe, 20-35 km from the urban center, and patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and landscape shape index (LSI) recorded the highest values. Total ESV of Xi'an city was 20493.65 x 10(6) CNY in 2016, and the mean value of ESV increased from 0.06 x 10(6) CNY to 2.60 x 10(6) CNY along an urban-rural gradient. This finding indicates that a higher ESV was recorded for the natural landscape. Results also indicated that SHAPE\_MN, FRAC\_MN, PLADJ, and AI recorded a positive effect on total ESV whilst ED and PD have a negative effect on total ESV. Results from the regression models showed quantitative relationships between ESVs and LPIs which revealed how ecosystem service values were affected by the landscape pattern. This study will improve the quantitative assessment method on landscape ecology and provide a basis for further research on city's landscape pattern and ecosystem balance, especially for detecting and evaluating urban-rural development.","{""Hou, Lei"",""Wu, Faqi"",""Xie, Xinli""}",hou_spatialcharacteristicsrelationshipslandscape_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Assessing The Impact Of Dams On Riparian And Deltaic Vegetation Using Remotely-Sensed Vegetation Indices And Random Forests Modelling,"Riparian and deltaic areas exhibit a high biodiversity and offer a number of ecosystem services but are often degraded by human activities. Dams, for example, alter the hydrologic and sediment regimes of rivers and can negatively affect riparian areas and deltas. In order to sustainably manage these ecosystems, it is, therefore, essential to assess and monitor the impacts of dams. To this end, site-assessments and in-situ measurements have commonly been used in the past, but these can be laborious, resource demanding and time consuming. Here, we investigated the impact of three dams on the riparian forest of the Nestos River Delta in Greece by employing multi-temporal satellite data. We assessed the evolution in the values of eight vegetation indices over 27 years, derived from 14 dates of Landsat data. We also employed a modelling approach, using a machine learning Random Forests model, to investigate potential linkages between the observed changes in the indices and a host of climatic and terrestrial predictor variables. Our results show that low density vegetation (0â€“25%) is more affected by the construction of the dams due to its proximity to anthropogenic influences and the effects of hydrologic regime alteration. In contrast, higher density vegetation cover (50â€“75%) appears to be largely unaffected, or even improving, due to its proximity to the river, while vegetation with intermediate coverage (25â€“49%) exhibits no clear trend in the Landsat-derived indices. The Random Forests model found that the most important parameters for the riparian vegetation (based on the Mean Decrease Gini and the Mean Decrease Accuracy) were the distance to the dams, the sea and the river. Our results suggest that management plans of riparian and deltaic areas need to incorporate and take into consideration new innovative management practices and monitoring studies that employ multi-temporal satellite data archives.

Oceanography Of Harmful Algal Blooms On The Ecuadorian Coast (1997-2017): Integrating Remote Sensing And Biological Data,"Ocean climate drivers and phytoplankton life strategies interact in a complex dynamic to produce harmful algal blooms (HABs). This study aims to integrate historical biological data collected during ""red tide"" events along the Ecuadorian coast between 1997 and 2017 in relation to five ocean variables derived from satellite remote sensing data to explain the seasonal drivers of coastal processes associated with HABs dynamics. Seasonality of the occurrence of HABs was assessed in relation to oceanographic variables by applying multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to the Ecuadorian central coast (Zone 1) and at the outer and inner Gulf of Guayaquil (Zone 2). Sixty-seven HABs events were registered between 1997 and 2017. From a total of 40 species of phytoplankton identified, 28 were identified as non-toxic and the remaining 12 are well known to produce toxins. Dinoflagellates were the taxonomic group most highly associated with potential HABs events along the entire Ecuadorian coast. HABs appear to be constrained by the Humboldt coastal upwelling, high precipitation, and associated coastal runoff, with higher biomass abundance in the Gulf of Guayaquil than in the central coast. Results from the MCA reveal that in the central Ecuadorian coast (oligotrophic system), toxic HABs occurred with low abundance of dinoflagellates, while in the Gulf of Guayaquil (eutrophic system), toxic HABs corresponded to a high abundance of dinoflagellates. In both cases, high values were found for sea surface temperature, precipitation, and irradiance-characteristic of wet seasons or El NiÃ±o years. Non-toxic HABs occurred with a high abundance of dinoflagellates, ciliates, and centric diatoms, corresponding to colder waters and low levels of precipitation and irradiance. These findings confirm that dinoflagellates display several strategies that enhance their productive capacity when ocean conditions are warmer, allowing them to produce toxins at high or at low concentrations. Considering that the Gulf of Guayaquil is essential to tourism, the shrimp industry, fisheries, and international shipping, these findings strongly suggest the need to establish an ecosystem health research program to monitor HABs and the development of a preventive policy for tourism and public health in Ecuador.

Soil-Related Predictors For Distribution Modelling Of Four European Crayfish Species,"One of the most critical challenges in species distribution modelling is testing and validating various digitally derived environmental predictors (e.g., remote-sensing variables, topographic variables) by field data. Therefore, here we aimed to explore the value of soil properties in the spatial distribution of four European indigenous crayfish species. A database with 473 presence and absence locations in Romania for Austropotamobius bihariensis, A. torrentium, Astacus astacus and Pontastacus leptodactylus was used in relation to eight digitalised soil properties. Using random forest modelling, we found a preference for dense soils with lower coarse fragments content together with deeper sediment cover and higher clay values for A. astacus and P. leptodactylus. These descriptors trigger the need for cohesive soil river banks as the microenvironment for building their burrows. Conversely, species that can use banks with higher coarse fragments content, the highland species A. bihariensis and A. torrentium, prefer soils with slightly thinner sediment cover and lower density while not influenced by clay/sand content. Of all species, A. astacus was found related with higher erosive soils. The value of these soil-related digital descriptors may reside in the improvement of approaches in crayfish species distribution modelling to gain adequate conservation measures.

Development Of A Spectral-Pattern-Analysis-Based Method For Automated Water Body Extraction Using Landsat Image Data: A Case Study In Central Vietnam And Southern Laos,"Water body mapping is an important application of optical remote sensing. Methods for classifying water bodies using multispectral image data have been successfully developed for water resource monitoring and management. However, in most cases, these traditional methods provide only partial automation capabilities. In this study, we propose a new spectral-pattern-analysis-based (SPAB) method for water body extraction using simplified spectral patterns (SSPs). Simplified spectral patterns are a generalized transformation of spectral patterns from analogue to digital format, realized by nonrepetitive pairwise comparison of reflectance values between two bands. Simplified spectral patterns allow for the direct incorporation of spectral patterns into the recognition process. The advantage of this method compared to traditional methods is that the SPAB method allows automation of water body classification using an SSP database. In this study, we selected a mountainous region in central Vietnam and southern Laos as a study site. Four Landsat 8 OLI scenes from 2015 and four Landsat 7 ETM+ scenes from 2001 and 2002 were used. The results of our proposed method were compared with visual interpretation, normalized differential water index (NDWI) thresholding, and the Global Inland Water (GIW) dataset provided by the Global Land Cover Facility of the University of Maryland. It is concluded that the classification results of the SPAB method agree by more than 98.0% with NDWI results for Landsat 8 OLI images, and by more than 95.0% with the GIW dataset for Landsat 7 ETM+ images.

Effects Of Interannual Variations In Environmental Conditions On Seasonal Range Selection By Mongolian Gazelles,"To examine the effects of interannual variations in environmental conditions on the seasonal range selection and movement pattern of Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa, we compared the summer and winter ranges of satellite tracked gazelles among 3 years, and we analyzed the environmental conditions in the gazelles' seasonal ranges by using a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The movement pattern of the tracked Mongolian gazelles was not regular migration between specific seasonal ranges. The locations of the summer ranges in 2003 and 2004 were similar for all gazelles, but in 2005, when the NDVI values were lower, the animals ranged about 30-70 km farther north, suggesting that the gazelles used areas of similar vegetation availability with former 2 years. The winter ranges were widely separated among years; the longest distance between winter ranges of the same individual in different years was about 340 km. During winter, the NDVI values of the winter ranges of tracked gazelles were almost always higher than or not significantly different from the mean of the 3-year range. Conservation strategies to allow access to wide ranges containing suitable areas in each year for gazelles, which location is changing interannually, are important.

Coffee Certification And Forest Quality: Evidence From A Wild Coffee Forest In Ethiopia,"Shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Assessing The Provisioning Potential Of Ecosystem Services In A Scandinavian Boreal Forest: Suitability And Tradeoff Analyses On Grid-Based Wall-To-Wall Forest Inventory Data,"Determining optimal forest management to provide multiple goods and services, also referred to as Ecosystem Services (ESs), requires operational-scale information on the suitability of the forest for the provisioning of various ESs. Remote sensing allows wall-to-wall assessments and provides pixel data for a flexible composition of the management units. The purpose of this study was to incorporate models of ES provisioning potential in a spatial prioritization framework and to assess the pixel-level allocation of the land use. We tessellated the forested area in a landscape of altogether 7500 ha to 27,595 pixels of 48 x 48 m(2) and modeled the potential of each pixel to provide biodiversity, timber, carbon storage, and recreational amenities as indicators of supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ESs, respectively. We analyzed spatial overlaps between the individual ESs, the potential to provide multiple ESs, and tradeoffs due to production constraints in a fraction of the landscape. The pixels considered most important for the individual ESs overlapped as much as 78\% between carbon storage and timber production and up to 52.5\% between the other ESs. The potential for multiple ESs could be largely explained in terms of forest structure as being emphasized to sparsely populated, spruce-dominated old forests with large average tree size. Constraining the production of the ESs in the landscape based on the priority maps, however, resulted in sub-optimal choices compared to an optimized production. Even though the land-use planning cannot be completed without involving the stakeholders' preferences, we conclude that the workflow described in this paper produced valuable information on the overlaps and tradeoffs of the ESs for the related decision support.

Background and Objectives: We (1) estimate the area of near-natural forests potentially remaining for forest harvesting and wood production, or as green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation and human well-being in rural areas, (2) review how forest and conservation policies have so far succeeded to reduce the loss of mountain forests, and (3) discuss what economic, socio-cultural and ecological values that are at stake, as well as different governance and management solutions. Materials andMethods: First, we estimated the remaining amount of intact mountain forests using (1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory, (2) protected area statistics, (3) forest harvest permit applications and actually harvested forests, (4) remote sensing wall-to-wall data on forests not subject to clear-felling since the mid-1950s, (5) mapping of productive and non-productive forestland, and (6) estimates of mean annual final felling rate. Second, we review policy documents related to the emergence of land use regulation in north Sweden, including the mountain forest border, and illustrate this with an actual case that has had significant policy implementation importance. Results: There is a clear difference between the proportions of formally protected productive forestland above the mountain forest border (52.5\%) and north Sweden in general (6.3\%). A total of 300,000 ha of previously not clear-felled mountain forest outside protected areas remain, which can support novel value chains that are not achievable elsewhere. Conclusions: The mountain forests in Sweden provide unique conservation values in the European Union. Since the beginning of the 1990s, policy regulations have been successful in limiting forest harvesting. Currently, however, mountain forests are a battle ground regarding intensification of forest use, including logging of forests that have never been subject to clear-felling systems vs. nature conservation and wilderness as a base for rural development. The ability of mountain municipalities to encourage sustainable rural forest landscapes must be strengthened.","{""Angelstam, Per"",""Jonsson, Bengt Gunnar"",""Manton, Michael"",""Mikusinski, Grzegorz"",""Svensson, Johan""}",jonsson_europeanunion'sintactforest_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Forest Landscape Restoration: Spectral Behavior And Diversity Of Tropical Tree Cover Classes,"Forest landscape restoration (FLR) commitments have been established in the past years to restore over 200 million hectares, as part of the global Bonn Challenge goal, mostly through the implementation of several different restorative practices in degraded lands, ranging from com-mercial tree monocultures to restoration plantings. The potential of such contrasting restorative practices to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision vary over space and time, making the monitoring of FLR programs an emerging challenge. Remote sensing techniques, together with innovative technologies for data acquisition, treatment, and analysis have proven to be strategic for planning and monitoring FLR, yet there are still important un-resolved questions. Here, we evaluated the potential of multispectral orbital images of the high spatial (5 m) and spectral (12 bands) resolution VEN mu S microsatellite, joint project of the Israeli Space Agency and CNES, to classify the spectral behavior and diversity of six tree cover classes (savanna woodlands, old-and second-growth semi-deciduous forests, young restoration plant-ings, and eucalyptus and pine tree monocultures) commonly found in FLR programs in tropical regions. We assessed how these tree cover classes located in a study landscape in southeastern Brazil differ according to their spectral response (winter and summer bands, and vegetation indices), canopy variability (textural features), seasonal behavior (delta layers -difference be-tween summer and winter vegetation indexes), and spectral diversity, and used these attributes as variables to the model. We used the Random Forest algorithm to generate the models and evaluate how the tree cover classes differ in the classification and how the variables supported the model. We achieved high values of global accuracy (91.9\%) and ""F1 score"" (above 0.8) for all tree cover classes, in which second-growth forest presented the lowest accuracy. The textural layers, delta layers, and the spectral diversity layers were the most important attributes to discriminate among tree cover classes. We demonstrate here the potential of using VEN mu S or similar sensor images together with different image processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor FLR programs, allowing further remote sensing approaches and in-deep field assessments to advance evaluation of FLR benefits for nature and people. We demonstrated how the fusion of all these types of data and innovative approaches to data processing, can result in novel ways to assess restoration performance and open new avenues to upscale monitoring, bridging the gap between FLR expectations and achieved goals.","{""Alves de Almeida, Danilo Roberti"",""Brancalion, Pedro H.

Object-Based Land Cover Change Detection For Cross-Sensor Images,"Accurate and timely land cover change detection at regional and global scales is necessary for both natural resource management and global environmental change studies. Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in land cover change detection over the past three decades. The variety of satellites which have been launched for Earth Observation (EO) and the large volume of remotely sensed data archives acquired by different sensors provide a unique opportunity for land cover change detection. This article introduces an object-based land cover change detection approach for cross-sensor images. First, two images acquired by different sensors were stacked together and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the stacked data. Second, based on the Eigen values of the PCA transformation, six principal bands were selected for further image segmentation. Finally, a land cover change detection classification scheme was designed based on the land cover change patterns in the study area. An image-object classification was implemented to generate a land cover change map. The experiment was carried out using images acquired by Landsat 5 TM and IRS-P6 LISS3 over Daqing, China. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the change map were 83.42\% and 0.82, respectively. The results indicate that this is a promising approach to produce land cover change maps using cross-sensor images.","{""Ban, Y."",""Chen, F."",""Li, B."",""Niu, Z."",""Qin, Y.""}",qin_objectbasedlandcover_2013,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Projecting The Impact Of Air Pollution On Child Stunting In India-Synergies And Trade-Offs Between Climate Change Mitigation, Ambient Air Quality Control, And Clean Cooking Access","Many children in India face the double burden of high exposure to ambient (AAP) and household air pollution, both of which can affect their linear growth. Although climate change mitigation is expected to decrease AAP, climate policies could increase the cost of clean cooking fuels. Here, we develop a static microsimulation model to project the air pollution-related burden of child stunting in India up to 2050 under four scenarios combining climate change mitigation (2 Â°C target) with national policies for AAP control and subsidised access to clean cooking. We link data from a nationally representative household survey, satellite-based estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a multi-dimensional demographic projection and PM2.5 and clean cooking access projections from an integrated assessment model. We find that the positive effects on child linear growth from reductions in AAP under the 2 Â°C Paris Agreement target could be fully offset by the negative effects of climate change mitigation through reduced clean cooking access. Targeted AAP control or subsidised access to clean cooking could shift this trade-off to result in net benefits of 2.8 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.4, 4.2) or 6.5 (UI: 6.3, 6.9) million cumulative prevented cases of child stunting between 2020-50 compared to business-as-usual. Implementation of integrated climate, air quality, and energy access interventions has a synergistic impact, reducing cumulative number of stunted children by 12.1 (UI: 10.7, 13.7) million compared to business-as-usual, with the largest health benefits experienced by the most disadvantaged children and geographic regions. Findings underscore the importance of complementing climate change mitigation efforts with targeted air quality and energy access policies to concurrently deliver on carbon mitigation, health and air pollution and energy poverty reduction goals in India.

A Market-Based Mechanism For Long-Term Groundwater Management Using Remotely Sensed Data,"Groundwater markets improve the agricultural economy by transferring water entitlements from low-efficient users to high-efficient ones to maximize productivity. Aiming at developing an efficient groundwater market, the environmental effects of the market mechanism should be assessed, and a reliable method for monitoring water consumption needs to be employed. Toward this end, this paper proposes three annual smart groundwater market mechanisms to maximize water net benefits, minimize groundwater withdrawal, and precisely measure water consumption in agricultural fields. To guarantee the aquifer's safe yield in each mechanism, a groundwater simulation model (i.e., Groundwater Modeling System (GMS)) is used to control groundwater table drawdown at the end of the planning horizon. In addition, the fields' evapotranspiration (ET) is estimated using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) algorithm to measure the net groundwater consumption during the market. In this regard, we evaluated the algorithms' performances using observed data from a local lysimeter. They are applied to the Nough plain in Iran to assess the effectiveness of the proposed market framework. The findings illustrate their efficiency in recovering approximately 80\% (23.33 million cubic meters (MCM)) of groundwater loss due to overexploitation in the study area and increasing the users' annual benefits by 10.6\% compared to the non -market condition. In addition, results imply that the METRIC model approximates daily crop ET with a higher accuracy level than the SEBAL model with RMSE, MAE, and Percentage Error of 0.37 mm/day, 0.32 mm/day, and 14.92\%, respectively. This research revealed that the proposed market framework is a powerful tool for reallocating water entitlements and increasing water productivity in arid and semi-arid regions.","{""Kerachian, Reza"",""Noory, Hamideh"",""Safari, Safoura"",""Sharghi, Soroush""}",safari_marketbasedmechanismterm_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
An Implementation Of Open Source-Based Software As A Service (Saas) To Produce Toa And Toc Reflectance Of High-Resolution Kompsat-3/3a Satellite Image,"The majority of cloud applications are created or delivered to provide users with access to system resources or prebuilt processing algorithms for efficient data storage, management, and production. The number of cases linking cloud computing to the use of global observation satellite data continues to rise, owing to the benefits of cloud computing. This study aims to develop a cloud software as a service (SaaS) that yields reflectance products in high-resolution Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT)-3/3A satellite images. The SaaS model was designed as three subsystems: a Calibration Processing System (CPS), a Request System for CPS supporting RESTful application programming interface (API), and a Web Interface Application System. Open-source components, libraries, and frameworks were used in this studyâ€™s SaaS, including an OpenStack for infrastructure as a service. An absolute atmospheric correction scheme based on a Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer code with atmospheric variable inputs was used to generate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance products. The SaaS implemented in this study provides users with the absolute atmospheric calibration functionality to apply their KOMPSAT-3/3A satellite image set through a web browser and obtain output directly from this service. According to experiments to check the total performance time for images, bundled with four bands of red, green, blue, and near-infrared, it took approximately 4.88 min on average for the execution time to obtain all reflectance results since satellite images were registered into the SaaS. The SaaS model proposed and implemented in this study can be used as a reference model for the production system to generate reflectance products from other optical sensor images. In the future, SaaS, which offers professional analysis functions based on open source, is expected to grow and expand into new application fields for public users and communities.

"Vascular Epiphytes In An Urban Environment Are Influenced By Tree Characteristics, Climate And Propagule Sources","Urban trees provide multiple benefits for the citizens such as shadow provision and climate regulation. In addition, it can contribute to the conservation of native plants from the ecoregion where the city is located, although there is not much information about it. In this study, species richness, cover and composition of vascular epiphytes were analyzed in urban trees of Gran San Miguel de TucumÃ¡n. We sampled epiphytes over 240 trees in 24 sites located in the localities of Horco Molle, El Corte, Yerba Buena and San Miguel de TucumÃ¡n. We recorded characteristics of trees (i.e., diameter at breast height [DBH], bark type and number of pruned branches) and sites (distance from the nearest source of epiphyte propagules such as sierra San Javier and urban green spaces, temperature and humidity using satellite images). Significant increases of species richness and cover of epiphytes were recorded with tree DBH and rough barks. Both features are important for vascular epiphyte establishment because they allow more surface and time available for colonization and a rough bark accumulates water and organic matter. In addition, epiphyte richness increased in trees closer to Sierra de San Javier, and in sites with lower temperature and higher humidity. The locality of Horco Molle, closer to sierra de San Javier, had a different composition of epiphytes compared to the other localities. Interactions between host trees and vascular epiphytes were similar to those observed in pristine forests of sierra de San Javier. These results are relevant for urban vegetation management because they allow us to consider urban trees as an important contribution to the conservation of native Yungas epiphytes.

Mapping Canopy Nitrogen In European Forests Using Remote Sensing And Environmental Variables With The Random Forests Method,"Canopy nitrogen (N) influences carbon (C) uptake by vegetation through its important role in photosynthetic enzymes. Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) predict C assimilation, but are limited by a lack spatial canopy N input. Mapping canopy N has been done in various ecosystems using remote sensing (RS) products, but has rarely considered environmental variables as additional predictors. Our research objective was to estimate spatial patterns of canopy N in European forests and to investigate the degree to which including environmental variables among the predictors would improve the models compared to using remotely sensed products alone. The environmental variables included were climate, soil properties, altitude, N deposition and land cover, while the remote sensing products were vegetation indices and NIR reflectance from MODIS and MERIS sensors, the MOD13Q1 and MTCI products, respectively. The results showed that canopy N could be estimated both within and among forest types using the random forests technique and calibration data from ICP Forests with good accuracy (r2 = 0.62, RRMSE = 0.18). The predicted spatial pattern shows higher canopy N in mid-western Europe and relatively lower values in both southern and northern Europe. For all subgroups tested (All plots, Evergreen Needleleaf Forest (ENF) plots and Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF) plots), including environmental variables improved the predictions. Including environmental variables was especially important for the DBF plots, as the prediction model based on remotely sensed data products predicted canopy N with the lowest accuracy.

"A Random Forest Algorithm For Landsat Image Chromatic Aberration Restoration Based On Gee Cloud Platform-A Case Study Of Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico","With the growth of cloud computing, the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to conduct research on water inversion, natural disaster monitoring, and land use change using long time series of Landsat images has also gradually become mainstream. Landsat images are currently one of the most important image data sources for remote sensing inversion. As a result of changes in time and weather conditions in single-view images, varying image radiances are acquired; hence, using a monthly or annual time scale to mosaic multi-view images results in strip color variation. In this study, the NDWI and MNDWI within 50 km of the coastline of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula from 1993 to 2021 are used as the object of study on GEE platform, and mosaic areas with chromatic aberrations are reconstructed using Landsat TOA (top of atmosphere reflectance) and SR (surface reflectance) images as the study data. The DN (digital number) values and probability distributions of the reference image and the image to be restored are classified and counted independently using the random forest algorithm, and the classification results of the reference image are mapped to the area of the image to be restored in a histogram-matching manner. MODIS and Sentinel-2 NDWI products are used for comparison and validation. The results demonstrate that the restored Landsat NDWI and MNDWI images do not exhibit obvious band chromatic aberration, and the image stacking is smoother; the Landsat TOA images provide improved results for the study of water bodies, and the correlation between the restored Landsat SR and TOA images with the Sentinel-2 data is as high as 0.5358 and 0.5269, respectively. In addition, none of the existing Landsat NDWI products in the GEE platform can effectively eliminate the chromatic aberration of image bands.

Using Text Mining And Crowdsourcing Platforms To Build Employer Brand In The Us Banking Industry,"Crowdsourcing platforms are a valuable source of information for employees and firms. They have become an essential part of human resource practices, such as recruiting, employee engagement, and the marketing of a company's brand. Crowdsourcing platforms can help enrich an employer's brand, with employee reviews acting as a terra-incognita for the early-stages in the employer branding process. In response to these dynamics, this research explores the employer value proposition preferences and the sentiments of employees in the US banking industry. Approximately 11,000 reviews on the crowdsourcing platform Indeed.com, covering the top 18 banks listed on the Fortune 500, were parsed. The text mining techniques topic modeling and sentiment analysis were carried out using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The topic modeling analysis revealed work-life balance, management, economic, social, and development values as the most preferred employer value proposition, while brand-image, application, and interest values were the least preferred. Sentiment analysis showed that employees exhibit negative sentiments for management, work stress, work-life balance, and economic values, and show positive sentiments for development, social, and interest values. The paper highlights avenues for future research and discusses the managerial and theoretical implications for managers and HR practitioners.

Natural And Anthropogenic Forcings Lead To Contrasting Vegetation Response In Long-Term Vs. Short-Term Timeframes,"Understanding vegetation response to natural and anthropogenic forcings is vital for managing watersheds as natural ecosystems. We used a novel integrated framework to separate the impacts of natural factors (e.g. drought, precipitation and temperature) from those of anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity) on vegetation cover change at the watershed scale. We also integrated several datasets including satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements for a twenty-year time period (2000â€“2019). Our results show that despite no significant trend being observed in temperature and precipitation, vegetation indices expressed an increasing trend at both the control and treated watersheds. The vegetation cover was not significantly affected by the natural factors whereas the watershed management practice (as a human activity) had significant impacts on vegetation change in the long-term. Further, the vegetation cover long-term response to watershed management practice was mainly linear. We also found that the vegetation indices values in the 2011â€“2019 period (as the treated period in treated watershed) were significantly higher than those in the 2000â€“2010 period. In the short-term, however, the drought condition and decreased precipitation (as natural factors) explained the majority of the change in vegetation cover. For example, the majority of the breakpoints occurred in 2008, and it was related to a widespread extreme drought in the area. The watershed management practice as a human activity along with extreme climatic events could explain a large part of the vegetation changes observed in the treated and control watersheds.

Adaptation Of The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation To Map Spatial Distribution Of Soil Erosion In Tropical Watersheds: A Gis/Rs-Based Study Of The Upper Mahaweli River Catchment Of Sri Lanka,"Soil erosion is a serious issue in highland areas of Sri Lanka that are dominated by extensive agricultural activities. Methods capable of rapidly assessing soil erosion are required to determine suitable conservation methods and to monitor their effectiveness to preserve this non-renewable resource. The widely used method of determining soil erosion rate is the use of field measurements and/or empirical modeling. Although the latter method along with the use of GIS/Remote Sensing has become very popular, its main limitations are the lack of model validation and lack of comparison of modeled rates with acceptable soil loss tolerance values. In this study, soil erosion rates of six sub-catchments were calculated with the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) following five different methods in GIS/RS environment and then compared with field-based measurements for verification. The mean modeled soil erosion rates of the six sub-catchments were within 0.12 and 7.70 t ha(-1) y(-1), whereas the field-based rates range from 1.14 to 15.83 t ha(-1) y(-1). Moreover, modeled erosion classes within the sub-catchments were similar to field-based localized erosion rates over different land use types quantified from plot experiments. Hence, we recommend the integration of RUSLE with GIS/RS as an effective tool for soil erosion hazard mapping at the catchment scale. We propose a typical rate of 1 t ha(-1) y(-1) and an upper limit of 2 t ha(-1) y(-1) as the soil loss tolerance level for the study area based on experimentally derived soil production rates. Finally, a soil erosion map of the entire Upper Mahaweli River Catchment was developed using the best method, and then its sub-catchments were ranked according to severity of soil erosion. The methodology adapted here can be used as a guide in land management and soil conservation programs.","{""Hewawasam, Tilak"",""Rambukkange, M. P."",""Somasiri, I.

Evaluating The Ability To Use Contextual Features Derived From Multi-Scale Satellite Imagery To Map Spatial Patterns Of Urban Attributes And Population Distributions,"With an increasing global population, accurate and timely population counts are essential for urban planning and disaster management. Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (<2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral signatures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R-2 values up to 93\%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84\% of the out-of-sample variation for population density.","{""Bedada, Adane"",""Chao, Steven"",""Engstrom, Ryan"",""Mann, Michael""}",chao_evaluatingabilitycontextualfeatures_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Evaluation Of The Impacts Of The ""Uma Terra E Duas Aguas"" Program (P1+2) On The Quality Of Life And Environmental Sustainability Of Beneficiaries In The Semiarid Region Of Ceara, Brazil","Purpose: Social policies for accessing water during droughts have contributed to coexisting with dry periods. One of these policies involves the construction of cisterns through the â€œUm MilhÃ£o de Cisternasâ€ Program (P1MC) and the â€œUma Terra e Duas Ãguasâ€ Program (P1+2). To comprehend the effects of P1+2, this study aims to assess its impacts on the quality of life and environmental sustainability of beneficiaries compared to non-beneficiaries. Method/design/approach: The research was conducted in the municipalities of CanindÃ© and ItapiÃºna, CearÃ¡, and data were collected through questionnaires administered to P1+2 beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. From the data, the Quality of Life Index (QLI) and the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) were calculated for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Results and conclusion: The QLI of beneficiaries was lower than that of non-beneficiaries, suggesting a need for greater monitoring of beneficiaries and potential adaptations. The ESI was higher for beneficiaries, indicating some effect of the program on environmental sustainability. The low ESI for beneficiaries highlights weaknesses in the context of water security in the semiarid region. Research implications: Contributing to the improvement of P1+2, population quality of life, and environmental sustainability. Originality/value: It is a novel research in this region, and it is important to generate data about P1+2 to understand its benefits and propose improvements.

Probabilistic Assessment Of Cloud Fraction Using Bayesian Blending Of Independent Datasets: Feasibility Study Of A New Method,"We describe and evaluate a novel method to blend two observed cloud fraction (CF) datasets through Bayesian posterior estimation. The research reported here is a feasibility study designed to explore the method. In this proof-of-concept study, we illustrate the approach using specific observational datasets from the U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's Southern Great Plains site in the central United States, but the method is quite general and is readily applicable to other datasets. The total sky image (TSI) camera observations are used to determine the prior distribution. A regression model and the active remote sensing of clouds (ARSCL) radar/lidar observations are used to determine the likelihood function. The posterior estimate is a probability density function (pdf) of the CF whose mean is taken to be the optimal blend of the two observations. The data at hourly, daily, 5-day, monthly, and annual time scales are considered. Some physical and probabilistic properties of the CFs are explored from radar/lidar, camera, and satellite observations and from simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5). Our results imply that (a) the Beta distribution is a reasonable model for CF for both short- and long-time means, the 5-day data are skewed right, and the annual data are almost normally distributed, and (b) the Bayesian method developed successfully yields a pdf of CF, rather than a deterministic CF value, and it is feasible to blend the TSI and ARSCL data with a capability for bias correction.

Cooling Effect Of Urban Green And Blue Infrastructure: A Systematic Review Of Empirical Evidence,"Urban green and blue infrastructure (GBI) plays an extremely important role in regulating urban climate and assisting cities to cope with future climate change and enhance urban resilience. This paper presents a comprehensive review of urban green and blue infrastructure researches on cooling effect trends and hotspots, and the distribution of cooling effect studies in different climatic zones. Most studies focused on surface types and configurations, urban parks and water bodies, roof greening (building energy conservation), ecological benefits, thermal comfort, plant communities, etc. through remote sensing imagery, ground measurement, and comprehensive simulation. Most studies were influenced by the research field (perspective) and the research scale dependence of urban green and blue infrastructure cooling effect was extremely obvious. Based on the Koppen climate classification, the research methods, indicators and key issues are different at scale level. Through the analysis of cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure and its influencing factors from the landscape, patch (corridor) and community scale, we found that the cooling effect was mainly affected by the proportion of ecological land, landscape pattern (landscape scale); patch area, underlying surface type (patch scale); and plant configuration, single plant (community scale), etc. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and the results showed that, on average, a park was 1.39 Â°C cooler in temperate climate zone and 3.12 Â°C cooler in continental climate zone. On this basis, this paper summarizes three challenges in the future research on the cooling effect of urban green and blue infrastructure based on the practical needs of urban planning and design: (1) The cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure on city and block scale should be connected to determine key heat mitigation parameters of GBI planning and design, and furthermore provide quantitative indicators for urban green space system planning; (2) The multi-dimensional of the horizontal distribution and vertical transmission spaces on the cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure studies should be integrated, and the characteristics of blocks should be combined to determine the cooling threshold for guiding and optimizing the distribution of GBI in regulatory detailed planning; (3) The pivotal indicators and thresholds of each plant or plant community configurations in heat mitigation should be determined for guiding the plant cooling design on site scale. Further multi-scale and multi-dimensional research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the planning and design of urban green and blue infrastructure in urban growth strategies, and warrants greater consideration in urban planning policy to mitigate the adverse effects of the urban heat islands and enhance climate resilience.

Homomorphic Filtering In Digital Multichannel Image Processing,"Purpose. The purpose of this article is to develop a preprocessing method for digital multispectral remote sensing images obtained through optical and infrared means in the electromagnetic spectrum. The method aims to ensure invariance with respect to positional formation conditions that determine spatial and radiometric resolution. By implementing homomorphic filtering in this method, we can significantly increase the informative value of processed imagery. Methodology. The problem solving, including the development of the spatial and radiometric resolution increase ways for multispectral geospatial data are based on the methods of brightness spatial distribution fusion, methods of data dimension reduction, de-correlation techniques and geometric correction of image spatial distributions. Findings. The method of preprocessing digital remote sensing data has been developed, which is a component of the methodology for identifying geometric shapes (GS) of objects in multi-channel aerospace images, allowing for a significant improvement in their recognition efficiency when noise is present. Originality. The method of preprocessing photogrammetric scenes using homomorphic filtering to enhance their informational significance is proposed. The method ensures invariance to positional conditions of fixation, improves the accuracy of further recognition, eliminates the drawbacks of known methods associated with the existence of parametric uncertainty dependence, the features of fixation of species information, low values of information indices of synthesized images, and computational process peculiarities. Practical value.

River Segmentation Of Remote Sensing Images Based On Composite Attention Network,"River segmentation of remote sensing images is of important research significance and application value for environmental monitoring, disaster warning, and agricultural planning in an area. In this study, we propose a river segmentation model in remote sensing images based on composite attention network to solve the problems of abundant river details in images and the interference of non-river information including bridges, shadows, and roads. To improve the segmentation efficiency, a composite attention mechanism is firstly introduced in the central region of the network to obtain the global feature dependence of river information. Next, in this study, we dynamically combine binary cross-entropy loss that is designed for pixel-wise segmentation and the Dice coefficient loss that measures the similarity of two segmentation objects into a weighted one to optimize the training process of the proposed segmentation network. The experimental results show that compared with other semantic segmentation networks, the evaluation indexes of the proposed method are higher than those of others, and the river segmentation effect of CoANet model is significantly improved. This method can segment rivers in remote sensing images more accurately and coherently, which can meet the needs of subsequent research.","{""Chen, Yunjie"",""Fan, Zhiyong"",""Hou, Jianmin"",""Yan, Fei"",""Zang, Qiang""}",fan_riversegmentationremotesensing_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Mapping Wetland Areas Using Landsat-Derived Ndvi And Lswi: A Case Study Of West Songnen Plain, Northeast China","Increasing interest in wetlands for environmental management requires an understanding of the location, spatial extent, and configuration of the resource. The National Wetlands Inventory is the most commonly used data source for this information. However, its accuracy is limited in some contexts, such as agricultural and forested wetlands. An large number of studies have mapped wetlands worldwide from the perspective of land use and land cover change. However, information on the actual wetland planting areas annually is limited, which greatly impacts ongoing research. In this case study of the West Songnen Plain, we developed a simple algorithm for the quick mapping of wetlands by utilizing their unique physical features, such as annual display of phenological land-cover change of exposed soils, shallow flooding water, and plants from multi-temporal Landsat images. Temporal variations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) derived from Landsat images in 2010 for wetlands at different growth stages were analyzed. Results show that during the ante-tillering phase, the NDVI value (above zero) is lower than the LSWI value of paddies because of flooding of shallow water; during the reproductive and ripening phases, the NDVI value is higher than the LSWI value (above zero); and during the post-harvest wetland planting phase, the NDVI value is still higher than the LSWI value, but the LSWI value is negative. Wetland areas can be detected using one or two images in the optimum time window. The algorithm based on the difference of NDVI and LSWI values derived from Landsat images was used to extract the actual wetland planting area. Validated alongside statistical data, the algorithm showed high accuracy. Therefore, this algorithm highlights the unique features of wetlands and can help in mapping the actual wetland area annually on a regional scale. Results further indicate that the new method has a classification accuracy of 92 \%. In comparison, two traditional methods based on Landsat-7/ETM registered accuracy rates of only 83 \% and 87 \% respectively.","{""Ding, Zhi"",""Dong, Zhangyu"",""Jia, Mingming"",""Li, Lin"",""Liu, Dianwei"",""Song, Kaishan"",""Wang, Zongming""}",dong_mappingwetlandlandsatderived_2014,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Analysing Factors Influencing Fire Frequency In Hwange National Park,"Detection of key factors driving fire frequency, especially in protected areas, is important for effective management of ecosystems. In this study, we used Generalized Linear Models to test the contribution of natural (NDVI, wind speed, dry matter productivity, soil moisture, percentage tree cover, elevation and temperature) and anthropogenic (distance from settlements) factors as predictors of fire frequency in Hwange National Park and adjacent areas. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate the variable contribution to fire frequency. The model results indicated that all the variables that were used contributed significantly to fire recurrence (p < 0.05). Distance from settlements contributed the most to the model whilst dry matter productivity and annual average temperature were second and third respectively. Removal of distance from settlements from the model increased the AIC value to 1411.2 while removal of dry matter productivity and temperature resulted in AICs of 1269.9 and 1265.8 respectively. Results showed that settlements which are found in the vicinity of the protected area influence the recurrence of fires. Findings from this study can be used for strategic fire management and for the development of effective measures to minimize fire recurrence in a protected area.","{""Kavhu, Blessing"",""Ndaimani, Henry""}",kavhu_analysingfactorsinfluencingfire_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

Nature-Based Solutions (Nbs) For Sustainable Development Of The Resource Base And Ecosystem Services Of Marine And Coastal Ecosystems Of India,"The imminent dangers due to increasing anthropogenic stress on the coastal seas, as well as marine pollution in the Anthropocene, have highlighted the need to devise and adopt novel eco-sustainable solutions through the use of technology for India. Special emphasis on the use of scientifically derived marine fishery advisories (MFAs) can have multiple co-benefits with the utilization of nature-based solutions (NbS) for monitoring and management of coastal and marine resource bases. Such co-management options can be effective to realize the targets for Sustainable Development Goals 14 (SDG 14) for 2030. At present, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) provides the MFAs on a daily basis by using a combination of data from satellite imageries and ground-based datasets. However, sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems services needs to be informed by appropriate technological models of resources usage, including the incorporation of coastal zone management plans as per NbS frameworks for achieving long-term successes. The present study highlights the need to adopt NbS and MFAs as co-management approaches for adaptation and/or mitigation of the impacts of climatic and environmental factors as well as for fostering sustainable fishing initiatives for the Bay of Bengal. Such integrative methodologies are crucial for the development of model-based policy frameworks for sustainable marine resources management. Accordingly, an assessment of the NbS techniques for deriving a new adaptive framework is presented and discussed in the context of consideration of MFAs as NbS Assisting Technologies (NAT) to obtain significant co-benefits for sustainable development.

How Safe Is The Safety Paradigm?,"This paper reviews safety initiatives in the health systems of the UK, Canada, Australia, and the US. Initiatives to tackle safety shortcomings involve public-private collaborations. Patient safety agencies (to institute learning, action and safety culture), adverse event reporting and, to a lesser extent, safety related performance indicators are currently used to design safer health systems. Their benefits are mixed, but there is little debate as to their possible side effects. Foreseeable adverse effects of multiple safety organisations stem from them being too many, too vague, too narrowly focused, threatened by the medical practice environment, and too optimistic. Safety related performance indicators are most developed in the US but suffer from inadequacies of administrative data, underreporting, variable indicator definitions, ""extended"" use, and low sensitivity of the diagnosis coding system, and arguable preventability of the prescribed conditions. A critical appraisal of the implications of these deficiencies is important to assure the safety of current health system safety initiatives and to establish evidence based safety. It is necessary to embed health system safety (as well as patient safety) in the societal culture, structures, and policies which promote effective, user centred, high performance care while allowing for healthy innovation.","{""Arah, O.

Extracting Tea Plantations Based On Zy-3 Satellite Data,"Tea is the most consumed natural plant drink in the world, and it plays an important role in human's daily life. The spatial distribution information of tea plantation is helpful for the government management and decision-making. Songyang county is located in southwest part of Zhejiang province, China, and the topography is characterized by basin in the central and surrounded by hills and mountains. The humid and cloudy climate is very suitable for tea planting, which accounts for the large proportion of tea plantation area, 68.5% of county's whole cultivated land. In this paper, ZhangXi Town, ZhaiTan Town, YeCun Town and ZhuYuan Town of SongYang County in Zhejiang Province were chosen as study area, and ZY-3 satellite images acquired on December 25, 2012 and June 9, 2013 were used to study the method of tea plantations extraction. Eight categories including roads, water, buildings, shadows, bare soil, forest, other crops and tea plantation were identified after conducting visual interpretation and field surveys. The decision tree method was adopted to extract the tea plantations. Due to the fact that tea plants in plain areas and mountains areas show different characteristics in their planting patterns, planting area and growth status,, the decision trees were built separately for these two different areas. The threshold values in the decision tree were determined by gradually changing their values in a certain range. Spectral curve analysis shows the range of the difference between band4 (0.77-0.89 Î¼m) and band3 (0.63-0.69 Î¼m) on December 25, 2012 is 20-30. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is almost unchanged or decreased from summer to winter for forest lands as they are covered mainly by evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, bamboo forest and mixed forest. As for tea plant, due to its seasonal harvest and pruning in summer, NDVI in summer is a little lower than that in winter and the threshold value of NDVI difference between summer (June 9, 2013) and winter (December 25, 2012) was 0~0.1.As tea plants are terraced planted along the contour in mountain area, texture features characterized with nearly parallel line trend for tea plantations are presented in the image. The panchromatic data on December 25, 2012 was used to derive texture features. Anisotropic strength with a range of 0 to 1 was obtained after conducting the anisotropic strength algorithm. The classification results with different threshold values were compared with region-of-interest data and threshold values with the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were selected as final threshold. For plain areas, the difference between band4 and band3 was used to roughly exclude roads, water, buildings, bare soil, other crops and part of the forest from tea plantations with the value above 26.Then the threshold value of 0 for NDVI difference between summer and winter was adopted to exclude the remaining forest. Spectral feature and textural feature were both used to extract tea plantations in mountainous areas. The threshold value of 20 for band4 and band3 difference and 0 for NDVI difference between summer and winter were firstly adopted to exclude water, buildings, crops, roads, bare soil and part of forest. And the threshold of 0.35 for anisotropic strength was then adopted to exclude the remaining forest. The classification maps were validated with ground verification data and compared with results derived from neural network (NN) classification. The results show that decision tree method combining with spectral and textural information can significantly improve the classification accuracy. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient in the plain area were 95.00% and 0.85, respectively, increased by 5.46% and 0.19 when compared with NN classification. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient in the mountain area were 92.97% and 0.69, respectively, increased by 7.57% and 0.61 when compared with NN classification. The presented study could provide a reference for government forecasting crop production and preventing disaster for tea plantation.

"The Relationship Of Spatial-Temporal Changes In Fringe Mangrove Extent And Adjacent Land-Use: Case Study Of Kien Giang Coast, Vietnam","Fringe mangroves are recognised as a highly valuable resource due to their provision of multiple ecosystem services. However, accelerating human-pressures on mangrove forests are resulting in the loss of key mangrove ecosystem services. In this paper, we assessed spatial-temporal changes in the extent and width of fringe mangroves, and changes in adjacent land use. The study focused on the Kien Giang Province, Vietnam, for the period 1989-2009. The total mangrove extent was estimated at seven points in tithe using four Landsat TM images (1989, 1992, 2003, and 2006) and three SPOT images (1995, 2003 and 2009). Supervised classification was conducted for image classification and mapping changes using a Maximum Livelihood Classifier approach. Changes in mangrove width were calculated for 2003 and 2009 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis Application. An assessment of the four Landsat TM images showed a significant decrease in mangrove extent for the periods 1989-1992 (-2.7\% yr(-1)) and 2003-2006 (-2.1\% yr(-1)), while a significant increase in mangrove extent was observed during 1992-2003 (0.7\% yr(-1)). SPOT images were used to classify shoreline land cover into four types, namely mangroves; shrimp farms; built-up areas; and bare and wet ground areas. The total loss of fringe mangrove extent was significantly correlated with the increase in extent of other land covers, especially shrimp farms and bare and wet ground, during the period of 2003-2009. The overall accuracy assessment of the classification using 2003 and 2009 SPOT 5 images was 90.1\% and 90.5\% respectively. The overall accuracy assessment of the 2003 Landsat image was 92.1\%. This accuracy in classification of mangroves and non-mangroves showed that use of Landsat images was adequate for assessing spatial-temporal mangrove dynamics when higher spatial resolution satellite images were limited. The results highlight the dynamic nature of fringe mangrove communities in the region, and provide data useful for informing shoreline mangrove rehabilitation, conservation efforts, and national monitoring programs for estimating mangrove values of carbon sequestration and shoreline protection functions in Vietnam.

"Impact Of Peri-Urban Forest Fires On Air Quality And Aerosol Optical And Chemical Properties: The Case Of The August 2021 Wildfires In Athens, Greece","Wildfires occurring near urban areas are known to have exceedingly detrimental impacts on the environment, air quality, economy and human health. In this framework, this study examines the effects of peri-urban forest fires on atmospheric chemical composition, and aerosol physical-optical properties in Athens, Greece, during August 2021. Satellite imagery and air mass trajectories showed advection of intense smoke plumes over Athens from three forest fires persisting for 10 days in the greater Athens area and in Central Greece (Euboea). During August 1â€“20, 2021, daily PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 8.9 to 78.7 Î¼g mâˆ’3, and were associated with high OC levels (2.3â€“27.8 Î¼g mâˆ’3), while BC and BCbb concentrations on smoke-impacted days were 2.6 Î¼g mâˆ’3 and 1.0 Î¼g mâˆ’3, respectively (2â€“3 times higher than August mean levels). During the peak of biomass burning (BB) smoke transport over Athens, daily-average scattering and absorption coefficients at short wavelengths maximized at 313 Mmâˆ’1 and 171 Mmâˆ’1, respectively. There was also a large impact of ambient BrC (brown carbon) absorption (60 Mmâˆ’1), while the OC/EC ratio exhibited characteristically low values (3â€“4), linked to flaming combustion (modified combustion efficiency of 0.97â€“0.99). The absorption Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (1.38) and single scattering albedo (0.74) indicated highly absorbing BB aerosol, deviating from the normal summer patterns. BB-tracers like nssâ€“K+ displayed strong correlations with OC, EC and BC concentrations, as well as with scattering and absorption coefficients. However, forest fires drastically modified the levels of additional chemical species, with enhancements observed for Ca2+, NO3âˆ’, Clâˆ’, and for organic aerosol (OA) components such as BBOA and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Since under climate change conditions, the Mediterranean is anticipated to experience a dramatic rise in the frequency and intensity of wildfires, the results highlight the necessity for prevention and mitigation policies to safeguard urban air quality.

The Global Atmospheric Environment For The Next Generation,"Air quality, ecosystem exposure to nitrogen deposition, and climate change are intimately coupled problems: we assess changes in the global atmospheric environment between 2000 and 2030 using 26 state-of-the-art global atmospheric chemistry models and three different emissions scenarios. The first (CLE) scenario reflects implementation of current air quality legislation around the world, while the second (MFR) represents a more optimistic case in which all currently feasible technologies are applied to achieve maximum emission reductions. We contrast these scenarios with the more pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario. Ensemble simulations for the year 2000 are consistent among models and show a reasonable agreement with surface ozone, wet deposition, and NO2 satellite observations. Large parts of the world are currently exposed to high ozone concentrations and high deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems. By 2030, global surface ozone is calculated to increase globally by 1.5 +/- 1.2 ppb (CLE) and 4.3 +/- 2.2 ppb (A2), using the ensemble mean model results and associated +/- 1 sigma standard deviations. Only the progressive MFR scenario will reduce ozone, by -2.3 +/- 1.1 ppb. Climate change is expected to modify surface ozone by -0.8 +/- 0.6 ppb, with larger decreases over sea than over land. Radiative forcing by ozone increases by 63 +/- 15 and 155 +/- 37 mW m(-2) for CLE and A2, respectively, and decreases by -45 +/- 15 mW m(-2) for MFR. We compute that at present 10.1\% of the global natural terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to nitrogen deposition above a critical load of 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1). These percentages increase by 2030 to 15.8\% (CLE), 10.5\% (MFR), and 25\% (A2). This study shows the importance of enforcing current worldwide air quality legislation and the major benefits of going further. Nonattainment of these air quality policy objectives, such as expressed by the SRES-A2 scenario, would further degrade the global atmospheric environment.","{""Amann, M."",""Atherton, C."",""Bell, N."",""Bergmann, D."",""Bey, I."",""Bouwman, L."",""Butler, T."",""Cofala, J."",""Collins, B."",""Dentener, F."",""Doherty, R."",""Drevet, J."",""Eickhout, B."",""Ellingsen, K."",""Eskes, H."",""Fiore, A."",""Gauss, M."",""Hauglustaine, D."",""Horowitz, L."",""Isaksen, I.

Satellite Detection Of Earlier Wheat Sowing In India And Implications For Yield Trends,"Wheat is a staple crop throughout much of India, but in many areas it is commonly sown past the optimum window for yields. Recent technologies, such as adoption of no-till practices or earlier maturing cotton and rice varieties, have enabled some farmers to sow wheat earlier, but repeatable and publicly available measurements of sow date trends are lacking. Here we utilize satellite measurements since 2000 to estimate sow dates over a decade throughout wheat growing areas in India. Comparisons with ground-based sow dates in Punjab confirmed the reliability of satellite estimates, and data from two independent satellite sensors were used as a robustness check. We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) shifts toward earlier sowing of wheat throughout much of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, with insignificant changes in Punjab. A production-weighted average of the entire region indicates that, on average, wheat was sown 1 week earlier by 2010 than it was at the beginning of the decade. Using previously published experimental estimates of yield gains from earlier sowing, we estimate that an overall yield gain of at least 5\% averaged across India can be explained by the sow date trend. Given that national yield changes since 2000 have been less than 5\%, our results indicate that the sow date shift has been a major factor in yield changes over the past decade, and that the net yield effect of all factors other than sow date has been close to zero, perhaps even negative. The results also indicate that sow dates in much of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are nearing or already at the optimum window for yields, so that yield benefits from sow date shifts will likely diminish in the next decade.

Biodiversity Mapping,"The term 'biodiversity mapping' encompasses a variety of techniques and methodological approaches in identifying and analyzing patterns in plant and animal distributions. Biodiversity mapping is usually a precursor to attempts to protect biodiversity, and is often undertaken in efforts to assess the conservation value of different areas. Usually this work is done to provide a means of prioritizing one area over another for protection. Methods of assessing conservation value are highly contested and have led to several distinct approaches to biodiversity mapping. Traditionally, conservation approaches have typically been focused at the species level. In light of the complex interconnections within and between ecosystems, however, many conservation practitioners are turning toward habitat- or landscape-level approaches, and making increasing use of cartographic techniques to assist with data representation and decision - making - biodiversity mapping. Recent developments in geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing have assisted this shift by facilitating the compilation and analysis of large amounts of complex spatial data. Despite these advances, a lack of sound baseline data remains one of the major challenges in biodiversity mapping. Most biodiversity maps must, therefore, rely on proxy measures of biodiversity to cover these data gaps. Considerable controversy exists over how best to select such proxies and how to deal with error and uncertainty more broadly in biodiversity mapping projects. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Burned Area Mapping For Heilongjiang Basin Based On Modis Time Series Data,"Fire is an important natural disturbance that affects several ecosystems and is also one of the main factors of the terrestrial carbon cycle. As fire modifies the structure and composition of vegetation, it is considered to be an important land management tool. Burned area mapping is an essential step in forest fire research to investigate the relationship between forest fire and climate change and the effect of forest fire on carbon budgets. Traditional data collection of forest fires in field-which are statistically recorded are difficult to manipulate over a large area. The development of the remote sensing technique provides a labor-efficient method for research of land surface processes. At the regional or global scale, in order to obtain a long-time series of burned area maps, a moderate spatial resolution with high temporal resolution remote sensing data is considered as the best alternative. Currently, the most widely used remote sensing data are Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Although the AVHRR provides continuous observations for burned area analyses, some studies have identified several sources of potential errors in burned area discrimination from this sensor, mainly due to its radiometric instability, cloud obscuration, and transmission problems. Most of these problems have been notably reduced in the MODIS sensor, which offers greater spectral, spatial, and radiometric resolution than the AVHRR. This study proposes an algorithm to map areas burned by forest fire using MODIS time series data in Heilongjiang Valley, China. The algorithm is divided into two steps: First, the â€œcoreå†¶pixels were extracted to represent the most possible burned pixels based on a comparison of the temporal change of the Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), the Burned Area Index (BAI), and the MODIS active fire products between pre-and post-fire spatial patterns. Second, a 15-km distance was set to extract the entire burned area near the â€œcore"" pixels. These more relaxed conditions were used to identify the fire pixels for reducing the omission error as much as possible. The algorithm comprehensively considered the thermal characteristics and the spectral change between pre-and post-fire spatial patterns, which were represented by the MODIS fire products and the spectral index, respectively. Heilongjiang province in China was selected as the typical study area to validate the accuracy of the algorithm. The results showed that with the use of the MODIS fire products, the accuracy of the algorithm was improved, with an overall accuracy of 71% and a highest accuracy of 84%. Consequently, the algorithm used in this study produced a long-time series of burned area maps of the study area from 2000 to 2011 with a relatively high accuracy. According to the burned area maps, the study area has been seriously affected by fire disasters on average of 0.53 million ha of burned land each year. The most affected years were 2003 and 2008 with burned areas exceeding 1 million ha. The least affected year was 2010 with a burned area of just 0.18 million ha. The relatively large disparity between the maximum and minimum values of the areas burned by forest fire indicates that there is a fluctuation in the severity of disaster during the studied period.

Sustainability Of Groundwater,"Groundwater fills and flows in the pore-space, fractures, and conduits of geological formations beneath the Earthâ€™s surface, called aquifers. Groundwater is the Earthâ€™s largest non-frozen freshwater reservoir, accounting for more than 97% of the liquid freshwater stock. Groundwater is the worldâ€™s most extracted natural resource with withdrawal rates in the range of 1000km3/year, and about 70% of the pumped groundwater is used for agriculture worldwide. Groundwater is a reliable freshwater resource that moves slowly in the aquifer, providing vital benefits for billions of people worldwide. Groundwater supplies more than half of the drinking water; helps to grow food by supplying approximately 40% of irrigation water; accounts for about one third of freshwater supply for industrial activities; and supports groundwater dependent ecosystems in aquifers, soil, rivers, lakes, wetlands, coastal zones, and marine environments, providing numerous ecosystem services. In addition, groundwater is a geothermal energy resource, which can be used for heating and cooling in urban heat islands as an example. Moreover, groundwater can generally serve as a manageable buffer to droughts, surface water seasonal variations, and floods. However, there are growing concerns over unsustainable groundwater pumping exceeding natural and induced recharge along with groundwater contamination and salinization, and degradation of groundwater dependent ecosystems. For example, more than half of the largest aquifers on Earth are being depleted, given estimates derived from the GRACE satellite mission (Richey etÂ al., 2015). In addition, sustainable management of groundwater resources is critical for climate adaptation strategies, as climate change and variability drive the aquifer recharge, and can change groundwater use. As the world population is nearing 8 billion, these essential benefits and growing concerns call for an action to ensure groundwater sustainability (Gleeson etÂ al., 2019). This article shows that understanding the coupled water-ecology-human system in a participatory water governance framework is critical for sustainable groundwater management. In addition, the article discusses the sustainability challenges of coastal and karst aquifers as examples. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved","{""Castilla-Rho, J."",""El-Kadi, A.

Coastal High-Frequency Radars In The Mediterranean - Part 1: Status Of Operations And A Framework For Future Development,"Due to the semi-enclosed nature of the Mediterranean Sea, natural disasters and anthropogenic activities impose stronger pressures on its coastal ecosystems than in any other sea of the world. With the aim of responding adequately to science priorities and societal challenges, littoral waters must be effectively monitored with high-frequency radar (HFR) systems. This land-based remote sensing technology can provide, in near-real time, fine-resolution maps of the surface circulation over broad coastal areas, along with reliable directional wave and wind information. The main goal of this work is to showcase the current status of the Mediterranean HFR network and the future roadmap for orchestrated actions. Ongoing collaborative efforts and recent progress of this regional alliance are not only described but also connected with other European initiatives and global frameworks, highlighting the advantages of this cost-effective instrument for the multi-parameter monitoring of the sea state. Coordinated endeavors between HFR operators from different multi-disciplinary institutions are mandatory to reach a mature stage at both national and regional levels, striving to do the following: (i) harmonize deployment and maintenance practices; (ii) standardize data, metadata, and quality control procedures; (iii) centralize data management, visualization, and access platforms; and (iv) develop practical applications of societal benefit that can be used for strategic planning and informed decision-making in the Mediterranean marine environment. Such fit-for-purpose applications can serve for search and rescue operations, safe vessel navigation, tracking of marine pollutants, the monitoring of extreme events, the investigation of transport processes, and the connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems. Finally, future prospects within the Mediterranean framework are discussed along with a wealth of socioeconomic, technical, and scientific challenges to be faced during the implementation of this integrated HFR regional network.","{""Aguiar, Eva"",""Bendoni, Michele"",""Berta, Maristella"",""Brandini, Carlo"",""Caceres-Euse, Alejandro"",""Capodici, Fulvio"",""Cardin, Vanessa"",""Cianelli, Daniela"",""Ciraolo, Giuseppe"",""Corgnati, Lorenzo"",""Dadic, Vlado"",""Doronzo, Bartolomeo"",""Drago, Aldo"",""Dumas, Dylan"",""Falco, Pierpaolo"",""Fattorini, Maria"",""Gauci, Adam"",""Gomez, Roberto"",""Griffa, Annalisa"",""Guerin, Charles-Antoine"",""Hernandez-Carrasco, Ismael"",""Hernandez-Lasheras, Jaime"",""Licer, Matjaz"",""Lorente, Pablo"",""Magaldi, Marcello G."",""Mantovani, Carlo"",""Mihanovic, Hrvoje"",""Molcard, Anne"",""Mourre, Baptiste"",""Orfila, Alejandro"",""Revelard, Adele"",""Reyes, Emma"",""Sanchez, Jorge"",""Saviano, Simona"",""Sciascia, Roberta"",""Taddei, Stefano"",""Tintore, Joaquin"",""Toledo, Yaron"",""Ursella, Laura"",""Uttieri, Marco"",""Vilibic, Ivica"",""Zambianchi, Enrico""}",lorente_coastalfrequencyradarsmediterranean_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Multi-Algorithm Comparison For Predicting Soil Salinity,"Soil salinization is one of the most predominant processes responsible for land degradation globally. However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30\% overall samples) at three depths, 010 cm, 1030 cm, 3050 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lins concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 010 cm and 1030 cm depths, whereas for the 3050 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m-1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m-1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m-1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.","{""Biswas, Asim"",""Ding, Jianli"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wang, Fei"",""Yang, Shengtian""}",wang_multialgorithmcomparisonpredicting_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Retrospective Observational Study Of Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance Data During Air Pollution Episodes Across London And Paris In 2014,"Introduction Poor air quality (AQ) is a global public health issue and AQ events can span across countries. Using emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance from England and France, we describe changes in human health indicators during periods of particularly poor AQ in London and Paris during 2014. Methods Using daily AQ data for 2014, we identified three periods of poor AQ affecting both London and Paris. Anonymised near real-time ED attendance syndromic surveillance data from EDs across England and France were used to monitor the health impact of poor AQ. Using the routine English syndromic surveillance detection methods, increases in selected ED syndromic indicators (asthma, difficulty breathing and myocardial ischaemia), in total and by age, were identified and compared with periods of poor AQ in each city. Retrospective Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to identify significant increases in ED attendance data on days with (and up to 3 days following) poor AQ. Results Almost 1.5 million ED attendances were recorded during the study period (27 February 2014 to 1 October 2014). Significant increases in ED attendances for asthma were identified around periods of poor AQ in both cities, especially in children (aged 0-14 years). Some variation was seen in Paris with a rapid increase during the first AQ period in asthma attendances among children (aged 0-14 years), whereas during the second period the increase was greater in adults. Discussion This work demonstrates the public health value of syndromic surveillance during air pollution incidents. There is potential for further cross-border harmonisation to provide Europe-wide early alerting to health impacts and improve future public health messaging to healthcare services to provide warning of increases in demand.

"Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes And Their Influence On The Ecosystem In Chengdu City, China During The Period Of 1992-2018","Due to urban expansion, economic development, and rapid population growth, land use/land cover (LULC) is changing in major cities around the globe. Quantitative analysis of LULC change is important for studying the corresponding impact on the ecosystem service value (ESV) that helps in decision-making and ecosystem conservation. Based on LULC data retrieved from remote-sensing interpretation, we computed the changes of ESV associated with the LULC dynamics using the benefits transfer method and geographic information system (GIS) technologies during the period of 1992-2018 following self-modified coefficients which were corrected by net primary productivity (NPP). This improved approach aimed to establish a regional value coefficients table for facilitating the reliable evaluation of ESV. The main objective of this research was to clarify the trend and spatial patterns of LULC changes and their influence on ecosystem service values and functions. Our results show a continuous reduction in total ESV from United States (US) \$1476.25 million in 1992, to US \$1410.17, \$1335.10, and \$1190.56 million in 2001, 2009, and 2018, respectively; such changes are attributed to a notable loss of farmland and forest land from 1992-2018. The elasticity of ESV in response to changes in LULC shows that 1\% of land transition may have caused average changes of 0.28\%, 0.34\%, and 0.50\% during the periods of 1992-2001, 2001-2009, and 2009-2018, respectively. This study provides important information useful for land resource management and for developing strategies to address the reduction of ESV.","{""Cao, Chunxiang"",""Chen, Wei"",""Ju, Hongrun"",""Lin, Xiaojuan"",""P.

Detecting And Mapping The Spatial Distribution Of Chromoleana Odorata Invasions In Communal Areas Of South Africa Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Remotely Sensed Data,"Alien Invasive Plants (AIPs) have been proclaimed to be a significant non-climatic driver of global change. The Siam weed (Chromoleana odorata) is highly invasive in South African rangelands, with serious environmental, agricultural and socio-economic consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of C.odorata's spatial distribution is necessary for implementing relevant mitigation and management approaches to vulnerable and invaded landscapes. Remotely sensed data offer a viable opportunity for detecting and mapping AIPs spatial extents. Hence, this study sought to compare the value of algorithms (i.e. maximum likelihood and random forest) in detecting and mapping C.odorata's spatial distribution in relation to other land use land cover classes (LULC) using the freely available Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. The findings of the study revealed that the vegetation red edge and near-infrared spectral bands of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI) sensor were the most important spectral variables for discriminating C.odorata from other land cover classes. The random forest algorithm yielded the highest overall classification accuracy of 83\%, outperforming the traditional maximum likelihood classifier (75\%) in classifying C.odorata's spatial distribution. Overall, results demonstrate that the combination of freely available Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data and machine learning random forest algorithm produces the highest accuracies for detecting the spatial distribution of C.odorata, particularly in heterogeneous environments. These results could be beneficial to sustainable rangeland management and the adoption of sitespecific mitigation approaches in areas invaded by C.odorata.","{""Buthelezi, Siphiwokuhle"",""Mutanga, Onisimo"",""Ndlovu, Helen S."",""Odindi, John"",""Sibanda, Mbulisi""}",ndlovu_detectingmappingspatialdistribution_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Estimation Of Spring Wheat Water Use Efficiency By Remote Sensing In The Yingke Oasis Of Heihe Drainage Area,"It has played an important role in precision agriculture for referring to water management, which was accomplished by quantitative remote sensing technology to estimate crop water use efficiency. Moreover, it can be useful to improve the benefit of agricultural water resources. In this study, the selected data were acquired in the growth season of spring wheat. In June, 2008, the field measurement was carried out with synchronization of satellite, airborne passing oasis. Taking production of spring wheat and the water use under the water balance condition as variables, water use efficiency was obtained. The results showed that using remote sensing technology to achieve evaluation of water use efficiency was able to meet the need of agriculture production, and also be worth of application and popularization.","{""Feng, Y.

Robust Particle Swarm Optimization Of Rfms For High-Resolution Satellite Images Based On K-Fold Cross-Validation,"Rational function model (RFM) is one of the most popular methods of geometrically correcting high-resolution satellite images (HRSIs). This model encounters overparameterization problem due to the existence of highly correlated RFM coefficients, namely, rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). Recently, a number of methods have been proposed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal RPCs. Although these algorithms are useful for determining the optimal RPCs, their results are strongly influenced by changes in both initial values and ground control points (GCPs) distribution. To address this problem, this study proposes a modified version of PSO based on the k-fold cross-validation, known as PSO-KFCV, which works well even in the presence of limited GCPs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, four different HRSIs were used. Our experimental results indicate that PSO-KFCV is indeed robust against the initial values and GCPs distribution. In addition, the experiments demonstrated that the proposed method led to significant improvement with respect to state-of-the-art meta-heuristic methods.

Characterizing Land Disturbance In Atewa Range Forest Reserve And Buffer Zone,"Changes in land cover of protected areas and their buffers have serious implications on the conservation of biodiversity within such biomes because land use has been recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity change. Atewa Range Forest Reserve is one of Ghana's Upper Guinea Forests declared as a Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA). But the reserve is under threat from several human disturbances which could impact on the land cover of the reserve.This study examined the spatial and temporal changes in land cover of Atewa Range Forest Reserve and it's buffer between 1986 and 2013 using remote sensing. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification and change detections were undertaken using one Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) image of 1986 and Landsat ETM+ images of 2003 and 2013.The study also investigated the driving forces of LULC and the effectiveness of the Forest and Wildlife Policy of 1994 in the management of the reserve. Results of image classification showed that much of the peripheral closed and open vegetative covers have been converted to farms and bushes with little disturbance within the interior of the reserve. The study revealed that, the conservation management policies were yielding very little results due to a number of policy deficiencies including low staff strength, lack of logistics and low remuneration. Enforcement of legal instruments against illegal logging, small scale mining and farming activities within the reserve, improvement in the staff strength and their condition of service, intensification of public education on the value of forest and the need to protect it are some of the major recommendations that could curb encroachment on the reserve.

Socioeconomic Factors Influencing Land Cover Changes In Rural Areas: The Case Of The Sierra De Albarracin (Spain),"Rural abandonment in mountainous regions is a habitual process that occurs in many countries and has socioeconomic and environmental implications. Land cover changes in Mediterranean mountains resulting from farming abandonment have been associated with certain processes of land degradation. This study employed Landsat satellite images for mapping the land cover changes in 1984 and 2007, south of the Iberian Range (region of Sierra de AlbarracÃ­n, Teruel, Spain). A neural network classification was used to achieve sufficient land cover accuracy. The land cover change analysis revealed an expansion of forestland at the expense of pastureland and abandoned rainfed cropland. These changes were associated with demographic and economic shifts that resulted from a continuous process of rural abandonment. Population reduction has been the natural trend for a century, characterized by massive internal migrations to nearby cities. The dynamic displacement of the population centroid was used to identify the migratory processes in the last century. The primary sector and the associated secondary sector (farming and forestry) were diminished and resulted in a decrease in natural resource exploitation. Economic activity moved towards the tertiary sector, which focuses on rural tourism. The current socioeconomic scenario has unknown future implications for land cover dynamics and their associated ecosystem services values. Thus, monitoring of land cover changes and ecosystem services is required to promote sustainable development in an area that is highly dependent on the conservation of natural resources and ecological services.

Quantifying Aboveground Biomass Dynamics From Charcoal Degradation In Mozambique Using Gedi Lidar And Landsat,"Understanding changes to aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests undergoing degradation is crucial for accurately and completely quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and for environmental monitoring in the context of climate change. Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA's GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendr-stabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 Â± 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 Â± 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events.

Assessing The Impact Of The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami On South Andaman's Coastal Shoreline: A Geospatial Analysis Of Erosion And Accretion Patterns,"The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami significantly impacted the coastal shoreline of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, causing widespread destruction of infrastructure and ecological damage. This study aims to analyze the short- and long-term shoreline changes in South Andaman, focusing on 2004-2005 (pre- and post-tsunami) and 1990-2023 (to assess periodic changes). Using remote sensing techniques and geospatial tools such as the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), shoreline change rates were calculated in four zones, revealing the extent of the tsunami's impact. During the pre- and post-tsunami periods, the maximum coastal erosion rate was -410.55 m/year, while the maximum accretion was 359.07 m/year in zone A, the island's east side. For the 1990-2023 period, the most significant coastal shoreline erosion rate was also recorded in zone A, which was recorded at -2.3 m/year. After analyzing the result, it can be seen that the tsunami severely affected the island's east side. To validate the coastal shoreline measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Landsat-7 and Google Earth was 18.53 m, enabling comparisons of the accuracy of different models on the same dataset. The results demonstrate the extensive impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on South Andaman's coastal shoreline and the value of analyzing shoreline changes to understand the short- and long-term consequences of such events on coastal ecosystems. This information can inform conservation efforts, management strategies, and disaster response plans to mitigate future damage and allocate resources more efficiently. By better understanding the impact of tsunamis on coastal shorelines, emergency responders, government agencies, and conservationists can develop more effective strategies to protect these fragile ecosystems and the communities that rely on them.","{""Kanga, Shruti"",""Kumar, Pankaj"",""Meraj, Gowhar"",""Pandey, Vikas"",""Prajapat, Deepak Kumar"",""Singh, Saurabh"",""Singh, Suraj Kumar""}",singh_assessingimpact2004indian_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Forest Fire Susceptibility And Risk Mapping Using Remote Sensing And Geographical Information Systems (Gis),"Purpose - In a tropical country like Malaysia, forest fire is a very common natural and man-made disaster that prevails in the whole South East Asian region throughout the year. Recently, the haze problem in Malaysia has created a lot of awareness among the government and eco-tourism sectors. Therefore, detection of the hotspot is very important to delineate the forest fire susceptibility mapping. In this study, remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) have been used to evaluate forest fire susceptibility at Sungai Karang and Raja Muda Musa Forest Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia. Frequency ratio model has been applied for the delineation of forest fire mapping for the study area. Design/methodology/approach - Forest fire locations were identified in the study area from historical hotspots data from year 2000 to 2005 using AVHRR NOAA 12 and NOAA 16 satellite images. Various other supported data such as soil map, topographic data, and agro climate were collected and created using GIS. These data were constructed into a spatial database using GIS. The factors that influence fire occurrence, such as fuel type and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), were extracted from classified Landsat-7 ETM imagery. Slope and aspect of topography were calculated from topographic database. Soil type was extracted from soil database and dry month code from agroclimate data. Forest fire susceptibility was analyzed using the forest fire occurrence factors by likelihood ratio method. Findings - A new statistical method has been applied for the forest fire susceptibility mapping. The results of the analysis were verified using forest fire location data with the help of a newly written programming code. The validation results show satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on forest fire location. The GIS was used to analyze the vast amount efficiently, and statistical programs were used to maintain the specificity and accuracy. The result can be used for early warning, fire suppression resources planning and allocation. Originality/value - All data used in this study are original. The forest fire susceptibility mapping has been done in this study area for the first time. A new program has been coded to cross-verify the susceptibility map. The results were also verified with field data and other supporting weather data. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","{""Awang, M. A. B."",""Pradhan, B."",""Suliman, M. D. H.

The Use Of Chronic Disease Risk Factor Surveillance Systems For Evidence-Based Decision-Making: Physical Activity And Nutrition As Examples,"Objective: To highlight the value of continuous risk factor surveillance systems in providing evidence of the impact of, and to inform health promotion interventions. Method: An ongoing risk factor surveillance system involving telephone interviews with approximately n = 600 randomly selected South Australians each month. Trend analysis on physical activity (PA) levels and daily consumption of fruit and vegetables was undertaken. Results: An apparent seasonal trend for fruit consumption and PA was found, with less activity and fruit consumption undertaken in winter months. Overweight/obese adults exercised less than those with normal BMI, and females less than males, although PA rates for both females and overweight/obese adults are rising. There was an increase in vegetable consumption following a major media campaign. Although reported prevalence of the consumption of five or more serves of vegetables daily and the mean number of serves consumed daily has decreased, it is still above pre-campaign rates. Conclusion: Additional information obtained from a risk factor surveillance system, when compared to an annual or point-in-time survey, provides valuable evidence for health professionals interested in measuring and assessing the effectiveness of health promotion interventions.

Wildland Fire Management And Air Quality In The Southern Sierra Nevada: Using The Lion Fire As A Case Study With A Multi-Year Perspective On Pm2.5 Impacts And Fire Policy,"Management of fire is an important and controversial policy issue. Active fire suppression has led to a backlog of fuels, limited the ecological benefits of fire, and reduced short-term smoke impacts likely delaying these emissions to future generations over a larger spatial extent. Smoke impacts can be expected to increase as fire size and intensity increase and the fuel backlog is consumed; whether through reintroduction of fire under desirable conditions or through stand replacing fire. Land Management Agencies would like to increase the use of naturally ignited fires to burn during favorable conditions as a way to reduce catastrophic fires. This study provides information about the levels of air quality impacts expected from these types of fires and discusses some of the policy controversies of managed fire that propagate inconsistencies between agencies and enter the public discourse. The Lion Fire, a primarily low intensity 8,370ha fire that was extensively monitored for Particulate Matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), is used to quantify impacts to air quality. PM2.5 monitoring sites are used to assess exposure, public health impacts, and subsequently quantify annual air quality during a year with a fire that is within the historic normal fire size and intensity for this area. Ground level PM2.5 impacts were found to be localized with 99% of the hourly Air Quality Index readings in the moderate or good category for the sites impacted by the fire. PM2.5 concentrations at sites nearest the fire were below annual federal air quality standards for PM2.5 with annual 98th percentile at the most impacted sites (Johnsondale, Kernville, and Camp Nelson) of 35.0, 34.0, and 28.0Î¼gm-3 respectively. Smoke impacts to PM2.5 concentrations were not found to reach the populated Central Valley. The findings suggest that this type of fire can be implemented with minimal public health impacts thus allowing an opportunity for air and fire managers to alter policy to allow additional burning in an area with severe anthropogenic air pollution and where frequent widespread fire is both beneficial and inevitable. The more extensive air quality impacts documented with large high intensity fire may be averted by embracing the use of fire to prevent unwanted high intensity burns. A widespread increase in the use of fire for ecological benefit may provide the resiliency needed in Sierra Nevada forests as well as be the most beneficial to public health through the reduction of single dose exposure to smoke and limiting impacts spatially.

"An Assessment Of The Vegetation Cover Change Impact On Rainfall And Land Surface Temperature Using Remote Sensing In A Subtropical Climate, Ethiopia","Quantifying the impact of vegetation cover change (VCC) on climatic variables is a gap that the fields of conservation and rehabilitation must address. This study aims to assess VCC and its impacts on rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) in a highly deforested and populated area of Ethiopia. We used (i) Landsat images to analyze VCC using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and threshold method and (ii) Climate Hazard Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRPS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to evaluate rainfall and LST in the area using Mann-Kendall trend (MKT) test. Results show that 4.7\% (210,177 ha) and 2.6\% (116,387 ha) of the area was covered by vegetation in 1985 and in 2017 respectively, which implied that 2.1\% (93,790 ha) of vegetation cover loss over the last 32 years. Although the mean annual rainfall increased from 1981 to 2017 and mean dry season LST increased from 2000 to 2017, the MKT test shows no significant trend with p-values of 0.09 and 0.35 rainfall and LST, respectively. Mean annual rainfall decreased with declining vegetation cover and mean LST increased as vegetation cover declined in central, northern and southeastern parts of the study area. The outputs from this study would provide information to maintain the agro-climatic condition, assure sustainability in resource utilization and proper land use planning and decision making for the concerned stack holders.","{""Fetene, Aramde"",""Hailu, Binyam Tesfaw"",""Nega, Worku""}",nega_assessmentvegetationcoverchange_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Estimating Rangeland Forage Production Using Remote Sensing Data From A Small Unmanned Aerial System (Suas) And Planetscope Satellite,"Rangelands cover ~23 million hectares and support a $3.4 billion annual cattle industry in California. Large variations in forage production from year to year and across the landscape make grazing management difficult. We here developed optimized methods to map high-resolution forage production using multispectral remote sensing imagery. We conducted monthly flights using a Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) in 2017 and 2018 over a 10-ha deferred grazing rangeland. Daily maps of NDVI at 30-cm resolution were first derived by fusing monthly 30-cm sUAS imagery and more frequent 3-m PlanetScope satellite observations. We estimated aboveground net primary production as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) derived from NDVI and light use efficiency (LUE), optimized as a function of topography and climate stressors. The estimated forage production agreed well with field measurements having a R2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 542 kg/ha. Cumulative NDVI and APAR were less correlated with measured biomass (R2 = 0.68). Daily forage production maps captured similar seasonal and spatial patterns compared to field-based biomass measurements. Our study demonstrated the utility of aerial and satellite remote sensing technology in supporting adaptive rangeland management, especially during an era of climatic extremes, by providing spatially explicit and near-real-time forage production estimates.

Improvements In High-Speed Rail Network Environmental Evaluation And Planning: An Assessment Of Accessibility Gains And Landscape Connectivity Costs In Spain,"High Speed Rail (HSR) in Spain began in 1992 and curently has a network of about 3400 km. In this 25-year period, accessibility has progressively increased, and its spatial distribution has changed throughout the territory. This has had important implications for territorial cohesion, which is a strategic planning objective of transport infrastructures in the European Union. However, this increase in HSR has environmental impacts; among other effects, new transport infrastructures imply a loss of landscape structural connectivity. This paper has two objectives: to study the distribution and development of the changes across the territory produced by the arrival of HSR in Spain between 1990 and 2025, by looking at changes in potential accessibility and structural habitat connectivity at the national scale; and to study â€“ at the same scale â€“ the relationship between both variables through the cost of accessibility improvements (socioeconomic variable) in terms of the loss of structural connectivity (environmental variable). All the analyses were done using GIS-based indicators, reported in the literature to be useful at the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) scale. The methodology is applied in different horizon years, namely 1990, 2007, 2016, and new proposed HSR lines to 2025 in Spain. The results show that throughout the whole period (1990âˆ’2025), accessibility improved by 74.7 % due to the extension of HSR. The most important period was 1990âˆ’2007, when the main socio-economic centres were connected by HSR, while connectivity, the environmental variable, declined by âˆ’3.4 %. The greatest connectivity loss was concentrated in 2007âˆ’2016, when the areas with the highest connectivity values in 1990 were the most affected. Our results show that a 1 % increase in accessibility implied a loss of connectivity of 0.03 % in the interval 1990âˆ’2007, while in the second period, the same 1 % increase entailed a 0.17 % loss; in the 2016âˆ’2025 scenario the value is intermediate (0.08). Our work contributes to adapting connectivity studies to the environmental assessment tiers in the transportation sector (i.e. plans, programmes and projects). Each stage has its limitations due to the lack of specific data or problems of spatial scale which must be publicly reported during environmental assessment processes. We also highlight the need for new research to establish a reliable spatial scale to assess the different effects of HSR corridors at the strategic level.

"Assessment Of Spatial Distribution Of Rain-Induced And Earthquake-Triggered Landslides Using Geospatial Techniques Along North Sikkim Road Corridor In Sikkim Himalayas, India","The spatial distribution of landslides is analyzed to understand landslide incidences and triggering factors along North Sikkim Road Corridor in the parts of Sikkim Himalayas. The present study area is also highly prone to landslide which mainly occurred due to heavy rainfall and earthquake. The present study highlights the spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides based on various preparatory factors. In this study 58 rain-induced landslideÂ locations were identified and assessed the spatial distribution. Earthquake triggered landslides were assessed based on the interpretation of pre and post satellite images on 2011 Sikkim earthquake. Therefore, the study attempts to (i) show the inventory map of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides (ii) evaluate the spatial distribution pattern of rain-induced and earthquake-triggered landslides basis of their event controlling parameters (iii) Finally, to show the characteristics of spatial distribution of rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides in the study area. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Ground Control Points (GCP) were used for verification of rainfall induced landslide locations and the improvement of the planimetric accuracy of the Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images from the Google Earth. For the spatial distribution analysis, all raster maps were prepared using GIS techniques. After that, location wise spatial values were extracted both rain-induced and earthquake triggered landslides using multi-data extraction technique in GIS environment. From the present study, it has been observed that the co-seismic landslides initiating under dry conditions could account for steeper slope angles than the rain-induced landslides. It has been also observed that rain-induced landslides on southerly slope facing is maximum, and it decreases with the angle orientation on the northerly slope facing is relatively low. The study also reveals that rain induced and earthquake triggered landslides could be found in the sparsely vegetated areas. The present study is a pathway to develop landslide hazard zonation map, landslide control measures, disaster management, tourism planning and sustainableÂ development in this area.

Evaluation Of Urban Environmental Quality (Ueq) Applied Before And After Land Regularization Process: A Case Study Of Vila Terra Santa - Curitiba/Pr,"This study aimed to evaluate Urban Environmental Quality - UEQ in a land going through a regularization process in irregular settlements located in a Permanent Preservation Area - APP. In order to check the changes in the regularization process, a case study was analyzed: the one of Vila Terra Santa in Curitiba / PR. Primary and secondary data were collected in two different periods of land regularization, the first set in the period between the years of 2000-2007, before the process, and the second one in the period between the years of 2008-2013, after the process. The methodology of Urban Environmental Quality was adapted for this study and consisted of eight categories of analysis with 34 variables and 43 indicators, focused on social and environmental aspects and infrastructure. It was also developed an Urban Environmental Quality Index System - UEQI by category of analysis. For a better evaluation, the values assigned to each variable for each category and, finally, to the final UEQI, were indicated in a system of quality grades from A to E, with A being a extremely satisfactory quality level, and E a very unsatisfactory level, with other 3 classes in between. From the results we observed that there was an improvement in 6 categories of analysis after the regularization process, which were evidenced in 65\% of the 34 variables evaluated by the comparison between the two periods. The final UEQI pointed out an index of 40.15in the previous regularization period, which was framed in class D, therefore in an unsatisfactory quality level. In the second period, the rate was 72.98, classifying the environmental quality of Vila Terra Santa in F, which is very satisfactory. The results of the indices in UEQ demonstrated the feasibility of applying them as a support tool for managers in decision-making.","{""Silva, Gabriela do Vale"",""da Cruz Bezerra, Stella Maris"",""van Kaick, Tamara Simone""}",silva_evaluationurbanenvironmentalquality_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Blue Carbon Ecosystem Monitoring Using Remote Sensing Reveals Wetland Restoration Pathways,"In an era of climate and biodiversity crises, ecosystem rehabilitation is critical to the ongoing wellbeing of humans and the environment. Coastal ecosystem rehabilitation is particularly important, as these ecosystems sequester large quantities of carbon (known in marine ecosystems as ""blue carbon "") thereby mitigating climate change effects while also providing ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits. The recent formal accreditation of blue carbon services is producing a proliferation of rehabilitation projects, which must be monitored and quantified over time and space to assess on-ground outcomes. Consequently, remote sensing techniques such as drone surveys, and machine learning techniques such as image classification, are increasingly being employed to monitor wetlands. However, few projects, if any, have tracked blue carbon restoration across temporal and spatial scales at an accuracy that could be used to adequately map species establishment with low-cost methods. This study presents an open-source, user-friendly workflow, using object-based image classification and a random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine, to accurately classify 4 years of multispectral and photogrammetrically derived digital elevation model drone data at a saltmarsh rehabilitation site on the east coast of Australia (Hunter River estuary, NSW). High classification accuracies were achieved, with > 90\% accuracy at 0.1 m resolution. At the study site, saltmarsh colonised most suitable areas, increasing by 142\% and resulting in 56 tonnes of carbon sequestered, within a 4-year period, providing insight into blue carbon regeneration trajectories. Saltmarsh growth patterns were species-specific, influenced by species' reproductive and dispersal strategies. Our findings suggested that biotic factors and interactions were important in influencing species' distributions and succession trajectories. This work can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration planning and monitoring at coastal wetlands and similar ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to apply this approach to other types of remote sensing imagery and to calculate other rehabilitation co-benefits. Importantly, the method can be used to calculate blue carbon habitat creation following tidal restoration of coastal wetlands.","{""Drummond, Christopher"",""Gaston, Troy"",""Glamore, William"",""Lanceman, Dana"",""Sadat-Noori, Mahmood""}",lanceman_bluecarbonecosystemmonitoring_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Fine Resolution Air Quality Dynamics Related To Socioeconomic And Land Use Factors In The Most Polluted Desert Metropolitan In The American Southwest,"Air pollution kills approximately 4.2 million people every year. As air pollution varies significantly in different urban areas, the assessment of urban emissions is key to taking appropriate actions and formulating policies for sustainable built environments and to promote the wellbeing of people. The overarching goal of this study was to generate fine resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) using Landsat imagery and examine both the socioeconomic inequalities of air pollution exposure and the air quality variation related to different land-use categories. This study has focused on a period of unusual population growth, 2000â€“2010, in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. It was found that socioeconomic factors, vegetation indexes, and land use land cover types are all strong predictors of AOD, and the negative coefficients of socioeconomic values reveal insight into the social inequality of air pollution exposure. Results suggest that the government regulation on air pollution during the study period helped to improve air quality. Meanwhile, planting vegetation to mitigate air pollution should be carefully examined in order to find the right vegetation species and spatial configuration of vegetation cover in urban settings.

"Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of The Bare Soil Cover In The Hetian Basinal Area Of County Changting, China, During The Past 35 Years","The Hetian basinal area in County Changting of Fujian province is one of the most typical soil loss areas reddish soil regions of southern China. Local people and governments have been struggling for the control of the soil l decades. This study used remote sensing technology to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of the bare soil cover in the Hetian basinal area since 1976. The bare soil features were extracted from the Landsat images of 1976, 1988, 1999, 2004 and 2010 using two thematic indices-normalized difference soil index (NDSI) and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI). After converting the original digital number values of the images to at-satellite reflectance, the soil and impervious surface features were enhanced using the two indices, respectively. The soil features were then extracted from the soil-enhanced images. However, the extracted soil information was found to have been mixed with built-up land information due to the spectral confusion between the two categories. Therefore, the NDISI was further used to filter out the unwanted built-up land information from the soil images using a logical tree algorithm, as the NDISI is the index specially designed for highlight impervious surface features represented mainly by built-up lands. Results showed that the nearly thirty-five years of fight for controlling soil loss have greatly reduced bare soil covers in the basinal area. The area of the bare soil cover has been greatly reduced from 159. 17 km2 in 1976 to 51. 98 km2 in 2010. In the three observed periods, 1976-1988, 1988-1999, and 1999-2010, the decrease in bare soil cover was in an accelerate speed, which was km2 per year, -2. 75 km2 per year, and -4. 33 km2 per year for the three periods, respectively. This corresponds major policies issued by the government for the soil loss treatment of the area. Government policies accompanied with effective actions have played a key role in the reducing of the bare soil cover in the Hetian basinal area.","{""Xu, H.""}",xu_spatiotemporaldynamicsbaresoil_2013,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Vegetation Indices As A Tool For Mapping Sugarcane Management Zones,"In precision agriculture, the adoption of management zones (MZs) is one of the most effective strategies for increasing agricultural efficiency. Currently, MZs in sugarcane production areas are classified based on conventional soil sampling, which demands a lot of time, labor and financial resources. Remote sensing (RS) combined with vegetation indices (VIs) is a promising alternative to support the traditional classification method, especially because it does not require physical access to the areas of interest, is cost-effective and less labor-intensive, and allows fast and easy coverage of large areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) to classify sugarcane MZs, compared with the conventional method, in the Brazilian Cerrado biome (savannah), where about half of Brazil ' s sugarcane production takes place. This study used historical crop production data from 5,500 production fields in three agricultural years (2015 to 2018) and NDVI and EVI2 values of 14 images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite from 2015 to 2018 in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Although improvements are still necessary and encouraged, a new methodology of classifying MZs according to VIs was proposed in this study. The NDVI was not correlated with MZs classified using the conventional method, whereas EVI2 was more sensitive to biomass variations between MZs and, therefore, could better discriminate between MZs. The EVI2 values measured in crops aged 180 to 240 days in the rainy season proved to be the best strategy for classifying MZs by RS, where MZ A, for example, had EVI2 of 0.37, compared to MZ E, which had an EVI2 of 0.32.","{""Bufon, Vinicius Bof"",""Leao, Tairone Paiva"",""de Oliveira Maia, Felipe Cardoso""}",deoliveiramaia_vegetationindicestoolmapping_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Examination Of The Relationships Between Urban Form And Urban Public Services Expenditure In China,"This econometric study contributes to the ongoing debate about the costs and benefits of urban form by employing interdisciplinary means-urban planning, econometrics and public administration-to explore the relationship between urban form and urban public services expenditure. In China, particularly, rapid urbanization is accompanied by an increase of urban public services expenditure and a difference in efficiency, which undermines the promotion of urban public service development. The Chinese government has paid great attention to urban sustainable development and promoting urban public services performance; however, until recently there has been a lack of empirical studies exploring the relationship between urban public services expenditure and urban form. Thus, the present research aims to analyze this issue by using relevant indicators based on an econometric model. The results provide a promising basis for improving urban public services expenditure efficiency. Based on the urban area interpreted by remote sensing data and geographic information system, two urban form metrics, the compactness ratio and the elongation ratio, are selected and quantified to describe urban compactness and urban sprawl accurately. Panel data analyses are performed using a cross-sectional dataset of the 30 cities for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 to assess the likelihood of association between indicators of urban form and urban public services expenditure, while controlling for other determinants, such as educational level, income per capita, degree of industrialization, and unemployment rate. The results indicate that urban elongation is positively correlated to per capita urban public services expenditure and urban compactness is insignificantly correlated to it. Thus, it is recommended that policymakers consider the relationship between urban form and public services expenditure as part of urban planning and on-going strategies to promote public service efficiency.","{""Bo, Chunming"",""Liu, Yong"",""Xu, Hengzhou""}",bo_examinationrelationshipsurbanform_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Use Of Continuous Plankton Recorder Information In Support Of Marine Management: Applications In Fisheries, Environmental Protection, And In The Study Of Ecosystem Response To Environmental Change","The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey was conceived from the outset as a programme of applied research designed to assist the fishing industry. Its survival and continuing vigour after 70 years is a testament to its utility, which has been achieved in spite of great changes in our understanding of the marine environment and in our concerns over how to manage it. The CPR has been superseded in several respects by other technologies, such as acoustics and remote sensing, but it continues to provide unrivalled seasonal and geographic information about a wide range of zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa. The value of this coverage increases with time and provides the basis for placing recent observations into the context of long-term, large-scale variability and thus suggesting what the causes are likely to be. Information from the CPR is used extensively in judging environmental impacts and producing quality status reports (QSR); it has shown the distributions of fish stocks, which had not previously been exploited; it has pointed to the extent of ungrazed phytoplankton production in the North Atlantic, which was a vital element in establishing the importance of carbon sequestration by phytoplankton. The CPR continues to be the principal source of large-scale, long-term information about the plankton ecosystem of the North Atlantic. It has recently provided extensive information about the biodiversity of the plankton and about the distribution of introduced species. It serves as a valuable example for the design of future monitoring of the marine environment and it has been essential to the design and implementation of most North Atlantic plankton research.

Assessing The Soil Erosion Control Efficiency Of Land Management Practices Implemented Through Free Community Labor Mobilization In Ethiopia,"This study aimed to assess the influence of conservation practices (P) and cover management (C) on soil loss reduction by determining it at the scale of landscape units in 16 systematically selected watersheds. Focusing on major land management practices implemented through free community labor mobilization, the assessment combined remote sensing techniques, field observation, and expert as well as local knowledge. The results show an average net decrement of 39\% ( +/- 19\%) in the P factor value and 8.9\% ( +/- 21\%) in the C factor value after implementation of land management practices. P factor value reduction is linked to a high area coverage of level structures, while increases in the P factor value are associated with poor quality of structures, inappropriate practices, and wide spacing between structures on steep slopes. C factor value reduction is observed in non-arable shrub- and bushland with enriched area closure, whereas increased C factor values are associated with open access grasslands and untreated croplands. The overall change in P and C factor values resulted in a 42\% ( +/- 28\%) relative soil loss reduction. The demonstrated approach makes it possible to assess spatial and temporal dynamics in the P and C erosion factors and to estimate spatially disaggregated changes in the P and C factor values. This can help to improve parameterization of inputs for erosion modelling and to assess their relative soil loss effect. The approach provides valuable feedback on watershed planning processes and supports informed decisions regarding the appropriate selection of land management practices.

European Copernicus Services To Inform On Sea-Level Rise Adaptation: Current Status And Perspectives,"Sea-level rise is a direct consequence of climate change. Primarily due to ocean thermal expansion and transfer from land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) to the ocean, sea-level rise is therefore an integrated indicator of climate change. Coastal zones and communities are expected to be increasingly threatened by sea level changes, with various adverse and widespread impacts. The European Unionâ€™s Earth Observation Programmed, Copernicus, monitors our planet and its environment, for the ultimate benefit of society. This includes the monitoring of sea level changes and the provision of ancillary fields needed to assess sea-level rise coastal risks, to guide adaptation and to support related policies and directives. Copernicus is organized with a space component, including dedicated Earth Observation satellites (Sentinel missions), and services, which transform the wealth of satellite, in situ and integrated numerical model information into added-value datasets and information usable by scientists, managers and decision-makers, and the wider public. Here, an overview of the Copernicus products and services to inform on sea level rise adaptation is provided. Perspectives from Copernicus services on future evolutions to better inform on coastal sea level rise, associated risks, and support adaptation are also discussed.

Optimizing The Gabor Bandwidth Of Satellite Navigation Signals By Mcs Signal Expression,"Satellite navigation is playing an important role in social life. The performances of the services a navigation system provides are the concern of the builders and users. The signal structure determines the inherent ability of a satellite navigation system to provide these services. Therefore, it is necessary and reasonable to optimize the signal in the initial design. The waveforms of signals in satellite navigation chips are an important aspect of the signal's structure, which impact the characteristics of the autocorrelation function and power spectrum in the time domain and frequency domain. The range accuracy of a navigation system is usually described by its Gabor Bandwidth. The Gabor Bandwidth of the Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation in next-generation GNSS signal systems is not optimal. This paper presents a signal expression based on Multilevel Coded Symbol (MCS) signals, which can describe the fine structure of navigation signals. With this expression, we can optimize the Gabor Bandwidth of the signal, and find out the corresponding MCS vector and chip waveform, so as to get higher range accuracy. The method in this paper, in theory, is of great value in the design of next-generation navigation signals.

Influence Of Urbanization On The Dynamics Of The Urban Vegetation Coverage Index (Vci) In Erechim (Rs),"Vegetation fragments located in urban perimeters provide better environmental conditions for biological diversity and human well-being. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Vegetation Coverage Index (VCI) of the urban perimeter of Erechim, RS, between years 2010 and 2015. Mapping was carried out using World View 2 and Pleiades satellites images with spatial resolution of 0.5 m. Significant difference was found between VCI values of 2010 and 2015, as well as a decrease in the recommended rate in the range of 30% per neighborhood. Due to the influence of increased urbanization, there was reduction of 229.98 hectares in the vegetation coverage area of the urban perimeter during the study period. The expansion of urban areas reduced vegetation fragments and has contributed in an effective manner to the disordered occupation of the city, generating negative impacts to the environment and to the quality of life of the local population.

"Based Real Time Remote Health Monitoring Systems: A Review On Patients Prioritization And Related ""Big Data"" Using Body Sensors Information And Communication Technology","The growing worldwide population has increased the need for technologies, computerised software algorithms and smart devices that can monitor and assist patients anytime and anywhere and thus enable them to lead independent lives. The real-time remote monitoring of patients is an important issue in telemedicine. In the provision of healthcare services, patient prioritisation poses a significant challenge because of the complex decision-making process it involves when patients are considered â€˜big dataâ€™. To our knowledge, no study has highlighted the link between â€˜big dataâ€™ characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process, as well as the inherent challenges involved. Thus, we present comprehensive insights into the elements of big data characteristics according to the six â€˜Vsâ€™: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value and variability. Each of these elements is presented and connected to a related part in the study of the connection between patient prioritisation and real-time remote healthcare monitoring systems. Then, we determine the weak points and recommend solutions as potential future work. This study makes the following contributions. (1) The link between big data characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process is described. (2) The open issues and challenges for big data used in the patient prioritisation process are emphasised. (3) As a recommended solution, decision making using multiple criteria, such as vital signs and chief complaints, is utilised to prioritise the big data of patients with chronic diseases on the basis of the most urgent cases.

Visible And Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Diurnal Variation Calibration For Corn Phenotyping Using Remote Sensing,"Remote sensing coupled with hyperspectral technology has become increasingly popular to investigate plant traits, showcasing its advantages in studying plant growth, health, and productivity. The quality of the collected hyperspectral images is crucial for subsequent data analysis and plant phenotyping studies. However, diurnal variations in spectral characteristics introduce more data variance in canopy reflectance spectra, raising the cost of subsequent analyses and compromising the performance of trait estimation models. In this study, a fixed gantry platform in a cornfield was used to capture visible and near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral images of corn canopies at consecutive time intervals. By applying reference board calibration and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to minimize the effects of ambient light and daily growth, diurnal spectral changes across all involved VNIR wavelengths were investigated. Several distinct diurnal patterns were observed to have close connections with the plantsâ€™ physiological effects. Diurnal calibration models were established at every wavelength by employing the least squares polynomial algorithm, with the highest coefficient of determination reaching 0.84. Moreover, by employing diurnal calibration in canopy spectra processing, the reduction in spectral variance brought about by varying imaging time was evidently exhibited. This study not only reveals the diurnal spectral variation pattern at VNIR bands but also offers a reliable, straightforward, and low-cost approach to improve the quality of remote sensing data and reduce the inherent variance brought about via the different imaging times ensuring that comparable spectral analysis can be performed under relatively fair conditions.

House Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Ieu-Net,"House buildings, as the main place for human activities, can be rapidly and accurately extracted from high-resolution remote sensing images, which is of great significance for promoting remote sensing information in disaster prevention and mitigation and town management. On the basis of deep learning, this paper proposes a pixel-level accurate extraction method for house buildings by using high-resolution remote sensing images.First, in consideration of the lack of pixel features at the edge of a sample image, an IEU-Net model is proposed on the basis of the U-Net model. A new ignore-edges categorical cross entropy function, IELoss, is designed as a loss function. Dropout and BN layers are added to help improve the speed and robustness of model training while fitting. Second, to solve the problem of limited feature richness of the model, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) is introduced into the classification process of the model, together with the remote sensing image RGB band. Lastly, when ignoring the edge prediction method, the best building extraction results can be obtained in the model prediction that corresponds to the IEU-Net model. The remote sensing image data used in this study are 0.8 m true color and infrared band data obtained by multispectral and panchromatic fusion from the GF-2 satellite of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province. A label image is obtained by visually interpreting the images by using ArcGIS software and performing a feature-to-raster transformation on the obtained vector file. Then, a ground truth image of the location of houses and buildings in the remote sensing image is recorded. The MBI and RGB bands are fused, and the corresponding label images are randomly cropped to obtain 500 pieces of 256Ã—256 training data and 100 pieces of 256Ã—256 verification data. Regarding the IEU-Net model r value of 0.5 and the training data as the model input and using the Adam optimization algorithm for back propagation iteration for 100 times help achieve the optimal parameter results.The Overall Accuracy (OA) is 91.86%, and the kappa value is 0.802. To verify the effectiveness of IELoss in the IEU-Net model and the ignore-edges prediction method relative to CELoss and the ordinary prediction method in solving the problem of insufficient edge pixel features, this study continues the comparison by using the values of r of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 (when r is 1.0, IELoss is equivalent to CELoss, and the ignore-edges prediction method is equivalent to the ordinary prediction method). The results show that the OA of the model using IELoss and the ignore-edges prediction method is 5.03% higher than that of the model using CELoss and the ordinary prediction method, and the kappa value is 0.165 higher. To verify the effectiveness of adding MBI to the training data of the model, a comparative experiment is performed by using RGB three-band data as the training set. The prediction result obtained using the MBI-added data set is 1.55% higher than the OA of the RGB band data set. The kappa value is increased by 0.009.The experimental results show that the IEU-Net model effectively solves the problem of insufficient edge pixel features and achieves house and building extraction accuracy with high OA and kappa values. The addition of MBI data can overcome the influence of roads and house building shadows to a certain extent and accurately extract the edge information of house buildings. Therefore, if significant vegetation exists near the houses and buildings in our area of interest, we can consider adding the normalized difference vegetation index to the training set to reduce the impact of the vegetation.

Combining Optical And Acoustic Data To Enhance The Detection Of Caribbean Forereef Habitats,"Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50\%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

A Method To Construct An Environmental Vulnerability Model Based On Multi-Source Data To Evaluate The Hazard Of Short-Term Precipitation-Induced Flooding,"Flood hazards resulting from short-term severe precipitation have caused serious social and economic losses and have posed extraordinary threats to the safety of lives and property. Vulnerability, which reflects the degree of the adverse impact of flooding on a city, the sensitivity of the environment, and the extent to which rescues are possible during flooding, is one of the significant factors of the disaster risk assessment. Because of this, this paper proposes an Environmental Vulnerability Analysis Model (EVAM), based on comprehensively evaluating multi-source remote sensing data. The EVAM includes a two-stage, short-term flood vulnerability assessment. In the first stage, the flood's areal extension and land-use classification are extracted, based on the U-NET++ network, using multi-source satellite remote sensing images. The results from the first stage are used in the second stage of vulnerability assessment. In the second stage, combining multi-source data with associated feature extraction results establishes the Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptive capacity framework. The short-term flood vulnerability index is leveraged through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the entropy method is calculated for an environmental vulnerability evaluation. This novel proposed framework for short-term flood vulnerability evaluation is demonstrated for the Henan Province. The experimental results show that the proportion of vulnerable cities in the Henan Province ranging from high to low is 22.22\%, 22.22\%, 38.89\%, and 16.67\%, respectively. The relevant conclusions can provide a scientific basis for regional flood control and risk management as well as corresponding data support for post-disaster reconstruction in disaster regions.","{""Cui, Chengling"",""Meng, Jian"",""Wang, Mengyao"",""Yang, Runlu"",""Yao, Jiaqi"",""Zhu, Hong""}",zhu_methodconstructenvironmentalvulnerability_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Cost-Effectiveness Of Strategies For Preventing Paediatric Lower Respiratory Infections Associated With Respiratory Syncytial Virus In Eight Chinese Cities,"Background: New monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against RSV with promising efficacy and protection duration are expected to be available in the near future. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities. Methods: We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective. Results: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US$19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts. Conclusions: Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart. Our results can inform the optimal strategy once these preventive interventions are commercially available. Â© 2021 The Author(s)","{""Jit, M."",""Leung, K."",""Liu, D."",""Wu, J.

"Impact Of Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Landscape Structure In The Dry Lands Of Southern Africa: A Case Of The Zambezi Region, Namibia","The study evaluated patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) change in the Zambezi Region, Namibia between 1984 and 2010 using geospatial tools. Spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes were quantified using the post classification change detection method. The images were classified into five land use and land cover classes: forest land, shrub land, bare land, crop/grass land and other land. Landscape metrics were calculated using Fragstats to understand the landscape patterns and structural integrity of the landscape. The results showed that political transition (before and after independence) has resulted in dramatic decreases in patch density and increases in the interspersion and juxtaposition index values. The general pattern of LULC showed that the communal area compared to protected area became structurally diverse and ecologically more fragmented from 1984 to 2010. This study provides a foundation and baseline data demonstrating LULC alteration and landscape context suitable for monitoring future changes of protected and communal areas. Our approach is a novel way to assess the drivers and patterns of LULC under different land tenure types for natural resources conservation and sustainable land management in the dry lands of Southern Africa.","{""Kamwi, J.

Long-Term Change Of Total Suspended Matter In A Deep-Valley Reservoir With Hj-1a/B: Implications For Reservoir Management,"The valley reservoirs service as a critical resource for society by providing drinking water, power generation, recreation, and maintaining biodiversity. Management and assessment of the water environment in valley reservoirs are urgent due to the recent eutrophication and water quality deterioration. As an essential component of the water body, total suspended matter (TSM) hinder the light availability to underwater and then affect the photosynthesis of aquatic ecosystem. We used long-term HJ-1A/B dataset to track TSM variation and elucidating the driving mechanism of valley reservoirs. Taking a typical deep-valley reservoir (Xin'anjing Reservoir) as our case study, we constructed a TSM model with satisfactory performance (R-2, NRMSE, and MRE values are 0.85, 18.57\%, and 20\%) and further derived the spatial-temporal variation from 2009 to 2017. On an intra-annual scale, the TSM concentration exhibited a significant increase from 2.13 +/- 1.10mgL(-1) in 2009 to 3.94 +/- 0.82mgL(-1) in 2017. On a seasonal scale, the TSM concentration in the entire reservoir was higher in the summer (3.36 +/- 1.54mgL(-1)) and autumn (2.74 +/- 0.82mgL(-1)) than in the spring (1.84 +/- 1.27mgL(-1)) and winter (1.44 +/- 2.12mgL(-1)). On a monthly scale, the highest and lowest mean TSM value occurred in June (4.66 +/- 0.45mgL(-1)) and January (0.67 +/- 1.50mgL(-1)), and the monthly mean TSM value increased from January to June, then dropped from June to December. Combing HJ-1A/B-derived TSM, climatological data, basin dynamic, and morphology of the reservoir, we elucidated the driving mechanism of TSM variation. The annual increase of TSM from long-term HJ-1A/B data indicated that the water quality of Xin'anjiang Reservoir was decreasing. The annual increase of phytoplankton jointed with an increase of built-up land and decrease of forest land in the basin may partially be responsible for the increasing trend in TSM. This study suggested that combining the long-term remote sensing data and in situ data could provide insight into the driving mechanism of water quality dynamic and improve current management efforts for local environmental management.","{""Moreno-Madrinan, Max J."",""Shi, Kun"",""Yao, Xiaolong"",""Zhang, Yibo"",""Zhang, Yunlin"",""Zhou, Yongqiang"",""Zhu, Guangwei""}",zhang_termchangetotalsuspended_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Renewable Energy: The Potential Opportunities And Obligations Of Plantation Forestry,"Global demand for woody biomass in substituting fossil fuels does, and will increasingly, place significant pressure on timber plantations and question conventional management practices. Plantations are rationally laid out, located in areas of high productivity, typically have good infrastructure, and are serviced by technologically efficient harvesting systems. Thus they have an inherent capacity to contribute more to bioenergy feedstocks than other, more natural, forms of forest or forest management. Sustainability goals are defined not only in terms of their in situ effect, but also in how they conform and contribute broadly to sustainable development at the local, regional and global levels. Renewable energy is generally recognised as a positive step on the pathway to sustainable development, but biomass-based renewable energy is becoming a controversial issue. In agriculture, the lure of first-generation biofuels is already distorting world food markets, energy crops such as sugar cane and oil palm continue to encroach on natural ecosystems, while in plantation forestry, everything from stumps and roots to branches and needles has taken on a new value. Not only does this threaten the ecological viability of the site, but it poses a challenge to forest management in suggesting a future and more direct competition for raw materials and the livelihoods of other users and satellite industries. Some level of trade-off between the long-term goals of plantation forestry, ecologically sound harvesting practices, and the benefits of renewable energy need to be arrived at. The challenge lies in ensuring an equitable incurrence of liabilities and distribution of benefits for all, while guaranteeing a feasible supply to a long-term investment in an energy conversion plant. Many argue that the free market should play itself out, oblivious to the fact that renewable energy plants are often subsidised. In this paper, we provide a general overview of some of the issues facing plantation forestry and the bioenergy harvest. The paper is presented primarily to stimulate discussion around issues of relevance to the emerging bioenergy sector.","{""Ackerman, P.

Building An Active Medical Product Safety Surveillance System In Taiwan: Adaptation Of The Us Sentinel System Common Data Model Structure To The National Health Insurance Research Database In Taiwan,"Purpose Using real-world data to support regulatory decision has become a global movement. However, a robust platform for active surveillance of medical product safety has not been established in Taiwan. Methods Following the common data model structure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System, we built the Taiwan Sentinel Data Model (TSDM) using the National Health Insurance Research Database with longitudinal claims data from 23 million individuals, linked death and cause of death data from a national registry, and linked electronic health record data from a delivery system. We examined the conversion of the TSDM using the Sentinel Data Quality Review and Characterization Programs in a sample of sex- and age-stratified cohort of 3 million individuals. Results The TSDM fulfilled the requirements of data quality assurance. Only about 6\% of sex and 0.0007\% of birth year were missing, and <0.001\% of date data had illogical values. Conclusions The TSDM-converted database could be a valuable data resource for domestic pharmacovigilance analysis in Taiwan and cross-country evaluation.","{""Hsu, Chien-Ning"",""Huang, Kelly"",""Huang, Ling-Ya"",""Lin, Fang-Ju"",""Ou, Huang-Tz"",""Toh, Sengwee"",""Wang, Chi-Chuan""}",huang_buildingactivemedicalproduct_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Can Suspended Sediment Concentrations Be Estimated From Multispectral Imagery Using Only Image-Derived Information?,"Sampling for suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in inland waters is traditionally based on collecting samples at sparse locations and in limited intervals. A number of investigators explored the utility of earth-observing satellites and air-borne sensors for monitoring of SSC over vast areas. Two approaches are commonly deployed: (1) empirical relationships between a chosen remotely sensed quantity and the actual in-situ SSC; and (2) bio-optical models founded on radiative transfer modeling. Unfortunately, in-situ measurements are often unavailable for direct image calibration, and inherent optical properties of optically active constituents (specific scattering and absorption coefficients) are usually unknown. This paper examines the possibility to retrieve SSC from multispectral satellite imagery without any in-situ data, i.e. using only image-derived information. The fundamental principle of image selfcalibration relies on the fact that in the visual domain of wavelengths (~400-700 nm) the at-sensor reflectance becomes ""saturated"" at high SSC, whereas the near-infrared domain (~700-900 nm) remains almost perfectly linearly related to sediment concentrations. The core idea of the self-calibrating procedure is rather simple and is based on fitting an exponential function between reflectance and SSC, with SSC replaced by a linear relationship between SSC and reflectance in the near-infrared domain. As a first approximation of the non-linearity between reflectance and SSC levels in the 400-700 nm range, we used the equation proposed by Schiebe et al. (1992), although other equations, especially those arising from optical theory could be used as well. The technique is illustrated on a moderately sediment-laden reservoir and two scenes acquired from Landsat ETM+. The standard error of the estimated SSC was below 15 mg/L (i.e.~25 % relative error for the observed range of SSC). Although the proposed algorithm does not yield better results than other models mentioned in the literature, the primary advantage of the outlined methodology is that no in-situ measurements (water sampling nor spectral profiling) are needed - i.e. only image-derived information is used.

Developing And Implementing Major League Baseball's Health And Injury Tracking System,"In 2010, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association reached an agreement regarding the development and implementation of an electronic medical record system and a new league-wide injury surveillance system. The systems were developed to create a more efficient method to track medical histories of players longitudinally as they move across Major and Minor league affiliates, as well as to identify and monitor injury trends in the sport, identify areas of specific concern, and conduct epidemiologic research to better optimize player health and safety. The resulting injury surveillance system, the Health and Injury Tracking System (HITS), is a robust system that includes all players from the both the Major and Minor Leagues. HITS also allows for data linkage with other player- and game-level data to inform the development of injury prevention policies and programs. In the present article, we document the development and implementation of HITS; describe its utility for epidemiologic research; illustrate the potential analytic strength of the surveillance system and its ability to inform policy change; and note the potential for this new surveillance system to advance the field of sports injury epidemiology.

Sustainable Urbanization In The China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor,"Countries in the China-Indochinese Peninsula are home to rich human and natural resource endowments and have the potential to be one of the world's fastest growing areas. Sustainable urbanization in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor is important for the regional economic development and prosperity. Taking the advantages of the remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, this chapter is first presents a general overview of urbanization procession in this region and monitors the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban environment; the second objective is to present the multiple driving force factor analysis for urban development in countries of the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor using statistical models. The results indicated that the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor has experienced a rapid urbanization process during the past 15 years both in terms of urban areas and urban population (UP). In addition to socioeconomic factors, there is also a noticeable correlation between foreign direct investment (FDI) and international trade and urban development in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor. Active participation in international trade and attracting foreign investment are helpful for the regional urbanization. As a neighboring country, China's economic and trade activity also has a significant impact on the urbanization in countries of the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor. Furthermore, as the launch of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor will witness a more rapid urbanization progress in the next decade. This study has its characteristics in focusing on the region of the Indochinese Peninsula in which the most rapid urbanization is occurring, presenting the state-of-the-art techniques for monitoring urban expansion and probing into the driving factors of the urban expansion in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor by multiple principles and multiple-level data. It is expected to benefit policymakers in urban development and also provide a basis for further studies of sustainable urbanization in the China-Indochinese Peninsula Economic Corridor.","{""Fu, Jingying"",""Jiang, Dong"",""Lin, Gang""}",jiang_sustainableurbanizationchinaindochinese_2016,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Overview Of Knowledge Management In Eurad,"Knowledge management is a core activity for the European Member States (MSs) implementing the Council Directive EC 2011/70/EURATOM. Twenty-one MSs and two associated countries have mandated their respective radioactive waste management, safety and research organisations to contribute to the European Joint Programme on Radioactive Waste Management (EURAD). EURAD has established a Knowledge Management and Networking Programme which supports the capturing of knowledge and its transfer among organisations, Member States and generations. EURAD as a Joint Programming has an utmost advantage, compared to individual projects, as it provides: processes for knowledge sharing, for example interaction between the different radioactive waste management (RWM) actors to find out what is already known and what is most useful to investigate further. Resources and people to develop new knowledge and/or to support preservation of existing knowledge at risk, for example access to experts, networks and communities of practice. Tools and technology capable of handling different forms of knowledge, with a focus on socialising, signposting and aggregating existing knowledge sources. This paper intends to describe the role of knowledge management and networking in EURAD, how knowledge generated by EURAD Workpackages and RWM organisations is captured and how we provide added value to MSs. Furthermore, it explains how we cooperate and work together towards common knowledge preservation goals with the EC PREDIS project, IAEA and OECD/NEA, to avoid duplication of work and maximise impact.

Integrating The Jrc Monthly Water History Dataset And Geostatistical Analysis Approach To Quantify Surface Hydrological Connectivity Dynamics In An Ungauged Multi-Lake System,"Determining the dynamics of surface hydrological connectivity in a landscape of multiple lakes with different sizes and depths is challenging. This is especially the case for ungagged, large areas of multi-lake systems. Integrated use of remote sensing and geostatistical analysis can be a useful approach for developing metrics that can be used to identify the hydrological connectivity and their changes. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis of 18 wet and dry binary state rasters derived from Landsat images over a large ungauged multi-lake system, the Momoge National Nature Reserve in Northeast China. Our goal was to investigate applicability and dynamics of three surface hydrological connectivity metrics, namely, geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), and surface water extent (SWE) of the top 10 largest connectomes (i.e., seasonally connected water bodies). We found that, during a dry year, the reduction rate of the GCF curve was slower along the west-east (W-E) direction than along the north-south (N-S) direction, which was contrary to the patterns exhibited in a normal or wet year. The minimum values of the MDC in W-E and N-S directions in the dry year were 22.4 km and 6.3 km, respectively, while the maximum values of the MDC along the above two directions in the wet year were 50.7 km and 65.1 km, respectively. The components and spatial distribution of the top 10 largest connectomes changed dramatically in different months of each hydrological year, resulting in a huge change in the monthly SWE of the top 10 largest connectomes. Overall, this study validated the usefulness of combining remote sensing image analysis with geostatistical methods to quantify the surface hydrological connectivity from different perspectives in an ungauged area. The approach may be applicable to studies in other geographical regions, to guide water resources and wetland management practices.","{""Chen, Yueqing"",""Tan, Zhiqiang"",""Wu, Lili"",""Xu, Y.

Mapping Daily Evapotranspiration At Landsat Spatial Scales During The Bearex'08 Field Campaign,"Robust spatial information about environmental water use at field scales and daily to seasonal timesteps will benefit many applications in agriculture and water resource management. This information is particularly critical in arid climates where freshwater resources are limited or expensive, and groundwater supplies are being depleted at unsustainable rates to support irrigated agriculture as well as municipal and industrial uses. Gridded evapotranspiration (ET) information at field scales can be obtained periodically using land-surface temperature-based surface energy balance algorithms applied to moderate resolution satellite data from systems like Landsat, which collects thermal-band imagery every 16 days at a resolution of approximately 100 m. The challenge is in finding methods for interpolating between ET snapshots developed at the time of a clear-sky Landsat overpass to provide complete daily time-series over a growing season. This study examines the efficacy of a simple gap-filling algorithm designed for applications in data-sparse regions, which does not require local ground measurements of weather or rainfall, or estimates of soil texture. The algorithm relies on general conservation of the ratio between actual ET and a reference ET, generated from satellite insolation data and standard meteorological fields from a mesoscale model. The algorithm was tested with ET retrievals from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance model and associated DisALEXI flux disaggregation technique, which uses Landsat-scale thermal imagery to reduce regional ALEXI maps to a finer spatial resolution. Daily ET at the Landsat scale was compared with lysimeter and eddy covariance flux measurements collected during the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote sensing EXperiment of 2008 (BEAREX08), conducted in an irrigated agricultural area in the Texas Panhandle under highly advective conditions. The simple gap-filling algorithm performed reasonably at most sites, reproducing observed cumulative ET to within 5-10\% over the growing period from emergence to peak biomass in both rainfed and irrigated fields.

Here, we produce the first reference data set and a prototype of a globally consistent forest management map with high spatial detail on the most prevalent forest management classes such as intact forests, managed forests with natural regeneration, planted forests, plantation forest (rotation up to 15 years), oil palm plantations, and agroforestry. We developed the reference dataset of 226 K unique locations through a series of expert and crowdsourcing campaigns using Geo-Wiki (https://www.geo-wiki.org/). We then combined the reference samples with time series from PROBA-V satellite imagery to create a global wall-to-wall map of forest management at a 100 m resolution for the year 2015, with forest management class accuracies ranging from 58\% to 80\%.

"Evaluation Of Trmm Satellite Rainfall Estimates (Algorithms 3b42 V7 & Rt) Over The Santo Antonio County (Goias, Brazil)","The rainfall has a direct influence on the agricultural productivity, being indispensable the knowledge of its spatiotemporal behavior in order to establish trends that will assist in the management of water resources, agricultural planning, hydrological monitoring and prevention of natural disasters. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the TRMM satellite precipitation estimates in relation to the gauge-recorded precipitation. For this, the rainfall data from the weather station located in the municipality of Santo AntÃ´nio de GoiÃ¡s-GO were used, being compared to the TRMM satellite datasets, especially, the algorithms 3B42 Version 7 (V7) and Real Time (RT), during the period from January 1998 to October 2015. The comparison of the TRMM satellite data showed that the ten-day and monthly precipitation records of the 3B42 V7 algorithm showed correlation values of 0.69 and 0.65, respectively, during the rainy season; in the dry season, the correlations were of 0.80 and 0.73. The ten-day concordance index ranged from 0.68 to 0.98 and the monthly concordance index ranged from 0.83 to 0.99. The algorithm 3B42 RT presented lower statistical results when compared to the 3B42 V7. The satellite precipitation estimates showed both trends of over estimation and underestimation; however, the satellite data can help research in the absence of information on the rainfall in the region.

"Ecological And Environmental Effects Of Land Use Change In Rapid Urbanization: The Case Of Hangzhou, China","Land use changes sharply under rapid urbanization, yet its ecological and environmental effects are often neglected in land use decisions. Using the case of Hangzhou, China, we analyze the ecological and environmental effects of land use changes, including ecosystem services value (ESV) and carbon emissions, based on Landsat TM images from 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014. We found significant ecological and environmental effects of land use changes under rapid urbanization. The value of ecosystem services in Hangzhou decreased from 546.7 million USD in 1995 to 448.97 million USD in 2014, and the ratio of ESV to GDP decreased from 5.8% to 0.6%. The net carbon emissions associated with land use changes increased from 4.26 million tons in 1995 to 15.10 million tons in 2014, mainly due to the increase of built-up land carbon emissions and the decrease of forest land carbon sink. The ESV is unevenly distributed spatially and low ESV spread from the central to the peripheral area. We use scenario analysis to illustrate that economic growth and environmental protection could be coordinated by bringing ecological and environmental effects into land use decisions.

The Impact Of Agricultural Land Use Change On Lake Water Quality: Evidence From Iowa,"The environmental impacts of agricultural policies must be quantified to perform full cost-benefit analyses and make informed policy decisions. In this paper I use a unique panel data set to estimate the effect of changes in cropland on lake water quality. Fifteen years of water quality measurements across over 100 lakes are combined with satellite imagery and weather data. Using a dynamic panel data model, I find that the elasticity of water quality to cropland is 0.0535. To understand the policy implications, I estimate a second model to find the elasticity of cropland to crop prices. I combine these estimates to analyze the effect of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). I find that the RFS decreased lake water quality; however, the magnitude of this effect is negligible.(1)","{""Meyer, Kevin""}",meyer_impactagriculturallandchange_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Marine Ecological Footprint Indicates Unsustainability Of The Pohnpei (Micronesia) Coral Reef Fishery,"Throughout the tropics, developing countries and territories are highly dependent on nearshore marine resources for food and income, however information on the sustainability and proper management of these fisheries is lacking. In Pohnpei, Micronesia, the sustainability of a coral reef finfishery was assessed by comparing coral reef fish demand to coral reef biocapacity using a marine ecological footprint (MEF) analysis. Based on geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery, Pohnpei and surrounding atolls have 184.2 km2 of coral reef habitat with a sustainable finfish yield of 573-1118 t yr-1, however total harvest was estimated at 4068 t yr-1, exceeding biocapacity by 360-710%. The MEF was supported by observed impacts to coral reef resources, including (1) long-term declines in fish spawning aggregation density, (2) reductions in mean size, age and fecundity of key commercial species, (3) reliance on undersized fish, and (4) decadal declines in mean size and abundance of fishes of iconic value and critical to ecosystem maintenance. The commercial fishery was responsible for 68% of finfish catch volume, while reef fish consumption, at 93 kg person-1 yr-1, was among the highest in the region. To sustainably meet current demand, up to 833 km2 of additional reef area would be required.

Large-Scale Digital Mapping Of Topsoil Total Nitrogen Using Machine Learning Models And Associated Uncertainty Map,"Understanding the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and factors affecting their concentration and availability is crucial for soil fertility management and sustainable land utilization while quantifying factors affecting soil nitrogen distribution in Qorveh-Dehgolan plain is mostly lacking. This study, thus, aimed at digital modeling and mapping the spatial distribution of topsoil total nitrogen (TN) in Qorveh-Dehgolan plain with an area of 150,000 ha using random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and cubist (CB) algorithms. A total of 130 observation points were collected from a depth of 0 to 30Â cm from topsoil surfaces based on a random sampling pattern. Then, soil physicochemical properties, calcium carbonate equivalent, organic carbon, and topsoil total nitrogen were measured. A number of 51 environmental variables including 31 geomorphometric attributes derived from a digital elevation model with 12.5-m spatial resolution, 13 spectral indices and reflectance from SENTINEL-2 satellite (MSIsensor), and five soil properties and two spatial variables of latitude and longitude were used as covariates for digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen. The most appropriate covariates were then selected by the Boruta algorithm in the R software environment. A standard deviation map was produced to show model uncertainty. The covariate selection resulted in the separation of 14 effective covariates in the spatial prediction of topsoil total nitrogen by using the data mining algorithms. The validation of digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen by RF, DT, and CB models using 20% of independent data showed root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.032, 0.035, and 0.043%; mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0008, 0.001, and 0.002%; and based on the coefficients of determination of 0.42, 0.38, 0.35, respectively. Relative importance (RI) of environmental covariates using the %IncMSE index indicated the importance of two geomorphometric variables of midslope position and normalized height along with SAVI and NDVI remote sensing variables in the spatial modeling and distribution of total nitrogen in the studied lands. The RF prediction and associated uncertainty maps, with show high accuracy and low standard deviation in the most part of study area, reveled low overfitting and overtraining in soil-landscape modeling; so, this model can lead to the development of a digital map of soil surface properties with acceptable accuracy for sustainable land utilization.

"Comparison Between Air Temperature And Land Surface Temperature For The City Of Sao Paulo, Brazil","This study aims to identify the relationship between changes in temperature regarding urbanization processes and seasonality in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, located in the Tropic of Capricorn. The land surface temperature (LST) results were compared to official weather stations measurements, identifying in the springâ€“summer period 65.5% to 86.2% accuracy, while in the autumnâ€“winter period, the results ranged from 58.6% to 93.1% accuracy, when considering the standard deviation and the temperature probe error. The mean MAE and mean RMSE range from 1.2 to 1.9â—¦C, with 83.0% of the values being â‰¤2.7â—¦C, and the coefficient of determination values are R = 0.81 in springâ€“summer and R = 0.82 in autumnâ€“winter. Great thermal amplitude was estimated in the springâ€“summer season, with a difference in LST of the built-up space and rural area ranging from 5.8 and 11.5â—¦C, while in the autumnâ€“winter season, the LST is more distributed through the city, with differences ranging from 4.4 to 8.5â—¦C. In addition, the current study suggests remote sensing as a reliable, cheap, and practical methodology to assist climate in order to support public policies and decision-making actions regarding environmental and urban planning.

Mapping The Total Phosphorus Concentration Of Biosolid Amended Surface Soils Using Landsat Tm Data,"Conventional methods for soil sampling and analysis for soil variability in chemical characteristics are too time-consuming and expensive for multi-seasonal monitoring over large-scale areas. Hence, the objectives of this study are: 1) to determine changes in chemical concentrations of soils that are amended with treated sewage sludge; and 2) to determine if LANDSAT TM data can be used to map surface chemical characteristics of such amended soils. For this study, we selected two fields in NW Ohio, designated as F34 and F11, that had been applied with 34 and 11Â ton acre- 1 of biosolids, respectively. Soil samples from a total of 70 sampling locations across the two fields were collected one day prior to LANDSAT 5 overpass and were analyzed for several elemental concentrations. The accumulation of Ba, Cd, Cu, S and P were found to be significantly higher in the surface soils of field F34, compared to field F11. Regression equations were established to search for algorithms that could map these five elemental concentrations in the surface soils using six, dark-object-subtracted (DOS) LANDSAT TM bands and the 15 non-reciprocal spectral ratios derived from these six bands for the May 20, 2005, LANDSAT 5 TM image. Phosphorus (P) had the highest R2 adjusted value (67.9%) among all five elements considered, and the resulting algorithm employed only spectral ratios. This model was successfully tested for robustness by applying it to another LANDSAT TM image obtained on June 5, 2005. Our results enabled us to conclude that LANDSAT TM imagery of bare-soil fields can be used to quantify and map the spatial variation of total phosphorous concentration in surface soils. This research has significant implications for identification and mapping of areas with high P, which is important for implementing and monitoring the best phosphorous management practices across the region.

How The Air Clean Plan And Carbon Mitigation Measures Co-Benefited China In Pm2.5 Reduction And Health From 2014 To 2020,"China implemented a stringent Air Clean Plan (ACP) since 2013 to address environmental and health risks caused by ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, the policy effectiveness of ACP and co-benefits of carbon mitigation measures to environment and health are still largely unknown. Using satellite-based PM2.5 products produced in our previous study, concentration-response functions, and the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of premature deaths attributable to PM(2.5 )exposure, and quantitatively estimated the policy benefits of ACP and carbon mitigation measures. We found the annual PM2.5 concentrations in China decreased by 33.65 \% (13.41 lig m(-3)) from 2014 to 2020, accompanied by a decrease in PM2.5-attributable premature deaths of 0.23 million (95 \% confidence interval (CI): 0.22-0.27), indicating the huge benefits of China ACP for human health and environment. However, there were still 1.12 million (95 \% CI: 0.79-1.56) premature deaths caused by the exposure of PM2.5 in mainland China in 2020. Among all ACP measures, clean production (contributed 55.98 \% and 51.14 \% to decrease in PM(2.5 )and pre-mature deaths attributable to PM2.5) and energy consumption control (contributed 32.58 \% and 29.54 \% to decrease in PM2.5 and premature deaths attributable to PM2.5) made the largest contribution during the past seven years. Nevertheless, the environmental and health benefits of ACP are not fully synergistic in different regions, and the effectiveness of ACP measures reduced from 2018 to 2020. The co-effects of CO2 and PM2.5 has become one of the major drivers for PM(2.5 )and premature deaths reduction since 2018, confirming the clear environment and health co-benefits of carbon mitigation measures. Our study suggests, with the saturation of clean production and source control, more targeted region-specific strategies and synergistic air pollution-carbon mitigation measures are critical to achieving the WHO's Air Quality Guideline target and the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Target in China.","{""Atkinson, Peter M."",""Chang, Jinfeng"",""Fang, Xuekun"",""Hu, Bifeng"",""Jiang, Yefeng"",""Shi, Zhou"",""Wang, Zhige"",""Wang, Zifa"",""Xu, Kang"",""Zhang, Ce""}",wang_aircleanplancarbon_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Spatial Grain Effects Of Urban Green Space Cover Maps On Assessing Habitat Fragmentation And Connectivity,"The scientific evaluation of landscape fragmentation and connectivity is important for habitat conservation. It is strongly influenced by the spatial resolution of source maps, particularly in urban environments. However, there is limited comprehensive investigation of the spatial grain effect on urban habitat and few in-depth analysis across different urban gradients. In this paper, we scrutinize the spatial grain effects of urban green space (UGS) cover maps (derived from remote sensing imagery and survey data) with respect to evaluating habitat fragmentation and connectivity, comparing among different urban gradient scenarios (downtown, urban periphery, and suburban area) in Hangzhou, a megacity in China. The fragmentation was detected from three indices, including Entropy, Contagion, and Hypsometry. Then morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was applied for the landscape element identification. The possibility of connectivity (PC) and patch importance (dPC) were proposed for measuring the landscape connectivity based on Cores and Bridges from MSPA results. The results indicate that the farther the location is from downtown, the less sensitive the landscape element proportion to the spatial resolution. Among the three fragmentation indices, the overall hypsometry index has the lowest sensitivity to the spatial resolution, which implies this index's broader application value. Considering connectivity, high spatial resolution maps are appropriate for analyzing highly heterogeneous urban areas, while medium spatial resolution maps are more applicable to urban periphery and suburban area with larger UGS patches and less fragmentation. This study suggests that the spatial resolution of UGS maps substantially influence habitat fragmentation and connectivity, which is critical for decision making in urban planning and management.","{""An, Wenzhan"",""Gan, Muye"",""Huang, Lingyan"",""Huang, Lu"",""Lin, Yue"",""Shahtahmassebi, AmirReza"",""Wang, Ke"",""Ye, Ziran"",""Zhang, Jing"",""Zhu, Congmou""}",lin_spatialgraineffectsurban_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Spatial Overlap Of Black-Browed Albatrosses With Longline And Trawl Fisheries In The Patagonian Shelf During The Non-Breeding Season,"Incidental mortality in fisheries is the main at-sea threat albatrosses are facing nowadays. In this study we used remote sensing techniques to model the degree of spatial overlapping between the Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and Argentine fisheries, assuming this as a proxy of risk for albatrosses. Eleven tags were deployed on albatrosses during the non-breeding seasons 2011 and 2012 in the Patagonian Shelf. Their distribution overlapped to different extents with the two coastal trawl, three offshore trawl and one demersal long-line fisheries. The overlap index showed highest values with both coastal fleets, followed by the ice-chilling trawl fleet. These intersections were located in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, in coastal areas of the SE of Buenos Aires province, El Rincon estuary and over the shelf break. The analysis of intersections of focal areas from albatrosses and all fisheries allowed the identification of thirty-four fishing management units (1 degrees by 1 degrees grid within the Argentine EEZ) classified as of medium, high or very high conservation priority. Very high priority units were placed between 35 and 38 degrees S in the external mouth of Rio de la Plata, and between 45 and 47 degrees s in neighboring waters East to the hake fishing closure. Although there were possible biases due to the limited number of tracked birds and the locations where albatrosses were captured and instrumented, the information presented in this study provides a comprehensive picture of important areas of overlapping during winter that could be used by the fishery administration to prioritize conservation actions under limited resource scenarios.

Effect Of Urbanization On The Dynamics Of Ecosystem Services: An Analysis For Decision Making In Kolkata Urban Agglomeration,"Urbanization has profound influence on the changes of land use and land cover, which on the other hand exert significant impact on ecosystem services and their values, especially in the urban agglomerations. Kolkata urban agglomeration of India has been selected to determine the causes in changes of ecosystem services under present and projected land use land cover scenario. Land use land cover maps of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were prepared by support vector machine method, using LANDSAT satellite imageries and projected up-to 2040 using CA-Markov model. Built-up land was increased by 65.39\% during 1990-2020 and will further increase to 76.88\% by 2040. Built-up lands are mainly encroaching crop lands and wetlands. During the period of fifty years (1990-2040), the ecosystem service value will decrease from \$38,486.49 to \$28,060.79, with annual rate of decrement of 0.54\%. During the same period, the spatial extent of very low ecosystem service value will be increased from 16.60 to 58.88\%; whereas, the area coverage of very high ecosystem service value will be decreased from 2.69 to 2.35\%. Water supply contributed highest ecosystem service value followed by disturbance regulation and nutrient cycling; whereas, lacking in soil formation, pollination and biological control services contributed lowest. The study will help in decision making process for sustainable management of natural resources and also provide useful guideline for the quality improvement in urban ecosystems.","{""Adhikary, Partha Pratim"",""Bera, Biswajit"",""Das, Subhasis"",""Kumar Shit, Pravat""}",das_effecturbanizationdynamicsecosystem_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Mapping Of Soils And Land-Related Environmental Attributes In Modern Agriculture Systems Using Geomatics,"The need for reliable information about soil water has become increasingly necessary in recent times. Which represent an important input data into ecological, hydrological, or land surface models. A total number of 460 soil samples were collected to perform inverse distance weighting (IDW) estimates to map some soil quality properties. Moreover, soil profiles were used to apply geo-statistical analysis. Maps were produced with available soil information on soil texture and organic matter. Their unknown reliability hampers the estimation of the accuracy of models that rely on soil information. The hydraulic properties of field soils can improve predictions for such models using remote sensing data (RS). Scientific study and models application at various geographic scales can both benefit from a reliable soil water map. It is also essential for the development and spatial implementation of the comprehensive soil quality index (SQ) planned in the examined study. The assessment of soil suitability for agricultural purposes was based on important physical, chemical and environmental parameters. It is indicated that 81\% of the samples fall within the moderately appropriate category S-2. These samples are found in the upper and middle parts of the investigated area. The remaining percentage (19\%), located in the south of the region, was marginally suitable for class S-3. The calculated coefficients were also used in addition to estimating the suitability of irrigation. Accordingly, most areas are unsuitable for (surface) irrigation under natural conditions and require a special type of irrigation method. Improving irrigation management techniques and using appropriate plants is the basis of irrigation water management according to soil characteristics.","{""AbdelRahman, Mohamed A.

Classification Of Expansive Grassland Species In Different Growth Stages Based On Hyperspectral And Lidar Data,"Expansive species classification with remote sensing techniques offers great support for botanical field works aimed at detection of their distribution within areas of conservation value and assessment of the threat caused to natural habitats. Large number of spectral bands and high spatial resolution allows for identification of particular species. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data provide information about areas such as vegetation structure. Because the species differ in terms of features during the growing season, it is important to know when their spectral responses are unique in the background of the surrounding vegetation. The aim of the study was to identify two expansive grass species: Molinia caerulea and Calamagrostis epigejos in the Natura 2000 area in Poland depending on the period and dataset used. Field work was carried out during late spring, summer and early autumn, in parallel with remote sensing data acquisition. Airborne 1-m resolution HySpex images and LiDAR data were used. HySpex images were corrected geometrically and atmospherically before Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation and vegetation indices calculation. Based on a LiDAR point cloud generated Canopy Height Model, vegetation structure from discrete and full-waveform data and topographic indexes were generated. Classifications were performed using a Random Forest algorithm. The results show post-classification maps and their accuracies: Kappa value and F1 score being the harmonic mean of producer (PA) and user (UA) accuracy, calculated iteratively. Based on these accuracies and botanical knowledge, it was possible to assess the best identification date and dataset used for analysing both species. For M. caerulea the highest median Kappa was 0.85 (F1 = 0.89) in August and for C. epigejos 0.65 (F1 = 0.73) in September. For both species, adding discrete or full-waveform LiDAR data improved the results. We conclude that hyperspectral (HS) and LiDAR airborne data could be useful to identify grassland species encroaching into Natura 2000 habitats and for supporting their monitoring.

A Multi-Source Heterogeneous Data Fusion Method For Landslide Monitoring With Mutual Information And Ipso-Lstm Neural Network,"Objectives: Based on the interaction characteristics of various environmental factors affecting landslide deformation, a new method for multiâ€‘source heterogeneous monitoring data fusion is proposed to improve the accuracy of landslide deformation prediction. Methods: First, environmental factors are selected based on mutual information method.Then,the selected environmental factors are taken as the input variaâ€‘bles of long shortâ€‘term memory(LSTM) model,and the accumulated displacement data of landslide are taken as the expected output data,and the parameters of the model are optimized through improved particle swarm optimization method, so as to further improve the prediction accuracy of the fusion model.The global navigation satellite system(GNSS) data of Fa'er landslide in Shuicheng County, Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province are analyzed. Results: Experimental results show that the improved particle swarm optimization(IPSO)â€‘LSTM neural network data fusion algorithm, based on mutual information is suitable for landslide deformation prediction with multiâ€‘source heterogeneous monitoring data.The environmental factor variable selection method based on mutual information is better than Pearson correlation coefficient selection method. After optimizing the parameters of the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, the prediction accuracy of the fusion model is higher. Conclusions: The proposed fusion prediction model has high prediction accuracy in landslide cumulative displacement prediction,which has important reference value for improving the reliability of landslide monitoring and early warning. It should be noted that only a few typical environmental factors are collected. In practical application, other factors such as groundwater level, soil moisture and human activities can be considered to further improve the prediction accuracy and reliability of the fusion model.

Tamsat-Alert V1: A New Framework For Agricultural Decision Support,"Early warning of weather-related hazards enables farmers, policy makers and aid agencies to mitigate their exposure to risk. We present a new operational framework, Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground based measurements-AgricuLtural EaRly warning sysTem (TAMSAT-ALERT), which aims to provide early warning for meteorological risk to agriculture. TAMSAT-ALERT combines information on land-surface properties, seasonal forecasts and historical weather to quantitatively assess the likelihood of adverse weather-related outcomes, such as low yield. This article describes the modular TAMSAT-ALERT framework and demonstrates its application to risk assessment for low maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale). The modular design of TAMSAT-ALERT enables it to accommodate any impact or land-surface model driven with meteorological data. The implementation described here uses the well-established General Large Area Model (GLAM) for annual crops to provide probabilistic assessments of the meteorological hazard for maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale) throughout the growing season. The results show that climatic risk to yield is poorly constrained in the beginning of the season, but as the season progresses, the uncertainty is rapidly reduced. Based on the assessment for the period 2002-2011, we show that TAMSAT-ALERT can estimate the meteorological risk on maize yield 6 to 8 weeks in advance of harvest. The TAMSAT-ALERT methodology implicitly weights forecast and observational inputs according to their relevance to the metric being assessed. A secondary application of TAMSAT-ALERT is thus an evaluation of the usefulness of meteorological forecast products for impact assessment. Here, we show that in northern Ghana (Tamale), the tercile seasonal forecasts of seasonal cumulative rainfall and mean temperature, which are routinely issued to farmers, are of limited value because regional and seasonal temperature and rainfall are poorly correlated with yield. This finding speaks to the pressing need for meteorological forecast products that are tailored for individual user applications.

"Integrating Gis And Fuzzy Logic For Urban Solid Waste Management (A Case Study Of Sanandaj City, Iran)","The city of Sanandaj with population of 340000 in 2003 produces 714 tons of solid waste per day. Waste dumping is the main method of solid waste disposal during the thirty past years.

So in the near future, the severe environmental impacts will threats the health of Sanandaj's inhabitants. The research attempts to integrate fuzzy logic and GIS with the help of Remote Sensing in selecting the most suitable area for the waste disposal. In this study we georeferenced many data which ranges from physical to socio-economic to monitor the impacts of all different factors. Some of these factors are; distance from the legal limits of the city, distance from main road, airport, main urban utilities, other human settlements, surface water resources, wind direction, population density, gradient, fault line, vegetation cover and geology.

Subpixel Land-Cover Classification For Improved Urban Area Estimates Using Landsat,"Urban areas are Earth's fastest growing land use that impact hydrological and ecological systems and the surface energy balance. The identification and extraction of accurate spatial information relating to urban areas is essential for future sustainable city planning owing to its importance within global environmental change and human-environment interactions. However, monitoring urban expansion using medium resolution (30-250 m) imagery remains challenging due to the variety of surface materials that contribute to measured reflectance resulting in spectrally mixed pixels. This research integrates high spatial resolution orthophotos and Landsat imagery to identify differences across a range of diverse urban subsets within the rapidly expanding Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR), Western Australia. Results indicate that calibrating Landsat-derived subpixel land-cover estimates with correction values (calculated from spatially explicit comparisons of subpixel Landsat values to classified high-resolution data which accounts for over {[}under] estimations of Landsat) reduces moderate resolution urban area over (under) estimates by on an average 55.08\% for thePMR. This approach can be applied to other urban areas globally through use of frequently available and/ or low-cost high spatial resolution imagery (e. g. using Google Earth). This will improve urban growth estimations to help monitor and measure change whilst providing metrics to facilitate sustainable urban development targets within cities around the world.","{""Biggs, Eloise"",""Boruff, Bryan"",""MacLachlan, Andrew"",""Roberts, Gareth""}",maclachlan_subpixellandcoverclassification_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

Ecocultural Networks As Grounds For Spatial Planning. A Psychosocial Approach Applied To Coastal Development,"Purpose This work critiques the situation of the ecological and cultural heritage in many coastal territories and analyses how current land planning methodologies are responding to it. The study builds a new integrated approach founded on ecocultural values and local knowledge as resources for an effective territorial planning and sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach The proposed framework was developed through: (1) analysing coastal planning needs and problems in European coastal areas; (2) identifying ecocultural values, including local knowledge, in such areas; (3) selecting best approaches and tools in spatial planning; (4) applying the selected planning approaches to use ecocultural values as resources for spatial planning and sustainable development; and (5) validating the final methodology. Findings A dynamic approach for maritime-land planning was developed projecting coastal waters and river basins as strategic drivers for sustainable development, based on the natural capacity of water to shape and integrate the ecological and cultural territory. A participatory governance planning methodology supports the new articulations of space based on ecocultural value chains and networks as synergistic vectors, focusing on local knowledge as psychosocial capital for a collective mapping of cultural, historical, social, economic and ecological values into ecocultural littoral plans. Originality/value The results show the potentials of combining new approaches applying cultural and ecological heritage into an effective strategy of integration between society and territory as a powerful driver for effective sustainable planning and development.","{""Angel Gandarillas, Miguel"",""McCall, Michael K.""}",angelgandarillas_ecoculturalnetworksgroundsspatial_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Mapping An Alien Invasive Shrub Within Conservation Corridors Using Super-Resolution Satellite Imagery,"Alien invasive plant species are one of the main drivers of global biodiversity loss. Methods for monitoring the spread of alien invasive plants are needed to improve management and mitigate impact on local biodiversity. Recent advances in deep learning and image fusion holds great potential for mapping and managing alien invasive plants. One such method is super-resolution image reconstruction, where a neural network learns to downscale images from coarse to fine resolution. Within the commercial timber production landscape of KwaZulu-Natal, endangered grassland corridors are threatened by American bramble invasion, impacting plants, birds, arthropods, and soil restoration. Here we aim to improve our understanding of bramble invasion dynamics through using super-resolved satellite mosaics. Bramble was classified with very high accuracies (85\%) from the super-resolved satellite mosaic, compared to other conventional satellite imagery with different spectral and spatial resolutions. Using landscape analyses, we identified plantation tree harvesting and prescribed burning to be major drivers increasing bramble cover within the landscape. Bramble cover was highest one year following plantation tree harvesting. Continuous prescribed burning positively influenced bramble. Bramble cover was also high close to streams, and under future invasion projections, bramble will severely impact Ensifera species alongside low priority grasshopper species habitat. Results also indicate that bramble has a significant negative impact on intermediate priority grasshoppers and plant species richness. For controlling bramble invasion within commercial timber production landscapes, we recommend the adoption rotational harvesting, as harvesting entire plantation blocks throughout the landscape will dramatically increase invasion potential of bramble. Current bramble removal programmes should prioritize riparian areas. Special attention is needed to control bramble one year after timber harvesting, as this is when bramble cover is highest. We show the benefits of using super-resolved mosaics to gain new insights into alien invasive species dynamics, while further development of this technique will aid in managing invasive alien plant species at local scales.","{""Latte, Nicolas"",""Pryke, James S."",""Samways, Michael J."",""Theron, Jurie""}",theron_mappingalieninvasiveshrub_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Integrating Soil Moisture Retrieved From L-Band Microwave Radiation Into An Energy Balance Model To Improve Evapotranspiration Estimation On The Irrigated Oases Of Arid Regions In Northwest China,"Irrigated oases are the main water consumers in arid and semi-arid regions. As plant evapotranspiration (ET) in these regions mainly depends on irrigated water, accurate quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) on the irrigated oases is crucial for allocation and management of irrigation water resources. In this study, we integrated the soil moisture retrieved from Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometer (PLMR) into the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model for improving ET estimates under water stress conditions. The study area is the irrigated oasis in the middle reaches of the Heihe River where airborne and satellite-borne remotely sensed data as well as in situ observations are available through the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (Hi WATER). The main goal of this experiment is to monitor the energy-water exchange between near-surface atmosphere and land surface, and to assess its influencing factors within the oasis-desert ecosystem. The soil moisture data were retrieved using the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model fed with the airborne dual-polarized and multi-angular viewing of PLMR. The comparison of soil moisture retrieval from PLMR data with the soil moisture measured by a wireless sensor network (WSN) showed good consistency, with an absolute mean error (ME) <0.004 cm(3) cm(-3) and a root mean square error (RMSE) value <0.05 cm(3) cm(-3). Further, the actual daily evapotranspiration was estimated using the soil moisture integrated (SM-integrated) SEBS algorithm fed with the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images and soil moisture data retrieved from PLMR data. The sensible heat fluxes and daily evapotranspiration-(ETdatiy) obtained by the SM-integrated SEBS and the original SEBS were compared with the eddy correlation (EC) measurements collected from HiWATER experiment. The results indicate an obvious improvement when soil moisture information is integrated into the SEBS. This method overcomes the weakness of remote sensing based (RS-based) surface energy balance models of overestimating evapotranspiration particularly in semi-arid and arid regions. It shows a prospect that the combination of optical and microwave remote sensing can further improve the RS-based ET estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Impacts Of Changes In Mangrove Ecosystems In The Ba And Rewa Deltas, Fiji Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data And Social Survey","Despite the expected importance, the changes in mangrove ecosystems and the main causes in Fiji have not been well addressed. To address the issues, we collected data from multiple sources to assess mangrove ecosystem variation due to both natural factors and human impacts in the Ba and Rewa deltas, Fiji. Landsat satellite data were used to map the land use and cover of the study area from 2000 to 2020. Questionnaire surveys were conducted to identify the main uses of mangroves that could influence mangrove ecosystems. Over the period investigated, the mangrove area increased by 572 ha (by 12\%) in Ba and decreased by 697 ha (by 9\%) in Rewa. The social survey revealed that 45\% of respondents in the Ba delta and 20\% in the Rewa delta visited the mangrove area daily in search of food resources. The net annual economic loss and lost functioning of mangroves as an anthropogenic CO2 reservoir caused by mangrove degradation in the two deltas were estimated to be 335,000 USD and 202 t-C, respectively. Because local livelihoods are strongly linked with mangroves, the outcomes of this study will provide preliminary information for policy interventions to ensure the sustainability of the mangrove ecosystem.","{""Avtar, Ram"",""Fujii, Masahiko"",""Navia, Miliana"",""Sassen, Jone""}",avtar_impactsmangroveecosystemsba_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
An Assessment Of The Accuracy Of Modis Land Surface Temperature Over Egypt Using Ground-Based Measurements,"Space-based data have provided important advances in understanding climate systems and processes in arid and semi-arid regions, which are hot-spot regions in terms of climate change and variability. This study assessed the performance of land surface temperatures (LSTs), retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua platform, over Egypt. Eight-day composites of daytime and nighttime LST data were aggregated and validated against near-surface seasonal and annual observational maximum and minimum air temperatures using data from 34 meteorological stations spanning the period from July 2002 to June 2015. A variety of accuracy metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of LST, including the bias, normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE), Yule-Kendall (YK) skewness measure, and Spearman's rho coefficient. The ability of LST to reproduce the seasonal cycle, anomalies, temporal variability, and the distribution of warm and cold tails of observational temperatures was also evaluated. Overall, the results indicate better performance of the nighttime LSTs compared to the daytime LSTs. Specifically, while nighttime LST tended to underestimate the minimum air temperature during winter, spring, and autumn on the order of -1.3, -1.2, and -1.4 degrees C, respectively, daytime LST markedly overestimated the maximum air temperature in all seasons, with values mostly above 5 degrees C. Importantly, the results indicate that the performance of LST over Egypt varies considerably as a function of season, lithology, and land use. LST performs better during transitional seasons (i.e., spring and autumn) compared to solstices (i.e., winter and summer). The varying interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially the differences between sensible and latent heat fluxes, contribute largely to these seasonal variations. Spatially, LST performs better in areas with sandstone formations and quaternary sediments and, conversely, shows lower accuracy in regions with limestone, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. This behavior can be expected in hybrid arid and semi-arid regions like Egypt, where bare rocks contribute to the majority of the Egyptian territory, with a lack of vegetation cover. The low surface albedo of igneous and limestone rocks may explain the remarkable overestimation of daytime temperature in these regions, compared to the bright formations of higher surface albedo (i.e., sandy deserts and quaternary rocks). Overall, recalling the limited coverage of meteorological stations in Egypt, this study demonstrates that LST obtained from the MODIS product can be trustworthily employed as a surrogate for or a supplementary source to near-surface measurements, particularly for minimum air temperature. On the other hand, some bias correction techniques should be applied to daytime LSTs. In general, the fine space-based climatic information provided by MODIS LST can be used for a detailed spatial assessment of climate variability in Egypt, with important applications in several disciplines such as water resource management, hydrological modeling, agricultural management and planning, urban climate, biodiversity, and energy consumption, amongst others. Also, this study can contribute to a better understanding of the applications of remote sensing technology in assessing climatic feedbacks and interactions in arid and semi-arid regions, opening new avenues for developing innovative algorithms and applications specifically addressing issues related to these regions.","{""El Kenawy, Ahmed M."",""Hereher, Mohamed E."",""Robaa, Sayed M.""}",elkenawy_assessmentaccuracymodisland_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Integrating Forest Cover Change And Carbon Storage Dynamics: Leveraging Google Earth Engine And Invest Model To Inform Conservation In Hilly Regions,"Forests are vital in combating climate change by storing and sequestrating CO2 from the atmosphere. Measuring the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) changes on the capacity of carbon storage (CS) within forest eco-systems presents a significant challenge. This study employs remote sensing techniques to examine the changes in spatiotemporal patterns of CS in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), resulting from LULC alterations between 1996 and 2021. LULC change patterns were identified for six different years utilizing the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model was combined with GEE to evaluate the changing patterns of CS. The study discovered that the CHT region experienced a loss of 21.65 x 10(6) Mg of CS, owing to a 21\% reduction in vegetation cover (2862.85 km<\^{}>2) during the study period. The central city area (Chittagong) accounted for the most significant loss of CS (7.99 x 10(6) Mg), while the suburban areas of Khagrachari (0.92 x 10(6) Mg) and Rangamati (3.53 x 106 Mg) contributed the least. The multiple regression model revealed that elevation and vegetation characteristics significantly influenced CS. The findings underscore the importance of developing policies and strategies that mitigate the adverse effects of land cover change on CS, and advocate for sustainable forest management practices that strike a balance between ecological, social, and economic concerns.","{""Al Kafy, Abdulla"",""Bakshi, Arpita"",""Duti, Bushra Monowar"",""Fattah, Md.

Detecting Montane Flowering Phenology With Cubesat Imagery,"Shifts in wildflower phenology in response to climate change are well documented in the scientific literature. The majority of studies have revealed phenological shifts using in-situ observations, some aided by citizen science efforts (e.g., National Phenology Network). Such investigations have been instrumental in quantifying phenological shifts but are challenged by the fact that limited resources often make it difficult to gather observations over large spatial scales and long-time frames. However, recent advances in finer scale satellite imagery may provide new opportunities to detect changes in phenology. These approaches have documented plot level changes in vegetation characteristics and leafing phenology, but it remains unclear whether they can also detect flowering in natural environments. Here, we test whether fine-resolution imagery (<10 m) can detect flowering and whether combining multiple sources of imagery improves the detection process. Examining alpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park (MORA), we found that high-resolution Random Forest (RF) classification from 3-m resolution PlanetScope (from Planet Labs) imagery was able to delineate the flowering season captured by ground-based phenological surveys with an accuracy of 70% (Cohen's kappa = 0.25). We then combined PlanetScope data with coarser resolution but higher quality imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10-m Sentinel and 30-m Landsat), resulting in higher accuracy predictions (accuracy = 77%, Cohen's kappa = 0.39). The model was also able to identify the timing of peak flowering in a particularly warm year (2015), despite being calibrated on normal climate years. Our results suggest PlanetScope imagery holds utility in global change ecology where temporal frequency is important. Additionally, we suggest that combining imagery may provide a new approach to cross-calibrate sensors to account for radiometric irregularity inherent in fine resolution PlanetScope imagery. The development of this approach for wildflower phenology predictions provides new possibilities to monitor climate change effects on flowering communities at broader spatiotemporal scales. In protected and tourist areas where the flowering season draws large numbers of visitors, such as Mt. Rainier National Park, the modeling framework presented here could be a useful tool to manage and prioritize park resources.

"Monte-Carlo Value Analysis Of High-Throughput Satellites: Value Levers, Tradeoffs, And Implications For Operators And Investors","High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) are a distinctive class of communication satellites that provide significantly more throughput per allocated bandwidth than traditional wide-beam communication satellites. They are the proverbial wave of creative disruption in the space industry and are poised to disrupt the communication market in significant ways. The objective of this work is to develop a decision-analytic framework for assessing the value of High-Throughput Satellites and to provide meaningful results of the value of such systems under realistic design, operational, and market conditions. We develop the cost and revenue models of HTS. To build the revenue model, we develop a hybrid data-driven and scenario-based load factor model that combines historical data based on financial records from current HTS operators with extrapolations based on best-, nominal-, and worst-case scenarios. We then integrate the cost and revenue models within a stochastic simulation environment and perform Monte-Carlo analysis of the net present value (NPV) of HTS. One important result is that a medium-sized HTS significantly outperforms a roughly equivalent traditional wide-beam satellite, even under the worst-case loading scenario. Another important result, here identified and quantified, is the tradeoff between the average revenue per user (ARPU) and average loading of the satellite and how it is mediated by the downlink speed provided to consumers. This result can be used in different ways, for example, by helping define the boundaries of what is competitively achievable in terms of ARPU and downlink speed offerings. The implications of these results are that they delineate the pathways to financial failure and the boundaries beyond which an HTS will be value-negative, or alternatively, the asymptotic minimum values for an HTS to be value-positive.","{""Geng, Fan"",""Gomez, David B."",""Guan, Yue"",""Saleh, Joseph Homer""}",geng_montecarloanalysisthroughput_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Use Of Multi-Temporal Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi) Data For Assessing Forest Cover Change Of Lawarchara National Park,"Lawachara National Park (LNP) is one of the most renowned protected areas in Bangladesh and a natural habitat of critically endangered Hoolock gibbon. TheÂ study's purpose was to assess the long-term change of forest cover using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) technique and evaluate the impact of co-management. Landsat images acquired from the USGS glovis website were used to assess forest cover change using NDVI, a popular technique for identification and estimation of forest areas. NDVI value ranges from (âˆ’ 1) to (+ 1); a negative value indicates non-vegetated areas including water bodies, road surfaces, settlements, etc., whereas a positive value near (+ 1) indicates the highest density vegetation. NDVI value (0) indicates bare land without vegetation. Based on NDVI values, the forest areas have been divided into four categories, namely: (1) very low or no vegetation area, (2) low-density vegetation area, (3) moderate-density vegetation area, and (4) dense vegetation area. A household survey was carried out among the people living in the adjacent villages to LNP. The study of assessing the forest cover change of LNP using remotely sensed data revealed that, after the initiation of co-management, the dense vegetation area increased by 8.62% in 2006 compared to 2001, but it decreased by 0.77% in 2014. In 2018, dense vegetation decreased by 3.86% relative to the dense vegetation area of 2014. If it is compared as a whole, it can be said that the forest cover has improved under co-management, and the household survey revealed that forest dependence has been reduced which might be considered as one of the reasons for forest cover improvement. However, more improvement can be achieved by focusing on the villages where forest dependence is still high. Betel leaf cultivation inside the forest area is creating a problem for wildlife and also hampering the natural composition of flora. Therefore, it is recommended to rehabilitate betel leaf cultivators outside the forest area with proper compensation. This will harness the full potentiality of the co-management practice, it needs complete monitoring and goodwill from every stakeholder, and hence it will bring good for the whole country.

A Nonparametric Approach To Filling Gaps In Satellite-Retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth For Estimating Ambient Pm2.5 Levels,"Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) is commonly used to estimate ambient levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), though it is important to mitigate the estimation bias of PM2.5 due to gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. A nonparametric approach with two random-forest submodels is proposed to estimate PM2.5 levels by filling gaps in satellite-retrieved AOD. This novel approach was employed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 levels during 2013-2015 in the Sichuan Basin of Southwest China, where the coverage rate of composite AOD retrieved by the Terra and Aqua satellites was only 11.7\%. Based on the retrieved AOD and various covariates (including meteorological conditions and land use types), the first random-forest submodel (named AOD-submodel) was trained to fill the gaps in the AOD dataset, giving a cross-validation R-2 of 0.95. Subsequently, the second random-forest submodel (named PM2.5-submodel) was trained to estimate the PM2.5 levels for unmonitored areas/days based on the gap-filled AOD, ground-monitored PM2.5 levels, and the covariates, and achieved a cross-validation R-2 of 0.86. By comparing the complete and incomplete (i.e., without the days when AOD data were missing) estimates, we found that the monthly PM2.5 levels could be overestimated by 34.6\% if the PM2.5 values coincident with AOD gaps were not considered. The newly developed approach is valuable for deriving the complete spatiotemporal distribution of daily PM2.5 from incomplete remote sensing data, which is essential for air quality management and human exposure assessment.

Monitoring Of Chlorophyll-A And Suspended Sediment Concentrations In Optically Complex Inland Rivers Using Multisource Remote Sensing Measurements,"In recent decades, phytoplankton proliferation and sediment input to rivers (especially urban rivers) have become more dramatic under the compound pressure of climate change and human activities. Given the generally narrow width of rivers and current high spatial resolution satellites, which are limited by band settings, bandwidth, and the signal-to-noise ratio, UAVs with their exceptional spatiotemporal resolution can be used as a useful tool for river environmental monitoring and inversion uncertainty assessment. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral (X20P) and multispectral (P4M) images, along with Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat-9 OLI2 data, were used to assess the uncertainty in retrieving chlorophyll-a (Chla) and suspended sediment (SS) concentrations in rivers. Chla and SS models based on UAV and satellite data were constructed using stepwise multiple regression and typical Chla and SS retrieval algorithms, respectively, and the performance of the models was the focus of our research. The results demonstrated that in the Chla concentration inversion, each sensor performed as follows: X20P > P4M > Landsat9 OLI2 > Sentinel-2 MSI > Landsat8 OLI, and the performance in the SS concentration inversion was as follows: X20P > Sentinel-2 MSI > P4M > Landsat9 OLI2 > Landsat8 OLI. In addition, the uncertainty of high spatial resolution satellite retrievals was analyzed with the assistance of the UAV-based model. Results showed that narrow bandwidths and finely tuned band settings are more essential for the Chla inversion. The typical Chla retrieval algorithm, NDCI, is only effective in certain bands (band 1 from 684 to 724 nm and band 2 from 660 to 680 nm). It is also noted that Landsat8 and Landsat9 lack some key band settings (e.g., the red-edge band of 700-710 nm), severely limiting practical application in relation to Chla. However, specific variances in different sensor bands have a relatively small impact on SS inversion, for example, the correlation between SS and the R/B (a typical SS retrieval algorithm) constructed by each sensor ranged from 0.68 to 0.77. Chla monitoring, on the other hand, necessitates a higher spatial resolution than SS monitoring. The accuracy decreased markedly when UAV images were resampled to 10 m and 30 m spatial resolution. However, it is not as crucial for the SS inversion, images with the original spatial resolution (RMSE<30cm = 6.28 mg/L) were resampled to 10 m resolution (RMSE10m = 5.85 mg/L) and 30 m resolution (RMSE30m = 4.08 mg/L) while using P4M for SS inversion, and the accuracy increased. Our results demonstrated and highlighted various options for future monitoring of Chla and SS, while exploiting the synergy between UAVs and satellites to achieve more precise observations at greater spatial and temporal scales, which will benefit aquatic environment management and protection.","{""Chen, Jiahao"",""Fu, Yongshuo H."",""Guo, Shihui"",""Guo, Yahui"",""Hao, Fanghua"",""Li, Xiran"",""Nie, Xingyu"",""Xiao, Yi"",""Xu, Yue""}",xiao_monitoringchlorophyllsuspendedsediment_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Study Of Soil Erosion By Using Remote Sensing And Gis Techniques In Sone Command Area In Bihar, India","Soil erosion is caused by various reasons, but the land slope and poor land management are the main rea-sons. Identification of erosion-prone areas is the most important factor for agricultural planning and effective land management. This study includes an estimation of average annual soil loss in the Sone command area in Bihar and the preparation of spatially distributed soil erosion map for different land-use scenarios. The soil in the study area is generally clay loam. A well-known empirical equation i.e. RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) has been used to estimate parameters and prepare spatially distributed maps. By using remote sensing and GIS techniques different soil loss parameters like rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness factor (LS), cover management factor (C) and conservation practice factor (P) are estimated and spatially distributed map of all these parameters are prepared. Average soil loss in the study area was found in the range 21 to 40 t.ha(-1).yr(-1) and the maximum value is found to be around 7000 t.ha(-1).yr(-1). It was also found that areas with high soil erosion rates are very low. Around 46\% variation is observed between the maximum and minimum average soil loss rates.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

"Variations Of Ecosystem Service Value In Response To Land-Use Change In The Kashgar Region, Northwest China","Increasing anthropogenic activities have significantly altered ecosystems in arid oasis regions. Estimating the impact on a wide range of ecosystem services is important for decision making and the sustainable development of these regions. This study analyzed time-series Landsat data to determine the influences of oasis land-use changes on the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region in Northwest China. The following results were found. The total value of the ecosystem services in the Kashgar region were approximately \$10,845.3, \$11,218.6, \$10,291.7, and \$10,127.3 million in 1986, 1996, 2005, and 2015, respectively. The water supply, waste treatment, biodiversity protection, and recreation and cultural services were the four ecosystem services with the highest service value, contributing 77.05\% of the total ecosystem services. The combined contribution rate of food production and raw material value was only about 4.02\%, relatively small. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated total ecosystem service value (ESV) for this study area was relatively inelastic with respect to the value coefficients. The findings of this study will be crucial for maintaining the stability and sustainable development of the oasis region, where socio-economic development and the integrity of the natural ecosystem complement each other. Furthermore, the results provide a scientific basis for decision makers in land use management, and provide a reference for researchers in the Northwest China.","{""Halik, Umut"",""Mamat, Aynur"",""Rouzi, Aihemaitijiang""}",mamat_variationsecosystemserviceresponse_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Passive Monitoring Of Mental Health Status In The Criminal Forensic Population,"Current approaches to monitoring patientsâ€™ mental status rely heavily on self-reported symptomatology, clinician observation, and self-rated symptom scales. The limitations inherent in these methodologies have implications for the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. Certain populations are particularly affected by these limitations because of their unique situations, including criminal forensic patients, who have a history of both criminal behavior and mental disorder, and experience increased stigma and restrictions in their access to mental health care. This population may benefit particularly from recent developments in technology and the growing use of mobile devices and sensors to collect behavioral information via passive monitoring. These technologies offer objective parameters that correlate with mental health status and create an opportunity to use Big Data and machine learning to refine diagnosis and predict behavior in a way that represents a marked shift from current practices. This article reviews the approaches to and limitations of psychiatric assessment and contrasts this with the promise of these new technologies. It then discusses the ethics concerns associated with these technologies and explores their potential relevance to criminal forensic psychiatry and the broader implications they carry for health and criminal justice policy.

The Responses Of Ecosystem Services To Land-Use Change In Dianshan Lake Area From 1984 To 2014,"Water resources are an important guarantee for the development of regions and eities. Understanding the ehanges in ecosystem services and their driving forces, therefore, is of great significance in the management of water resources across regions. By utilizing remote sensing images of Dianshan Like area in 1984, 1993, 2(X)6 and 2014, land-use change and ecosystem service value ( ESV) were analyzed by revising the ESV coefficient of different types of land use. The results showed that the areas of woodland and construction land tended to increase, while those of arable land and water bodies tended to decrease between 1984 and 2014. Results from the ESV analysis showed that the ESV of water bodies and arable land decreased by 215 and 24! million yuan, respectively, while the ESV of woodland increased by 250 million yuan. The ESV sensitivity index of each land-use type was less than 1 , indicating that the ESV of the study area was inelastic. On the township scale, the ESV analysis showed a net increase only in Zhujiajiao and Jinxi Towns. At the provincial and municipal scales, the total ESV perunitarea of Jiangsu Province decreased, while the total ESV per unit area of Shanghai increased. The driving force analysis showed that both natural and socio-economic factors had an impact on the ESV. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between population density and ESV and between total regional economic output and ESV. Our results suggest that changes in land use have an important impart on the ESV. An optimal land-use pattern would help to increase the total ESV across regions. Â© 2019 Science Press.

Impact Of The Transport Of Aerosols From The Free Troposphere Towards The Boundary Layer On The Air Quality In The Paris Area,"We propose a quantification of the downward transport of aerosols from the free troposphere (FT) to the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Aerosols are originally released at the surface as a consequence of anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, soil mobilization, etc. After being vertically transported into the FT, they are exposed to the long-range transport (LRT) and may subside to impact, in turn, surface air pollution in remote places. Using 5400 h of routine Lidar observations conducted at the SIRTA observatory in the Paris area (France), we identified 154 free tropospheric aerosol layers continuously monitored during their downward transport into the local PBL. One of these events-associated to a Saharan dust outbreak-is thoroughly documented in a case study. And a climatological analysis of surface PM10 levels recorded at air quality monitoring stations allows the impact of FT to PBL transport of aerosols to be quantified. This source is found to be significant for 15 out of the 16 stations, with average PM10 concentrations 2.14 Î¼g m-3 (i.e. 12%) above climatological values after the injection of free tropospheric aerosols into the PBL.

Considerations On Capacity Building For National Forest Assessments In Developing Countries - With A Case Study Of India,"Large-area forest assessments are attracting increasing attention owing to their role in providing information related to carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation and enhancement of rural livelihoods. The information needs actually hold good for all geographic levels from the local to the global. Forest assessments on national level are of particular interest because countries that wish to engage in the REDD+ initiative and to benefit from results-based payments, need to give quantitative evidence of their progresses in enhancing their forest resources. This contribution analyzes the capacity building needs for national forest assessments with a focus on the situation in developing countries, identifies key areas in which national capacity may be developed and makes suggestions for implementation. India's forest assessment systems are used as an example. The National Forest Inventory (NFI) system needs to be institutionalized to ensure a practical way for proficient monitoring and analysis of forest ecosystems. The institutions established to carry out NFI require continued institutional and financial support with qualified and committed scholars and professionals from relevant disciplines, including forest mensuration, forest inventory and remote sensing.

"Toward Cloud-Native, Machine Learning Base Detection Of Crop Disease With Imaging Spectroscopy","Developing actionable early detection and warning systems for agricultural stakeholders is crucial to reduce the annual \$200B USD losses and environmental impacts associated with crop diseases. Agricultural stakeholders primarily rely on labor-intensive, expensive scouting and molecular testing to detect disease. Spectroscopic imagery (SI) can improve plant disease management by offering decision-makers accurate risk maps derived from Machine Learning (ML) models. However, training and deploying ML requires significant computation and storage capabilities. This challenge will become even greater as global-scale data from the forthcoming Surface Biology \& Geology satellite becomes available. This work presents a cloud-hosted architecture to streamline plant disease detection with SI from NASA's AVIRIS-NG platform, using grapevine leafroll-associated virus complex 3 (GLRaV-3) as a model system. Here, we showcase a pipeline for processing SI to produce plant disease detection models and demonstrate that the underlying principles of a cloud-based disease detection system easily accommodate model improvements and shifting data modalities. Our goal is to make the insights derived from SI available to agricultural stakeholders via a platform designed with their needs and values in mind. The key outcome of this work is an innovative, responsive system foundation that can empower agricultural stakeholders to make data-driven plant disease management decisions while serving as a framework for others pursuing use-inspired application development for agriculture to follow that ensures social impact and reproducibility while preserving stakeholder privacy.","{""Galvan, Fernando Romero"",""Gold, Kaitlin M."",""Pavlick, Ryan"",""Rubambiza, Gloire"",""Weatherspoon, Hakim""}",rubambiza_cloudnativemachinelearning_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Analysis Of Land Cover Change Detection In Gozamin District, Ethiopia: From Remote Sensing And Dpsir Perspectives","Land cover patterns in sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly changing. This study aims to quantify the land cover change and to identify its major determinants by using the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses (DPSIR) framework in the Ethiopian Gozamin District over a period of 32 years (1986 to 2018). Satellite images of Landsat 5 (1986), Landsat 7 (2003), and Sentinel-2 (2018) and a supervised image classification methodology were used to assess the dynamics of land cover change. Land cover maps of the three dates, focus group discussions (FGDs), interviews, and farmers' lived experiences through a household survey were applied to identify the factors for changes based on the DPSIR framework. Results of the investigations revealed that during the last three decades the study area has undergone an extensive land cover change, primarily a shift from cropland and grassland into forests and built-up areas. Thus, quantitative land cover change detection between 1986 and 2018 revealed that cropland, grassland, and bare areas declined by 10.53\%, 5.7\%, and 2.49\%. Forest, built-up, shrub/scattered vegetation, and water bodies expanded by 13.47\%, 4.02\%, 0.98\%, and 0.25\%. Household surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) identified the population growth, the rural land tenure system, the overuse of land, the climate change, and the scarcity of grazing land as drivers of these land cover changes. Major impacts were rural to urban migration, population size change, scarcity of land, and decline in land productivity.

These challenges are further compounded by the remote location of some MPAs, which magnify the costs of management activities. However, large size and remoteness alone may be insufficient to achieve conservation outcomes in the absence of critical management functions such as environmental monitoring and enforcement. The Australian subantarctic Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI) Marine Reserve is among the world's most remote MPAs with notoriously harsh oceanographic conditions, and yet the region's rich mammal and fish resources have been exploited intermittently since the mid-1800s. More recently, the development of lucrative international markets for Patagonian toothfish, sold as Chilean seabass, led to the growth in both legal and illegal fishing. In 2002, to conserve the unique ecology and biodiversity in the area, Australia declared a 65,000 km2 MPA around HIMI. Worldwide, government agencies have, however, struggled to develop cost-effective institutional arrangements for conservation. This paper therefore draws upon the social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) to characterize the structure of conservation governance and outcomes in the HIMI Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve has generally been successful in supporting a sustainable fishery while addressing threats to biodiversity. The remote and isolated nature of the Marine Reserve was critical to its success, but also benefited greatly from collaborations between managers and the fishing industry. Commercial fishers keep watch over the Reserve while fishing, report any observations of illegal fishing (none since 2006/07), and have at times been asked to verify remote observation of potential illegal fishing vessels. The industry also undertakes annual ecological surveys in the MPA, allowing managers to track environmental trends. The fishing industry itself highlights the importance of industry participation in conservation planning, strengthened by secure access to resources via statutory fishing rights, which provide critical incentives to invest in conservation. We therefore reflect on the potential application of this case to other remote large MPAs, highlighting potential directions for future research.","{""Ban, Natalie C."",""Brooks, Cassandra M."",""Epstein, Graham""}",brooks_managingmarineprotectedremote_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Modeling The Spatio-Temporal Changes In Land Uses And Its Impacts On Ecosystem Services In Northeast China Over 2000-2050,"Land use and its dynamics have attracted considerable scientific attention for their significant ecological and socioeconomic implications. Many studies have investigated the past changes in land use, but efforts exploring the potential changes in land use and implications under future scenarios are still lacking. Here we simulate the future land use changes and their impacts on ecosystem services in Northeast China (NEC) over the period of 2000-2050 using the CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) model under the scenarios of ecological security (ESS), food security (FSS) and comprehensive development (CDS). The model was validated against remote sensing data in 2005. Overall, the accuracy of the CLUE-S model was evaluated at 82.5\%. Obtained results show that future cropland changes mainly occur in the Songnen Plain and the Liaohe Plain, forest and grassland changes are concentrated in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains and the western Changbai Mountains, while the Sanjiang Plain will witness major changes of the wetlands. Our results also show that even though CDS is defined based on the goals of the regional development plan, the ecological service value (ESV) under CDS is RMB 2656.18 billion in 2050. The ESV of CDS is lower compared with the other scenarios. Thus, CDS is not an optimum scenario for eco-environmental protection, especially for the wetlands, which should be given higher priority for future development. The issue of coordination is also critical in future development. The results can help to assist structural adjustments for agriculture and to guide policy interventions in NEC.","{""Tan Wenxia"",""Verburg, Peter H."",""Wu Wenbin"",""Xia Tian"",""Yang Peng"",""Ye Liming"",""Zhou Qingbo""}",xiatianandwuwenbinandzhouqingboandtanwenxiaandverburg_modelingspatiotemporalland_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Comparisons Of Random Forest And Stochastic Gradient Treeboost Algorithms For Mapping Soil Electrical Conductivity With Multiple Subsets Using Landsat Oli And Dem/Gis-Based Data At A Type Oasis In Xinjiang, China","Accurate assessment of the spatial distribution and severity of soil salinization has long plagued local governments and researchers in the arid parts of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XJUAR). The emergence of machine learning has brought hope to this researchÂ field, such as Random Forest (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT),however,Â whichÂ are few applications to the quantitative assessment of soil salinization. Therefore, in order to evaluate the accuracy level of the two algorithms for predicting soil salinity, twenty-seven environmental subsets were designed. Each data set is calculated using both RF and SGT to produce an optimal set of variables. The simulation results from 70.37% (19/27) of the subsets showed that the predicted value of soil salinity from SGT is closer to the observed value than is that from RF. The statistics of all datasets showed that the average values of R2Â value for RF and SGT were 0.38 and 0.40, the average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value were 28.59 and 27.46, and the Ratio of Prediction to Deviation (RPD) averages were 1.20 and 1.24, respectively. The important dominant factor were topographic variables with coarse resolution, temperature and vegetation indices, land use and landform.Â . Â© 2021 The Author(s).

"Uniting Remote Sensing, Crop Modelling And Economics For Agricultural Risk Management","The increasing availability of satellite data at higher spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions is enabling new applications in agriculture and economic development, including agricultural insurance. Yet, effectively using satellite data in this context requires blending technical knowledge about their capabilities and limitations with an understanding of their influence on the value of risk-reduction programmes. In this Review, we discuss how approaches to estimate agricultural losses for index insurance have evolved from costly field-sampling-based campaigns towards lower-cost techniques using weather and satellite data. We identify advances in remote sensing and crop modelling for assessing agricultural conditions, but reliably and cheaply assessing production losses remains challenging in complex landscapes. We illustrate how an economic framework can be used to gauge and enhance the value of insurance based on earth-observation data, emphasizing that even as yield-estimation techniques improve, the value of an index insurance contract for the insured depends largely on how well it captures the losses when people suffer most. Strategically improving the collection and accessibility of reliable ground-reference data on crop types and production would facilitate this task. Audits to account for inevitable misestimation complement efforts to detect and protect against large losses. Improvements in earth observation are enabling new approaches to assess agricultural losses, such as those resulting from adverse weather. This Review examines advances in the application of remotely sensed data and crop modelling in index-based insurance as well as opportunities to enhance the quality of index insurance programmes. Key pointsIn many developing regions, adverse weather can lead to food insecurity, reduced investments or distressed asset sales that ensnare people in a cycle of poverty.Tools to manage risk - such as well-designed insurance - can help people avoid the most severe possible consequences of bad weather and build confidence to invest in additional income-generating opportunities.In recent decades, governments and researchers across the globe have trialled approaches to inexpensively assess agricultural losses. Index-based insurance offers promise, but detecting losses cheaply and accurately remains challenging.Recent advances in crop modelling and remote sensing can improve index-based approaches by strengthening the link between indices and actual losses, as well as reducing programme costs.We provide an economic framework to evaluate indices, suggesting how the remote sensing and modelling communities can contribute to enhancing index insurance quality through better detection of adverse conditions.Promising opportunities to enhance index insurance programmes include inexpensively addressing heterogeneous conditions on the ground, such as employing audits, optimizing insurance zones, using new sensors or increasing contract flexibility.","{""Benami, Elinor"",""Carter, Michael R."",""Ghosh, Aniruddha"",""Hijmans, Robert J."",""Hobbs, Andrew"",""Jin, Zhenong"",""Kenduiywo, Benson"",""Lobell, David B.""}",benami_unitingremotesensingcrop_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Evaluating China's Biomass Power Production Investment Based On A Policy Benefit Real Options Model,"In this study, a policy benefit real options model was developed to evaluate biomass power production investment in China. A method based on the cumulative probability was proposed using binomial decision tree calculations for the exercising of options in order to evaluate the optimal investment timing. Two scenarios were analyzed to identify the optimal investment strategy with/without the consideration of revenue from certified emission reduction (CER). Uncertainties in straw purchased price, government incentives, and technological improvements were considered. The results showed that it was not optimal for immediate investment in biomass power production in China. Given full government subsidy, the thresholds of straw purchased price for scenarios 1 and 2 are 213.55 and 218.87 RMB/ton, respectively, while the current straw purchased price in Chinese market is 220 RMB/ton. The investment of biomass power production would be executed at 2022 and 2028 with/without the consideration of revenue from CER in the current situation in China if there are no government incentive to encourage motivation, respectively. The conclusion could provide useful information for power enterprise decision-makers on whether and when to invest a biomass power production in China in an uncertain environment.

"Assessment Of Ecological Environment Quality In Kolkata Urban Agglomeration, India","The global ecosystem has been significantly disrupted on various spatiotemporal scales over the last three decades due to human activities. Geospatial technology can quickly, effectively, and quantitatively to evaluate the spatiotemporal change of eco-environmental quality (EEQ). The present study is focused on novel approach of Remote Sensing based Ecological Index (RSEI), using Landsat Imagery data to assess environmental conditions and changes pattern. Four ecological indicators were prepared in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 of Kolkata urban agglomeration (KUA) to evaluate the ecological environmental condition. The principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial autocorrelation analysis can relate all indicators with each other's and RSEI. Out study indicated, greenness and wetness have a positive effect on EEQ of the province, but both dryness and heat have a negative effect. However, it should be noted that greenness has a greater impact on the eco-environment than the other three indicators. Based on the RSEI values, we have categorized the environmental standards of the study area into four groups-very good (0.81-1.00), good (0.61-0.80), acceptable (0.41-0.60), poor (0.21-0.40), and very poor (0.00-0.20), where high values indicate that environmental quality is stable and healthy for living organisms and low values indicate relatively unstable and threatening conditions of the environment. The status of RSEI showed that 9.02\%, 12.29\%, 12.79\% and 37.23\% of an area was under poor to very poor condition in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. Good to very good condition of RSEI values was increased from 19.12\% to 34.074\% during 1990 to 2010, but declined of RSEI value 9.47\% during 2010 to 2020 due to urban expansion. Here, Moran's I values fund that 0.265, 0.543, 0.396 and 0.367 in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. The result of Moran's I values indicate that clustering nature.

Combined Impacts Of Land Use And Soil Property Changes On Soil Erosion In A Mollisol Area Under Long-Term Agricultural Development,"Soil erosion exhibits special characteristics in the process of agricultural development. Understanding the combined impacts of land use and soil property changes on soil erosion, especially in the area under long-term agricultural cultivations, is vital to watershed agricultural and soil management. This study investigated the temporal-spatial patterns of the soil erosion based on a modified version of Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and conducted a soil erosion contribution analysis. The land use data were interpreted from Landsat series images, and soil properties were obtained from field sampling, laboratory tests and SPAW (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Water) model calculations. Over a long period of agricultural development, the average erosion modulus decreased from 187.7 t kmâˆ’ 2 aâˆ’ 1 in 1979 to 158.4 t kmâˆ’ 2 aâˆ’ 1 in 2014. The land use types were transformed mainly in the reclamation of paddy fields and the shrinking of wetlands on a large scale. Most of the soils were converted to loam from silty or clay loam and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of most soil types decreased by 1.11% to 43.6%. The rapidly increasing area of 49.8 km2 of paddy fields together with the moderate decrease of 14.0 km2 of forests, as well as Ks values explained 87.4% of the total variance in soil erosion. Although changes in soil physical and water characteristics indicated that soil erosion loads should have become higher, the upsurge in paddy fields played an important role in mitigating soil erosion in this study area. These results demonstrated that land use changes had more significant impacts than soil property changes on soil erosion. This study suggested that rational measures should be taken to extend paddy fields and control the dry land farming. These findings will benefit watershed agricultural targeting and management.

Integration Of Alos Palsar And Landsat Data For Land Cover And Forest Mapping In Northern Tanzania,"Land cover and forest mapping supports decision makers in the course of making informed decisions for implementation of sustainable conservation and management plans of the forest resources and environmental monitoring. This research examines the value of integrating of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat data for improved forest and land cover mapping in Northern Tanzania. A separate and joint processing of surface reflectance, backscattering and derivatives (i.e., Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Radar Forest Deforestation Index (RFDI), quotient bands, polarimetric features and Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures) were executed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The classification accuracy was assessed using a confusion matrix, where Overall classification Accuracy (OA), Kappa Coefficient (KC), Producer's Accuracy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA) and F-1 score index were computed. A two sample t-statistics was utilized to evaluate the influence of different data categories on the classification accuracy. Landsat surface reflectance and derivatives show an overall classification accuracy (OA = 86\%). ALOS PALSAR backscattering could not differentiate the land cover classes efficiently (OA = 59\%). However, combination of backscattering, and derivatives could differentiate the land cover classes properly (OA = 71\%). The attained results suggest that integration of backscattering and derivative has potential of utilization for mapping of land cover in tropical environment. Integration of backscattering, surface reflectance and their derivative increase the accuracy (OA = 97\%). Therefore it can be concluded that integration of ALOS PALSAR and optical data improve the accuracies of land cover and forest mapping and hence suitable for environmental monitoring.","{""Deus, Dorothea""}",deus_integrationalospalsarlandsat_2016,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Geospatial Modelling Approach For Identifying Disturbance Regimes And Biodiversity Rich Areas In North Western Himalayas, India","The present study is a comprehensive effort for making spatially explicit vegetation type information, one of the basic inputs for species and habitat conservation, readily available to the decision makers, resource managers and nature conservationists. The present study was carried out to understand the vegetation composition and structure in Doda area of Western Himalayas, India. During the study, vegetation types were mapped using on-screen image interpretation technique of multispectral high resolution satellite data. A total of ten types of vegetation were delineated from the satellite data. Phytosociological data was collected for the forest, pasture and scrub classes using nested-quadrat approach to characterize the vegetation. A total of ten phytosociological parameters were analyzed. Pinaceae, Rosaceae and Asteraceae were the dominant plant families with most of the identified plant species having a very high medicinal value. Other important component of the study involved landscape modelling, using the Spatial Landscape Analysis Model for identifying disturbance regimes and biodiversity rich landscapes in the area. The model results indicate that most of the area contains a very rich biodiversity repository with only a few areas showing signs of disturbance where terrain is either complex or where the anthropogenic pressures on forest resources are apparent. The forest and nature conservation managers could use the conservation measures suggested on the basis of these research findings for developing biodiversity conservation strategies in the region.","{""Rashid, Irfan"",""Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad"",""Vijayalakshmi, Tartiparti""}",rashid_geospatialmodellingapproachidentifying_2013,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
A Wireless Sensor Network-Based Ubiquitous Paprika Growth Management System,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology can facilitate advances in productivity, safety and human quality of life through its applications in various industries. In particular, the application of WSN technology to the agricultural area, which is labor-intensive compared to other industries, and in addition is typically lacking in IT technology applications, adds value and can increase the agricultural productivity. This study attempts to establish a ubiquitous agricultural environment and improve the productivity of farms that grow paprika by suggesting a 'Ubiquitous Paprika Greenhouse Management System' using WSN technology. The proposed system can collect and monitor information related to the growth environment of crops outside and inside paprika greenhouses by installing WSN sensors and monitoring images captured by CCTV cameras. In addition, the system provides a paprika greenhouse environment control facility for manual and automatic control from a distance, improves the convenience and productivity of users, and facilitates an optimized environment to grow paprika based on the growth environment data acquired by operating the system.

Remotely Sensed Forest Structural Complexity Predicts Multi Species Occurrence At The Landscape Scale,"Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained (D-2) and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5\% to 63.1\% and 0.77\% to 0.97\% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry.

Parrotfish Soundscapes: Implications For Coral Reef Management,"Parrotfishes are prominent members of the herbivore/detritivore feeding guild on coral reefs. Their feeding activity is important for the removal of algae and detritus, the clearing of new settlement sites for coral and other larvae, and the bioerosion and redistribution of sand across the reef. Estimates of parrotfish feeding activity are normally obtained by divers that may influence or overlook fish behaviors, and are of short duration, limited to shallow habitats, and have limited temporal resolution to associate feeding activity with ecological processes. Excavator and scraper parrotfishes have a robust beak-like jaw morphology that produces a unique sound as the teeth scrape the surface of hard coral rock. We tested the hypothesis that ambient parrotfish bite sounds can be used to estimate their temporal patterns of feeding and associations with environmental variates in the area of an acoustic recorder. Acoustic recorders were deployed on 2 Hawaiian reefs to collect ambient fish sounds for a period of 3 yr. Parrotfish bite sounds showed distinct and repetitive variations in daily, seasonal, and annual feeding patterns, and were statistically correlated with factors of day length and tide range. This study demonstrates the utility of using parrotfish bite sounds to estimate patterns of feeding at coral reef sites. We suggest that regular sampling by multiple acoustic monitors may be a cost-efficient and valuable tool for monitoring the health, degradation, and recovery of large coral reef areas.

Prediction Of Soil Organic Matter Based On Multi-Resolution Remote Sensing Data And Random Forest Algorithm,"Soil organic matter is closely related with soil fertility, so the knowledge about spatial distribution of soil organic matter is conducive to rationalization of fertilization management and improvement of land use potential. As carbon source, soil organic carbon is an important factor affecting regional carbon budgeting. Remote sensing data has widely been used in digital soil mapping, which may improve accuracy of the prediction of soil properties to a certain extent. With the aeolian sandy fluvial land and loess hills in Yuyang District cited as subject, this study tried to predict soil organic content and distribution in the topsoil layer of the region of a varying resolution (30 m, 56 m and 250 m), using random forest (RF) algorithm and relevant thematic mapper (TM), advanced wide field sensor (AWIFS), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (M0DIS) and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) data, separately, and in addition, other various factors affecting distribution of soil organic matter, and to validate the predictions with soil samples collected from 324 sampling sites. Variables in the prediction were screened in the light of out-of-bag (OOB) errors the RF algorithm may yield. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the differences between predicted and observed values of soil organic matter relative to resolution. Entropies of the prediction, using the RF model, of distribution of soil organic matter in regions different in topography were compared. Besides, explanation of spatial variability of soil organic matter with the RF model was compared relative to resolution, and at the same time, various environmental variables in the aeolian sandy fluvial land area and loess hilly area were ranked in importance relative to resolution of the TM, AWIFS and MODIS data used, so as to identify the most important environmental variables affecting distribution of soil organic matter; and based on the partial dependence map of soil organic matter on the variables, specific range of the impacts of the main variables were delineated. Results showed that:1) in the aeolian sand fluvial land area, the prediction using the RF model and the AWIFS data is the highest in accuracy, with OOB error being 3.52 and correlation coefficient between predicted and measured values reaching 0.67, regardless of percentage of the samples taken for validation, while in the loess hilly area, the prediction based on the TM data is the highest, with OOB error being is 3.31 and correlation coefficient reaching 0.71. The prediction is better in the loess hilly area than in the aeolian sand fluvial land area, with MAE being in the range of 1.27 âˆ¼ 1.57 g kg-1 in the former and in the range of 1.46 âˆ¼ 2.08 g kg-1 in the latter. 2) ln the aeolian sand fluvial land area, vegetation is the most important factor affecting distribution of soil organic matter, and mostly in positive relationship with soil organic matter. Among the TM data, reduced simple ratio (RSR) is the highest in effect on soil organic matter, or > 7.5 g kg-1, among the AWIFS data, normalized difference vegetation green index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) are, or > 8.5 g kg-1, and among the MODIS data, NDVI is or > 8 g kg-1. Elevation is the second one and its impact varies the most sharply when it ranges between 1 200 and 1 260 m and peaks at 1 220 m. Distance from water source is the third one. As water sources in the aeolian sandy fluvial land area are quite scattered and small in area, their impacts on soil organic matter seldom exceed 500 m. 3) ln the loess hilly area, elevation is the most important factor affecting soil organic matter and negatively related to soil organic matter. Geographic location is the second one, soil organic matter declines in content from southwest to northeast in the area. Vegetation is the third one, in positive relationship with soil organic matter, but in all t e three types of datasets, the impacts of vegetation indices on soil organic matter never go beyond 8 g kg-1. So, it is quite obvious that in areas relatively simple in topography, it is advisable to use data relatively low in resolution instead of data high in resolution in predicting soil organic matter and the RF model is more effective in predicting in areas complex in topography.

Distinct Microalgae Species For Food-Part 1: A Methodological (Top-Down) Approach For The Life Cycle Assessment Of Microalgae Cultivation In Tubular Photobioreactors,"Specific microalgae species are an adequate source of EPA and DHA and are able to provide a complete protein, which makes them highly interesting for human nutrition. However, microalgae cultivation has also been described to be energy intensive and environmentally unfavorable in pilot-scale reactors. Moreover, production in cold temperature zones has not been sufficiently investigated. In particular, the effects of tube materials and cultivation season length have rarely been previously investigated in the context of a comparative LCA of microalgae cultivation. A computational ""top-down"" model was conducted to calculate input flows forNannochloropsissp.andPhaeodactylum tricornutumcultivation in a hypothetical tubular photobioreactor. Cultivation processes were calculated according to detailed satellite climatic data for the chosen location in Central Germany. This model was applied to a set of different scenarios, including variations in photobioreactor material, tube diameter, microalgae species, and cultivation season length. Based on these data, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed following ISO standard 14040/44. The impact assessment comprised the global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, cumulative energy demand, and water scarcity. The results showed that a long cultivation season in spring and fall was always preferable in terms of environmental impacts, although productivity decreased significantly due to the climatic preconditions. Acrylic glass as a tube material had higher environmental impacts than all other scenarios. The cultivation of an alternative microalgae species showed only marginal differences in the environmental impacts compared with the baseline scenario. Critical processes in all scenarios included the usage of hydrogen peroxide for the cleaning of the tubes, nitrogen fertilizer, and electricity for mixing, centrifugation, and drying. Microalgae cultivation in a tubular photobioreactor in a ""cold-weather"" climate for food is sustainable and could possibly be a complement to nutrients from other food groups. The added value of this study lies in the detailed description of a complex and flexible microalgae cultivation model. The new model introduced in this study can be applied to numerous other scenarios to evaluate photoautotrophic microalgae cultivation in tubular photobioreactors. Thus, it is possible to vary the facility location, seasons, scale, tube dimensions and material, microalgae species, nutrient inputs, and flow velocity. Moreover, single processes can easily be complemented or exchanged to further adjust the model individually, if, for instance, another downstream pathway is required.","{""Meier, T."",""Schade, S.""}",schade_distinctmicroalgaespeciesfood_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Hydrological Modeling To Identify And Manage Critical Erosion-Prone Areas For Improving Reservoir Life: Case Study Of Barakar Basin,"In this investigation, an effort was made to model the hydrology and to identify critical erosion-prone areas of the Barakar Basin (6,293km2) in Jharkhand state, India using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). This effort is helpful to select and adopt suitable soil conservation measures to reduce soil erosion. Input data include daily rainfall, and air temperature; and monthly runoff, sediment yield and reservoir inflow data of 5years. Additional data were the topographical map, soil map, land resource data, and satellite imageries of the study area. The model was calibrated and validated for monthly inflow to the Maithon and Tilaiya Reservoirs for the periods of 1997-1999 and 2000-2001, respectively. In addition, it was also calibrated and validated for monthly runoff and sediment yield from two subwatersheds (Banha and Karso), located within Barakar Basin for the monsoon season of the same period. The calibration and validation results established good agreement (less than 10\% deviation) between the observed- and model-predicted values in all cases. The identified critical areas using model-predicted sediment yield were compared with results of a report obtained from the Soil Conservation Department of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Hazaribagh. The erosion class map developed using simulation results matched spatially well with the DVC-prepared map based on sediment yield index. A management plan was developed to treat the subwatersheds with conservation practices. Subwatersheds were divided into seven priority classes for treating them sequentially to reduce reservoir sedimentation rate. In the model, conservation practices were accounted for through curve number, universal soil loss equation (USLE) cover factor, USLE support factor, and farm pond. Adaptation of the management plan resulted in decreased sedimentation rate. The sedimentation rate decreased from the current rate of 0.76 and 4.59mm3/year to 0.56 and 1.41mm3/year for Tilaiya and Maithon Reservoirs, respectively. Furthermore, the life of Tilaiya and Maithon Reservoirs increased by 29 and 166years, respectively. These results suggest that SWAT can be used to identify critical subwatersheds and to develop management plans to control erosion from critical areas by reducing the reservoir sedimentation rate.","{""Chatterjee, Chandranath"",""Raghuwanshi, Narendra S."",""Sardar, Bidhan"",""Singh, Amit Kumar""}",sardar_hydrologicalmodelingidentifymanage_2014,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Raising Standards While Watching The Bottom Line: Making A Business Case For Infection Control,"While society would benefit from a reduced incidence of nosocomial infections, there is currently no direct reimbursement to hospitals for the purpose of infection control, which forces healthcare institutions to make economic decisions about funding infection control activities. Demonstrating value to administrators is an increasingly important function of the hospital epidemiologist because healthcare executives are faced with many demands and shrinking budgets. Aware of the difficulties that face local infection control programs, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) Board of Directors appointed a task force to draft this evidence-based guideline to assist hospital epidemiologists in justifying and expanding their programs. In Part 1, we describe the basic steps needed to complete a business-case analysis for an individual institution. A case study based on a representative infection control intervention is provided. In Part 2, we review important basic economic concepts and describe approaches that can be used to assess the financial impact of infection prevention, surveillance, and control interventions, as well as the attributable costs of specific healthcare-associated infections.

"Population Dynamics And Movements Of Atlantic Tarpon, Megalops Atlanticus, In The Parnaiba Delta Protected Area, Brazil: Challenges For Local Fishery Management Planning","Fishery management in Brazil has many challenges, including the engagement of fishers, building institutional (NGO, university, etc.) relationships to carry out research and provide key data for managers, and strengthening the capacity to articulate effective management strategies (policy institution). Here we report on recent work to address some of these challenges for the Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) fishery in the Parnaiba Delta Protected Area. These include meetings to create inter-sector communication, citizen science and ethnobiology to support data collection and biological sampling, satellite tagging to discern tarpon movements, and the first data-limited stock assessment. The research occurred between September 2018 and April 2020 in the Parnaiba Delta and adjacent marine area, specifically in the Canarias Islands (MA), Pedra do Sal (PI), and Bitupita (CE). Gonadosomatic indices (GSI > 5\%) of female tarpon suggested that tarpon migrate to the Parnaiba Delta to spawn in the dry season (July-December). These GSI findings corresponded with the ethnobiology results in which the fishers confirmed more intense fishing effort in the dry periods due in part to the added value of the gonads. Satellite-tagged tarpon remained close to the Buraco and Boca da Barra fishery areas, thus, close to the Parnaiba Delta region. The information collected here will enhance the collaborative formulation of an unprecedented management plan for the tarpon fishery in this region.","{""Adams, Aaron"",""Araujo, Alan C.

"Satellite Remote Sensing Of Land Cover Change In A Mixed Agro-Silvo-Pastoral Landscape In The Alentejo, Portugal","Mixed agro-silvo-pastoral landscapes are typically of significant natural, economic and cultural value. The montado (wood pasture) dominated systems of southern Portugal are a prime example, and experience high rates of land cover change. Tracking these changes is of importance for landscape level conservation and management. Whilst satellite remote sensing is the most realistic approach at large spatial scales, heterogeneous landscapes can present challenges to the accurate classification of land cover and its change. In this investigation we demonstrate a novel approach to the investigation of land cover change over a 25year period (1984-2009) in an area of importance for the conservation of the Iberian lynx, Black vulture, and other threatened biodiversity in south-east Alentejo, Portugal. We apply a Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) to Landsat imagery from these two years, and then Change Vector Analysis (CVA) on the transformed data to highlight areas of vegetation gain and loss during the intervening period. Using a 2009 land cover classification, and a set of rules based on these vegetation changes, we then predict the land change over the 25year period focussing on predominant classes of vegetation physiognomy. The results are discussed in terms of probable drivers, as well as implications for biodiversity and other landscape values.","{""Allen, Harriet"",""Hotham, Paul"",""Parham, Erin"",""Simonson, William"",""de Basto e Santos, Eduardo""}",allen_satelliteremotesensingland_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

Weather Index Insurance Viability In Mitigation Of Climate Change Impact Risk: A Systematic Review And Future Agenda,"Purpose The purpose of the present paper is to review studies on weather index-insurance as a tool to manage the climate change impact risk on farmers and to explore the study gaps in the currently existing literature by using a systematic literature review. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed and reviewed the 374 articles on weather index insurance (WII) based on a systematic literature search on Web of Science and Scopus databases by using the systematic literature review method. Findings WII studies shifted their focus on growing and emerging areas of climate change impact risk. The finding shows that the impact of climate change risk significantly influenced the viability of WII in terms of pricing and design of WII. Therefore, the cost of WII premium increases due to the uncertainty of climate change impact that enhances the probability of losses related to insured weather risks. However, WII has emerged as a risk management tool of climate insurance for vulnerable agrarian communities. The efficacy of WII has been significantly influenced by repetitive environmental disasters and climate change phenomena. Research limitations/implications This study will be valuable for scholars to recognize the missing and emerging themes in WII. Practical implications This study will help the policy planners to understand the influence of climate change impact on WII viability. Originality/value This study is the original work of the author. An attempt has been made in the present study to systematically examine the viability of WII for insuring the climate change risk.","{""Singh, Pankaj""}",singh_weatherindexinsuranceviability_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Socio-Ecological Vulnerability In Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau: Evaluation, Driving Forces And Scenario Simulation","With the social and economic development in recent years, human activities have been more extensive and intensified. As a result, ecosystems are damaged to varying degrees, and regional ecological environments tend to be weaker. The socio-ecological system in Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau, China, the researched area, also faces increasingly serious problems. To advance ecological civilization development in a coordinated way across the country, the national government and the competent authorities have launched a series of new strategies. Research on socio-ecological vulnerability, a major part of the ecosystem protection and restoration program, is provided with powerful spatial data observation and analysis tools thanks to the invention and development of remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. This study was based on the vulnerability scoping diagram (VSD) framework. Multi-source data such as digital elevation model (DEM), geographical data such as land use types, soil and geological disasters, remote sensing image data, meteorological data and social statistics data from 2005 to 2019 were used to construct the temporal social-ecosystem vulnerability evaluation index database of Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau. The spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) is applied to evaluating the socio-ecological vulnerability and analyzing its spatial-temporal variation in Aba Prefecture, Western Sichuan Plateau. To probe into the driving effects of various impact factors on the socio-ecological vulnerability, the Geodetector is used to analyze the driving factors. The ordered weighted average (OWA) method is applied to the multi-scenario analysis of socio-ecological vulnerability in the researched area. The conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) from 2005 to 2019, the spatial distribution characteristics of exposure and sensitivity in Aba Prefecture were higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest, and the overall spatial distribution characteristics of socio-ecological system vulnerability showed that the degree of vulnerability increased from the north to the southeast. (2) Extreme natural climate conditions play a leading role in the driving of socio-ecosystem vulnerability, followed by human production activities and geological hazards. (3) The degree of social-ecosystem vulnerability in Aba Prefecture will increase with the increase of decision risk coefficient. The results of social-ecosystem vulnerability under the status quo scenario are similar to those in 2010 and 2019, indicating that the selected evaluation factors can reflect the actual social-ecosystem vulnerability. In the sustainable guided scenario and the unsustainable guided scenario, the proportion of the area of the social-ecosystem severe vulnerability level was at the minimum value and the maximum value, respectively.","{""Dai, Xiaoai"",""Fu, Xiao"",""He, Yuxin"",""Li, Naiwen"",""Li, Weile"",""Li, Wenyu"",""Liu, Chao"",""Lu, Heng"",""Ma, Lei"",""Shan, Yunfeng"",""Wang, Youlin"",""Yang, Xingping"",""Yang, Zhengli""}",yang_socioecologicalvulnerabilityaba_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

"Soil Erosion And Degradation Assessment Integrating Multi-Parametric Methods Of Rusle Model, Rs, And Gis In The Shaqlawa Agricultural Area, Kurdistan Region, Iraq","This study evaluated soil erosion rates in the Shaqlawa district using the Geographical Information System (GIS)-based Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The primary objective was to identify areas within the district that are prone to significant erosion and develop appropriate soil conservation schemes accordingly. A combination of primary and secondary data from diverse sources was utilized to achieve this objective. The GIS-based RUSLE model used variables like soil erodibility (K), soil coverage (C), topographic effect (LS), rainfall runoff (R), and erosion control practices (P) to estimate the amount of soil that had been washed away in the study area. The study provided valuable information that can be used to plan and administer soil protection in the Shaqlawa district. The average yearly soil loss in the study region is estimated to be 65.66 t ha-1 year-1. The district is experiencing significant soil erosion rates, which may have detrimental effects on agricultural productivity, water quality, and environmental health. The analysis revealed that Balisan, Hiran, Shaqlawa center, and part of the Salahaddin subdistrict are the most affected areas, with high values of LS and R factors contributing to significant soil erosion rates. These results underscore the importance of soil protection and management efforts in the Shaqlawa district. The combination of the RUSLE with GIS and remote sensing techniques has been recognized as an essential, cost-effective, and highly accurate approach for estimating soil erosion.","{""Abdi, Badeea"",""Kolo, Kamal"",""Shahabi, Himan""}",abdi_soilerosiondegradationassessment_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Perceptions Of Land Use And Land Cover Analysed Using Geospatial Data,"Considering how individuals perceive landscape is important when undertaking land management decisions. However, understanding how the community perceives a landscape is complex involving their experiences in that landscape, their lived experiences and other socio-cultural processes. One of the key challenges to understanding perception is linking the landscape properties to what is experienced when individuals interact with the landscape. Increasingly the use of geospatial data offers a tool for understanding the landscape and perceptions. This study compares satellite estimates of land use with the perceptions of the inhabitants of Yungay, Chile. Viewshed analysis is used to reconcile the differences seen in the satellite image cover estimates and those of the participants. It was found that restricting the cover estimate to the visible landscape, provided similar estimates of cover to those made by the participants. This varied between demographic groups. With differences between participants living in urban and rural settings particularly evident.","{""Guzman Aguayo, Liliana"",""McLennan, Blythe"",""Reinke, Karin"",""Saldias, Daisy San Martin"",""Wallace, Luke""}",saldias_perceptionslandlandcover_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Change And Comparison Of Agricultural Landscape Patterns And Ecological Service Values In Karst And Non-Karst Areas: A Case Study Of Quanzhou County,"The research area is Quanzhou county in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a typical Karst Hilly Basin. Based on the theory of landscape patterns and ecosystem service values, use the results of the interpretation of TM remote sensing images and socio-economic data in 2005, 2010 and 2015, and combined with GIS and Fragstats software to analyze and compare the changes of Agricultural landscape pattern and corresponding changes of ecological service value during 2005-2015.The analysis and comparison were carried out and the results showed that: 1) From 2005 to 2015, the spatial distribution of agricultural landscape in karst and non-karst areas of Quanzhou county changed to a certain extent, with obvious changes in the central and southern regions of karst areas and relatively scattered changes in non-karst areas. In agricultural landscape, the increase of water area in non-karst area is more than twice that of karst area, but the dominant landscape types of karst and non-karst areas have not changed. In both regions, the agricultural landscape has undergone significant changes, but the rate of change in karst area is greater, indicating that the change in karst area is stronger and more significant than that in non-karst areas. 2) In the past 10 years, the area of agricultural landscape in Karst was reduced by 472.23 hm2, and the non Karst area decreased by 476.28 hm2, but the reduction rate of Karst area was higher than that of non Karst region. Compared with the non Karst area, the landscape in Karst area is more fragmented, the patch shape is more dispersed and complex, and the landscape heterogeneity is even higher. On the one hand, the change of landscape pattern in karst and non-karst areas is due to the requirements of urban construction, industry and traffic layout. On the other hand is affected by the policy, making agricultural landscape internal change. 3) In the past 10 years, the total value of ecosystem services in prefectures and counties increased continuously, but the increase was small. In addition, the value of ecosystem services was reduced by RMB 1 million in karst areas. On the contrary, District ecosystem service value it increased by RMB 4 million in the non-karst areas. It can be seen that human activities have affected both karst and non-karst areas, but the influence of karst area is larger, leads to a decrease in karst area ecosystem service value. Among them, the largest contribution rate to the decrease of service value of the two regional ecosystems is the decrease of forested land, which reaches 78% in karst area and 83% in non-karst area. During the study period, although the value of ecosystem services provided by woodland decreased, the value of ecosystem services provided by water landscape increased. The increased value of ecosystem services in the two regions is due to the increase in water landscape. Since the forestry has a decisive role in the value of the ecosystem services of the two regions, it would be helpful to improve the ecosystem services of the study area, and improve the overall value of ecosystem services in the study area.

The Evolution Of Irrigation Effects On Agricultural Drought Mitigation In North China,"Drought is one of the most common natural threats to agricultural production worldwide. Few studies have studied the effects of agricultural practices on drought mitigation at a regional scale over a long period. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics in the agricultural drought-affected area change index (ADAC), which was developed to assess the drought mitigation. The linear regression method was used to investigate the impact factors on the change of ADAC in the three main winter wheat provinces of northern China. The results showed that the average ADAC during the main growing season in the study area was approximately -61.5\% over the past 38 years, which indicated a great decrease of the agricultural drought-affected area. The significant decreasing trends of ADAC values across the study area during 1981-2000 could be explained by the area percentage equipped for irrigation (APEI) by 49.2-89.7\%. There was a lack of pronounced change trends of ADAC during 2001-2018, implying that the positive effects of irrigation infrastructure in the plain area might reach a plateau under the constraints of available water resources, and other agricultural practices need to be investigated in the future. This research provides helpful decision information on drought adaptation management and water conservation project planning.","{""Bulgan, Davdai"",""Ma, Zonghan"",""Wu, Bingfang"",""Yan, Nana"",""Zhang, Xiwang"",""Zhu, Weiwei""}",yan_evolutionirrigationeffectsagricultural_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Landsat Imagery Spectral Trajectories-Important Variables For Spatially Predicting The Risks Of Bark Beetle Disturbance,"Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests. Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come from forests in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power, even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors, and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model. Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions. The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.","{""Berec, Ludek"",""Braaten, Justin"",""Broz, Zdenek"",""Bruna, Josef"",""Hais, Martin"",""Kennedy, Robert"",""Wild, Jan""}",hais_landsatimageryspectraltrajectories_2016,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Use Of Syndromic Surveillance For Decision-Making During The H1n1 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study,"Background: Although an increasing number of studies are documenting uses of syndromic surveillance by front line public health, few detail the value added from linking syndromic data to public health decision-making. This study seeks to understand how syndromic data informed specific public health actions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Methods. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with participants from Ontario's public health departments, the provincial ministry of health and federal public health agency to gather information about syndromic surveillance systems used and the role of syndromic data in informing specific public health actions taken during the pandemic. Responses were compared with how the same decisions were made by non-syndromic surveillance users. Results: Findings from 56 interviews (82% response) show that syndromic data were most used for monitoring virus activity, measuring impact on the health care system and informing the opening of influenza assessment centres in several jurisdictions, and supporting communications and messaging, rather than its intended purpose of early outbreak detection. Syndromic data had limited impact on decisions that involved the operation of immunization clinics, school closures, sending information letters home with school children or providing recommendations to health care providers. Both syndromic surveillance users and non-users reported that guidance from the provincial ministry of health, communications with stakeholders and vaccine availability were driving factors in these public health decisions. Conclusions: Syndromic surveillance had limited use in decision-making during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Ontario. This study provides insights into the reasons why this occurred. Despite this, syndromic data were valued for providing situational awareness and confidence to support public communications and recommendations. Developing an understanding of how syndromic data are utilized during public health events provides valuable evidence to support future investments in public health surveillance.

The Surface Geology Of The Prince Edward Islands: Refined Spatial Data And Call For Geoconservation,"Volcanological maps of the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands were first published in 1968, with a revised surface geology map of Marion Island produced in 2006. These maps have been widely used in terrestrial studies on the Prince Edward Islands but they have limitations in spatial accuracy and detail. Using high-resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation data, more spatially accurate data for both Prince Edward and Marion Islandâ€™s surface geology are presented here. In particular, Marion Islandâ€™s volcanology on the western coast, including the 1980s lava flow, and the newly exposed Central Highland following the disappearance of extensive ice and snow cover is mapped with greater detail and verified through field observations. The spatial data are downloadable as ESRI layer packages, which can assist in future investigations of island biotic-abiotic processes and interactions and enable improvements in spatial modelling. In addition, this paper highlights geological features and specimens from the Prince Edward Islands as unique examples of geodiversity in a South African context. An overview of these features are provided in terms of their geoheritage value to enable a more comprehensive geoconservation strategy be incorporated into the Prince Edward Islands Management Plan.

A Complex Aerosol Transport Event Over Europe During The 2017 Storm Ophelia In Cams Forecast Systems: Analysis And Evaluation,"In mid-October 2017 Storm Ophelia crossed over western coastal Europe, inducing the combined transport of Saharan dust and Iberian biomass burning aerosols over several European areas. In this study we assess the performance of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) forecast systems during this complex aerosol transport event and the potential benefits that data assimilation and regional models could bring. To this end, CAMS global and regional forecast data are analysed and compared against observations from passive (MODIS: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard Terra and Aqua) and active (CALIOP/CALIPSO: Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite sensors and ground-based measurements (EMEP: European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme). The analysis of the CAMS global forecast indicates that dust and smoke aerosols, discretely located on the warm and cold fronts of Ophelia, respectively, were affecting the aerosol atmospheric composition over Europe during the passage of the Storm. The observed MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are satisfactorily reproduced by the CAMS global forecast system, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and a fractional gross error (FGE) of 0.4. The comparison with a CAMS global control simulation not including data assimilation indicates a significant improvement in the bias due to data assimilation implementation, as the FGE decreases by 32 \%. The qualitative evaluation of the IFS (Integrated Forecast System) dominant-aerosol type and location against the CALIPSO observations overall reveals a good agreement. Regarding the footprint on air quality, both CAMS global and regional forecast systems are generally able to reproduce the observed signal of increase in surface particulate matter concentrations. The regional component performs better in terms of bias and temporal variability, with the correlation deteriorating over forecast time. Yet, both products exhibit inconsistencies on the quantitative and temporal representation of the observed surface particulate matter enhancements, stressing the need for further development of the air quality forecast systems for even more accurate and timely support of citizens and policy-makers.","{""Akritidis, Dimitris"",""Douros, John"",""Eskes, Henk"",""Flemming, Johannes"",""Georgoulias, Aristeidis K."",""Inness, Antje"",""Kartsios, Stergios"",""Katragkou, Eleni"",""Zanis, Prodromos""}",akritidis_complexaerosoltransportevent_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Where The Wild Things Are: Using Remotely Sensed Forest Productivity To Assess Arboreal Marsupial Species Richness And Abundance,"Aim: Highly productive areas have long been hypothesized to support a greater abundance and diversity of animals than less productive areas. However, evidence for this is equivocal and, until recently, has been difficult to test at a landscape level. For the first time, we use imaging spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between plant productivity and arboreal mammal species richness and abundance at a landscape scale. Location: A eucalypt forest in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Using a common index of plant productivity - normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) - as a proxy for available energy, we test the ability of species-energy theory and optimal foraging theory to explain variations in arboreal marsupial species richness and abundance. We obtained NDVI data from an airborne imaging spectrophotometer. Results: Species richness increased in relation to NDVI among 53 eucalypt forest sites, based on five arboreal marsupial species. The presence and abundance of a eucalypt folivore specialist, Petauroides volans, increased in relation to NDVI. The relative abundance of all arboreal marsupials collectively also increased in relation to NDVI among sites, even with P.Â volans data excluded. In support of optimal foraging theory, the observed locations of P.Â volans had a higher NDVI value than the average for sampling transects. In addition, the average NDVI of eucalypt forest remnants was positively related to the overall abundance of P.Â volans. An important caveat is that NDVI did not explain all the variation in arboreal marsupial populations. Main conclusions: Assuming that NDVI is an appropriate proxy for available energy in a eucalypt forest, our results are consistent with predictions from species-energy and optimal foraging theories. Remotely sensed measures of productivity and forage quality, used in conjunction with other important landscape characteristics, provide a potentially powerful tool to evaluate habitat and biodiversity hotspots at scales relevant to wildlife management and conservation.

Comparative Assessment Of The Diffusion Of Traditional Leafy Vegetables With Satellite And Innovation Platforms Methods In Benin,"Innovation platforms (IPs) are perceived today as the best approaches to the development and promotion of innovations compared to previous satellite diffusion methods (SDM). Most of the previous studies have focused on the outcomes of implementing IP without addressing the underlying factors. The success or failure factors of these new approaches remain unclear. The present study seeks to compare the factors of the institutional environment that influence the results of implementation of traditional leafy vegetable (LFT) platforms to SDM results. Four case studies including two IPs and two SDMs were chosen in a reasoned way in terms of the importance or not of the market dynamics (whether or not there are any inputs market, LFT sales markets, establishment of formal or informal sales links, etc.) and the diversity of organizations (the existence of OP, importance of NGOs and support project, intervention of local structures, gender, etc.). These cases are presented following an analytical framework combining innovation systems and functionnal analysis. Data is collected through structured, semi-structured interviews, direct observations, testimonials, etc. The data collected relates to each stage of the implementation process and concerns the actors (types of actors, profile of the actors, relationships developed, roles, attitudes, practices, perceptions, etc.), the different activities carried out (entrepreneurial, learning, dissemination of innovations, investment in developed markets, mobilization of human resources, material financial resources, lobbying of interest groups), difficulties encountered and approaches to solutions. The method of analysis is essentially qualitative. The results showed that IPs as well as SDM are influenced by the previous existence of market in the implementation context. IP cannot work when traders do not show interest in the product including TLV on which study focused. We recommend for scaling up innovations that IP initiatives take this factor into account to ensure the effectiveness of its implementation. Â© 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Characterizing Uncertainty Of General Building Stock Exposure Data,"Effective disaster risk management (DRM) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) require modeling potential and post-event impacts using building exposure data. The data used to develop building exposure databases will influence the accuracy of risk assessments and the appropriateness of subsequent decisions. This article proposes a framework for classifying approaches of developing building exposure databases into levels. To examine the uncertainty introduced through using various approaches to exposure development, a probabilistic seismic risk assessment was run with the exposure data corresponding to each proposed level using the County of Los Angeles as the study area. A factor of similar to 2.5 was observed in the final loss estimates. The variance was less dependent on the spatial scale of data than on key values, most notably estimates of building size and replacement cost.","{""Amyx, Paul"",""Eguchi, Michael"",""Esquivias, Georgiana"",""Hu, Zhenghui ''Z''"",""Huyck, Charles K."",""Jordan, Colm"",""Smith, Kay""}",huyck_characterizinguncertaintybuildingstock_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Response To Resources And Parasites Depends On Health Status In Extensively Grazed Sheep,"A fundamental question in animal ecology is how an individual's internal state and the external environment together shape species distributions across habitats. The increasing availability of biologgers is driving a revolution in answering this question in a wide range of species. In this study, the position of sheep (Ovis aries) from Global Positioning System collars was integrated with remote sensing data, field sampling of parasite distributions, and parasite load and health measures for each tagged individual. This allowed inter-individual variation in habitat use to be examined. Once controlling for a positive relationship between vegetation productivity and tick abundance, healthier individuals spent more of their time at sites with higher vegetation productivity, while less healthy individuals showed a stronger (negative) response to tick abundance. These trends are likely to represent a trade-off in foraging decisions that vary between individuals based on their health status. Given the rarity of studies that explore how animal distributions are affected by health and external factors, we demonstrate the value of integrating biologging technology with remote sensing data, traditional ecological sampling and individual measures of animal health. Our study, using extensively grazed sheep as a model system, opens new possibilities to study free-living grazing systems. Â© 2020 The Authors.

Cognitive Satellite Spectrum Management Scheme Based On The Cooperative Solidarity Values,"With the rapid development of satellite services, the requirement for improving satellite spectrum efficiency has become significant, and attracted great attention from researchers and industry practitioners. Recently, cognitive satellite communication mechanism dynamically accesses idle bands of licensed spectrum while enabling spectrum sharing among satellite and terrestrial agents. In this paper, we propose a new spectrum management scheme for cognitive satellite communications. To effectively improve spectrum efficiency, the concepts of cooperative Solidarity values are adopted by compromising between productivity and solidarity principles. Based on two Solidarity values - Solidarity and Solidarity with size p values, our two-step interactive game approach can leverage the full synergy that gives mutual advantage. The main novelty of our proposed scheme is to ensure the trade-off between marginalism and egalitarianism. Therefore, we can take various benefits in a rational way to reach a fair-efficient agreement under the dynamic changing satellite network environments. Finally, numerical results are provided to confirm the validity of our proposed approach, as well as quantitatively analyze the performance improvement by comparing with the existing protocols.

Vegetation-Based Ecosystem Service Delivery In Urban Landscapes: A Systematic Review,"The use of plants in cities and the ecosystem services they provide has attracted increased attention both publicly and within the research literature. Increasingly, the value of urban green and blue space is being recognised for its multiple benefits to human wellness and ecological integrity.\& nbsp;A quantitative assessment of studies considering nature-based solutions and ecosystem services can identify the current evidence -base for improving the provisioning of plant ecosystem services management and understanding barriers to adoption of nature-based solutions. Here, we provide a systematic review of the literature to characterise the current state of research on ecosystem service provision by urban blue and green space.\& nbsp;We identified 684 relevant studies on urban plant literature and extracted key research themes. Studies were generally focused on terrestrial systems (89\%) compared to aquatic systems such as blue space (11\%). Geographically most studies were focused on Europe (39\%), Asia (23\%), and N. America (22\%). Trees were the most frequently reported vegetation type studies (29\%) followed by generic vegetation (20\%), grassland (11\%), forest (7\%), and aquatic vegetation (5\%). Many studies were short (41\%), collecting data only over a single year or single field season. Many of the long-term studies are concerning land use/land cover change. Most studies (64\%) were conducted for less than five years. The most-reported methodology was remote sensing technology (15\%), followed by field surveys (8\%), stakeholder surveys (6\%), and ecosystem service models (5\%). The most-reported ecosystem service types were regulation and maintenance (54\%), cultural (28\%), and provisioning (16\%). Only a small number of studies looked solely at disservice (1\%) or discussed ecosystem services in generic terms. Disservices were reported in only 16\% of studies with the greatest single category of a disservice being biogenic volatile organic compounds and allergenic potential. Few studies (13\%) reported on the use of nature-based solutions and these 80\% only focused on a single nature-based solution. There was a lack of detail on plant species, 68\% (n = 468) did not list the species studied.\& nbsp;We conclude that there is a broad spectrum of research on urban vegetation services, overall, the focus of the literature is uneven. Research should seek to examine the species-specific responses to urbanisation and counter geographic disparities. There is also a need for longitudinal experimental data to identify the functioning and ecosystem service provision of green infrastructure in both urban green and blue space and factors that influence performance over policy-and management-relevant timescales.

Spectral Detection Of Stress-Related Pigments In Salt-Lake Succulent Halophytic Shrubs,"The spectral detection of vegetation pigment concentrations has a high potential value, but it is still underdeveloped, especially for pigments other than chlorophylls. In this study, the seasonal pigment dynamics of two Tecticornia species (samphires; halophytic shrubs) from north-western Australia were correlated with spectral indices that best document the pigment changes over time. Pigment dynamics were assessed by analysing betacyanin, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations at plant level and by measuring reflectance at contrasting seasonal dates. Plant reflectance was used to define a new reflectance index that was most sensitive to the seasonal shifts in Tecticornia pigment concentrations. The two Tecticornia species turned from green to red-pinkish for the period Marchâ€“August 2012 when betacyanins increased almost nine times in both species. Chlorophyll levels showed the opposite pattern to that of betacyanins, whereas carotenoid levels were relatively stable. Normalised difference indices correlated well with betacyanin (rÂ =Â 0.805, using bands at 600 and 620Â nm) and chlorophyll (rÂ =Â 0.809, using bands at 737 and 726Â nm). Using knowledge of chlorophyll concentrations slightly improved the ability of the spectral index to predict betacyanin concentration (rÂ =Â 0.822 at bands 606 and 620Â nm, in the case of chemically determined chlorophyll, rÂ =Â 0.809 when using remotely sensed chlorophyll). Our results suggest that this new spectral index can reliably detect changes in betacyanin concentrations in vegetation, with potential applications in ecological studies and environmental impact monitoring.

"Reference Upper-Air Observations For Climate Rationale, Progress, And Plans","While the global upper-air observing network has provided useful observations for operational weather forecasting for decades, its measurements lack the accuracy and long-term continuity needed for understanding climate change. Consequently, the scientific community faces uncertainty on key climate issues, such as the nature of temperature trends in the troposphere and stratosphere; the climatology, radiative effects, and hydrological role of water vapor in the upper troposphere and stratosphere; and the vertical profile of changes in atmospheric ozone, aerosols, and other trace constituents. Radiosonde data provide adequate vertical resolution to address these issues, but they have questionable accuracy and time-varying biases due to changing instrumentation and techniques. Although satellite systems provide global coverage, their vertical resolution is sometimes inadequate and they require independent reference observations for sensor and data product validation, and for merging observations from different platforms into homogeneous climate records. To address these shortcomings, and to ensure that future climate records will be more useful than the records to date, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) program is initiating a GCOS Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) to provide high-quality observations using specialized radiosondes and complementary remote sensing profiling instrumentation that can be used for validation. This paper outlines the scientific rationale for GRUAN, its role in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, network requirements and likely instrumentation, management structure, current status, and future plans. It also illustrates the value of prototype reference upper-air observations in constructing climate records and their potential contribution to the Global Space-Based Inter-Calibration System. We invite constructive feedback on the GRUAN concept and the engagement of the scientific community.","{""Berger, Franz H."",""Diamond, Howard J."",""Dykema, John"",""Goodrich, David"",""Immler, Franz"",""Murray, William"",""Peterson, Thomas"",""Seidel, Dian J."",""Sisterson, Douglas"",""Sommer, Michael"",""Thorne, Peter"",""Voemel, Holger"",""Wang, Junhong""}",seidel_referenceupperairobservations_2009,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Improving The Efficiency Of Conservation Policies With The Use Of Surrogates Derived From Remotely Sensed And Ancillary Data,"Conservation policies are emerging in many places around the world, many of which involve payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes. PES schemes provide economic incentives for forgoing land uses that reduce the provision of ecosystem services. The efficiency of such schemes depends not only on the ecosystem services provided by an area but also on the willingness of local people to forgo their land use activities. Targeting land for enrollment in PES schemes on the basis of the potential provision of ecosystem services and on the willingness to forgo certain economic activities, may therefore improve the efficiency of these schemes. The objective of this study was to develop a targeting approach, based on three surrogates derived from remotely sensed and ancillary data, for identifying land to be enrolled in one of the largest PES schemes in the world: China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP). The GTGP encourages farmers to return steep hillside cropland to forest by providing cash, grain and tree seedlings. The three surrogates used in the targeting approach were slope index, cropland probability, and GTGP enrollment probability. Combining these surrogates through Bernoulli trials allows targeting areas under cropland, with low opportunity costs for farmers and with potentially high soil erosion and landslide susceptibility. Results of applying the targeting approach in a case study area (Baoxing County, Sichuan Province, China) show that around half of the land currently enrolled is placed in areas with gentle slopes and tend to be located distant from forest areas. This reduces the potential benefits obtained from the GTGP. Targeting land using the proposed approach may double the benefits obtained from the program under the same budget, thus improving its efficiency. The approach may be applied to the entire GTGP implementation area in China and with proper modifications it may also be applicable to similar PES programs around the world. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A Review Of Applications Of Remote Sensing For Drought Studies In The Andes Region,"Study region: As climate change intensifies, drought events are becoming more frequent and intense in the Andes region. Remote sensing offers new opportunities to characterize and monitor drought and its impacts for the benefit of disaster risk reduction, water governance, and climate change adaptation. However, it remains to be seen the extent to which remotely-sensed data has been integrated into the Andes regional drought literature. Study focus: Through a semi-systematic literature review, this study evaluates the existing literature in the Andes on the topic, assesses how, where, and the extent to which remote sensing is being deployed in drought studies in the region, and points to key gaps in our regional understanding of this topic of high societal and environmental concern. New hydrological insight for the region: Remote sensing applications in drought studies remain limited in the Andes but have grown substantially since 2020. The reviewed studies concentrate on Chile and offer new insight into the impact of drought on vegetation, water bodies, the cryosphere, and wildfire incidence. Human activity, through agricultural decision-making and other socioeconomic dimensions, plays a role in propagating or deepening drought in the region. This literature offers new insight into the interplay between different drought types and the role of remote sensing in social-environmental research, although further research across geographies and drought types in the Andes region is urgently needed.

An Analysis Of The Feasibility Of Incorporating A Mobile Phone-Based Participatory Field Survey Into Satellite-Based Fall Webworm Monitoring,"This study explores the feasibility of incorporating public participatory field data collection into satellite-based fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea Drury) monitoring. Case studies were conducted through fall webworm monitoring at Jinghai county in the north of China and Lieshan county in the middle-east of China. Sample data generated from participatory monitoring data were used for satellite-based fall webworm defoliation mapping, achieving an average accuracy above 92%. By comparing participatory monitoring data with expert measurements, Willmott's indices of agreement were greater than 0.88, which demonstrated that infestation data collected by local community could achieve a comparable accuracy to expert value. Meanwhile, the comparison with satellite data confirmed that participatory monitoring data could serve as a valuable, high temporal and spatial resolution data source complementary to satellite data, to help forest managers, planners and scientists to better understand the status of fall webworm infestation.

Assessment Of The Value Of Remotely Sensed Surface Water Extent Data For The Calibration Of A Lumped Hydrological Model,"For many catchments, there is insufficient field data to calibrate the hydrological models that are needed to answer water resources management questions. One way to overcome this lack of data is to use remotely sensed data. In this study, we assess whether Landsat-based surface water extent observations can inform the calibration of a lumped bucket-type model for Brazilian catchments. We first performed synthetic experiments with daily, monthly, and limited monthly data (Aprilâ€“October), assuming a perfect monotonic relation between streamflow and stream width. The median relative performance was 0.35 for daily data and 0.17 for monthly data, where values above 0 imply an improvement in model performance compared to the lower benchmark. This indicates that the limited temporal resolution of remotely sensed data is not an impediment for model calibration. In a second step, we used real remotely sensed water extent data for calibration. For only 76 of the 671 sites the remotely sensed water extent was large and variable enough to be used for model calibration. For 30% of these sites, calibration with the actual remotely sensed water extent data led to a model fit that was better than the lower benchmark (i.e., relative performance >0). Model performance increased with river width and variation therein. This indicates that the coarse spatial resolution of the freely-available, long time series of water extent used in this study hampered model calibration. We, therefore, expect that newer higher-resolution imagery will be helpful for model calibration for more sites, especially when time series length increases. Â© 2023.

"Hydro-Morphometric Characterization And Prioritization Of Sub-Watersheds For Land And Water Resource Management Using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (Fahp): A Case Study Of Upper Rihand Watershed Of Chhattisgarh State, India","Rihand reservoir is continuously experiencing siltation due to erosion in upper basin; thus study of morphometric-based prioritization of sub-watershed has become prerequisite for implementation of measures for conservation of soil and water resource. In present study an attempted has been made to analyze characterization and prioritization of sub-watersheds in upper basin of Rihand watershed based on hydro-morphometric parameters, in an environment of Geographical Information System (GIS), with the help of Multicriteria Decision Making through Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) techniques in order to identify critical sub-watersheds for conservation and management of soil and water resource. The morphometric characterization has been done through measurement of linear, areal and relief aspect of over seven sub-watersheds using SOI topographical sheet and SRTM data with the help of Q GIS 3.10 and White box software. In the purpose prioritization of sub-watersheds FAHP method has been implemented through assigning fuzzy membership function to each of 15 morphometric parameters by deriving their relationships with erosional hazard and criterion weight has been obtained using Saaty's (Fundamentals of decision making and priority theory with analytical hierarchical process, RWS Publications University of Pittsburgh, Pittusburgh, 1980) proposed method. Based on prioritization approach the entire sub-watershed has divided into 3 vulnerable zones, i.e., high, medium and low. This study reveals that about 29\% area of the watershed is falls under high vulnerable zone as they obtained high priority value and required immediate measures. In addition, ideal locations for measure structure to prevent soil erosion and maximize infiltration has been proposed which will be useful to the decision maker for land and water resource conservation, management, and sustainable agricultural development.","{""Ghosh, Milan"",""Gope, Dipti""}",ghosh_hydromorphometriccharacterizationprioritization_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Effects Of Vegetation Restoration On Soil Conservation And Sediment Loads In China: A Critical Review,"China has been one of the countries suffering from the most serious soil erosion, which has severely degraded soil productivity and water quality, thus affecting agricultural activities and hindering economic and social development. During the past few decades, a large amount of effort has been made to combat soil erosion. Vegetation restoration as a major strategy is given equal importance compared to engineering measures. Although a measure of success has been achieved, many uncertainties remain unanswered such as to what extent the vegetation restoration has reduced soil erosion and sediment loads especially in large river systems. This paper first analyzes the impacts of vegetation restoration on soil erosion and sediment loads in terms of vegetation cover and vegetation species. Then, the spatial scale effect of soil erosion reduction benefit resulting from vegetation restoration is elaborated. Soil erosion reduction benefit decreases with increased vegetation planting area. In addition, a comprehensive discussion about the disputes between vegetation restoration and engineering measures is made by integrating published studies spanning large spatial and temporal scales. Finally, future research needs regarding vegetation restoration efforts are given. In order to evaluate the effects of vegetation restoration programs on soil erosion, assessments in shorter time interval and larger spatial scale should be undertaken. Further, the present assessment system mainly based on simple statistical methods has to be improved. Specific areas demanding immediate attention, including the western China in general and the upper Yangtze River basin in particular, are highlighted as well.

"Changes In Land-Use And Ecosystem Service Value In Guangdong Province, Southern China, From 1990 To 2018","Land-use/cover is one of the major factors that affect the ecosystem and the services it provides. The impact of land-use change on ecosystem service value is a hotspot in developing countries, especially China-a region with rapid economic development and rapid population growth. As the leading area of China's reform and opening-up, Guangdong province in southern China is subjected to land-use conversion that significantly alters the capacity of natural ecosystem to provide ecosystem services supporting human well-being. We analyzed the characteristics of land-use changes from 1990 to 2018 using the four-phase land-use data interpreted from Landsat satellite images. We estimated the ecosystem service value through a well-established benefit transfer method using modified local value coefficients, analyzed the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services through ecosystem service trade-off degree, and compared the relationship between ecosystem services value, economic development, and population in Guangdong province. The results indicated that the following: (1) Built-Up Area drastically expanded from 6783.1 km(2) in 1990 to 13,142.0 km(2) in 2018 (93.7\%), especially in the Pearl River Delta, where the growth rate of Built-Up Area expansion was up to 169.0\%. The other land-use types were all contracted as Cropland (-10.9\%), Forestland (-1.0\%), Grassland (-4.0\%), Water Body (-2.1\%), and Unused Land (-24.4\%). (2) Total ecosystem service value decreased from US\$121,666 billion in 1990 to US\$116,432 billion in 2018 (-4.3\%). Cropland, Forestland, and Water Body played the most important roles for the total ecosystem service value. Water supply experienced the largest declines in ecosystem services value (US\$ -1866.3 million, -10.1\%), followed by waste treatment (7.6\%) and gas regulation (-4.9\%). (3) Synergy was the dominant relationship among ecosystem services. The above results can not only serve as reference case for other provinces/regions/countries/ to carry out relevant research work but also provide much focus on land-use planning to manage the impacts of land-use change on regional ecosystem services function.","{""Bai, Hui"",""Wang, Ting"",""Wang, Xuan"",""Ye, Yanqiong"",""Zhang, Jiaen"",""Zhao, Wei""}",ye_landecosystemserviceguangdong_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"An Integrated Approach To Trophic Assessment Of Coastal Waters Incorporating Measurement, Modelling And Water Quality Classification","Various protocols have been developed for trophic assessment of coastal waters but most incorporate single value compliance criteria for water quality parameters which, in reality, exhibit significant spatial variation. Application of these protocols generally requires the averaging of data recorded at discrete locations to obtain single values for comparison with compliance criteria; however, there is no guarantee that the averaged values are truly representative of overall water quality. The present approach to trophic assessment integrates measurement, remote sensing, flushing analysis and water quality modelling with the aim of identifying sub-regions in coastal waterbodies that demonstrate homogeneity. Averaged water quality data for these homogenous sub-regions should be more representative of the water quality in the sub-region as a whole making the assessment process more accurate. The integrated approach incorporates water quality classification criteria developed by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency but it can incorporate any suitable classification criteria. The approach was validated for a sub-region of Cork Harbour, Ireland and the trophic assessments agreed with previous assessments by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The approach has significant applications in the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and was adopted by the Irish EPA in convincing the EU to provide the Irish government with structural funds for water quality management within Cork Harbour.

Use Of Marine Protected Areas And Exclusive Economic Zones In The Subtropical Western North Atlantic Ocean By Large Highly Mobile Sharks,"Study aim and location: Many populations of highly mobile marine fishes, including large sharks, are experiencing declines. The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Methods: Bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N = 86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation. Results: A total of 0%, 17.9% and 34.7% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area. Main conclusions: Expansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts. These findings also provide a means to inform decision makers and marine conservation planning efforts as to the types of management actions available and potential efficacy of spatial protections for these marine predators.

Can Global Precipitation Datasets Benefit The Estimation Of The Area To Be Cropped In Irrigated Agriculture?,"The area to be cropped in irrigation districts needs to be planned according to the available water resources to avoid agricultural production loss. However, the period of record of local hydro-meteorological data may be short, leading to an incomplete understanding of climate variability and consequent uncertainty in estimating surface water availability for irrigation area planning. In this study we assess the benefit of using global precipitation datasets to improve surface water availability estimates. A reference area that can be irrigated is established using a complete record of 30 years of observed river discharge data. Areas are then determined using simulated river discharges from six local hydrological models forced with in situ and global precipitation datasets (CHIRPS and MSWEP), each calibrated independently with a sample of 5 years extracted from the full 30-year record. The utility of establishing the irrigated area based on simulated river discharge simulations is compared against the reference area through a pooled relative utility value (PRUV). Results show that for all river discharge simulations the benefit of choosing the irrigated area based on the 30 years of simulated data is higher compared to using only 5 years of observed discharge data, as the statistical spread of PRUV using 30 years is smaller. Hence, it is more beneficial to calibrate a hydrological model using 5 years of observed river discharge and then to extend it with global precipitation data of 30 years as this weighs up against the model uncertainty of the model calibration.","{""Karimi, Poolad"",""Kaune, Alexander"",""Lopez, Patricia Lopez"",""Rodriguez, Erasmo"",""Werner, Micha"",""de Fraiture, Charlotte""}",kaune_globalprecipitationdatasetsbenefit_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
From Bamako To Kolda: A Case Study Of Medicines And The Financing Of District Health Services,"In 1987 the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization promoted the Bamako Initiative whose principal objective was to raise funds for primary health care (PHC) at community level through charging for drug treatment. Although the $US 180 million requested from donors by UNICEF has not been forthcoming, nevertheless about 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are at present implementing Bamako-type projects. The management of these projects may perhaps benefit from experience in the district of Kolda in Senegal, a country in which the principle of the self-management of receipts by health service structures has been established since 1981.In 1985, in the rural district (departement) of Kolda, Senegal, situated 450 km from Dakar, the health service was not being used by the population. The district management team attempted to change the pattern of under-utilization by rationalizing the mechanisms for financing services and supplies of pharmaceuticals. After the introduction of new forms of management and control, the hospital issue of prescriptions for the purchase of drugs at private pharmacies was stopped. The result was an increase in the utilization of services and in receipts, which made it possible to increase the stocks held by the pharmacy. It is planned to make the services of the pharmacy available to satellite dispensaries, giving priority to those which under take to rationalize their prescribing of medicines and to alter their methods of financing.

An Integrated Method To Create Habitat Suitability Models For Fragmented Landscapes,"Given the pervasive influence of human induced habitat fragmentation in ecological processes, landscape models are a welcome advance. The development of GIS software has allowed a greater use of these models and of analyses of the relationship between species and habitat variables. Habitat suitability models are thus theoretical concepts that can be used for planning in fragmented landscapes and habitat conservation. The most commonly used models are based on single species and on the assignment of suitability values for some environmental variables. Generally the cartographic basis for modeling suitability are thematic maps produced by a Boolean logic. In this paper we propose a model based on a set of focal species and on maps produced by a fuzzy classification method. Focal species, selected by an expert-based approach, provide a practical way of extending the scope of habitat suitability models to the conservation of biodiversity at landscape scale. The utilisation of a classification method that applies a continuity criterion may allow more consideration of the connectivity of an area because it allows a better detection of ecological gradients within a landscape. We applied this methodology to the Tuscany region focusing on terrestrial mammals. Performing a fuzzy classification we produced five land cover maps and through image processing operations we obtained a suitability model which applies a continuity criterion. The resulting suitability fuzzy model seems better for the study of connectivity and fragmentation, especially in areas with high spatial complexity. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Brazil's Amazon Soy Moratorium Reduced Deforestation,"Between 2004 and 2012, multiple policies contributed to one of the great conservation successes of the twenty-first century-an 84\% decrease in the rate of Brazilian Amazon deforestation. Among the most prominent of these policies is the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an agreement by grain traders not to purchase soy grown on recently deforested land. The ASM inspired widespread adoption of similar zero-deforestation commitments, but its impact is poorly understood due to its overlap with other conservation policies. Here, we apply an econometric triple-differences model to remotely sensed deforestation data to isolate the ASM's impact within Brazil's Arc of Deforestation. We show that the ASM reduced deforestation in soy-suitable locations in the Amazon by 0.66 +/- 0.32 percentage points relative to a counterfactual control, preventing 18,000 +/- 9,000 km(2) of deforestation over its first decade (2006-2016). Although these results highlight potential benefits of private conservation policies, the ASM's success was dependent on complementarities with public property registries and deforestation monitoring. Disentangling the impacts of anti-deforestation interventions from other conservation efforts remains a challenge. An econometric analysis of remotely sensed data reveals the efficacy of the Soy Moratorium in the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation and the extent to which its success relies on complementary policies.","{""Gibbs, Holly K."",""Heilmayr, Robert"",""Munger, Jacob"",""Rausch, Lisa L.""}",heilmayr_brazil'samazonsoymoratorium_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Landsat-Based Monitoring Of Southern Pine Beetle Infestation Severity And Severity Change In A Temperate Mixed Forest,"The recent northward expansion of Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) outbreaks associated with warming winters has caused extensive tree mortality in temperate pine forests, significantly affecting forest dynamics, structure, and functioning. Spatially-explicit early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality is critical for timely and sustainable forest management practices. The unique contributions of remote sensing technologies to mapping the location, extent, and severity of beetle outbreaks, as well as assisting in analyzing the potential drivers for outbreak predictions, have been well recognized. However, little is known about the performance of moderate resolution satellite multispectral imagery for early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality. Thus, we conducted this study, as the first attempt, to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of SPB infestation severity at the regional scale and to understand the underlying environmental drivers in a spatially-explicit manner. First, we explored the spectral signatures of SPB-killed trees based on 30-m plot measurements and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, to improve detection accuracy for areas with low-moderate SPB infestation severity, we added spectraltemporal anomaly information in the form of a linear trend of the spectral index trajectory to a previously developed approach. The best overall accuracy increased from 84.7\% to 90.1\% and the best Macro F1 value increased from 0.832 to 0.900. Next, we compared the performances of spectral indices in mapping SPB infestation severity (i.e., \% red stage within the 30-m grid cell). The results showed that the combination of Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness had the best performance for mapping SPB infestation severity (2016: R2 = 0.754; RSME = 15.7; 2017: R2 = 0.787; RSME = 12.4). Finally, we found that climatic and landscape variables can explain the detected patterns of SPB infestation from 2014 to 2017 in our study area (R2 = 0.751; RSME = 9.67), providing valuable insights on possible predictors for early warning of SPB infestation. Specifically, in our study area, winter dew point temperature was found to be one of the most important predictors, followed by SPB infestation locations in the previous year, canopy cover of host species, elevation, and slope. In the context of continued global warming, our study not only provides a novel framework for efficient, spatially-explicit, and quantitative measurements of forest damage induced by SPB infestation over large scales, but also uncovers opportunities to predict future SPB outbreaks and take precautions against it.","{""Gao, Renjie"",""Huang, Chengquan"",""Huang, Zehua"",""Lv, Zhengang"",""Meng, Ran"",""Sun, Rui"",""Zhao, Feng""}",meng_landsatbasedmonitoringsouthern_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Conservation And Development: Evidence From Thai Protected Areas,"Protected areas are a key tool for conservation policy but their economic impacts are not well understood. This paper presents new evidence about the local effects of strictly protected areas in Thailand, combining data on socioeconomic outcomes from a poverty mapping study with satellite-based estimates of forest cover. The selective placement of protected areas is addressed by controlling for characteristics which drove both protection and development and by instrumenting for protection with priority watershed status. The estimates indicate that protected areas increased average consumption and lowered poverty rates, despite imposing binding constraints on agricultural land availability. Socioeconomic gains are likely explained by increased tourism in and around protected areas. However, net impacts are largest at intermediate distances from major cities, highlighting that the spatial patterns of both costs and benefits are important for efforts to minimize conservation-development tradeoffs.

Grace And Glory: How One Can Make A Difference,"In 2010, a free clinic in northeast Oklahoma City opened its doors and began seeing nonemergent patients. This evidence-based article illustrates the impact of the clinic on its community. It discusses the benefits and financial implications and the operation of the free clinic through contributions and volunteerism, and highlights strengths and limitations. A survey conducted over a period of three months on 50 clinic patients concluded that one free clinic can make a difference by providing much-needed access to medical care, decreasing financial burdens on area hospitals, and enhancing public opinion of Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) as primary care providers.","{""Ng, J.""}",ng_graceglorydifference_2013,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Monitoring Restored Tropical Forest Diversity And Structure Through Uav-Borne Hyperspectral And Lidar Fusion,"Remote sensors, onboard orbital platforms, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance our understanding of changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function of forests, offering multi-scale monitoring of forest restoration. UAV systems can generate high-resolution images that provide accurate information on forest ecosystems to aid decision-making in restoration projects. However, UAV technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining UAV-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar dataâ€”canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and understory LAIâ€”and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral dataâ€”15 vegetation indices (VIs), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that VIs were positively correlated with LAI for low LAI values, but stabilized for LAI greater than 2 m2/m2. LAI and structural VIs increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted AGB than hyperspectral-derived VIs, it was the fusion of UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration. The use of UAV-borne remote sensors can play an essential role during the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, which requires detailed forest monitoring on an unprecedented scale.

"Investigating Aerosol Vertical Distribution Using Calipso Time Series Over The Middle East And North Africa (Mena), Europe, And India: A Bfast-Based Gradual And Abrupt Change Detection","Monitoring spatio-temporal changes of aerosols is necessary to better understand atmospheric processes. Here, the vertical distribution of aerosols and how it has changed from 2006 to 2017 is studied using time series data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite. Aerosol centroid altitude, a variable representing the aerosol vertical extent, is estimated using the aerosol flags of the Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) product of CALIOP. The case study includes four overpasses, with various aerosol types and densities, covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and India regions characterized by frequent dust storms and smoke emissions, respectively, and Europe, a pioneer in establishing air quality policies. The values of aerosol centroid altitude are examined to determine the effects of climate (space) and season (time) on aerosol vertical distribution. For this purpose, 10-year mean values of aerosol centroid altitude were calculated over climate regions extracted from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) climate map as well as over each season, and the resultant values were then statistically analyzed. The results indicate that environmental heat, steam from climate or season, leads to aerosols increasing in altitude. The time series was imported in a version of the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, so-called BFAST01, allowing the magnitude of gradual changes along with the time and type of the major abrupt change to be determined. The strongest positive trends in aerosol centroid altitude were recorded in the desert regions. Positive trends were also observed in the mid-latitudes steppes and the North Sea. India was another region with a relatively positive trend which could be mainly caused by the increasing anthropogenic activities and smoke emission. The strongest negative trend detected in Europe is a result of strict environmental regulation policies and efforts for air quality improvement. The results show that a small fraction of granules (12 out of 4036) mainly in the northern part of overpass A, over Europe, the mid part of overpasses B and C, over the Middle East, and southern part of overpass D, over India, experienced structural changes. The reversal changes type 8 (50% of the abrupt changes) and interruption type 6 (33%) are the dominant types, mostly occurred around 2014 and 2012, respectively. Changing environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, and anthropogenic activities are the main drivers of these changes. The study demonstrates the applicability of BFAST01 and the usability of CALIOP VFM time series data to monitor the vertical structure of the atmosphere.

The Promise Of Information And Communication Technology In Healthcare: Extracting Value From The Chaos,"Healthcare is an information business with expanding use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Current ICT tools are immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange (HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise.Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices.ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.

"Analysis Of Urban Sprawl And Growth Pattern Using Geospatial Technologies In Megacity, Bangkok, Thailand","Urbanization is a spatial process and involves multiple dimensions of the settlements where jobs and housing are the driving force for urban migration, causing the expansion of urban areas from the center of Bangkok to its vicinity. This study focuses on the changes in physical factors affecting urban expansion by using spatial analysis in term of remote sensing statistical models. Three years of aerial photo and satellite imagery studies (2000, 2010 and 2020) are used to determine urbanization which was input into the study of land-use changes to demonstrate the situation of urban sprawl. The changes in land use pattern of Bangkok and its vicinities during 2000â€“2020 demonstrates the consequences of urban migration based on Urban Index (UI) which presents urban sprawling of Bangkok to its vicinities. The results of analysis demonstrated that the five adjacent provinces of Bangkok have continued its growth with the higher sprawling rate based on entropy calculations ranging from 2.25 to 2.46 in 2020. The expanding from the capital city to the vicinity provinces has resulted due to the nodes of employment are clustered in the capital city. The settlement in the outskirt areas of Bangkok could help in reduction of living expenses within the urban areas, although require longer travel distance from the vicinities of Bangkok. The findings demonstrate the value of geospatial technologies in urban planning and environmental management to cope with the rapid urban expansion, resulting in urban sprawl for sustainable urban strategies and policies by controlling improper future of land use changes.

Deforestation And Co 2 Emissions In Coastal Tanzania From 1990 To 2007,"Conversion of forest to other land uses is a major contributor to climate change. The coastal forests of Tanzania have increasingly been recognized as being of global biodiversity importance, due to high rates of species endemism. Rates of forest loss are similar to those of other tropical regions, resulting in increasing levels of threat for the biological values within the remaining forest and potentially significant source of CO 2 emissions. This study estimated the remaining cover and carbon stock of Tanzania's coastal forests and the CO 2 emissions due to forest loss between c. 1990 and c. 2007. Coastal Tanzania contained over 273 700 ha of forest in 2007. Deforestation rates in the area have slowed from 1.0% yr 1, or > 3735 ha yr 1 during the 1990s, to 0.4% yr 1, or > 1233 ha yr 1 during 2000-2007. Despite lower deforestation rates in 2000-2007, the percentage forest lost from within reserved areas has remained steady at 0.2% yr 1 for both time periods. CO 2 emissions from deforestation slowed from at least 0.63 Mt CO2 yr 1 in 1990-2000 to at least 0.20 Mt CO 2 yr 1 in 2000-2007. Regional forest clearance in Tanzania is highly dynamic; while rates have slowed since 2000, forest habitat conversion has continued and there is no guarantee that future rates will remain low. A rigorous policy on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) should be implemented to avoid future increases in deforestation rates.

"Prescribed Burning Protects Endangered Tropical Heathlands Of The Arnhem Plateau, Northern Australia","Summary: There are concerns that frequent intense fires are reducing biodiversity on the Arnhem Plateau within Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. Since the 1980s, prescribed burning in the early dry season has aimed to reduce the extent of late dry season wildfires. A programme of more strategic prescribed burning has been undertaken since 2007, aiming to increase intervals between fires affecting heathland and rain forest communities. We assess the effectiveness of prescribed burning in Kakadu's Stone Country using a Landsat satellite-derived fire history (1980-2011), in terms of achieving 'tolerable fire intervals' for dominant plant communities. Our analysis indicates that fire regimes have become substantially more favourable for biodiversity since the early 1980s. Although annual extent of burning has remained unchanged, two significant changes in fire regimes have occurred over the long term: (i) a switch from late dry season dominance to early dry season dominance and (ii) an increase in the abundance of long-unburnt vegetation, both of which are likely to benefit biodiversity. Demonstrating the statistical significance of changes associated with recent, more strategic fire management (2007-2011) is limited by the short duration of this management approach, although there is evidence of increasing abundance of long-unburnt vegetation during this time. The view that the Arnhem Plateau's fire regimes are increasingly driving biodiversity loss (due to frequent late dry season wildfires) is erroneous; they are in a more benign state now than at any time over the last three decades, most likely due to extensive use of prescribed burning. Synthesis and applications. In highly fire-prone landscapes, such as savannas, prescribed burning can be an effective means of: (i) bringing forward peak fire activity to the time of year when fire conditions are relatively mild and (ii) increasing abundance of long-unburnt vegetation. These changes are likely to favour persistence of a range of fire-sensitive communities. Our case study supports the strategic use of prescribed burning to protect fire-sensitive biota within highly fire-prone landscapes throughout the world.

Crowdsourced Data For Bicycling Research And Practice,"Cities are promoting bicycling for transportation as an antidote to increased traffic congestion, obesity and related health issues, and air pollution. However, both research and practice have been stalled by lack of data on bicycling volumes, safety, infrastructure, and public attitudes. New technologies such as GPS-enabled smartphones, crowdsourcing tools, and social media are changing the potential sources for bicycling data. However, many of the developments are coming from data science and it can be difficult evaluate the strengths and limitations of crowdsourced data. In this narrative review we provide an overview and critique of crowdsourced data that are being used to fill gaps and advance bicycling behaviour and safety knowledge. We assess crowdsourced data used to map ridership (fitness, bike share, and GPS/accelerometer data), assess safety (web-map tools), map infrastructure (OpenStreetMap), and track attitudes (social media). For each category of data, we discuss the challenges and opportunities they offer for researchers and practitioners. Fitness app data can be used to model spatial variation in bicycling ridership volumes, and GPS/accelerometer data offer new potential to characterise route choice and origin-destination of bicycling trips; however, working with these data requires a high level of training in data science. New sources of safety and near miss data can be used to address underreporting and increase predictive capacity but require grassroots promotion and are often best used when combined with official reports. Crowdsourced bicycling infrastructure data can be timely and facilitate comparisons across multiple cities; however, such data must be assessed for consistency in route type labels. Using social media, it is possible to track reactions to bicycle policy and infrastructure changes, yet linking attitudes expressed on social media platforms with broader populations is a challenge. New data present opportunities for improving our understanding of bicycling and supporting decision making towards transportation options that are healthy and safe for all. However, there are challenges, such as who has data access and how data crowdsourced tools are funded, protection of individual privacy, representativeness of data and impact of biased data on equity in decision making, and stakeholder capacity to use data given the requirement for advanced data science skills. If cities are to benefit from these new data, methodological developments and tools and training for end-users will need to track with the momentum of crowdsourced data. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

Analysis Of Thermal Environment By Urban Expansion Using Kompsat And Landsat 8: Sejong City,"Urban population growth and consequent rapid urbanization involve some thermal environmental problems in the cities. Monitoring of thermal environments in urban areas such as hot spot analysis is required for effective actions to resolve these problems. This study selected 14 dongs and surrounding administrative districts of Sejong city as study areas and analyzed the characteristics of changes in surface temperature due to the urban expansion in the summer from 2013 to 2018. In the study, the surface temperature distributions in the study areas were plotted using surface temperature values from Landsat 8 and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) based on KOMPSAT 2/3 data, and the patterns of surface temperature changes with urban expansion were discussed using the estimated NDVI and NDBI. In particular, the distinct urbanization in the study areas were selected for case studies, and the cause of the changes in the hot spots in the regions was analyzed using high-resolution KOMPSAT images. This study results present that hot spots appeared in urbanized regions within the study areas, and it was plotted that the lower the NDVI values and the higher the NDBI values indicate the temperature values are high. The land surface temperature and satellite-based products were used to divide the study areas into continuously urbanized regions and rapidly urbanized regions and to identify the different characteristics depending on land covers. In the regions with distinct surface temperature changes by urbanization, the analysis using high-resolution KOMPSAT images as presented in this study could provide effective information for urban planning and policy utilization in the future.","{""Cho, Dongjin"",""Kim, Yeji"",""Park, Seonyoung"",""Yoo, Cheolhee""}",yoo_analysisthermalenvironmenturban_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Response Of Ecosystem Services To Land Use And Cover Change: A Case Study In Chengdu City,"Land use and cover change is an important factor reflecting the resource footprints of the human race. Studies related to land use and cover change with ecosystem services value can provide a good reference for research on human resource footprints. In this study, through the interpretation of remote sensing images of Chengdu from 2000 to 2015, we obtained data on land use and cover change. Based on the analysis of the equivalent factor table for land use and cover change and ecosystem services value, we used the CPI accumulation coefficient and marginal value coefficient to modify the evaluation model of ecosystem services value, thus calculating the value of ecosystem services for Chengdu. The results show that the area under farmland and grassland continued to decrease, while the area covered by forest land, water area, construction land and unused land continued to increase in general. The ecosystem services value of Chengdu increased from 2.86 x 10(10) RMB yuan in 2000 to 5.02 x 10(10) RMB yuan in 2015, indicating a 75.46\% increase. From this study, we determined that the development of Chengdu during 2000-2015 is sustainable, with reasonable land use, and will provide an important reference for economic development and land use policy in Chengdu in the future.

Discovering Floristic And Geoecological Gradients Across Amazonia,"Aim To map and interpret floristic and geoecological patterns across the Amazon basin by combining extensive field data with basin-wide Landsat imagery and climatic data. Location Amazonia. Taxon Ground truth data on ferns and lycophytes; remote sensing results reflect forest canopy properties. Methods We used field plot data to assess main ecological gradients across Amazonia and to relate floristic ordination axes to soil base cation concentration, Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) climatic variables and reflectance values from a basin-wide Landsat image composite with generalized linear models. Ordination axes were then predicted across all Amazonia using Landsat and CHELSA, and a regional subdivision was obtained using k-medoid classification. Results The primary floristic gradient was strongly related to base cation concentration in the soil, and the secondary gradient to climatic variables. The Landsat image composite revealed a tapestry of broad-scale variation in canopy reflectance characteristics across Amazonia. Ordination axis scores predicted using Landsat and CHELSA variables produced spatial patterns consistent with existing knowledge on soils, geology and vegetation, but also suggested new floristic patterns. The clearest dichotomy was between central Amazonia and the peripheral areas, and the available data supported a classification into at least eight subregions. Main conclusions Landsat data are capable of predicting soil-related species compositional patterns of understorey ferns and lycophytes across the Amazon basin with surprisingly high accuracy. Although the exact floristic relationships may differ among plant groups, the observed ecological gradients must be relevant for other plants as well, since surface reflectance recorded by satellites is mostly influenced by the tree canopy. This opens exciting prospects for species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and biogeographical and ecological studies on Amazonian biota. Our maps provide a preliminary geoecological subdivision of Amazonia that can now be tested and refined using field data of other plant groups and from hitherto unsampled areas.","{""Cardenas, Glenda"",""Figueiredo, Fernando O.

Sustainable Forest Management Tools For The Moscow Region,"The paper presents an inventory of current forest formations and a map of forest vegetation in the Moscow region. To assess current forest formations, an approach integrating both ground-and remote sensing data was applied. The transformation of forests in the Moscow region was evaluated by the criteria of changing the quality, quantity and spatial configuration of forests, in accordance with the model SLOSS (Single Large or Several Small). The conceptual model ""Pressure-State-Response"" (hereinafter PRS) was used to develop appropriate tools for sustainable environmental management in the region. The use of this model made it possible not only to assess the state of forests but also to determine the main impacts affecting them, as well as the effectiveness of measures aimed at optimizing environmental management regimes in order to maintain forest biodiversity. Complex assessment of sets of indicators for each group of PRS criteria is performed for the integrated multicriteria assessment of sustainable forest management within the boundaries of urban districts. The average normalized score was calculated for each group of criteria. Correlation between the scores of the groups of criteria evaluated and classification of administrative units according to the ratio of groups of the K-means method criteria performed. As a result of component-by-component evaluation, the values of indicators are presented in form of tables and map Ñharts. Benchmarking of Specially Protected Natural Area (SPNA) system and reforestation activities is performed regarding to the forest biodiversity conservation in the urban districts. It is shown that single integrated assessment of the ecological value of the territory (the ""State"" criterion), an integrated assessment of impact factors (the ""Load"") and appropriate actions to maintain forest biodiversity (the ""Response"" criterion) can be considered as an expression of generalized information directly used in decision-making and assessment of current trends for a particular region.

A Decision Analysis Approach For Risk Management Of Near-Earth Objects,"Risk management of near-Earth objects (NEOs; e.g., asteroids and comets) that can potentially impact Earth is an important issue that took on added urgency with the Chelyabinsk event of February 2013. Thousands of NEOs large enough to cause substantial damage are known to exist, although only a small fraction of these have the potential to impact Earth in the next few centuries. The probability and location of a NEO impact are subject to complex physics and great uncertainty, and consequences can range from minimal to devastating, depending upon the size of the NEO and location of impact. Deflecting a potential NEO impactor would be complex and expensive, and inter-agency and international cooperation would be necessary. Such deflection campaigns may be risky in themselves, and mission failure may result in unintended consequences. The benefits, risks, and costs of different potential NEO risk management strategies have not been compared in a systematic fashion. We present a decision analysis framework addressing this hazard. Decision analysis is the science of informing difficult decisions. It is inherently multi-disciplinary, especially with regard to managing catastrophic risks. Note that risk analysis clarifies the nature and magnitude of risks, whereas decision analysis guides rational risk management. Decision analysis can be used to inform strategic, policy, or resource allocation decisions. First, a problem is defined, including the decision situation and context. Second, objectives are defined, based upon what the different decision-makers and stakeholders (i.e., participants in the decision) value as important. Third, quantitative measures or scales for the objectives are determined. Fourth, alternative choices or strategies are defined. Fifth, the problem is then quantitatively modeled, including probabilistic risk analysis, and the alternatives are ranked in terms of how well they satisfy the objectives. Sixth, sensitivity analyses are performed in order to examine the impact of uncertainties. Finally, the need for further analysis, data collection, or refinement is determined. The first steps of defining the problem and the objectives are critical to constructing an informative decision analysis. Such steps must be undertaken with participation from experts, decision-makers, and stakeholders (defined here as ""derision participants""). The basic problem here can be framed as: ""What is the best strategy to manage risk associated with NEOs?"" Some high-level objectives might be to minimize: mortality and injuries, damage to critical infrastructure (e.g., power, communications and food distribution), ecosystem damage, property damage, ungrounded media and public speculation, resources expended, and overall cost. Another valuable objective would be to maximize inter-agency/government coordination. Some of these objectives (e.g., ""minimize mortality"") are readily quantified (e.g., deaths and injuries averted). Others are less so (e.g., ""maximize inter-agency/government coordination""), but these can be scaled. Objectives may be inversely related: e.g., a strategy that minimizes mortality may cost more. They are also unlikely to be weighted equally. Defining objectives and assessing their relative weight and interactions requires early engagement with decision participants. High-level decisions include whether to deflect a NEO, when to deflect, what is the best alternative for deflection/destruction, and disaster management strategies if an impact occurs. Important influences include, for example: NEO characteristics (orbital characteristics, diameter, mass, spin and composition), impact probability and location, interval between discovery and projected impact date, interval between discovery and deflection target date, costs of information collection, costs and technological feasibility of deflection alternatives, risks of deflection campaigns, requirements for inter-agency and international cooperation, and timing of informing the public. The analytical aspects of decision analysis center on estimation of the expected value (i.e. utility) of different alternatives. The expected value of an alternative is a function of the probability-weighted consequences, estimated using Bayesian calculations in a decision tree or influence diagram model. The result is a set of expected-value estimates for all alternatives evaluated that enables a ranking; the higher the expected value, the more preferred the alternative. A common way to include resource limitations is by framing the decision analysis in the context of economics (e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis). An important aspect of decision analysis in the NEO risk management case is the ability, known as sensitivity analysis, to examine the effect of parameter uncertainty upon decisions. The simplest way to evaluate uncertainty associated with the information used in a decision analysis is to adjust the input values one at a time (or simultaneously) to examine how the results change. Monte Carlo simulations can be used to adjust the inputs over ranges or distributions of values; statistical means then are used to determine the most influential variables. These techniques yield a measure known as the expected value of imperfect information. This value is highly informative, because it allows the decision-maker with imperfect information to evaluate the impact of using experiments, tests, or data collection (e.g. Earth-based observations, space-based remote sensing, etc.) to refine judgments; and indeed to estimate how much should be spent to reduce uncertainty.

Spatial Modeling Of Susceptibility To Subsidence Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Land subsidence is a hazard that results from conditioning factors that cause environmental change and generate social and economic impacts. Some of these factors may increase dissolution of calcareous stones, change groundwater storage, or stem from mining, faulting, and seismic activity. Semnan Plain, Iran is experiencing land subsidence that, along with secondary impacts like surface fissures, is becoming increasingly troublesome. This study modeled land subsidence and created a susceptibility map using multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), and boosted regression tree (BRT) machine-learning methods. Analysis of satellite imagery, documents reporting past subsidence, and a contemporary field survey identified 65 sinkholes on Semnan Plain. Twelve conditioning factors were selected for analysis from a review of the scholarly literature, field investigation, and data availability. The three methods were used to model subsidence from a training subset of the known sites. The models were validated with the remaining subset of subsidence locations. Finally, susceptibility maps were used to predict other sites that are highly likely to see subsidence. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curves (AUC) were applied to assess the accuracies of the maps.

Advances In Representing Interactive Methane In Modele2-Yibs (Version 1.1),"Methane (CH4) is both a greenhouse gas and a precursor of tropospheric ozone, making it an important focus of chemistry-climate interactions. Methane has both anthropogenic and natural emission sources, and reaction with the atmosphere's principal oxidizing agent, the hydroxyl radical (OH), is the dominant tropospheric loss process of methane. The tight coupling between methane and OH abundances drives indirect linkages between methane and other short-lived air pollutants and prompts the use of interactive methane chemistry in global chemistry-climate modeling. In this study, an updated contemporary inventory of natural methane emissions and the soil sink is developed using an optimization procedure that applies published emissions data to the NASA GISS ModelE2-Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (ModelE2-YIBs) global chemistry-climate model. Methane observations from the global surface air-sampling network of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are used to guide refinement of the natural methane inventory. The wetland methane flux is calculated as a best fit; thus, the accuracy of this derived flux assumes accurate simulation of methane chemical loss in the atmosphere and accurate prescription of the other methane fluxes (anthropogenic and natural). The optimization process indicates global annual wetland methane emissions of 140 Tg CH4 yr(-1). The updated inventory includes total global annual methane emissions from natural sources of 181 Tg CH4 yr(-1) and a global annual methane soil sink of 60 Tg CH4 yr(-1). An interactive methane simulation is run using ModelE2-YIBs, applying dynamic methane emissions and the updated natural methane emissions inventory that results from the optimization process. The simulated methane chemical lifetime of 10.4 +/- 0.1 years corresponds well to observed lifetimes. The simulated year 2005 global-mean surface methane concentration is 1.1\% higher than the observed value from the NOAA ESRL measurements. Comparison of the simulated atmospheric methane distribution with the NOAA ESRL surface observations at 50 measurement locations finds that the simulated annual methane mixing ratio is within 1\% (i.e., +1 \% to -1 \%) of the observed value at 76\% of locations. Considering the 50 stations, the mean relative difference between the simulated and observed annual methane mixing ratio is a model overestimate of only 0.5 \%. Comparison of simulated annual column-averaged methane concentrations with SCIAMACHY satellite retrievals provides an independent post-optimization evaluation of modeled methane. The comparison finds a slight model underestimate in 95\% of grid cells, suggesting that the applied methane source in the model is slightly underestimated or the model's methane sink strength is slightly too strong outside of the surface layer. Overall, the strong agreement between simulated and observed methane lifetimes and concentrations indicates that the ModelE2-YIBs chemistry-climate model is able to capture the principal processes that control atmospheric methane.","{""Harper, Kandice L."",""Unger, Nadine"",""Zheng, Yiqi""}",harper_advancesrepresentinginteractivemethane_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
A Pilot Asthma Incidence Surveillance System And Case Definition: Lessons Learned,"Objectives. Surveillance for incident asthma in the general population could provide timely information about asthma trends and new, emerging etiologic factors. We sought to determine the feasibility of an asthma incidence surveillance system using voluntary reporting of asthma by outpatient clinics and emergency departments (EDs). Methods. Voluntary reporting occurred from July 2002 through June 2006. We classified reported asthma based on a case definition adapted from one developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. We validated the case definition by having pulmonologists review data from participant interviews, medical record abstractions, and pulmonary function test (PFT) results. Results. The positive predictive value (PPV) of meeting any of the case definition criteria for asthma was 80% to 82%. The criterion of taking at least one rescue and one controller medication had the highest PPV (97% to 100%). Only 7% of people meeting the incident case definition had a PFT documented in their medical record, limiting the usefulness of PFT results for case classification. Compared with pediatric participants, adult participants were more likely to be uninsured and to obtain asthma care at EDs. The surveillance system cost $5,129 per enrolled person meeting the incident case definition and was difficult to implement in participating clinics and EDs because asthma reporting was not mandatory and informed consent was necessary. Conclusions. The project was useful in evaluating the case definition's validity and in describing the participants' characteristics and health-care use patterns. However, without mandatory reporting laws, reporting of incident asthma in the general population by clinicians is not likely to be a feasible method for asthma surveillance.

General Landscape Connectivity Model (Glcm): A New Way To Map Whole Of Landscape Biodiversity Functional Connectivity For Operational Planning And Reporting,"Graph-theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities. We developed the new General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM), as a operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks to inform conservation priorities and plans. GLCM is built on two complementary metapopulation ecology-based measures: Neighbourhood habitat area (Ni) and habitat link value (Li). Ni is a measure of the amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross-scale connectivity to neighbouring habitat. The remaining Ni across a region can be reported as an indicator of Ecological Carrying Capacity for wildlife (plants and animals). Li at any location is its contribution to the landscape connectivity of the study region (i.e. which is reported as summed Ni across a region) by virtue of providing the 'least-cost' linkages between concentrations of habitat. Mapped Li provides valuable insights into the pattern of a region's habitat network, highlighting functioning habitat corridors and stepping-stones, and candidate areas for conservation and restoration. Due to its foundations in ecological theory and its parsimonious design, GLCM addresses a number of criteria we list as important, while addressing criticisms often levelled at graph-theoretical approaches. We present results for three south-east Australian case studies using continuous-value ecological condition surfaces as input. However, a simple habitat/non-habitat binary surface approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used. GLCM has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape connectivity assessment at regional scales, and broader. It incorporates connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes (foraging, dispersal and migration). Successively finer spatial scales are more intensively sampled based on a simple scaling-law. This approach allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data-driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations. The operational advantages of GLCM means that landscape connectivity assessments can be readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time-series remote sensing of land cover, or applied to alternative scenarios of land use, ecological restoration, climate projections or combinations of these.","{""Drielsma, Michael J."",""Love, Jamie"",""Taylor, Subhashni"",""Thapa, Rajesh"",""Williams, Kristen J.""}",drielsma_landscapeconnectivitymodelglcm_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Assessing Irrigation Water Use With Remote Sensing-Based Soil Water Balance At An Irrigation Scheme Level In A Semi-Arid Region Of Morocco,"This study aims to evaluate a remote sensing-based approach to allow estimation of the temporal and spatial distribution of crop evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation water requirements over irrigated areas in semi-arid regions. The method is based on the daily step FAO-56 Soil Water Balance model combined with a time series of basal crop coefficients and the fractional vegetation cover derived from high-resolution satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. The model was first calibrated and validated at plot scale using ET measured by eddy-covariance systems over wheat fields and olive orchards representing the main crops grown in the study area of the Haouz plain (central Morocco). The results showed that the model provided good estimates of ET for wheat and olive trees with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 0.56 and 0.54 mm/day respectively. The model was then used to compare remotely sensed estimates of irrigation requirements (RS-IWR) and irrigation water supplied (WS) at plot scale over an irrigation district in the Haouz plain through three growing seasons. The comparison indicated a large spatio-temporal variability in irrigation water demands and supplies; the median values of WS and RS-IWR were 130 (175), 117 (175) and 118 (112) mm respectively in the 2002-2003, 2005-2006 and 2008-2009 seasons. This could be attributed to inadequate irrigation supply and/or to farmers' socio-economic considerations and management practices. The findings demonstrate the potential for irrigation managers to use remote sensing-based models to monitor irrigation water usage for efficient and sustainable use of water resources.","{""Chehbouni, Abdelghani"",""Er-Raki, Salah"",""Khabba, Said"",""Kharrou, Mohamed Hakim"",""Le Page, Michel"",""Simonneaux, Vincent""}",kharrou_assessingirrigationwaterremote_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Impact, Efficiency, Inequality, And Injustice Of Urban Air Pollution: Variability By Emission Location","Reducing exposure to air pollution is an important goal for many local and national governments. Disparities in air pollution exposure by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class are well documented; reducing these disparities is another important policy target. Meeting both goals requires tools to evaluate how emission reduction options affect average exposures and exposure disparities. Here, we consider the role of emission location in implementing control strategies, and investigate the effect of two practical, space-based approaches-low-emission zones and truck rerouting-on diesel particle levels in Southern California. We employ Eulerian grid modeling to explore the impact that emission location has on four outcomes important to policymakers: total pollution exposure, exposure efficiency (i.e. exposure impact per unit emission), exposure inequality (i.e. deviations from exposure being equally distributed across the population; unequal exposure among individuals), and exposure injustice (i.e. associations between exposure and demographic attributes such as race or ethnicity; unequal exposure among groups). Our results highlight potential trade-offs (e.g. an increase in equality but reduction in justice for interventions in some locations) as well as opportunities for 'win-win' solutions (locations for which emission reductions would reduce all four target outcomes). We find that a simple, straightforward approach-reducing emissions in neighborhoods with a high proportion of minority residents-may or may not yield the strongest benefits to environmental justice; the reason is that the straightforward approach fails to account for meteorology and where pollution travels after being emitted. In short, we demonstrate an approach that can be used to identify areas in which emissions reductions would have high efficiency and would also result in disproportionately large reductions to average exposure, exposure inequality, and exposure injustice. The approach presented here could be used to design and prioritize local or national emission reduction efforts.","{""Marshall, Julian D."",""Nguyen, Nam P.""}",nguyen_impactefficiencyinequalityinjustice_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Assessing Waterlogging Stress Level Of Winter Wheat From Hyperspectral Imagery Based On Harmonic Analysis,"Frequent waterlogging disasters can have serious effects on regional ecology, food safety, and socioeconomic sustainable development. Early monitoring of waterlogging stress levels is vital for accurate production input management and reduction of crop production-related risks. In this study, a pot experiment on winter wheat was designed using three varieties and seven gradients of waterlogging stress. Hyperspectral imagery of the winter wheat canopy in the jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage, filling stage, and maturation stage were measured and then classified. Wavebands of imaging data were screened. Waterlogging stress level was assessed by a combined harmonic analysis method, and application of this method at field scale was discussed preliminarily. Results show that compared to the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine algorithms, the random forest algorithm is the best batch classification method for hyperspectral imagery of potted winter wheat. It can recognize waterlogging stress well in the wavebands of red absorption valley (RW: 640â€“680 nm), red-edge (RE: 670â€“737 nm), and near-infrared (NIR: 700â€“900 nm). In the RW region, amplitudes of the first three harmonic sub-signals (c1, c2, and c3) can be used as indexes to recognize the waterlogging stress level that each winter wheat variety undertakes. The third harmonic sub-signal amplitude c3 of the RE region is also suitable for judging stress levels of JM31 (one of the three varieties which is highly sensitive to water content). This study has important theoretical significance and practical application values related to the accurate control of waterlogging stress, and functions as a new method to monitor other types of environmental stress levels such as drought stress, freezing stress, and high-temperature stress levels.

Protected Areas In Boreal Canada: A Baseline And Considerations For The Continued Development Of A Representative And Effective Reserve Network,"Boreal forests maintain regionally important biodiversity and globally important ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and freshwater resources. Many boreal systems have limited anthropogenic disturbances and are preserved, in effect, to date largely by their harsh climates and remoteness. As of 2011, almost 10\% of Canada is subject to some manner of formal protection, with 4.5\% of this protected area found within the boreal zone. The management of existing parks and protected areas (PPAs) is shared amongst many federal, provincial, and territorial jurisdictions. Although there are currently low levels of anthropogenic development in some portions of the boreal zone (especially the north), if expansion of protected areas is of interest, there are challenges to traditional PPA networks that may be more prominent in the boreal zone than elsewhere: (1) the boreal zone is home to charismatic mammal species with area requirements much larger than typical PPAs; (2) the boreal zone is characterized by natural disturbance regimes that impact large areas; and (3) projected changes to climate for the boreal zone are among the greatest in the world, creating temporal considerations for conservation planning exercises. There is currently no PPA assessment specific to boreal Canada. To address this lack of an assessment, we developed a conservation gap analysis of the current PPA system with respect to a variety of environmental surrogates (ecozones, land cover, vegetation productivity, and landscape structure). The amount of formally protected land varied within each surrogate, with few commonly reported features meeting national or international conservation targets. Furthermore, few reserves met the areal requirements that have been previously recommended to protect large mammals or accommodate the disturbance regimes present. We also discuss considerations and implications of area-based versus value-based protection objectives. While recognizing that there are still scientific challenges around understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of PPAs, based upon our review and assessment, the following considerations should inform conservation options for the boreal zone: (1) representation of the distribution of natural features within the PPA network; (2) effective maintenance of habitat requirements and spatial resilience to both cyclical and directional changes in spatial patterns through large, connected reserves; and (3) implementation of sustainable forest management practices (where applicable) throughout the broader landscape, as traditional on-reserve protection is unlikely to be sufficient to meet conservation goals. The Canadian boreal is unique in possessing large tracts of inaccessible forested lands that are not subject to management interventions, thereby offering functions similar to protected lands. The question of how to more formally integrate these lands into the existing PPA network requires further consideration. Further, the important temporal role of landscape dynamics in designing an effective PPA needs to be further studied as well as development of a better understanding of design needs in the context of a changing climate.","{""Andrew, Margaret E."",""Cardille, Jeffrey A."",""Wulder, Michael A.""}",andrew_protectedborealcanadabaseline_2014,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Mapping High-Resolution Forest Aboveground Biomass Of China Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data,"Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is crucial for carbon cycle studies and climate change mitigation actions. However, because of limitations in timely and reliable forestry surveys and high-resolution remote sensing data, producing a fine resolution and spatial continuous forest AGB map of China is challenging. Here, we combined 4789 ground-truth AGB measurements and multisource remote sensing data such as a recently released forest canopy-height product, optical spectral indexes, topographic data, climatological data, and soil properties to train a random forest regression model for forest AGB estimation of China at 30-m resolution. The accuracy of the estimated AGB can yield R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 70.71 Mg/ha. The nationwide estimates show that the average forest AGB and total forest carbon storage were 97.57 +/- 23.85 Mg/ha and 11.06 Pg C for the year 2019, respectively. The value of AGB uncertainty ranges from 0.68 Mg/ha to 37.80 Mg/ha, and the average AGB uncertainty was 4.32 +/- 1.75 Mg/ha. The forest AGB estimates of China in this study correspond reasonably well with the AGB estimates derived from the forestry and grassland statistical yearbook at the provincial level (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 30.15 Mg/ha). In addition, we found that previous AGB products generally underestimate the forest AGB compared with our estimated AGB at the pixel-level and ground-truth AGB measurements. The high-resolution forest AGB map provides an important alternative data source for forest carbon cycle studies and can be used as a baseline map for forest management and conservation practices.","{""Feng, Yuhao"",""Guo, Qinghua"",""Liu, Xiaoqiang"",""Ma, Qin"",""Niu, Chunyue"",""Tang, Hao"",""Wang, Xuejing"",""Yang, Qiuli""}",yang_mappingresolutionforestaboveground_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Urban Forest Structure Effects On Property Value,"Studies have quantified urban forests using well established field sampling methods. Other studies have used hedonic regression with real estate prices and remotely sensed vegetation cover data in valuation models. However, remote sensing introduces unfamiliar perspectives since it changes the scale and resolution perceived by humans. Real estate prices also fluctuate and are not regularly used in urban decision-making processes. This study values an urban forest cultural ecosystem service by integrating an explanatory hedonic regression model with randomly field-measured tree, shrub, and turf data horn Foul cities across Florida, USA, during 2006-2009, and congruent parcel tract-level home attributes and appraised property values from single and multi-family units for 2008-2009. Results, on average, indicate trade-offs in that more trees with greater Leaf Area Indices (LAIs) add to property value, while biomass and tree-shrub cover have a neutral effect, and replacing tree with grass cover has lower value. On average, property value increased by \$1586 per tree and \$9348 per one-unit increase in LAI, while increasing maintained grass from 25\% to 75\% decreased home value by \$271. Our ecological approach is an alternative, applied method that can be used by decision-makers for policy and cost-benefit analyses that calculate the stream of net benefits associated with urban forests.

"Assessing Multi-Criteria Approaches With Environmental, Economic And Social Attributes, Weights And Procedures: A Case Study In The Pampas, Argentina","Soil erosion control is a major issue in agriculture. The no till system of soybean production has been widely adopted; however, soil erosion may increase due to pasture and forestry land convert ion to crop-land in the marginal Pampas, Argentina. The aim of this paper is to assess the conflicts and trade-off among environmental, economic and social interests by using three continuous multi-criteria approaches and a set of different weights. Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423 km(2)) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5th and 6th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak run-off, annual erosion. sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming. compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2:1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation-consensus process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","{""Anton, J. M."",""Cantero, A."",""Cisneros, J.

Quantifying The Vegetation Health Based On The Resilience In An Arid System,"Proper management of natural ecosystems is not possible without the knowledge of the health status of its components. Vegetation, as the main component of the ecosystem, plays an important role in its health. One of the key determinants of vegetation health is its resilience in the face of environmental disorders. This research was conducted in parts of the Namakzar-e Khaf watershed in Northeast of South Khorasan Province with the aim of quantifying the vegetative resilience on behalf of the ecosystem health in response to long-term precipitation changes. First, the annual precipitation standardization was performed during a thirty-year period by the SPI method. Then, the average variation in TNDVI index obtained from the Landsat satellite images was examined and the resilience was tested by calculating the four effective factors (amplitude, malleability, damping and hysteresis). According to the results, the amplitude in the survey period was 6.04% and the vegetation has had different values of damping over the years. The most prominent example of vegetation resilience occurred between 1986 and 1996, with malleability of 0.7 and damping of zero. Vegetation in this period, after the elimination of drought effects (1986), has not only returned to the amount of vegetation of reference year with severe precipitation (1996) but also increased by 0.25%. This increase, as the index of hysteresis, has been presented for the first time in the ecosystem health discussion quantitatively in the present study. A set of quantitative calculations showed that despite reduced annual precipitation and drought events, the vegetation has been able to maintain its resilience, which indicates the health of vegetation in the studied ecosystem.

Coastal Mountain Landscape And Urban Plant Planning Based On Remote Sensing Imaging,"Due to the gradual decline of plant diversity, the distribution structure and spatial pattern of plant diversity have undergone significant changes in recent years. As a substantial reference standard for assessing whether the ecological functions of urban gardens can be performed commonly, the quality of the urban ecological environment, and the goodness of the urban human settlement environment, plant diversity is essential. If plant diversity presents a rich situation, it can play a critical role in improving the ecological environmentâ€™s quality and providing a solid material foundation for human development. Suppose you want to achieve sustainable growth in urban development. In that case, it is of positive significance to carry out protection and development projects for plant diversity within the cityâ€™s jurisdiction. To implement long-term green development goals, it is necessary to formulate a planning outline that meets actual needs. The stability of the upper-level planning and the richness of the landscape can also be fully guaranteed. The methods used in this study mainly include (1) unary linear regression and Mann-Kendall trend test; (2) interannual change extraction and data normalization; and (3) correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. The changing trend of ecological vegetation within a predetermined range and its significant development stage are obtained through unary linear regression and trend testing. Interannual change extraction and data normalization are used to get the interannual change characteristics of vegetation and climate factors and make them comparable. Use correlation analysis and multiple linear regression methods to analyze the driving analysis of natural and human ecological vegetation changes. Therefore, changes in climatic conditions and human activities can directly affect vegetation growth trendsâ€™ critical factors.

Use Of A Neuro-Variational Inversion For Retrieving Oceanic And Atmospheric Constituents From Satellite Ocean Colour Sensor: Application To Absorbing Aerosols,"This paper presents a new development of the NeuroVaria method. NeuroVaria computes relevant atmospheric and oceanic parameters by minimizing the difference between the observed satellite reflectances and those computed from radiative transfer simulations modelled by artificial neural networks. Aerosol optical properties are computed using the Junge size distribution allowing taking into account highly absorbing aerosols. The major improvement to the method has been to implement an iterative cost function formulation that makes the minimization more efficient. This implementation of NeuroVaria has been applied to sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery. A comparison with in situ measurements and the standard SeaWiFS results for cases without absorbing aerosols shows that this version of NeuroVaria remains consistent with the former. Finally, the processing of SeaWiFS images of a plume of absorbing aerosols off the US East coast demonstrate the ability of this improved version of NeuroVaria to deal with absorbing aerosols.

Gis-Based Assessment Of The Technical And Economic Feasibility Of Utility-Scale Solar Pv Plants: Case Study In West Kalimantan Province,"This paper presents a technical and economic feasibility assessment of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) plants in the West Kalimantan Province of Borneo, which is essential for boosting the development of solar PV plants in Indonesia. The assessment was performed based on a previously developed geographical information systems (GIS) package that integrates satellite-derived data of solar irradiation with locally obtained data such as land usage, topography, road lines, and an electrical network. For the evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility, annual energy production and electrical cost were calculated using an analysis tool that was integrated into a GIS package. The results show that more than 93\% of the exploitable land that covers the area of 49,859 km(2)is available for the development of solar PV plants, with an annual energy production higher than 180 GWh/km(2)and an electricity cost lower than 0.05 USD/kWh, indicating the attractiveness of utility-scale solar PV plant development in West Kalimantan Province. A further detailed assessment of optimal sites shows that the selected sites are technically and economically feasible for the development of utility-scale solar PV plants. The approaches and results of this research should be valuable for energy planners, developers, and policy makers to set the strategies for promoting the development of utility-scale solar PV plants in pro of the sustainable development of Indonesia.","{""Budiarto, Irwan"",""Ibrahim-Bathis, Kunhali"",""Murti, Sakti A."",""Ruiz, Harold S."",""Sunarso, Alfeus""}",sunarso_gisbasedassessmenttechnical_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Seasonal Variation In Space Use By Nonbreeding Bald Eagles Within The Upper Chesapeake Bay,"Access to food resources is essential to self-maintenance and reproduction and, for species of conservation concern, foraging areas are considered critical habitat. Human disturbance is an important factor restricting access to prey resources for Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and guidelines in the Chesapeake Bay have been developed to mitigate its impact. However, our ability to implement such guidelines has been limited by a lack of information on important foraging areas. We used Brownian bridge movement modeling to develop a population-wide utilization probability surface for Bald Eagles along shorelines within the upper Chesapeake Bay. We used locations (n=320 304) for individuals (n=63) tracked with GPS satellite transmitters between 2007 and 2011 in the analysis. We examined seasonal variation by developing utilization surfaces for summer and winter. Although shoreline use was widespread, segments receiving high levels of activity were relatively rare. Shoreline classified as having the highest category of use and accounting for 10\% of the total utilization made up 0.41\% and 0.55\% of the total shoreline for winter and summer, respectively. From a management perspective, there is a clear pattern of diminishing returns in conservation value for including sequentially lower-use shorelines in land-use management plans. Shoreline use shifted dramatically in both location and extent between seasons. During the summer months, use was highly concentrated on shorelines along the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay or along major (>1 km wide) tributaries. During the winter months, use shifted away from the main stem of the bay and was more focused on minor (<100 m wide) tributaries and inland ponds. Seasonal shifts in shoreline use suggest the need for season-based management objectives.","{""Mojica, Elizabeth K."",""Paxton, Barton J."",""Watts, Bryan D.""}",watts_seasonalvariationspacenonbreeding_2015,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Ecosystem Services Assessment Using A Valuation Framework For The Bangladesh Sundarbans: Livelihood Contribution And Degradation Analysis,"The ecosystem services provided by the Bangladesh Sundarbans contribute in various sectors especially to the livelihood of the surrounding peoples, but they are often overlooked in the valuation process. This study investigates the significance of ecosystem services on peoples' lives and how these services are affected by climate change and other factors. Here an economic valuation framework was used to list the ecosystem services provided by this mangrove forest. Direct uses included timber, golpata (Nypa fruticans), honey, beeswax, fish, shrimp larvae and tourism. Indirect uses included carbon storage, protection from cyclones and tidal surges, breeding and nursery grounds for the aquatic species, and biodiversity conservation. This work also found that the ecosystem services were diminished by fresh water flow reduction, overharvesting, sea level rise, salinity increase, poaching, and climate change. In the present context and future scenario, sea level rise will be an important contributor to changes in ecosystem services.

Evaluating Forest Protection Strategies: A Comparison Of Land-Use Systems To Preventing Forest Loss In Tanzania,"Understanding the effects of forest management strategies is especially important to avoid unregulated natural resource extraction that leads to ecosystem degradation. In addition to the loss of crucial forest services, inefficiencies at converting these natural resources into economic gain for people ultimately exacerbates poverty. Therefore, it is important to know which conservation strategies have proven to be effective in preventing ecosystem degradation and thus be encouraged in future management plans. Here, we used a high-resolution remotely sensed dataset spanning 15 years to study forest cover dynamics across various protected areas in Tanzania. Our findings highlight particular management approaches more effective in preventing forest cover loss and promote forest cover gain, and provide valuable information for conservation efforts. Results show that National Parks have the least forest cover loss, whereas multiple-use Game Controlled Areas have the highest rates of forest loss. In fact, results suggest that these multiple use areas tend to lose more forest cover than areas with no protection or management status at all. These findings suggest the need for more effective strategies for enforcing the existing policies to ensure that socio-economic benefits to local communities are maximized and national interests are sustained.","{""Hopcraft, J.

Economics And Financing Of Communications Satellites,"The economics and financing of satellite communications is a very large and complex topic. It ranges from normal business planning, analysis, and investment financing, to issues of government policy, dual-use technologies, and national security and defense. Commercial satellite systems represent a special case of economic analysis since such systems are heavily dependent on a government market that is focused on political considerations of budgeting and regulation. Today, satellite telecommunications systems are critical to almost all nations of the world, and they are especially important in the approximately 60 nations that have domestic launch and/or satellite operations capabilities. This chapter will specifically focus on four topics: (1) a summary of the economic characteristics of the industry and a review of major trends in the industry, (2) a summary of the elements of a business plan for satellite telecommunications, (3) an analysis of issues in the manufacturing productivity for satellites and an analysis of commercial satellite manufacturing compared to government satellites, and (4) a brief discussion of future cost considerations including the increasing risk of space sustainability, insurance, and rules concerning disposal of satellites after their useful lifetime.

Lulc Analysis Of Urban Spaces Using Markov Chain Predictive Model At Ranchi In India,"Monitoring of land use and land cover (LULC) change is one important drivers of global change, which plays a decisive role on the management and sustainable developmental planning for urban spaces. The study aims to develop series of LULC maps of urban areas of Ranchi, India and was studied during the years 1989 and 2015. It predicts LULC changes using geospatial tools such as remote sensing and GIS. Various satellite imagery datasets such as Landsat TM, ETM? and Landsat 8 OLI of years 1989, 2002 and 2015 were used to analyze urban LULC, which was later used to predict for 2015 and 2028 using Markov transition matrix and was cross-validated with true LULC of 2015. The urban area growth was found 11\% more than the predicted value. Slope map was also generated from digital elevation model and urban expansion in 2015 was 67\% and with respect to roads it was 60\% within 1 km road buffer in 2015 over 2002. Regression equation was developed over decadal population of 1961-2011 to estimate it for years 1989, 2002, 2015 and 2028. The population has increased 102\% in 2015 over 1989. However, Markov predicted 43\% more urban expansion for year 2028 over 2015. Coarse resolution temporal satellite data can be effectively harnessed to assess LULC change whereas prediction can be done with accuracy as high as 89.02\% based on Markov transition matrix. An effective coordination between governments agencies are solicited to achieve sustainable development to be implemented systematically.","{""Ahmad, Firoz"",""Goparaju, Laxmi"",""Qayum, Abdul""}",ahmad_lulcanalysisurbanspaces_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
An Identification Study On Field-Derived Spectra Of Grassland Combustibles And Soil Based On Fractal Theory,"Grassland fire disaster is an important influence factor to grassland ecological system in China. Therefore, it is crucial to study on the monitoring, prediction and management of grassland fire. Remote Sensing (RS) provides detailed data and saves a lot of manpower, material resources and financial resources on the research of grassland fire. However, it is difficult to identify the grassland fuel and soil with Remote Sensing. In this paper, we introduced fractal into the spectral analyses of the field-derived spectra (FDS) of grassland fuel and soil to solve the problem above. The study area laid on the Westward of Changling, Jinlin province, China. Study subjects included soil and dominant species: Leymus chinensis, Reed, Chloris virgate, Kalimeris integri folia and Artemisia mongolica. FDS of study subjects were measured with ASD FS3 and continuums of FDS were calculated by Matlab 2010. Meanwhile, Box-counting values of FDS and continuums were calculated by Matlab 2010. According to the spectral and continuum analysis, it is difficult to identify soil, Leymus chinensis, Reed, Chloris virgate, and Artemisia mongolica because of the similar spectral curves. However, the Artemisia mongolica can be identified for the strong reflection. For typical fractal characteristics of FDS and continuum, clustering analyses of study subjects were done according to box-counting values of FDS and continuum. The results of clustering analyses show that Box-counting values of FDS and continuum are important indexes to identify the study subjects. This study provides a new thought to identity the grassland combustibles and soil with Remote Sensing.","{""Luo Xiao-long"",""Tong Zhi-jun"",""Zhang Ji-quan"",""Zhao Yun-sheng""}",luoxiaolongandtongzhijunandzhaoyunshengandzhangjiquan_identificationstudyfieldderived_2016,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
An Improved Actor-Critic Algorithm In Continuous Spaces With Action Weighting,"Classic reinforcement learning algorithms mainly aim at the discrete state and action spaces. For the complex environment or the more applicable continuous spaces, the methods for the discrete spaces cannot satisfy the requirement. One feasible method is to discretize the state and action spaces, then the methods applied in discrete spaces can solve these problems with continuous state and action spaces. However, the reasonable discretization for the state and action spaces is not an easy problem. The methods applicable in continuous spaces do not have to discretize the state or action spaces, but most of them did not consider the constraint of the action range, additionally, the fluctuations of the optimal action were heavily. To be more applicable in continuous action spaces, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for continuous action space based on weighting of the actions by considering the constraint of the action range and decreasing the fluctuation, called AW-PS-AC. AW-PS-AC is designed in the framework of the actor-critic which is a classic method for the continuous space. The action exploration policy takes the Gaussian distribute by using the optimal action as the mean value, so that the selective action is the action with a small exploration factor. The optimal state value function and the optimal policy are approximated by linear function approximation, where the gradient descent method is utilized to update one set of the value function parameter and two sets of the policy parameters. The two sets of the policy parameters are weighted to obtain the optimal policy to constraint the optimal action, so that the optimal action will not surpass the action range and the optimal policy will not fluctuate significantly. The weighting for the actions can satisfy the constraint of the action range. Moreover, the samples can be utilized more comprehensively, resulting in a better performance under only a small amount of the data. To speed the convergence rate, an improved temporal difference algorithm is designed, where the temporal difference error (TD-error) of the value function are employed to update the optimal policy and the policy eligibility trace is introduced to improve the convergence rate for the algorithm. To prove the convergence of this proposed method, under the three given assumptions, AW-PS-AC is analyzed theoretically and its convergence is proved. On two classic benchmarks of the classic reinforcement learning benchmarks which have the nonlinear system dynamics, pole-balancing problem and puddle world problem, AW-PS-AC is compared with the representative methods which are representative in continuous spaces, namely, continuous actor-critic learning automaton (CALAC), continuous-action on Q-learning (CAQ) and incremental natural actor-critic with scaling gradient (INAC-S), and they are implemented on them. The results show that the AW-PS-AC algorithm performs well in the two experiments. The good performances in the two experiments demonstrate that the AW-PS-AC algorithm can solve the approximated-optimal problems effectively in continuous space. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, AW-PS-AC outperforms them not only in convergence but also in stability. From the experiments, it is clearly that AW-PS-AC algorithm can converge only after only a few episodes, moreover, it can be stable all the time after it is converged. Â© 2017, Science Press.

Planning Of Multi-Station Accessing Multi-Satellite Based On Physical Planning,"With the increase of on-orbit satellites, there is an urgent need for effective supervision of many satellites. It is necessary to study how to reasonably allocate and schedule limited ground resources to satellite access. An assignment and planning method for multi-station accessing multi-satellite is proposed based on physical planning. The accessing window assignments of the ground facilities to the satellites are used as the design variables, the adjacent window's minimum interval of the same ground facility and the maximum accessing number of a ground facility are considered as the constraints, and the end time of the task, the access benefit based on success rate and the access cost are designed as the objective functions, and then an accessing and planning model of multi-station incompletely accessing multi-satellite with the consideration of the cost and the benefit is established. A single objective function is reasonably mapped from the multiple objective functions by physical programming, and the differential evolution algorithm is used for optimization. The proposed method is applied to solving a small-scale problem with three stations and four satellites and a large-scale problem with 20 stations and 96 satellites. The case's results show that the proposed method can obtain the solution of trade-off of multi-objective preference in line with the constraints. Compared with the weighting method and the constraint method, the solution is more stable and efficient, and each index can be optimized. Â© 2023 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

"Non-Timber Forest Products And Environmental Valuation Of The National Forest Pacotuba, Es","This study aimed to evaluate the potential for the extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and environmental valuation by the willingness to receive from the residents of the damping zone of the National Forest (FLONA) of Pacotuba, state of EspÃ­rito Santo. Forms were applied in a sample of 78 families, in the community of Monte Alegre, located in the damping zone of the FLONA de Pacotuba, for the NTFPs ethnobotanical survey and the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. The mapping use of the soil Pacotuba FLONA and the damping zone were obtained through a Landsat image. The contingent valuation method was used using the forms to estimate the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. At FLONA de Pacotuba there is potential to produce NTFPs, with an offer mainly for medicinal and ecological purposes. The use of the soil demonstrates that the FLONA of Pacotuba presents a high percentage of forest cover, however the damping zone is with a high percentage of pasture and use of the soil Anthropic, with the payment for environmental services (PES) an alternative to increase the forest cover in the cushioning zone. The willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover of the owners in the damping zone and in the FLONA was greater than the PES of the state of EspÃ­rito Santo, which hinders the adoption of a payment program for environmental services. The PES of EspÃ­rito Santo, through the program Reflorestar, associated with the management of NTFPs, mainly medicinal and ecological, would be alternatives for income generation and preservation of the forest cover.

Rapid Assessment Of Plant Diversity Using Modis Biophysical Proxies,"The spectral information derived from satellite data provides important inputs for assessing plant diversity. If a suitable satellite-derived biophysical proxy is applicable to assess and monitor plant diversity of different biogeographic regions will be of interest to policy makers and conservationists. We selected four biogeographic regions of India, i.e., semi-arid, Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, and Northeast as the test sites on the basis of variations in moisture availability. The flora data collected for the study sites are the extract of the national biodiversity project 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level'. The available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived biophysical proxies at high temporal frequencies was considered to compare the biophysical proxies: surface reflectance-red and near-infrared, normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, enhanced vegetation index-EVI, leaf area index-LAI, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation-FAPAR at different temporal scales (monthly, post-monsoon, seasonal, annual) in each selected biogeographic regions of India. Generalized linear model (GLM) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) were utilized to evaluate the relationship between plant diversity and MODIS-derived biophysical proxies. MARS summarized the suitable biophysical proxies at monthly scale in descending order for the total forest area in semi-arid was red, NDVI, and FAPAR; for Eastern Ghats was EVI, FAPAR, and LAI; for Western Ghats was EVI, LAI, and FAPAR; and for Northeast was NDVI, near-infrared, and red. Furthermore, monthly FAPAR commonly found to be the suitable proxy to large scale monitoring of plant diversity in the moisture varied biogeographic regions of India, except Northeast. Using artificial neural network, the relationship of plant diversity and monthly FAPAR/NDVI were modeled. The correlation between the predicted and reference plant diversity was found to be r = 0.56 for semi-arid, r = 0.52 for Eastern Ghats, r = 0.52 for Western Ghats and r = 0.61 for Northeast at p-value < 0.001. The study affirms that FAPAR is potentially an essential biodiversity variable (EBV) for carrying out rapid/indicative assessment of plant diversity in different biogeographic regions, and thereby, meeting various international commitments dealing with conservation and management measures for biodiversity.","{""Behera, Mukunda Dev"",""Mahanand, Swapna"",""Roy, Partha Sarathi""}",mahanand_rapidassessmentplantdiversity_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Characterization Of Water Use And Water Balance For The Croplands Of Kansas Using Satellite, Climate, And Irrigation Data","Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states in the United States, where agricultural irrigation is a primary user of underground and surface water. Because of low precipitation and declining groundwater levels in western and central Kansas, sustainable management of irrigation water resources is a critical issue in the agricultural productivity of the state. The objective of this study is to analyze and characterize the water use and water balance in the croplands of Kansas using satellite observations, meteorological data, and in situ irrigation water use records. We used actual evapotranspiration (ETa), precipitation, soil moisture, and irrigation water use to calculate water balance for Kansas in 2015 at scales of counties, climatic divisions, and groundwater management districts (GMD). The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance model was implemented to estimate 30-m resolution ETa. Results showed that the seasonal (May - September) precipitation, soil water storage change, and ETa are 528 mm, 80 mm, and 555 mm, respectively, on average of all croplands in the state. The annual net irrigation water consumption was 293 mm for irrigated croplands, indicating that irrigation water constitutes an substantial portion of the water supply in the state. The total volumetric irrigation water use was 3.24 km3 for all croplands within five GMDs in western and south-central Kansas, while only 0.38 km3 was outside of GMDs. The multiple regression models of ETa against precipitation and irrigation water use were statistically significant with R2 values of 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, at county and climate division scales. Regression models also indicated a higher rate of ETa response to irrigation water use than that to precipitation. Our study demonstrated the spatial patterns of crop water use and water balance in Kansas, which could provide useful information for management of irrigation agriculture and water resources for the state.","{""Boiko, Olena"",""Friedrichs, MacKenzie"",""Ji, Lei"",""Schauer, Matthew"",""Senay, Gabriel B.""}",ji_characterizationwaterwaterbalance_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Object-Based Mapping Of Aboveground Biomass In Tropical Forests Using Lidar And Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Data,"Developing countries that intend to implement the United Nations REDD-plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, and the role of forest conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) framework and obtain economic incentives are required to estimate changes in forest carbon stocks based on the IPCC guidelines. In this study, we developed a method to support REDD-plus implementation by estimating tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) by combining airborne LiDAR with very-high-spatial-resolution satellite data. We acquired QuickBird satellite images of Kampong Thom, Cambodia in 2011 and airborne LiDAR measurements in some parts of the same area. After haze reduction and atmospheric correction of the satellite data, we calibrated reflectance values from the mean reflectance of the objects (obtained by segmentation from areas of overlap between dates) to reduce the effects of the observation angle and solar elevation. Then, we performed object-based classification using the satellite data (overall accuracy = 77.0\%, versus 92.9\% for distinguishing forest from non-forest land). We used a two-step method to estimate AGB and map it in a tropical environment in Cambodia. First, we created a multiple-regression model to estimate AGB from the LiDAR data and plotted field-surveyed AGB values against AGB values predicted by the LiDAR-based model (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 38.7 Mg/ha), and calculated reflectance values in each band of the satellite data for the analyzed objects. Then, we created a multiple-regression model using AGB predicted by the LiDAR-based model as the dependent variable and the mean and standard deviation of the reflectance values in each band of the satellite data as the explanatory variables (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 42.8 Mg/ha). We calculated AGB of all objects, divided the results into density classes, and mapped the resulting AGB distribution. Our results suggest that this approach can provide the forest carbon stock per unit area values required to support REDD-plus.","{""Furuya, Naoyuki"",""Hirata, Yasumasa"",""Kajisa, Tsuyoshi"",""Leng, Chivin"",""Ma, Vuthy"",""Mizoue, Nobuya"",""Ota, Tetsuji"",""Pak, Chealy"",""Saito, Hideki"",""Sokh, Heng""}",hirata_objectbasedmappingaboveground_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Estimation Of Surface Moisture Content Using Sentinel-1 C-Band Sar Data Through Machine Learning Models,"Monitoring the spatio-temporal variation in soil moisture content (SMC) of the surface soil layer is essential for agriculture and water resource management activities, especially in regions where the socio-economic condition and livelihood depend upon agriculture and allied sectors. In the present study, we have compared different machine learning (ML) and linear regression models to estimate the SMC integrating field observed soil moisture and Sentinel-1 SAR data. Total 56 soil samples were collected from the surface soil layer (similar to 5 cm) in correspondence with the passing date of the Sentinel-1 sensor over the study area. The surface SMC was estimated for bare soil areas, which was extracted by applying the threshold values on vegetation and water index maps derived from the Sentinel-2 multispectral data. The univariate linear regression with the co-polarized VV band provided higher accuracy compared to the cross-polarized VH band. However, the multiple linear regression with VV and VH bands indicated similar accuracy as obtained by the VV band alone. The random forest model was observed as the best performing ML model for soil moisture estimation (R-2 = 0.87 and 0.93 during modeling and validation, respectively; RMSE: similar to 0.03). The obtained results indicate well accurate surface soil moisture verified with in-situ information collected during the dry rabi crop season (January to March 2019). The maximum SMC was observed for March, followed by February and January, that corroborated with the total monthly precipitation and irrigation activities. The study highlights the potentiality of ML models and Sentinel-1 SAR data for soil moisture estimation, which is useful for policy-level implications and decision making in agriculture and water resource management activities.","{""Das, Pulakesh"",""Datta, Subhadip"",""Dutta, Dipanwita"",""Giri, Rakesh Kr.""}",datta_estimationsurfacemoisturecontent_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Airborne Laser Scanning For Quantifying Criteria And Indicators Of Sustainable Forest Management In Canada,"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has emerged as a technology capable of generating descriptors of vegetation structure and best available terrain information. Research and operational implementations of ALS data have highlighted their value for characterizing forest structure and generating spatially explicit and objective spatial coverages and mapping products for forest management. Continued emphasis to enhance forest stewardship is promoting novel methods to integrate ALS to detail non-timber ecosystem values like habitat, soil, and water. Standardized criteria and indicator frameworks such as the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers provide a reliable starting point for where ALS has opportunities to characterize ecosystems objectively regardless of location. In this review of primarily Canadian work, we highlight how ALS is becoming an increasingly viable technology for deriving meaningful indicators to meet sustainable forest management criteria. We review and highlight the value of ALS for quantifying indicators of biological diversity, ecosystem condition and productivity, soil and water, and the role of forests in global ecological cycles. We conclude by highlighting the need for increased education, tech transfer, flexible software, and reporting frameworks alongside five key considerations for using ALS to derive meaningful indicators of sustainable forest management.","{""Coops, Nicholas C."",""Fournier, Richard"",""Frizzle, Catherine"",""Furze, Shane"",""Goodbody, Tristan R.

What Rainfall Does Not Tell Us-Enhancing Financial Instruments With Satellite-Derived Soil Moisture And Evaporative Stress,"Advanced parametric financial instruments, like weather index insurance (WII) and risk contingency credit (RCC), support disaster-risk management and reduction in the world's most disaster-prone regions. Simultaneously, satellite data that are capable of cross-checking rainfall estimates, the standard dataset to develop such financial safety nets, are gaining importance as complementary sources of information. This study concentrates on the analysis of satellite-derived multi-sensor soil moisture (ESA CCI, Version v04.2), the evapotranspiration-based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), and CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) rainfall estimates in nine East African countries. Based on spatial correlation analysis, we found matching spatial/temporal patterns between all three datasets, with the highest correlation coefficient occurring between October and March. In large parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, we observed a lower (partly negative) correlation coefficient between June and August, which was likely caused by issues related to cloud cover and the volume scattering of microwaves in sandy, hot soils. Based on simple linear and logit regression analysis with annual, national maize yield estimates as the dependent variable, we found that, depending on the chosen period (averages per year, growing or harvesting months), there was added value (higher R-squared) if two or all three variables were combined. The ESI and soil moisture have the potential to close sensitive knowledge gaps between atmospheric moisture supply and the response of the land surface in operational parametric insurance projects. For the development and calibration of WII and RCC, this means that better proxies for historical and potential future drought impact can strengthen drought narratives, resulting in a better match between calculated payouts/credit repayment levels and the actual needs of smallholder farmers.","{""Anderson, Martha"",""Enenkel, Markus"",""Farah, Carlos"",""Hain, Christopher"",""Osgood, Daniel"",""Wagner, Wolfgang"",""White, Andrew"",""You, Liangzhi""}",enenkel_rainfallenhancingfinancialinstruments_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Ensemble Three-Dimensional Habitat Modeling Of Indian Ocean Immature Albacore Tuna (Thunnus Alalunga) Using Remote Sensing Data,"This study evaluated the vertical distribution of immature albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the Indian Ocean as a function of various environmental parameters. Albacore tuna fishing data were gathered from the logbooks of large-sized Taiwanese longline vessels. Fishery and environmental data for the period from 1998 to 2016 were collected. In addition to the surface variable, the most influential vertical temperature, dissolved oxygen (OXY), chlorophyll, and salinity layers were found at various depths (i.e., 5, 26, and 53 m for SST; 200, 244, and 147 m for OXY; 508, 628, and 411 for SSCI; and 411, 508, and 773 m for SSS) among 20 vertical layers based on Akaike criterion information value of generalized linear model. Relative to the 20 vertical layers base models, these layers had the lowest Akaike information criteria. For the correlation between the standardized and predicted catch per unit effort (CPUE), the correlation values for the generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and random forest (RF) model were 0.798, 0.832, 0.841, and 0.856, respectively. The GAM-, BRT-, and RF-derived full models were selected, whereas the GLM-derived full model was excluded because its correlation value was the lowest among the four models. From March to September, a higher immature albacore standardized CPUE was mainly observed from 30Â°S to 40Â°S. A northward shift was observed after September, and the standardized CPUE was mainly concentrated at the south coast of Madagascar from November to January. Â© 2022 by the authors.","{""Lee, M.

Improved Radar Composites And Enhanced Value Of Meteorological Radar Data Using Different Quality Indices,"Radar measurements are inherently affected by various meteorological and non-meteorological factors that may lead to a degradation of their quality, and the unwanted effects are also transferred into composites, i.e., overlapping images from different radars. The paper was aimed at answering the research question whether we could create â€˜cleanerâ€™ radar composites without disturbing features, and if yes, how the operational practice could take advantage of the improved results. To achieve these goals, the qRad and qPrec software packages, based on the concept of quality indices, were used. The qRad package estimates the true quality of the C-band radar volume data using various quality indices and attempts to correct some of the adverse effects on the measure-ments. The qPrec package uses a probabilistic approach to estimate precipitation intensity, based on heterogeneous input data and quality-based outputs of the qRad software. The advantages of the qRad software are improved radar composites, which offer benefits, among others, for aviation meteorology. At the same time, the advantages of the qPrec software are manifested through improved quantitative precipitation estimation, which can be translated into hydrological modeling or climatological precipitation mapping. Beyond this, the developed software indirectly contributes to sustainability and environmental protectionâ€”for instance, by enabling fuel savings due to the more effective planning of flight routes or avoiding runway excursions due to information on the increased risk of aquaplaning.

"Estimation Of Forage Mass In A Mixed Pasture By Machine Learning, Pasture Management And Satellite Meteorological Data","Measuring forage mass (FM) in the pasture, prior to grazing, is critical to determining the daily allocation of forage in pastoral animal production systems. FM is estimated by cutting forage in known areas, using allometric equations, or with the use of remote sensors (RS); however, the accuracy and practicality of the different methods for estimating FM is variable. The objective was to obtain predictive models using environmental and pasture management variables to predict FM. Regression models were fitted to estimate FM based on variables of pasture management (PM) or measurements obtained by RS, such as reflectance, air temperature, and rainfall. A mixed pasture grazed by beef cattle was studied for three years. With 80 % of data, models were built by ordinary least squares (OLS) or by machine learning (ML) algorithms. The remaining 20 % of the data was used to validate the models using the coefficient of determination and average bias between estimated and observed values. The base model of study was the relationship between pasture height before grazing and FM, this model was fitted using OLS; the r2 was 0.43. When models that included PM variables were fitted, the r2 was 0.45 for OLS and 0.63 for ML. When fitting models with PM and RS variables, the r2 was 0.71 for OLS and 0.96 for ML. ML-fitted model ensembles reduced the bias of FM estimates of the examined pasture. Overall, ML models better represented the relationship between pasture height before grazing and FM than OLS models, when fitted with pasture management variables and RS information. ML models can be used as a tool for daily decision-making in pastoral production systems. Â© 2023 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

Assessing Canal Seepage And Soil Salinity Using The Electromagnetic Remote Sensing Technology,"Canal seepage and soil salinity are two major problems in irrigated areas of California's Central Valley, USA. Seepage is very common throughout the vast network of irrigation canals found in California. Most of these canals are earthen structures, where seepage contributes to the loss of millions of litres of water annually. Salinity problems are attributed to saline parent material, clayey soils, intensive irrigation, shallow water tables, and inadequate drainage that prevents the leaching of soluble salts. Several irrigation management practices, including sequential reuse of drainage waters within farm boundaries, are currently being tested in the region. Such practices are expected to reduce drainage volume, conserve irrigation water, and contribute to soil reclamation. Canal seepage and soil salinity can be assessed very accurately using the electromagnetic (EM) remote sensing technique. When coupled with a GPS and data logging capabilities, a mobilized EM system can provide automated and geo-referenced measurements over large areas. The study objectives were to locate seepage along irrigation canals and assess soil salinity in agricultural fields using the EM approach. Calibration of the EM data was performed following soil sampling. Samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity, texture, and moisture. Surface maps describing spatial distribution of these parameters were generated using GIS. The study suggested that the location of seepage could be detected rapidly and cost-effectively with the EM meter. The salinity assessment survey indicated that soil salinity levels ranged from 1 to 39 dS/m, with high spatial variability observed in most areas. Elevated salinity values were associated with poor drainage management. Growers and water agencies can utilize information from this study to develop water management and conservation strategies.","{""Cassel S, F."",""Zoldoske, D.""}",cassels_assessingcanalseepagesoil_2006,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
'Tidy' And 'Messy' Management Alters Natural Enemy Communities And Pest Control In Urban Agroecosystems,"Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people's values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for 'tidiness' are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a 'tidy garden' versus a 'messy garden' influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular 'tidy' management practice-woodchip mulching-on the one hand, and simulating 'messy' gardens by adding 'weedy' plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some 'messiness' in their garden plots as a ""lazy gardener"" approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.","{""Egerer, Monika"",""Philpott, Stacy M.""}",egerer_tidymessymanagementalters_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Development And Evaluation Of Satellite Endoscopy Services In Western Australia,"A satellite endoscopy service was formally established in late January 1997 in one peripheral hospital, a second service commencing in April 1997, and a third in December 1997. More than 500 patients underwent gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures at these satellite services during 1997. The feedback received to date indicates that the establishment of this service is supported by patients and the peripheral hospitals. It is expected that this project will achieve all its stated objectives. In addition, the implementation of this service will assist in improved waiting list management at Royal Perth Hospital. The satellite endoscopy service is a unique development in Western Australia and has demonstrated definite benefits to patients in less than six months of operation.","{""Bramston, B.

Accuracy Of Estimated Crop Evapotranspiration Using Locally Developed Crop Coefficients Against Satellite-Derived Crop Evapotranspiration In A Semiarid Climate,"Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is measured or estimated using different methods, and its accuracy is critical for water management under precision agriculture. The objective of this study was to compare maize ETa estimated by the two-step approach using a locally developed crop coefficient curve with satellite-retrieved evapotranspiration by six models incorporated in the OpenET to identify the best evapotranspiration estimation alternatives to the two-step approach for water management in northern New Mexico. Maize (Zea mays L.) was planted at the NMSU Agricultural Science Center at Farmington from 2017 to 2022 and uniformly managed across years. Water management in plants was based on maize's actual evapotranspiration estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration and the local crop coefficient, which is described as a third-order polynomial function of the accumulated heat units by maize plants. For the same growing seasons, maize ETa was retrieved from satellite, and was estimated by six models listed within the OpenET from 2017 to 2022. The results show that maize daily ETa was consistently smaller when measured by SIMS and PT-JPL during maize initial and actively growing stages, while ETc(kc), SIMS and eeMETRIC showed similar maize daily ETa during maize full canopy development and mid-season, and which overcome the evapotranspiration estimated by DisALEXI, PT-JPL, geeSEBAL, and SSBop. ETc(kc) drastically dropped and became the lowest value among all ETa estimation models after the first fall snow or the first killing frost. Regarding the seasonal average, all six models included in OpenET showed smaller maize evapotranspiration. Maize seasonal evapotranspiration varied from 589.7 to 683.2 mm. eeMETRIC compares most similarly to the ETc(kc) model, followed by SIMS, with percent errors of 2.58 and 7.74\% on a daily basis and 2.43 and 7.88\% on a seasonal basis, with the lowest MBE and RMSE values, respectively, and could be used as an alternative for maize actual daily evapotranspiration for water management in northern New Mexico. The results of this study could be used by water managers and crop growers to improve water management in the Four Corners region, using eeMETRIC for crop water use to improve water management and conservation under sustainable agriculture.","{""Djaman, Koffi"",""Koudahe, Komlan"",""Mohammed, Ali T.""}",djaman_accuracyestimatedcropevapotranspiration_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Ecological Structure Of A Tropical Urban Forest In The Bang Kachao Peninsula, Bangkok","Rapid urbanization has changed the structure and function of natural ecosystems, especially floodplain ecosystems in SE Asia. The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area: rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks. We suggest that the application of NDVI for assessments can be useful for future planning, monitoring and management of the BKP and hence may contribute for increasing biodiversity and complexity of these urban forests.

Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol: A Commercial System-Of-Systems To Incentivize Forest Restoration And Management,"Forest carbon sequestration offsets are methodologically uncertain, comprise a minor component of carbon markets and do not effectively slow deforestation. The objective of this study is to describe a commercial scale in situ measurement approach for determination of net forest carbon sequestration projects, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM, to address forest carbon market uncertainties. In contrast to protocols that rely on limited forest mensuration, growth simulation and exclusion of CO2 data, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM is based on standardized methods for direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy covariance, a meteorological approach integrating forest carbon fluxes. NEE is used here as the basis for quantifying the first of its kind carbon financial products. The DMFCP differentiates physical, project and financial carbon within a System-of-SystemsTM (SoS) network architecture. SoS sensor nodes, the Global Monitoring PlatformTM (GMP), housing analyzers for CO2 isotopologues (e.g., 12CO2,13CO214CO2) and greenhouse gases are deployed across the project landscape. The SoS standardizes and automates GMP measurement, uncertainty and reporting functions creating diverse forest carbon portfolios while reducing cost and investment risk in alignment with modern portfolio theory. To illustrate SoS field deployment and operation, published annual NEE data for a tropical (Ankasa Park, Ghana, Africa) and a deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, USA) are used to forecast carbon revenue. Carbon pricing scenarios are combined with historical in situ NEE annual time-series to extrapolate pre-tax revenue for each project applied to 100,000 acres (40,469 hectares) of surrounding land. Based on carbon pricing of $5 to $36 per ton CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) and observed NEE sequestration rates of 0.48 to 15.60 tCO2eq acreâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1, pre-tax cash flows ranging from $230,000 to $16,380,000 across project time-series are calculated, up to 5Ã— revenue for contemporary voluntary offsets, demonstrating new economic incentives to reverse deforestation. The SoS concept of operation and architecture, with engineering development, can be extended to diverse gas species across terrestrial, aquatic and oceanic ecosystems, harmonizing voluntary and compliance market products worldwide to assist in the management of global warming. The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol reduces risk of invalidation intrinsic to estimation-based protocols such as the Climate Action Reserve and the Clean Development Mechanism that do not observe molecular CO2 to calibrate financial products. Multinational policy applications such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, constrained by Kyoto Protocol era processes, will benefit from NEE measurement avoiding unsupported claims of emission reduction, fraud, and forest conservation policy failure.

Price Tagging On Urban Farming Benefit In The Context Of Ecosystem Services,"Rapid urbanisation, along with urban poverty, leads to social and environmental challenges that require cities to improve their resilience. Urban farming is promoted as an essential strategy for improving citiesâ€™ resilience by providing ecosystem services, namely strengthening the community, improving the urban environment and saving energy. The research aimed to estimate urban farming benefits in the context of ecosystem services in the monetary unit. It took place in Malang City, East Javaâ€“Indonesia, as a case study. The study utilised the Total Economic Value framework in conjunction with the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity concept to develop and estimate indicators of urban farming benefit into valuation through the direct market and stated preferences approaches. The study employed field surveys, in-depth interviews and remote sensing analysis. Here we show for the first time that the Total Economic Value of urban farming benefits reached up to US$ 13.11 in a square metre annually if all urban farming forms occupy a square metre each. However, this value had a gap with the benchmark of US$ 15.89/m2 annually. The gap value could be a policy recommendation to incentivise citizens to participate in emerging urban farming initiatives actively. This benefit value indicates that urban farming is feasible and valuable for further development.

Mapping Oilfield Brine-Contaminated Sites With Mid-Spatial Resolution Remotely Sensed Data,"An environmental problem associated with petroleum production is the disposal of brine, which is produced during petroleum exploration and production. Oilfield brine, if improperly handled, transported, and disposed of, can pose a serious threat to surrounding water resources, arable lands, and plant communities. Although field checking of known oilfield brine-contaminated sites is relatively straightforward, the ability to detect and inventory brine-contaminated sites over remote and expansive areas can be time consuming and expensive. A more efficient and cost-effective method is needed to delineate brine-contaminated sites accurately. The chief aim of this project was to test a remote sensing method to map accurately and quantify contaminated oilfield brine sites in west Texas. Landsat ETM+ data of west Texas were obtained, de-correlated with a three-band dataset using principal component analysis (PCA), and classified into brine and non-brine locations using supervised classification with a maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Results show the Landsat ETM+ data is effective in quantifying previously unknown oilfield brine-contaminated areas larger than 2 acres in west Texas. Overall map accuracy was 91.67%, users accuracy was 87.50% for brine-contaminated sites, and the kappa statistic was 82.35%. Once contaminated brine sites have been mapped via remote sensing, the spatial location and quantity of the sites can make land reclamation and restoration decisions more timely and cost-effectively compared to traditional ground surveys.

Digital Surface Models For Gnss Mission Planning In Critical Environments,"Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) surveys performed in critical environments (e.g., urban canyons, mountainous areas, or areas of dense vegetation) usually suffer from a lack of satellite coverage as a result of obstacles such as buildings and vegetation. GNSS mission-planning software provides an estimate of satellite visibility and dilution-of-precision (DOP) values along a planned trajectory to establish the best time frame over which to perform the survey. However, such an estimate is not reliable in a complex scenario because the surrounding environmental morphology is not considered. This paper introduces a new method to improve the prediction of GNSS satellite visibility. This method involves computing GNSS satellites position by means of the orbital parameters, as well as using three-dimensional digital surface models (DSMs) to develop a more reliable mission plan. The time evolution of key parameters describing the GNSS constellation is computed by means of a visibility georeferenced map for both dynamic and static surveys.","{""Ackermann, S."",""Angrisano, A."",""Del Pizzo, S."",""Gaglione, S."",""Gioia, C."",""Troisi, S.""}",ackermann_digitalsurfacemodelsgnss_2014,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Analyzing The Relationship Between Historic Canopy Dynamics And Current Plant Species Diversity In The Herb Layer Of Temperate Forests Using Long-Term Landsat Time Series,"Current plant species diversity of the forest herb layer is influenced by site conditions, seed banks, stand age and historic canopy dynamics, induced for example by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Long-term Landsat time series allow for analyzing forest canopy dynamics over several decades at a spatial resolution of 30 m. These dynamics have not been related to plant diversity in the herb layer of forests yet. Here, we related canopy layer dynamics of 132 one hectare temperate forest plots derived from Landsat time series (1985â€“2015) to herb layer plant species diversity observed in 2015. To quantitatively characterize the dynamics in the canopy over this period, we applied Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation representation (SAX) to yearly NDVI time series of the plots and calculated the frequency of the representations of similar time series patterns, hereafter called SAX-metrics. We used the SAX-metrics as predictors to estimate with beta regression models the Simpson's diversity index of the herb layer of our forest plots subdivided into six forest types. Models including SAX-metrics, describing abrupt decreases in NDVI, and high, medium, or low NDVI values had pseudo R2 between 0.13 and 0.63. We conclude that disturbances, canopy closure, as well as stand age, as represented in NDVI time series, influence the diversity in the herb layer in five of the six examined forest types. Our study shows that information on historic canopy dynamics, detected from Landsat time series, can contribute to a better understanding of current herb layer diversity in some forest types. This study gives first indications on the potential of temporal metrics of Landsat time series in biodiversity research.

Analysis Of Coastal Zone Data Of Northern Yantai Collected By Remote Sensing From 1990 To 2018,"Using remote sensing images of different time phases from 1990 to 2018, the surface coverage information of northern Yantai (coastline, 2 km from coastline to land) was extracted by means of average high tide line and visual interpretation. The end point change rate (EPR) and linear regression rate were used to study the coastline change rate, the fractal dimension of the coastline in the study area was analyzed, and the change of the type of coastal surface cover was analyzed by the transition matrix. The results show that: (1) Form 1990 to 2018, a significant trend of a continuous increase in the total length of coastline was observed with an increase of 181.08 km (43.18\%). In the study area, the coastline of Laizhou had the greatest change rate with an EPR value of 33.67 m/a, whereas the coastline of Laishan had the smallest change rate with an EPR value of 0.30 m/a. (2) Over the past 30 years, with the rapid economic development of Yantai and the ensuant urbanization, the total surface area of the coastal zone in the study area has increased by 144.94 km(2), mainly in the areas covered by structures and forests/grasses, by 112.96 km(2) and 96.08 km(2), respectively, while the areas of desert/bare land and water have decreased by 92.26 km(2) and 12.32 km(2), respectively. (3) The changes among different types in the study area were clear, mainly from desert/bare land, cultivated land, and building areas to forests/grasses cover and structures. The change areas were mainly concentrated in Laizhou, Longkou, Zhifu, and Penglai. Frequent human activities are an important factor affecting the continuous expansion of the coastal areas of Jiaodong Peninsula to the sea. Aquaculture, coastal construction, construction of artificial islands, and expansion of port terminals have seriously affected the sustainability of ecological resources in the coastal areas. At the same time, the changes in the ecological environment in the coastal zone will have a greater impact on the health of the coastal zone.","{""Hou, Xiaoyun"",""Wu, Mengquan"",""Yang, Yi"",""Zhang, Guangzong"",""Zhao, Lianjie"",""Zhou, Min""}",zhou_analysiscoastalzonedata_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Value-Based Development Connecting Engineering And Business: A Case On Electric Space Propulsion,"The static relation between business and engineering design hinders the pace of innovation. While program managers often evaluate innovation in terms of financial value generated over a number of business scenarios, engineering design teams base their activities on improving product functionality and meeting technical requirements. This results in an insufficient common understanding during gate meetings about the business implications of alternative technological tradeoffs, thus negatively impacting the pace of innovation. This article presents the results from the introduction of a methodology-based on value and functional modeling-into the practice of design teams working with next-generation electric propulsion systems for satellite applications. The introduction of the methodology was evaluated via interviews, workshops, and observations with nine industrial partners. The results indicate business stakeholders and technology-focused design teams' bidirectional interest in the methodology. In particular, the results highlight the benefits of the methodology in creating cross-boundary representations that can be used by stakeholders to share knowledge and find common ground in gate meetings.

Developing An Integrated Urban Ecological Efficiency Framework For Spatial Ecological Planning: A Case On A Tropical Mega Metropolitan Area Of The Global South,"Rapid urbanization has emerged as one of the most critical challenges to ecological sustainability in urban areas. In developing countries, the degradation of the ecosystem is more prominent due to the lack of urban planning. Thus, it has become urgent for researchers to identify the ecological efficiency (EE) changes imposed by urban expansion and promote sustainable land use planning. This study aims to develop a comprehensive urban ecological efficiency (UEE) framework in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India, from 2000 to 2020. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to develop a remote sensing-based UEE index (UEEI) based on five effective ecological parameters (Greenness, Dryness, Heat, Wetness and vegetation health. A single sensitivity parameter was also calculated to determine the role of a single parameter based on which management strategies can be carried out. The findings showed that (i) there were substantial deteriorations of UEE in the last 20 years. In 2000 the areas with good EE were about 65.5\% which declined to 53.72\% in 2010 and 20.87\% in 2020. The areas with good UEE decreased 68\% and 61\% from 2000 to 2020 and 2010 to 2020, respectively; (ii) the areas with good UEE were 52\% in 2000, while 38\% in 2010. Most urban centres (Bhadreshwar, Champdani, Srirampur, Bally, Howrah, Kamarhati, Baranagar, Dum Dum, South Dum Dum, Rajarhat, Bidhannagar) located around the Kolkata megacity are characterized by poor and very poor EE (ranges of 0.60-1.00). Thus, spatiotemporal pattern of UEE could assist to clarify the administrative responsibilities as well as obligations. In addition to this, the UEE framework can help for scientific guidance of urban ecosystem protection and restoration through comprehensive spatial landscape planning.

Title: Ecological Relevance Of Least Cost Path Analysis: An Easy Implementation Method For Landscape Urban Planning,"Landscape connectivity promotes dispersal and other types of movement, including foraging activity; consequently, the inclusion of connectivity concept is a priority in conservation and landscape planning in response to fragmentation. Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners.

"Changes In Coastal City Ecosystem Service Values Based On Land Use A Case Study Of Yingkou, China","The valuation of ecosystem services is intended to facilitate the rational and sustainable utilization of natural resources. However, calculating the values of natural resources is complex, and research is underway in this regard. The change of land use types can reflect the changes in the area of each ecosystem; therefore, in this study, land use changes in Yingkou (located in the south of Liaoning Province and an important port city) over a 10-year period (2004-2014) are assessed using a geographic information systems platform and the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Thematic Mapper remotely sensed images of the area. The Costanza calculation method and classification system are used to estimate changes in the total values of ecosystem services in the Yingkou area from 2004 to 2014 and to investigate the causes of these changes. The ""change tendency"" of particular ecological communities is calculated using the Variable coefficient, the Gini coefficient, and the Theil index. The results reveal the following: (i) The total value of ecosystem services in the Yingkou area decreased drastically (i.e., from \$2567.60 million to \$2127.26 million, representing a 17.2\% decline) between 2004 and 2014. (ii) Aquatic ecosystem services are valued greater than terrestrial services. In Yingkou, a decline in the value of aquatic ecosystem services accounts for 88.6\% of the total decrease in ecosystem service value. (iii) Land reclamation in the Yingkou urban area emerges as the primary factor influencing ecosystem service values for the various ecological communities in the region. The ecosystem service value of each ecological community is different, and the differences between the contributions made by the various communities to the total ecosystem services value are increasing over time. (iv) The decline in ecosystem service values in Yingkou is linked to urban development. Following widespread land reclamation, an increase in land area intended for urban construction is associated with a decrease in water area.","{""Feng, Yu"",""Guo, Xiaorong"",""Li, Ying"",""Peng, Fei""}",li_coastalcityecosystemservice_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Temporal And Spatial Variations Of Eco-Asset Patterns And The Factors Driving Change In The Wanjiang Demonstration Area,"With the rapid development of the society and the economy, people are paying more attention to the value of natural resources and the benefits of the ecological environment. Evaluating the value of eco-assets has become a focus of concern. Quantitative remote sensing measurements, land data and other auxiliary data were used to measure the eco-assets in 46 regions of the Wanjiang Demonstration Area from 1990 to 2013. This paper analyzes temporal and spatial variations of eco-assetsâ€™ distribution, composition, change patterns and the factors driving variations. The results show that the distribution of eco-assets in the regions is very uneven, the central region has higher ecological assets than other regions, and it declined first and then rose during the period 1990-2013. The total amount of eco-assets increased by 3.05%. The change in the amount of ecological assets was not large, but it is important that the amount of assets was basically stable, and increases in the proportion of degraded areas was small. Grassland and water body eco-assets decreased by 11.19% and 0.66%, respectively, and that of cultivated land decreased by 15.54%, but forest land increased by 6.42%. As for the change pattern of ecological as-sets, the per capita assets of Hefei had the largest reduction, and those of Xuancheng the second largest. The spatial and temporal changes of ecological assets in the Wanjiang Demonstration Area include natural factors and human factors. The government's macro-control and economic policies are the main driving factors for the spatial and temporal changes of the ecological assets pattern.

"Changes In Wetland Landscape Patterns On Yinchuan Plain, China","Wetlands, with their many values and important functions, are precious resources. They have, however, undergone great changes during economic development and population growth. Relying on recent advances in remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, this paper probes changes in wetland landscapes on Yinchuan Plain during 1978-2006. A series of remote sensing images was used to identify wetland landscape types. Landscape pattern indices, such as patch number, patch density, landscape shape, and Shannon's diversity, evenness, and contagion indices were calculated with GIS and landscape analysis software. Changes in wetland landscape patterns on Yinchuan Plain were analyzed. The analysis show that the total area of wetlands on Yinchuan Plain decreased from 391,540,239 m2 in 1978 to 267,979,957 m2 in 2006, a significant change over 28 years. The area of rivers and lakes has shrunk, and the area of paddies has increased consistently, with increasing wetland fragmentation and heterogeneity. The number of patches, patch density, and landscape shape index shows that wetland landscape patterns have undergone great changes. The landscape diversity, landscape evenness, and contagion indices indicate that wetland landscapes have become less heterogeneous. We discuss the causes of these changes and the sustainable development of wetland ecosystems.

Application Of Hybrid Model-Based Machine Learning For Groundwater Potential Prediction In The North Central Of Vietnam,"Groundwater resources are required for domestic water supply, agriculture, and industry, and the strategic importance of water resources will only increase in the context of climate change and population growth. For optimal management of this crucial resource, exploration of the potential of groundwater is necessary. To this end, the objective of this study was the development of a new method based on remote sensing, deep neural networks (DNNs), and the optimization algorithms Adam, Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), Artificial Ecosystem-based Optimization (AEO), Pathfinder Algorithm (PFA), African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to predict groundwater potential in the North Central region of Vietnam. 95 springs or wells with 13 conditioning factors were used as input data to the machine learning model to find the statistical relationships between the presence and nonpresence of groundwater and the conditioning factors. Statistical indices, namely root mean square error (RMSE), area under curve (AUC), accuracy, kappa (K) and coefficient of determination (R2), were used to validate the models. The results indicated that all the proposed models were effective in predicting groundwater potential, with AUC values of more than 0.95. Among the proposed models, the DNN-AVOA model was more effective than the other models, with an AUC value of 0.97 and an RMSE of 0.22.

Structural Equation Modeling And Gis Application Into Non-Carcinogenic Health Risk Assessment Of The Phreatic Aquifers Of The South-Western Coastal Basin-Ghana,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) advocates the use of risk assessment together with risk management for the control of water safety in drinking water supplies. Groundwater has become important source of water supply for domestic use in Ghana. In the present study, sixty-five (65) constructed wells in the Dixcove Belt Granitoids (DBG) and Sandstone Mudstone Slate Carbonate (SMSC) geological formations of the Sekondi-TakoradiÂ metropolis were investigated for their non-carcinogenic health risk state for children (0â€“6Â years) and adults. The hazard index (HI) method was used as a measure of public health risk.Â The results indicated the HI values ranged from 4.58 Ã— 10âˆ’2 to 111 Ã— 10âˆ’2 and 18.5 Ã— 10âˆ’2 to 226 Ã— 10âˆ’2 for the adult category in the SMSC and DBG respectively. For the children category the HI values were 32.9 Ã— 10âˆ’2 to 217 Ã— 10âˆ’2 and 39.7 Ã— 10âˆ’2 to 403 Ã— 10âˆ’2 respectively. On individual well basis, 2.1% and 12.5% of wells have HI > 1 for adults in the SMSC and DBG respectively. In the children category the values were 29.2% and 50% respectively. Using the mean HI values, HI < 1 in both geological formations indicating no potential health risk to adults. However the mean HI > 1 for children (1.01 and 1.18 SMSC and DBG respectively) indicating a potential health risk. At the 95th percentile level, children were 66.79% and 64.28% more at risk than adults in the SMSC and DBG, respectively. Structural Equation Model and Point Pattern Analysis indicated, fluoride content accounted for the greater proportion of the human health risk for both adults and children.

Monitoring Water Quality With Remote Sensing Image Data,"Water covers approximately 74% of the Earthâ€™s surface, and it plays many important roles in the lives of all human being. Inland and coastal waters in particular have a direct interface with human society by providing value for food supplies, industrial uses, transportation, commerce, and human health (UNEP 2006). However, many water bodies have encountered severe environmental problems (e.g., eutrophication) in recent decades as a result of human interventions and climate change (Ayres et al. 1996; Haddeland et al. 2014). It is thus crucial to monitor and understand the amount and quality of these water bodies as well as their biogeochemical processes in order to achieve the effective management and sustainable use of the water resources (United Nations Open Working Group 2014).

"Evaluating The Effects Of Human Activity Over The Last Decades On The Soil Organic Carbon Pool Using Satellite Imagery And Gis Techniques In The Nile Delta Area, Egypt","The study aims to clarify the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) and human activity under arid conditions, in the east area of the Nile Delta, Egypt. SOC is one of the critical factors in food production and plays an important role in the climate change because it affects the physio-chemical soil characteristics, plant growth, and contributes to sustainable development on global levels. For the purpose of our investigations, 120 soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected throughout different land uses and soil types of the study area. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship of SOC, soil characteristics, and environmental factors. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat 5 TM in July 1995 and operational land imager (OLI) in July 2018 were used to model SOC pool. The results revealed significant variations of soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) among different soil textures and land-uses. Soil with high clay content revealed an increase in the percentage of soil organic carbon, and had mean SOCP of 6.08 +/- 1.91 Mg C ha(-1), followed by clay loams and loamy soils. The higher values of SOCP were observed in the northern regions of the study area. The phenomenon is associated with the expansion of the human activity of initiating fish ponds that reflected higher values of SOC that were related to the organic additions used as nutrients for fish. Nevertheless, the SOC values decreased in southeast of the study area with the decrease of soil moisture contents and the increase in the heavy texture profiles. As a whole, our findings pointed out that the human factor has had a significant impact on the variation of soil organic carbon values in the Eastern Nile Delta from 1995 to 2018. As land use changes from agricultural activity to fish ponds, the SOCP significantly increased. The agriculture land-use revealed higher SOCP with 60.77 Mg C ha(-1) in clay soils followed by fish ponds with 53.43 Mg C ha(-1). The results also showed a decrease in SOCP values due to an increasing in land surface temperature (LST) thus highlighting that influence of temperature and ambient soil conditions linked to land-use changes have a marked impact on surface SOCP and C sequestration.","{""AbdelRahman, Mohamed A.

"Characterizing Forest Succession With Lidar Data: An Evaluation For The Inland Northwest, Usa","Quantifying forest structure is important for sustainable forest management, as it relates to a wide variety of ecosystem processes and services. Lidar data have proven particularly useful for measuring or estimating a suite of forest structural attributes such as canopy height, basal area, and LAI. However, the potential of this technology to characterize forest succession remains largely untested. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of lidar data for characterizing forest successional stages across a structurally diverse, mixed-species forest in Northern Idaho. We used a variety of lidar-derived metrics in conjunction with an algorithmic modeling procedure (Random Forests) to classify six stages of three-dimensional forest development and achieved an overall accuracy > 95%. The algorithmic model presented herein developed ecologically meaningful classifications based upon lidar metrics quantifying mean vegetation height and canopy cover, among others. This study highlights the utility of lidar data for accurately classifying forest succession in complex, mixed coniferous forests; but further research should be conducted to classify forest successional stages across different forests types. The techniques presented herein can be easily applied to other areas. Furthermore, the final classification map represents a significant advancement for forest succession modeling and wildlife habitat assessment. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc.","{""Evans, J.

Evolution Of Land Use And Landscape Analysis In The Area Around The Rppn Cafundo,"The objective of this study was to map the land use and occupancy classes and to analyze and quantify the structural changes of scenery, between the years 1970 and 2007, surrounding the Conservation Unit (UC) Private reservation of natural patrimony (PRNP) CafundÃ³, through the use of landscape ecology indexes. With the land use and occupation map itwas possible to characterize quantitatively, in terms of area, the present classes in the surroundings of the reservation. On the 37 evaluated years there were a few changes in the land use and occupancy surrounding the unit, with the areas mostly dominated by grazing. Landscape ecology metrics or indexes were obtained through the Patch Analyst extension by landscape and class level, and values were obtained for the 10 classes of land use and occupancy.

Radiation Use Efficiency Of Forage Resources: A Meta-Analysis,"Forage production is increasingly monitored through models based on remote sensing. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) is a key input to these models. However, no study has synthesized the published values of RUE of forage resources. Our objective was to quantitatively synthesize through a meta-analysis the variation of RUE of forage resources and its main controls. We gathered 496 RUE values and assessed their variation according to genotype, resource availability and phenological stage. Mean RUE was 1.93 +/- 1.2 g of dry matter (DM) per megajoule of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) (+/- SD). The RUE was most responsive to genotype and to direct and indirect manipulations of resource availability. Within genotype treatments, mean effect size of C-4 species identity, cultivar identity and C-3 species identity was 61, 58, and 42\%, respectively. Within resource availability treatments, mean effect size was 43\% for N fertilization, 40\% for shading and inter-annual environmental variation and 23\% for irrigation and defoliation frequency. For the phenology treatment, mean effect size of reproductive vs. vegetative stage did not differ from zero. This large variability implies a challenge to select RUE values as input to estimate productivity through plant-growth models, such as those based on remote sensing, but also highlight the margin for increasing RUE through breeding and management practices.","{""Druille, Magdalena"",""Oesterheld, Martin"",""Oyarzabal, Mariano""}",druille_radiationefficiencyforageresources_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Artificial Intelligence Techniques For Enhanced Skin Lesion Detection,"The timely diagnosis of skin lesion diseases is highly difficult for people living in rural or far flung areas due to dearth of qualified dermatologists. However, the dermatologists can diagnose skin lesion diseases by carefully examining the high-quality images at their clinics or from a distance area. Further, the computerized automatic diagnostic system may assist primary health professionals for quick and accurate diagnosis of these skin diseases. Thus, there is a need for medical image processing and analysis of skin lesion images to enhance their visibility properties. An efficient and effective skin lesion detection and identification software tool will provide a better classification system and may enhance the automation of skin lesion diagnosis. In this work, detection of skin lesions from human skin images is conducted by utilizing three image processing segmentation methodologies namely-Edge Detection using Ant Colony Optimization, Color Space-based Thresholding, Genetic Algorithm-based Segmentation and FCM-Based Image Segmentation. In order to quantitatively collate the working of three techniques, the entropy values of skin lesion images are considered. Application of FCM-based Segmentation yields in far better attribute of skin lesion images as compared to Genetic Algorithm-based Segmentation, Edge Detection using Ant Colony Optimization and Color Space-based Thresholding.","{""Mittal, Neetu"",""Modi, Megha"",""Sengupta, Sudhriti""}",sengupta_artificialintelligencetechniquesenhanced_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Spatiotemporal Variations In Soil Loss Across The Biodiversity Hotspots Of Western Ghats Region, India","Quantifying the soil loss in the Western Ghats Region (WGR) is challenging due to limited long-term observation data and accessibility issues, as well as the WGR spanning multiple administrative units. This study aimed to estimate long-term spatiotemporal variations in soil loss rates across the WGR. Using remote sensing inputs, such as LANDSAT-8, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and rainfall records to estimate soil loss rates using the USLE method from 1990 to 2020. Results indicated that the average soil loss for the WGR was 32.3, 46.2, 50.2, and 62.7 Tons ha(-1) yr(-1) for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively, showing a concerning 94\% increase, and an consistently increasing trend. The state-wise increase is highest in Tamil Nadu (121\%), followed by Gujarat (119\%), Maharashtra (96\%), Kerala (90\%), Goa (80\%), and Karnataka (56\%). These high rates of increase in soil loss are unsustainable to support the biodiversity of WGR and can lead to permanent destruction. The study highlights the importance of considering the long-term effects of land use change on soil erosion and the need for sustainable land management practices, and benefits of using open source satellite products for monitoring. The results can be used to sensitise government agencies on the need to protect the natural land cover, which will reduce soil erosion. The need for conservation and preservation of the WGR is of paramount importance, and steps must be taken to ensure that the natural land cover is protected and soil erosion is reduced.","{""Chinnasamy, Pennan"",""Honap, Vaishnavi U.""}",chinnasamy_spatiotemporalvariationssoilloss_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Winter Wheat Yield Forecasting In Ukraine Based On Earth Observation, Meteorological Data And Biophysical Models","Ukraine is one of the most developed agriculture countries and one of the biggest crop producers in the world. Timely and accurate crop yield forecasts for Ukraine at regional level become a key element in providing support to policy makers in food security. In this paper, feasibility and relative efficiency of using moderate resolution satellite data to winter wheat forecasting in Ukraine at oblast level is assessed. Oblast is a sub-national administrative unit that corresponds to the NUTS2 level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) of the European Union. NDVI values were derived from the MODIS sensor at the 250 m spatial resolution. For each oblast NDVI values were averaged for a cropland map (Rainfed croplands class) derived from the ESA GlobCover map, and were used as predictors in the regression models. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the best time for making reliable yield forecasts in terms of root mean square error was identified. For most oblasts, NDVI values taken in April-May provided the minimum RMSE value when comparing to the official statistics, thus enabling forecasts 2-3 months prior to harvest. The NDVI-based approach was compared to the following approaches: empirical model based on meteorological observations (with forecasts in April-May that provide minimum RMSE value) and WOFOST crop growth simulation model implemented in the CGMS system (with forecasts in June that provide minimum RMSE value). All three approaches were run to produce winter wheat yield forecasts for independent datasets for 2010 and 2011, i.e. on data that were not used within model calibration process. The most accurate predictions for 2010 were achieved using the CGMS system with the RMSE value of 0.3 t ha(-1) in June and 0.4 t ha(-1) in April, while performance of three approaches for 2011 was almost the same (0.5-0.6 t ha(-1) in April). Both NDVI-based approach and CGMS system over-estimated winter wheat yield comparing to official statistics in 2010, and underestimated it in 2011. Therefore, we can conclude that performance of empirical NDVI-based regression model was similar to meteorological and CGMS models when producing winter wheat yield forecasts at oblast level in Ukraine 2-3 months prior to harvest, while providing minimum requirements to input datasets.

A Citsci Approach For Rapid Earthquake Intensity Mapping: A Case Study From Istanbul (Turkey),"Nowadays several scientific disciplines utilize Citizen Science (CitSci) as a research approach. Natural hazard research and disaster management also benefit from CitSci since people can provide geodata and the relevant attributes using their mobile devices easily and rapidly during or after an event. An earthquake, depending on its intensity, is among the highly destructive natural hazards. Coordination efforts after a severe earthquake event are vital to minimize its harmful effects and timely in-situ data are crucial for this purpose. The aim of this study is to perform a CitSci pilot study to demonstrate the usability of data obtained by volunteers (citizens) for creating earthquake iso-intensity maps in a short time. The data were collected after a 5.8 Mw Istanbul earthquake which occurred on 26 September 2019. Through the mobile app ""I felt the quake"", citizen observations regarding the earthquake intensity were collected from various locations. The intensity values in the app represent a revised form of the Mercalli intensity scale. The iso-intensity map was generated using a spatial kriging algorithm and compared with the one produced by The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), Turkey, empirically. The results show that collecting the intensity information via trained users is a plausible method for producing such maps.","{""Gokceoglu, Candan"",""Kocaman, Sultan"",""Yalcin, Ilyas""}",yalcin_citsciapproachrapidearthquake_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Changes In Ecosystem Service Values In Zoige Plateau, China","Climate change and human activities in high-altitude, cold pasture areas with fragile environments can cause land use changes that significantly affect ecosystem services and functions. Our study investigated changes in ecosystem services in response to land use changes caused mainly by climate change and human activities on the Zoige Plateau, a region in the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau with large areas of grassland and wetland. The aim was to provide guidance for sustainable management of high, cold pasture areas. We used remote sensing to evaluate land use changes, and then applied a fast method for evaluating ecological service values in 1975, 1990, and 2005. The value of ecosystem services dropped from 61.46 x 10(9) yuan in 1975 to 58.61 x 10(9) yuan in 2005, exhibiting an accelerating rate of decrease, mainly due to the degradation of wetlands and, to a lesser extent, high-cover grassland. Waste treatment and water supply were the two largest service functions, contributing about 42\% of the total service value. The results suggest that future land use planning should emphasize the protection of wetlands, high-cover grassland, and woodland, which have the highest ecosystem service values and showed the greatest degradation during the study period.

Public Space Layout Optimization In Affordable Housing Based On Social Network Analysis,"The efficient use of public space in affordable housing is of great significance to the physical and mental health of low-income and aging residents. Previous studies have evaluated the layout and quality of public space in residential areas based on residents' subjective satisfaction, however, there still lack studies exploring residents' behavior patterns and the use of public spaces based on objective measurement standards. Therefore, this paper selected the public space in the large affordable housing areas in the suburbs as the research object and used social network analysis (SNA) to objectively evaluate the network density, clustering coefficient and small-world value of the public space in affordable housing from the perspective of the physical spatial network of the built public space. Based on the network structure characteristics of existing public spaces, this paper further explores the relationship between the frequency of public space use in and the characteristics of nodes' social networks and their own attributes, and the influence of public space layout structure on the behavioral patterns of affordable housing residents. This paper puts forward proposals for the renovation and optimization of public space according to the behavioral preferences of affordable housing residents, so as to complete the network of public space, promote the interaction and communication of residents in the residential area, enhance the residents' experience of using public space and improve the living standard of residents in the residential area.","{""Liu, Lingbo"",""Peng, Zhenghong"",""Shang, Zhourui"",""Yu, Yang"",""Zhao, Jie""}",zhao_publicspacelayoutoptimization_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Estimation Of Degraded Grassland Aboveground Biomass Using Machine Learning Methods From Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data,"Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important indicator for grassland ecosystem assessment, management and utilization. Remote sensing technologies have driven the development of grassland AGB estimation from labor-intensive to highly-efficient. However, optical image-based remote sensing methods are fraught with uncertainty issues due to the saturation effects. In this study, we evaluated the capability of the emerging terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technique in estimating grassland AGB in the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China. Seven variables (i.e., canopy cover, canopy volume, mean height, maximum height, minimum height, range of height, and standard deviation of height) were extracted from the TLS data of 30 plots across the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China, and were used to build regression models with field measured AGB using four regression methods, which are simple regression (SR) model, stepwise multiple regression (SMR) model, random forest (RF) model and artificial neural network (ANN) model. The results demonstrate that TLS is a feasible technique for extracting grassland structural parameters. Mean grass height and canopy cover obtained from TLS data have good correspondence with field measurements (R2 > 0.7, p-values < 0.001). Among the four regression models, the SMR model yields the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 48.89 g/m2), followed by the RF model (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 68.72 g/m2), the SR model (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 86.4 g/m2), and the ANN model (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 101.40 g/m2). Minimum grass height and canopy coverage are the two most important variables influencing the prediction accuracy of the SMR model, and the prediction accuracy of the SMR model increases with the increase of point density. The results of this study can provide guidance for choosing the optimal model and data collection method for estimating degraded grassland AGB using TLS in agro-pastoral ecotone.

Sentinel-1 Polarimetry To Map Apple Orchard Damage After A Storm,"Climate change increases extreme whether events such as floods, hailstorms, or storms, which can affect agriculture, causing damages and economic loss within the agro-food sector. Optical remote sensing data have been successfully used in damage detections. Cloud conditions limit their potential, especially while monitoring floods or storms that are usually related to cloudy situ-ations. Conversely, data from the Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) are operational in all-weather conditions and are sensitive to the geometrical properties of crops. Apple orchards play a key role in the Italian agriculture sector, presenting a cultivation system that is very sensitive to high-wind events. In this work, the H-Î±-A polarimetric decomposition technique was adopted to map damaged apple orchards with reference to a stormy event that had occurred in the study area (NW Italy) on 12 August 2020. The results showed that damaged orchards have higher H (entropy) and Î± (alpha angle) values compared with undamaged ones taken as reference (Mannâ€“Whitney one-tailed test U = 14,514, p < 0.001; U = 16604, p < 0.001 for H and Î±, respectively). By contrast, A (anisotropy) values were significantly lower for damaged orchards (Mannâ€“Whitney one-tailed test U = 8616, p < 0.001). Based on this evidence, the authors generated a map of potentially storm-dam-aged orchards, assigning a probability value to each of them.

Direct Aerosol Optical Depth Retrievals Using Modis Reflectance Data And Machine Learning Over East Asia,"Anthropogenic aerosols have rapidly increased since the industrial revolution and are harmful to human health. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are critical for retrieving aerosol properties worldwide. However, current MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products require extensive computations and a precalculated lookup table. This study proposes assumption-free high-resolution AOD retrieval models based on the light gradient boosting machine method using MODIS data and ground-based observations over East Asia. The models were developed with three spatial resolutions: 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km. The results showed that 77.8% of the 250 m AOD values were within the MODIS expected error (EE) range, while 76.5%, 76.3%, and 70.08% of the 500 m, 1 km, and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD values were within the EE range, respectively. Furthermore, an analysis of the time series and detailed spatial distribution of the proposed model-derived AOD based on data from the Koreaâ€“United States Air Quality campaign demonstrated the excellent quality of the 250 m AOD via further validation using a spatially independent dataset. The Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis identified the sensor zenith angle and top-of-atmosphere reflectance of the blue band as the key contributors to the models. In addition, while MAIAC has limited spatial coverage, the spatial frequency of the proposed direct AOD retrieval was nearly 1.5-times higher than that of the MAIAC AOD. Our findings confirmed that machine learning-based high-resolution AOD estimates can be obtained using only satellite data.

Evaluate The Effect Of Topographic Factors And Lithology On Forest Cover Distribution: A Case Study Of The Moroccan High Atlas,"Understanding the relationship between the spatial distribution of forest vegetation and influencing factors provides valuable information to decision-makers in land planning, for the sustainable development of forests and efficient monitoring of environmental and ecological issues. This paper aims to understand the effect of topographic factors and lithology on forest cover distribution around Bin El Ouidane dam in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, using remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), field observation, and statistical analysis. The forest vegetation was quantified by calculating the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) from Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDVI was classified according to the density of forest vegetation into four levels: bare soil, low density of forest cover, moderate density of forest cover, and high density of forest cover. The correlation analysis between NDVI, interpreted as forest densities and topographic parameters (elevation, slope, and aspect), derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), showed that elevation has the most significant positive correlation with forest density, with r = 0.563 and a p-value less than 0.05. Additionally, moderate and high densities of forest vegetation are optimal in the terrain aspect of the South-East and North-West, respectively. However, the NDVI variation cannot be interpreted only by altitude and terrain aspect. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification has been used to map and to separate the forest vegetation types. The statistical results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the altitude is the most important topographic factor affecting the distribution of forest species. The analysis of frequency histograms revealed that Holm oaks are increasing at high altitudes, and are more abundant in the North-West, while the Thuya species prefer moderate altitudes and are more abundant in the South-East-facing aspects. In our study area, the Holm oak develops on limestone formations. On the contrary, Thuya does not thrive in lithological conditions, and is found with a decreasing level of predominance on limestones, marls-limestones, and sandstones, respectively. The conclusion of the study shows that a combination of topographic factors and lithological conditions affects the spatial distribution of forest vegetation. The adaptation of the forest species to specific topography and lithological conditions should be considered for forest management. It can be helpful in selecting potential sites for reforestation of these species, for conservation of the natural resources, including water and soil.","{""Daghor, Lamia"",""El Moutaki, Saida"",""Lhissou, Rachid"",""Maimouni, Soufiane"",""Oukassou, Mostafa""}",maimouni_evaluateeffecttopographicfactors_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

We consider a scenario, where Internet-of-Things devices on the ground operate with sensing and communication in a time-division manner, and can process the sensing results locally, at the edge, or in the cloud via the satellite communication link. Based on the proposed framework, we formulate a multi-dimensional optimization problem to maximize the utility performance of sensing, communication, and computing abilities. After decomposing the original optimization problem into two subproblems, we first derive the closed-form solution of the optimal task partitioning strategy for terrestrial users and satellite users. Then, we develop the joint subframe allocation and task partitioning strategy to optimize the overall performance, by means of which the Pareto optimal solutions can be obtained along the Pareto frontier. Extensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which is 10% to 60% superior compared with the benchmarks.

Site-Specific Seeding For Maize Production Using Management Zone Maps Delineated With Multi-Sensors Data Fusion Scheme,"Uniform rate seeding (URS) density may result in under- or over-optimal plant population that negatively affects crop growth and yield. Site-specific seeding (SSS) is one of the solutions to manage in-field soil variation by optimizing the input seed rate to match soil fertility. This study has evaluated the agronomic and economic response of maize to SSS compared to the URS using a data fusion scheme. Two fields of 5.5 ha and 10 ha in Belgium and France, respectively, were scanned using an on-line visible and near-infrared spectroscopy sensor to measure soil pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), moisture content (MC), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Crop normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were retrieved from several Sentinel-2 images. Measured crop yield, retrieved NDVI and on-line measured soil attributes were then fussed using k-means clustering algorithm to delineate management zone (MZ) maps, whose classes were ranked based on their fertility level and crop yield. A parallel strips experiment was overlaid upon the MZ map, to allow comparing the performance of SSS against URS. Two SSS treatments were implemented in the strip experiment, e.g., the â€œKingsâ€ approach that recommended the highest seeding density for the highest fertile MZ class and vice versa, and the â€œRobin Hoodâ€ approach followed the opposite principle. Results revealed that SSS treatments increased maize grain yield by 0.25â€“0.70 Mg haâˆ’1 and thus improved gross margin by 26.7â€“92.67 â‚¬ haâˆ’1, compared to the URS. Besides, the SSS-Kings treatment outperformed the URS and SSS-Robin Hood in both fields, whereas the SSS-Robin Hood outperformed the URS treatment only in one field. Soil OC, MC, Mg, and pH revealed a positive correlation each with grain yield in the SSS-Kings treatment. The SSS-Kings treatment is therefore recommended to manage in-field soil variation, which can result in optimizing input seed rates for increasing maize productivity and profitability.

A Combined Optimization-Assimilation Framework To Enhance The Predictive Skill Of Community Land Model,"Land Surface Model (LSM) predictions are affected by unknown parameters, uncertain meteorological forcings, inaccurate initial conditions, and incomplete process representation. While parameter optimization (PO) algorithms have been used to estimate the model parameter for best model performance, the use of data assimilation (DA) has been receiving increased prominence to characterize the uncertainties in such models. However, it is still an open question that how DA techniques can be used together with PO algorithms to enhance the performance of LSMs for different applications. In this study, a combined framework composed of the PO algorithm-Adaptive Surrogate Modeling Based Optimization (ASMO) and the DA algorithm-Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM), is used to improve the soil moisture (SM) estimates of Community Land Model (CLM) across the Tibetan Plateau in China. The SM data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite are used as the benchmark data for model improvement. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, the simulated SM values are validated against the SM observations collected from the in situ networks in the Tibetan Plateau, China. The findings revealed that the joint application of ASMO and EPFM algorithms results in more accurate and reliable SM estimates of CLM compared to when they are solely employed. This study suggests that the combined optimization-assimilation framework can be utilized for improving the predictive skill of the other large-scale complex LSMs while accounting for the uncertainties associated with both model parameters and state variables.","{""Abbaszadeh, Peyman"",""Duan, Qingyun"",""Gong, Wei"",""Moradkhani, Hamid"",""Xu, Lei"",""Zhang, Chong""}",zhang_combinedoptimizationassimilationframework_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Using Morphometric Analysis For Assessment Of Flash Flood Susceptibility In The Mediterranean Region Of Turkey,"Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters around the world because of their rapid and unpredictable nature. It is expected that the frequency and intensity of flood events will increase because of extreme rainfall events induced by climate change. In this context, the generation of a flood susceptibility map contributes to effective flood management in a basin. The present study aims to generate a flash flood susceptibility map for the Imali Stream Basin (ISB) situated within the Mediterranean region of Turkey. For this purpose, morphometric analysis, geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used in this study. ASTER GDEM (v.3) was used to delineate 9 sub-watersheds and to obtain the required morphometric parameters. To generate a flash flood susceptibility map, the original compound values â€‹â€‹calculated for each sub-watershed were transformed into values â€‹â€‹between 0 and 1 by using the minâ€“max normalization method. Then, these values were divided into 3 classes called low, moderate, and high by using the equal interval classification method in ArcGIS. According to both flash flood susceptibility maps produced by using morphometric analysis and PCA, sub-watershed 5 has the highest flash flood susceptibility in the basin. The flash flood that occurred in sub-watershed 5 in 2016 contributes to these results. Therefore, flood management based on morphometric analysis can be a highly effective method for decision-makers and planners in the Mediterranean region, one of the hotspots to be affected by climate change.

Demarcation Of Prime Farmland Protection Areas Around A Metropolis Based On High-Resolution Satellite Imagery,"Prime farmland (PF) is defined as high-quality farmland and a prime farmland protection area (PFPA, including related roads, waters and facilities) is a region designated for the special protection of PF. However, rapid urbanization in China has led to a tremendous farmland loss and to the degradation of farmland quality. Based on remote sensing and geographic information system technology, this study developed a semiautomatic procedure for designating PFPAs using high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI), which involved object-based image analysis, farmland composite evaluation, and spatial analysis. It was found that the HRSIs can provide elaborate land-use information, and the PFPA demarcation showed strong correlation with the farmland area and patch distance. For the benefit of spatial planning and management, different demarcation rules should be applied for suburban and exurban areas around a metropolis. Finally, the overall accuracy of HRSI classification was about 80\% for the study area, and high-quality farmlands from evaluation results were selected as PFs. About 95\% of the PFs were demarcated within the PFPAs. The results of this study will be useful for PFPA planning and the methods outlined could help in the automatic designation of PFPAs from the perspective of the spatial science.","{""Cheng, Liang"",""Jiang, PengHui"",""Li, ManChun"",""Sun, YueFan"",""Wang, YaJun"",""Xia, Nan"",""Xu, Hao"",""Yuan, Yi""}",xia_demarcationprimefarmlandprotection_2016,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
High-Resolution Riparian Vegetation Mapping To Prioritize Conservation And Restoration In An Impaired Desert River,"In highly impaired watersheds, it is critical to identify both areas with desirable habitat as conservation zones and impaired areas with the highest likelihood of improvement as restoration zones. We present how detailed riparian vegetation mapping can be used to prioritize conservation and restoration sites within a riparian and instream habitat restoration program targeting 3 native fish species on the San Rafael River, a desert river in southeastern Utah, United States. We classified vegetation using a combination of object-based image analysis (OBIA) on high-resolution (0.5m), multispectral, satellite imagery with oblique aerial photography and field-based data collection. The OBIA approach is objective, repeatable, and applicable to large areas. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80\% (Cohen's =0.77). We used this high-resolution vegetation classification alongside existing data on habitat condition and aquatic species' distributions to identify reaches' conservation value and restoration potential to guide management actions. Specifically, cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima) density layers helped to establish broad restoration and conservation reach classes. The high-resolution vegetation mapping precisely identified individual cottonwood trees and tamarisk thickets, which were used to determine specific locations for restoration activities such as beaver dam analogue structures in cottonwood restoration areas, or strategic tamarisk removal in high-density tamarisk sites. The site prioritization method presented here is effective for planning large-scale river restoration and is transferable to other desert river systems elsewhere in the world.","{""Gifford, Suzanne J."",""Laub, Brian G."",""Macfarlane, William W."",""McGinty, Christopher M.""}",macfarlane_resolutionriparianvegetationmapping_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Monitoring And Mapping Of Rice Cropping Pattern In Flooding Area In The Vietnamese Mekong Delta Using Sentinel-1a Data: A Case Of An Giang Province,"Cropping intensity is one of the most important decisions made independently by farmers in Vietnam. It is a crucial variable of various economic and process-based models. Rice is grown under irrigated triple- and double-rice cropping systems and a rainfed single-rice cropping system in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). These rice cropping systems are adopted according to the geographical location and water infrastructure. However, little work has been done to map triple-cropping of rice using Sentinel-1 along with the effects of water infrastructure on the rice cropping intensity decision. This study is focused on monitoring rice cropping patterns in the An Giang province of the VMD from March 2017 to March 2018. The fieldwork was carried out on the dates close to the Sentinel-1A acquisition. The results of dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1A data show a strong correlation with the spatial patterns of various rice growth stages and their association with the water infrastructure. The VH backscatter (sigma degrees) is strongly correlated with the three rice growth stages, especially the reproductive stage when the backscatter is less affected by soil moisture and water in the rice fields. In all three cropping patterns, sigma degrees VV and sigma degrees VH show the highest value in the maturity stage, often appearing 10 to 12 days before the harvesting of the rice. A rice cropping pattern map was generated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of Sentinel-1A data. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80.7\% with a 0.78 Kappa coefficient. Therefore, Sentinel-1A can be used to understand rice phenological changes as well as rice cropping systems using radar backscattering.","{""Avtar, Ram"",""Kurasaki, Masaaki"",""Minh, Huynh Vuong Thu"",""Misra, Prakhar"",""Mohan, Geetha""}",minh_monitoringmappingricecropping_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Satellite-Aided Land Mobile Radio Experiments, Applications And Problems","Radio communications between vehicles or individuals and base stations are essential to many public safety, law enforcement and commercial users in urban areas. Present day communications are limited to nearly line-of-sight distances from the vehicle or hand portable units to a base station or repeater. It is probable that many potential users in rural, remote and offshore areas would benefit if the communications were available everywhere on land and territorial waters. Geosynchronous satellites can serve as repeaters for mobile and personal radios, and they appear to be a cost effective means of providing the service. Voice bandwidth communication and automatic position monitoring of an automobile were tested using the VHF transponders of NASAs ATS-3 and ATS-1 satellites. Voice communications were reliable and position fixes were accurate to one fourth mile, with 0.3 mile precision of individual fixes. Demonstrations for potential users have included emergency medical voice and telemetry communications between ambulances and hospitals. While technical feasibility of satellite-aided mobile and personal communications has been demonstrated, and its potential value is appreciated by a small segment of the user community, many problems remain before an operational system could be implemented. Solutions to the problems require an experimental satellite with a multibeam antenna. The satellite or its associated ground terminals should incorporate computer controlled network switching to test demand assignment of channels. Prolonged experience by many users of the experimental satellite in their routine operations would aggregate user needs and define the capital investment that would be justified to implement a commercial operating system.

Evaluating Conservation Program Success With Landsat And Swat,"In the United States, many state and federally funded conservation programs are required to quantify the water quality benefits resulting from their efforts. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of conservation practices subsidized by the Oklahoma Conservation Commission on phosphorus and sediment loads to Lake Wister. Conservation practices designed to increase vegetative cover in grazed pastures were evaluated using Landsat imagery and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Several vegetative indices were derived from Landsat imagery captured before and after the implementation of conservation practices. Collectively, these indicators provided an estimate of the change in vegetative soil cover attributable to conservation practices in treated fields. Field characteristics, management, and changes in vegetative cover were used in the SWAT model to simulate sediment and phosphorus losses before and after practice implementation. Overall, these conservation practices yielded a 1.9\% improvement in vegetative cover and a predicted sediment load reduction of 3.5\%. Changes in phosphorus load ranged from a 1.0\% improvement to a 3.5\% increase, depending upon initial vegetative conditions. The use of fertilizers containing phosphorus as a conservation practice in low-productivity pastures was predicted by SWAT to increase net phosphorus losses despite any improvement in vegetative cover. This combination of vegetative cover analysis and hydrologic simulation was a useful tool for evaluating the effects of conservation practices at the basin scale and may provide guidance for the selection of conservation measures subsidized in future conservation programs.","{""Busteed, Philip"",""Phillips, Shannon J."",""Stoodley, Scott"",""Storm, Daniel E."",""White, Michael J.""}",white_evaluatingconservationprogramsuccess_2010,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Combining High-Resolution Images And Lidar Data To Model Ecosystem Services Perception In Compact Urban Systems,"In this study, we aim to understand how the provision of ecosystem services (ESS) is spatially distributed within a compact urban system considering the structure and spatial arrangement of green spaces in relation to built-up areas and other infrastructures. For this purpose, we devised an approach to assess the ESS provided by urban green spaces through the integration of social data (i.e., stakeholders' perception of the multiple benefits of green spaces) with remotely sensed data, such as high-resolution satellite images and Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point-cloud. We developed a spatially explicit indicator (or metric) called Normalized Difference Green-Building Volume (NDGB), derived from remote sensing, that can be used to predict the way people perceive the ESS conveyed by green spaces in cities. We designed the NDGB metric using the city of Bad, Southern Italy, as a case example by involving four groups of stakeholders (n = 202) to assess ten urban green spaces. Our results show a strong positive relationship between the NDGB and the way stakeholders perceive the ESS provided by these urban green spaces. Thus, our indicator accurately expresses the relationship between stakeholders' perceptions of ESS provided by green spaces and the physical data (i.e., green space structure) produced by remote sensing technology. The green space most highly evaluated by the NDGB indicator, the periurban park ""Lama Balice"", was also the one on which all stakeholder group responses converged, including the group of NGOs and associations, which assigned average low scores for perceived ESS across all the green spaces presented in the study. The study was developed using the city of Bari in Southern Italy as testbed. There is a need to further extend and replicate our approach to other urban systems across different regions (e.g., Northern Europe, North America, Asia), especially those which are in the process of pursuing more sustainable green infrastructure planning and development, as they could be inclined to adopt our approach in ongoing decision making processes. We believe our approach can inform planners and decision makers on ESS provision and supply them with evidence of the local co-benefits of green spaces as well as of the spatial distribution of ESS within compact urban systems.","{""Giannico, Vincenzo"",""Lafortezza, Raffaele""}",lafortezza_combiningresolutionimageslidar_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

"Satellite Remote-Sensing Observations For Definitions Of Areas For Marine Conservation: Case Study Of The Scotian Slope, Eastern Canada","Characterizing offshore areas for marine conservation faces impediment from logistics and costs of in situ data collection. This study leveraged the high spatial and temporal coverage provided by remote-sensing ocean colour products, and the concept of biogeographical classification to delineate areas in the pelagic environment with application to marine conservation. Satellite-derived and modelled biogeophysical data were used to delineate an area of biological and physical homogeneity spatially consistent with the static boundaries of the Scotian Slope Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), off eastern Canada. We used iterative cluster analysis applied to an archive (2004-2014) that consisted of remotely-sensed Chlorophyll a, sea-surface temperature, and primary production derived from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and simulated mixed layer depth to define ""dynamic"" boundaries of the EBSA at bi-weekly, seasonal and annual resolutions. The final cluster extended further east than the static EBSA in summer and fall, indicating that characteristics of the static EBSA environment persist beyond the current boundaries in these seasons. In winter and spring, the final areas derived by our analysis was smaller than the static EBSA, but again showed extension beyond the current eastern boundary. Both ice and cloud cover affecting remotely-sensed data and the extent of water column mixing were important in determining the size of the final cluster. The dynamic cluster east of the original static boundary incorporated an area of lower Chlorophyll a and water column primary production in the spring, but higher values in the autumn relative to the static area. Overall physical and biological characteristics of the static and dynamic EBSA considered in this research were similar within and across years. This methodology incorporates ocean-colour data and modelled estimates of multiple biological and physical characteristics to objectively refine areas of ecological interest at a spatial scale relevant for the management of marine conservation areas.","{""Breeze, H."",""Devred, E."",""McIver, R.""}",mciver_satelliteremotesensingobservations_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Plant Life In Campo Rupestre: New Lessons From An Ancient Biodiversity Hotspot,"The years 2011â€“2020 represent the United Nations Decade of Biodiversity, aiming to inspire worldwide actions to support biodiversity conservation. This Special Issue illustrates the current knowledge of plant life in campo rupestre, a megadiverse, highly-endemic vegetation complex, and one under alarming and unprecedented threats. The major research areas grouping the 27 contributions to the Special Issue are: i) plant diversity, ii) species coexistence, regeneration niche and climate change, iii) ecology of species interactions, iv) plant life on canga, and v) fire, regeneration ecology, and conservation. We highlight knowledge gaps in plant life in campo rupestre and suggest priority avenues of future research and steps forward to understand and preserve ancient ecosystems worldwide. Such efforts include the need to: 1) better assess the ecology of herbaceous species, 2) understand the effects of global change drivers on the vulnerability of endemic species, 3) understand how plant functional diversity and plantâ€“animal interactions shape community structure and function, 4) apply new technologies (cameras, drones and remote sensing proxies) to understand plant phenology in space and time, 5) unravel diversification patterns and distinguish paleoendemism from neoendemism, 6) to disentangle the ecological and evolutionary role of fire, 7) gain insight into the factors that limit ecological restoration in degraded campo rupestre, 8) increase awareness and value of ecosystem services, 9) identify essential variables, key measures and areas to conserve campo rupestre, 10) promote reviews and research comparing old ecosystems. Therefore, burgeoning literature on campo rupestre will benefit from long-term multi- and trans-disciplinary research investigating a wide array of topics, from plant ecology to ecosystem functioning to biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. All knowledge must reach stakeholders, and it should be translated into an ecosystem services assessment for guiding the rational stewardship of campo rupestre and for benefiting local people. A key step forward in the understanding of plant life in campo rupestre is the OCBIL Theory (old, climatically-buffered, infertile landscapes), which provides a theoretical framework of testable hypotheses and cross-continental comparisons. We anticipate this Special Issue will foster collaborative research leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of one of the world's most ancient ecosystems. Â© 2017","{""Morellato, L. P.

Modelling Landscape Vulnerability To The Bracken Fern (Pteridium Aquilinum) Invasion In A Remnant Urban Sandstone Sourveldt Grassland Ecosystem,"The Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) is one of the world's most pervasive alien invasive plants, exerting adverse effects on the sustainability and balance of remnant urban green ecosystems and thereby threatening the provision of valuable ecological goods and services in urban landscapes. To identify vulnerable landscapes and future distribution of the fern, this study aimed to model landscape vulnerability to the Bracken fern invasion using bio-physical, climatic, and remotely sensed data using Maxent species distribution model. Furthermore, the study sought to evaluate the value of variable selection on Maxent's modelling performance. Vulnerability to invasion was modelled based on four scenarios of different bio-climatic, physical and remotely sensed data inputs and model performance assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The results show that Model 1 (topographic variables) and Model 2 (topographic variables and Sentinel-2 spectral bands) predicted the western part of the eThekwini Municipal as highly suitable for the Bracken fern invasion, while Model 3 (topographic and bio-climatic variables) and Model 4 (topographic variables, Sentinel-2 spectral bands and bio-climatic variables), i.e., all variables predicted the central and western parts of the area as highly vulnerable to the Bracken fern invasion. Results also showed that elevation and rainfall wettest month (Bio13) were the most influential variables in determining the potential spread of the Bracken fern invasion and the model built using solely topographic and all the variables had the lowest (AUC of 0.895) and highest (AUC of 0.978) performance. The findings of this study are valuable to planning conservation initiatives in the often-vulnerable urban green ecology and managing invasive species in the remnant urban green spaces.","{""Matongera, Trylee Nyasha"",""Mkungo, Luyanda"",""Mutanga, Onisimo"",""Odindi, John""}",mkungo_modellinglandscapevulnerabilitybracken_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Cost-Efficiency Assessments Of Marine Monitoring Methods Lack Rigor-A Systematic Mapping Of Literature And An End-User View On Optimal Cost-Efficiency Analysis,"Global deterioration of marine ecosystems, together with increasing pressure to use them, has created a demand for new, more efficient and cost-efficient monitoring tools that enable assessing changes in the status of marine ecosystems. However, demonstrating the cost-efficiency of a monitoring method is not straightforward as there are no generally applicable guidelines. Our study provides a systematic literature mapping of methods and criteria that have been proposed or used since the year 2000 to evaluate the cost-efficiency of marine monitoring methods. We aimed to investigate these methods but discovered that examples of actual cost-efficiency assessments in literature were rare, contradicting the prevalent use of the term â€œcost-efficiency.â€ We identified five different ways to compare the cost-efficiency of a marine monitoring method: (1) the costâ€“benefit ratio, (2) comparative studies based on an experiment, (3) comparative studies based on a literature review, (4) comparisons with other methods based on literature, and (5) subjective comparisons with other methods based on experience or intuition. Because of the observed high frequency of insufficient costâ€“benefit assessments, we strongly advise that more attention is paid to the coverage of both cost and efficiency parameters when evaluating the actual cost-efficiency of novel methods. Our results emphasize the need to improve the reliability and comparability of cost-efficiency assessments. We provide guidelines for future initiatives to develop a cost-efficiency assessment framework and suggestions for more unified cost-efficiency criteria.

"Random Forest Regression Model For Estimation Of The Growing Stock Volumes In Georgia, Usa, Using Dense Landsat Time Series And Fia Dataset","The forest volumes are essential as they are directly related to the economic and environmental values of the forests. Satellite-based forest volume estimation was first developed in the 1990s, and the accuracy of the estimation has been improved over time. One of the satellite-based forest volume estimation issues is that it tends to overestimate the large volume class and underestimate the small volume class. Free availability of the major satellite imagery and the development of cloud-based computational platforms facilitate an immense amount of satellite imagery in the estimation. In this paper, we set three objectives: (1) to examine whether the long Landsat time series contributes to the improvement of the estimation accuracy, (2) to explore the effectiveness of forest disturbance record and land cover data as ancillary spatial data on the accuracy of the estimation, and (3) to apply the bias correction method to reduce the bias of the estimation. We computed three Tasseled-cap components from the Landsat data for preparation of short (2014â€“2016) and long (1984â€“2016) time series. Each data entity was analyzed with harmonic regressions resulting in the coefficients and the fitted values recorded as pixel values in a multilayer raster database. Data included Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) unit field inventory measurements provided by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service and the National Land Cover Database and disturbance history data added as ancillary information. The totality of the available data was organized into seven distinct Random Forest (RF) models with different variables compared against each other to identify the ones with the most satisfactory performance. A bias correction method was then applied to all the RF models to examine the effectiveness of the method. Among the seven models, the worst one used the coefficients and fitted values of the short Landsat time series only, and the best one used coefficients and fitted values of both short and long Landsat time series. Using the Out-of-bag (OOB) score, the best model was found to be 34.4% better than the worst one. The model that used only the long time series data had almost the same OOB score as the best model. The results indicate that the use of the long Landsat time series improves model performance. Contrary to the previous research employing forest disturbance data as a feature variable had almost no effect on OOB. The bias correction method reduced the relative size of the bias in the estimates of the best model from 3.79% to âˆ’1.47%, the bottom 10% bias by 12.5 points, and the top 10% bias by 9.9 points. Depending on the types of forest, important feature variables were differed, reflecting the relationship between the time series remote sensing data we computed for this research and the forestsâ€™ phenological characteristics. The availability of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and accessibility of the precise locations of the FIA data are likely to improve the model estimates further. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Willow Cover As A Stream-Recovery Indicator Under A Conservation Grazing Plan,"Many rangeland streams and associated fisheries have suffered from livestock grazing as a cost of upland-forage utilization. Due to damage from intensive usage, restoration of damaged streams is now a common land-management objective. The Squaw Valley Ranch of Elko County, Nevada, US, in cooperation with the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Barrick Gold Corp., is attempting to improve those portions of the Rock Creek watershed negatively affected by past ranch operations. The watershed includes both historical and occupied habitat for the threatened Lahonton cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi {[}Richardson]). From 2003, and continuing to the present, hot-season livestock grazing on Squaw Valley Ranch private and permitted public-land riparian areas was greatly reduced. To assess the effectiveness of this conservation effort, we (1) evaluated BLM archived images of riparian photo points in the watershed, (2) tested for change over time using data from systematic, intermittent, aerial sampling that acquired 2-cm resolution images from low-altitude surveys conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2006, and (3) compared Landsat scenes of the area from before and after 2003. Willow (Salix spp.) cover was chosen as the primary ecological indictor of riparian condition and we introduce willow canopy (m(2)) per m of stream length in the image field-of-view, as a practical measure of willow status. Archived images from photo points show mostly low-condition riparian plant communities, often with little or no willow canopy evident before 2003, but with conspicuous improvement thereafter. This subjective perception is supported by objective analyses finding, (1) the relative increase in willow cover nearly tripled on one stream, more than doubled on three others, and increased on all but one (fire affected) and (2) a highly significant post-2003 increase in willows in the Landsat record. Thus, the post-2003 increase in willow cover documented in three complementary lines of evidence from ground, air, and space support the predicted ecological benefits of reduced hot-season riparian grazing and the utility of 2-cm imagery as a tool for assessing watershed-wide conservation benefits from a federal cost-share-eligible conservation practice. This appears to be the first use of willow measurements from an aerial survey as a particular indicator of riparian condition and trend and the first demonstration of change detection based on objective measurements from a watershed-scale riparian monitoring effort that used systematic sampling (versus subjective selection) and high sample density to address the large Type II error (false negative) risk common to conventional land-management survey efforts.

Tourism's Impacts On Natural Resources: A Positive Case From China,"Tourism development may result in negative impacts on natural resources owing to overuse and mismanagement. However, tourism may also play positive roles in natural resource conservation, which has rarely been verified in practice, although some researchers have demonstrated this in theory. In this article, taking the Jiuzhaigou Biosphere Reserve as a case study area, we conducted an analysis for the environmental impacts from tourism development based on social survey and interpretation of remote sensing images. The results show that the natural environment was not degraded and some indicators are even improving because all the residents have participated in tourism and given up farming and hunting. It is concluded that it is possible to use tourism as a way to balance natural resource conservation and economic development under the preconditions of making effective policies to encourage and help local people participate in tourism business and to benefit from it.","{""Li, Wenjun"",""Liu, Chunyan"",""Xue, Qifu"",""Zhang, Qian""}",li_tourism'simpactsnaturalresources_2006,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Assessment Of Spatial And Temporal Variation In No2 Levels Over Tourist Reception Areas In Poland,"Featured Application: Recognizing the temporal and spatial variation in NO2 pollution will allow more effective management of tourist reception areas. Air quality in tourist reception areas can be a significant health concern. It also plays an increasingly important role when it comes to choosing tourist destinations. NO2 is a harmful gas that can cause an increased number of cancer or respiratory diseases. The development of satellite remote sensing techniques now enables a much broader spectrum of air quality analysis than mere point measurements at environment monitoring stations. In the study, the spatial diversity of nitrogen dioxide air pollution over tourist reception areas in Poland was assessed. The lowest pollution was found in national parks and tourist regions. The most polluted air was found in tourist reception areas located near industrial regions and large urban agglomerations. Temporal variationâ€”annual and monthlyâ€”and spatial variation were determined (for the period 2019â€“2021). The highest concentrations, exceeding the WHO recommended value (40 Î¼mol/m2), occurred in the winter and autumn. Low pollution was found in most reception areas in the summer (except cities). In 2020, due to restrictions related to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the NO2 pollution decreased (10â€“20%). In the cold half of the year (Octoberâ€“April), NO2 concentrations greater than 40 Î¼mol/m2 occurred for about 20% of national parks, 50% of health resorts, 30% of tourist regions, and 100% of provincial capitals.

The Drawing Of A National Blue Product Space And Its Evolution,"As countries transition to a blue economy to increase the long-term benefits of the sustainable use of marine resources, the different pathways toward the blue growth engine depend on identifying profitable ocean-related sectors and activities that offer advantages when competing with other countries. The ability to identify and establish the processes of blue product exports can be viewed as an essential part of a long-term strategy aimed at supporting blue growth and sustainable development. This paper proposes a method for defining a blue product space based on the product space model introduced by Hidalgo et al. in 2007, which is used to draw and analyze export strengths and the evolution of different countries with respect to a list of blue products. Although this descriptive analysis addresses only a small part of the overall concept of blue economy/growth, the method can identify blue products that may be competitive or potentially competitive in the world market by analyzing product export performance. An example from China is used to clarify the method of drawing the blue product space and analyzing its evolution, which is followed by a discussion of the method's limitations and possible contributions to policymakers and stakeholders when formulating blue industry policies.","{""Qi, Xiaofei"",""Xiao, Wenwen"",""Zhang, Jianghua"",""Zhao, Bingxin""}",qi_drawingnationalblueproduct_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Implications Of Changing Urban Land Use On The Livelihoods Of Local People In Northwestern Bangladesh,"Bangladesh is one of the emerging economies in the Global South, and rapid urbanization is the driving force behind its economic development. Urban growth and development are closely associated with land use/land cover changes in any area, which sometimes negatively affect the livelihood and wellbeing of local people. We investigated the impacts of urban land use changes on the local people of northwestern Bangladesh using Nilphamari Sadar as a case study site. In order to identify land use patterns and variations in land cover, a 10-year period of land use/land cover changes from 2000 to 2020 was monitored using satellite imagery and the supervised classification method. Primary data were collected through household surveys and focus group discussions. Our analysis suggests that land use has changed over the past 20 years in the study area. As a result, the land area under settlements has substantially increased from 19 square kilometers in 2000 to 48 square kilometers in 2020. Waterbodies were 24 square kilometers in 2010, dropping to 4 square kilometers in 2020, whereas croplands decreased to 218 square kilometers in 2020 from 259 square kilometers in 2000. These changes have proportionately and adversely affected the lives and livelihoods of the local people by altering their longstanding traditional livelihood options, limiting their access to common resources, failing to adapt to new environmental arrangements and economic structures, and creating new forms of vulnerability. We suggest that urban planning processes should consider local people's interests with the entitlement of local and marginalized people to the benefits generated by urbanization.","{""Huq, Hamidul"",""Mukul, Sharif A.

Early Landslide Detection Based On D-Insar Technique At The Wudongde Hydropower Reservoir,"Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) is an effective technique for geological disaster prevention. In this study, an early landslide detection method based on the D-InSAR technique is proposed. First, SAR data are used to monitor landslide deformation in the Wudongde hydropower reservoir. Then, the ground surface deformation is derived by using the D-InSAR technique, which includes both soil and non-soil deformations. To remove the non-soil deformation, the vertical deformation filter method and slope deformation filter method for extracting soil deformations are established, and the error of D-InSAR results is analyzed. By using two methods, Permanent Scatterers InSAR and Corner Reflectors InSAR, the errors caused by the atmospheric delay are estimated quantitatively. Additionally, the relationship between the landslide deformation and the temporal-spatial change of the SAR data is analyzed, and used to identify landslides. Finally, through the proposed early landslide detection method, the Jinpingzi landslide in the Wudongde area is investigated to validate the proposed method, and the other unknown landslides in this area are also detected, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method. The outcome of this study provides a workable technique for early detection of landslides in valley reservoir areas.

The Effects Of Climate And Land Use On British Bumblebees: Findings From A Decade Of Citizen-Science Observations,"Bumblebees are important pollinators but are suffering from population declines due to land use intensification and climate change. In-depth knowledge of species' relationships with different land use and climate variables is invaluable to guide conservation efforts, as well as enable predictions to be made about the impacts of future changes in these variables. Here we use 10 years of bumblebee abundance data from the UK, collected by citizen scientists as part of the BeeWalk scheme, to investigate associations between 14 bumblebee species and various land use, habitat and climate variables. National-scale land cover and climate data were complemented with observer-collected habitat data. Bumblebee presence and abundance showed strong relationships with environmental variables. However, interspecific variation was far stronger than commonalities, which suggests that targeted conservation work is required to effectively safeguard particular species. Within species, we found evidence of different habitat associations between reproductive and worker castes. The results also showed that wetland and riparian habitats had consistently positive associations with a number of species, while semi-natural, arable and urban areas had strongly species-specific associations. Synthesis and applications. This study reveals strong effects of specific habitats occurring within broad land cover types on the presence and abundance of bumblebees, with several distinct habitats having importance for different species and castes. Consequently, conservation efforts need to be carefully tailored to particular species. Nevertheless, reversing the loss of semi-natural areas such as wetlands may be the single most generally effective action for bumblebee conservation while improving habitats in urban and arable areas could benefit particular (rare) species. Our results also suggest that the combination of long-term, detailed monitoring data of both species and habitats, here collected by citizen scientists, with remotely sensed landcover and climate data is essential to extend knowledge of species' habitat requirements and to support future research and conservation.

Monitoring The Production Of Central California Coastal Rangelands Using Satellite Remote Sensing,"There is a long history of livestock grazing on the California Central Coast, dating back over 150 years. In this study, methods were reviewed and results presented for analysis of NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor data to monitor year-to-year variation of forage production on Central Coast rangelands around Big Sur, California. Time series plots from 2000 to 2012 of vegetation greenness for ten rangeland sites showed similar inter-annual patterns in satellite yield index (SYI) values. Most sites reached their maximum greenness levels each year in early May. The year with the highest observed SYI level across most sites was 2005. In the northern portion of the region (north of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park), 2007 was the year with the lowest observed SYI level, whereas in the southern allotments, 2007 was a year with a relatively high SYI level. These methods have the potential to monitor the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland production across the area of individual grazing allotments on the Central Coast. Such a cost-effective and timely approach is required for conservation monitoring in the Big Sur coastal ecosystems where rapid climate change may shift vegetation cover in favor of more extensive rangelands at the expense of forested lands.

Contribution Of Phytoecological Data To Spatialize Soil Erosion: Application Of The Rusle Model In The Algerian Atlas,"Among the models used to assess water erosion, the RUSLE model is commonly used. Policy makers can act on cover (C-factor) and conservation practice (P-factor) to reduce erosion, with less costly action on soil surface characteristics. However, the widespread use of vegetation indices such as NDVI does not allow for a proper assessment of the C-factor in drylands where stones, crusted surfaces and litter strongly influence soil protection. Two sub-factors of C, canopy cover (CC) and soil cover (SC), can be assessed from phytoecological measurements that include gravel-pebbles cover, physical mulch, annual and perennial vegetation. This paper introduces a method to calculate the C-factor from phytoecological data and, in combination with remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS), to map it over large areas. A supervised classification, based on field phytoecological data, is applied to radiometric data from Landsat-8/OLI satellite images. Then, a C-factor value, whose SC and CC subfactors are directly derived from the phytoecological measurements, is assigned to each land cover unit. This method and RUSLE are implemented on a pilot region of 3828 km(2) of the Saharan Atlas, composed of rangelands and steppe formations, and intended to become an observatory. The protective effect against erosion by gravel-pebbles (50\%) is more than twice that of vegetation (23\%). The C-factor derived from NDVI (0.67) is higher and more evenly distributed than that combining these two contributions (0.37 on average). Finally, priorities are proposed to decision-makers by crossing the synthetic map of erosion sensitivity and a decision matrix of management priorities.

Synergistic Use Of Landsat 8 Oli Image And Airborne Lidar Data For Above-Ground Biomass Estimation In Tropical Lowland Rainforests,"Developing a robust and cost-effective method for accurately estimating tropical forest's carbon pool over large area is a fundamental requirement for the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). This study aims at examining the independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to accurately estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB) of primary tropical rainforests in Sabah, Malaysia. Thirty field plots were established in three types of lowland rainforests: alluvial, sandstone hill and heath forests that represent a wide range of AGB density and stand structure. We derived the height percentile and laser penetration variables from the airborne LiDAR and calculated the vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation values, and the texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data. We found that there are moderate correlations between the AGB and laser penetration variables from airborne LiDAR data (r = âˆ’0.411 to âˆ’0.790). For Landsat 8 OLI data, the 6 vegetation indices and the 46 texture measures also significantly correlated with the AGB (r = 0.366â€“0.519). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to establish the estimation models for independent and combined use of airborne LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI data. The results showed that the model based on a combination of the two remote sensing data achieved the highest accuracy (R2adj = 0.81, RMSE = 17.36%) whereas the models using Landsat 8 OLI data airborne LiDAR data independently obtained the moderate accuracy (R2adj = 0.52, RMSE = 24.22% and R2adj = 0.63, RMSE = 25.25%, respectively). Our study indicated that texture measures from Landsat 8 OLI data provided useful information for AGB estimation and synergistic use of Landsat 8 OLI and airborne LiDAR data could improve the AGB estimation of primary tropical rainforest.

"Land Use Optimization Through Bridging Multiobjective Optimization And Multicriteria Decision-Making Models (Case Study: Tilabad Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran)","This study aims to present an efficient methodology for land use optimization based on minimization of runoff and sediment and maximization of economic benefits, occupational opportunities, and land use suitability in the Tilabad watershed in northeast of Iran. The land use map of the area was prepared using the Landsat satellite images and field surveys. The amounts of runoff and sediment were estimated via SWAT model. The TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was applied on the results of the multiobjective optimization (MOO) based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to choose the final optimal solution among the Pareto solutions front generated by MOO. The results indicated that the area of agriculture and rangelands should decrease, and the area of forests should increase to achieve the defined objectives. Overall, results indicated that integration of MOO and MCDM provides an efficient procedure for land use optimization in a complex watershed. Recommendations for Resource Managers The optimization of land use allocation across a complex watershed requires the combined application of several models and techniques to achieve a sustainable decision-making process. By optimization of land use patterns according to the final solution, the surface runoff and sediment load of the watershed will decline, while the economic profit and land use suitability will improve. Despite using a maximization objective function, the land-based job opportunities might decrease across a watershed by optimization of land use allocation, but this can be considered as an opportunity for provision of manpower to other socioeconomic sectors.","{""Fathabadi, Abolhasan"",""Mahiny, Abdolrassoul Salman"",""Ownegh, Majid"",""Salmani, Hossein"",""Sheikh, Vahedberdi""}",sheikh_landoptimizationbridgingmultiobjective_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
From Landsat To Leafhoppers: A Multidisciplinary Approach For Sustainable Stocking Assessment And Ecological Monitoring In Mountain Grasslands,"We present a case study illustrating a multidisciplinary approach for characterizing, mapping and monitoring the bio-ecological properties of Mediterranean mountain grasslands in extensive grazing systems. The approach was developed to provide the basis for the management plan of a cluster of Natura 2000 special conservation areas in the Central Apennine mountains, Italy (with a total area of 79,500 ha, including 22,130 ha of grasslands). It includes a novel methodology for estimating sustainable stocking rates of different plant communities, at a detailed spatial scale over large areas, based on the integration of: (i) a classification of grassland types, based on physical habitat stratification and vegetation sampling; (ii) a forage-value assessment of each grassland type, obtained from field sampling of botanical composition and corrected with remote-sensing information on pasture microtopography; (iii) an estimate of primary productivity at a detailed spatial scale, obtained from the remote-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calibrated with biomass field data. Additionally, to obtain a bioclimatic characterization of the grasslands and to determine the optimal grazing season for each grassland type, intra-annual phenological signatures were obtained from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Given the inherent limitations in the sustainable stocking rates concept, and the particular susceptibility of dry grasslands to changes in grazing regimes, we tested two biological indicators, the Auchenorrhyncha quality index (AQI) and the Arthropod-based biological soil quality index (QBS-ar). These indicators take into account above- and below-ground arthropod diversity, respectively, and are applied here for the first time to the specific purpose of monitoring grazing load effects on ecological quality and biodiversity of Natura 2000 dry grasslands. We conclude that: (i) it is possible to effectively integrate biomass estimates, obtained from publicly available satellite data, with a relatively simple field sampling of botanical composition, to achieve a detailed spatialization of sustainable stocking rates; (ii) within the same Natura 2000 habitat type there can be a large spatial heterogeneity in both sustainable stocking rates and optimal stocking season: thus, grazing should be kept under careful human control to maintain the habitats in the desired conservation status; (iii) while plant species richness was not correlated to grazing intensity, both AQI and QBS-ar had a significant negative correlation to grazing levels and can thus be useful for monitoring the actual ""sustainability"" of livestock loads on different aspects of grassland ecosystems.

Forests And Trees: A Public Health Perspective,"Forests have historically supplied humans with timber, fuel, and forage. They have also provided goods and services associated with human physical, mental, social, and spiritual health. Given competing priorities for funding in healthcare, research on forests and health is important from a health economics perspective. Engagement with forests (including wilderness areas, managed production forests, and urban forests) for enhanced human health and wellbeing, and perhaps for illness prevention at a fraction of the cost of medical interventions, is a major opportunity for forest management in the 21st century. Despite this general recognition, there is a lack of information regarding public health policies and approaches that exist in relation to forests and trees. The available literature suggests that the majority in the field of public health view the natural environment with ambivalence. However, a paradigm shift is underway and there is an emerging field working with the positive impacts that trees and forests have on human health and wellbeing. While the value of forests has been noted by many health practitioners in Europe and Japan, health practitioners and the associated health industry in North America remain largely focused on treatment rather than preventative approaches. Largely as a result of advocacy from forestry and recreational organizations, this view is beginning to change, but the focus in the healthcare industry on treatment rather than prevention remains deeply entrenched.

Selection Of Independent Variables For Crop Yield Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network Models With Remote Sensing Data,"Knowing the expected crop yield in the current growing season provides valuable information for farmers, policy makers, and food processing plants. One of the main benefits of using reliable forecasting tools is generating more income from grown crops. Information on the amount of crop yielding before harvesting helps to guide the adoption of an appropriate strategy for managing agricultural products. The difficulty in creating forecasting models is related to the appropriate selection of independent variables. Their proper selection requires a perfect knowledge of the research object. The following article presents and discusses the most commonly used independent variables in agricultural crop yield prediction modeling based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Particular attention is paid to environmental variables, such as climatic data, air temperature, total precipitation, insolation, and soil parameters. The possibility of using plant productivity indices and vegetation indices, which are valuable predictors obtained due to the application of remote sensing techniques, are analyzed in detail. The paper emphasizes that the increasingly common use of remote sensing and photogrammetric tools enables the development of precision agriculture. In addition, some limitations in the application of certain input variables are specified, as well as further possibilities for the development of non-linear modeling, using artificial neural networks as a tool supporting the practical use of and improvement in precision farming techniques.","{""Hara, Patryk"",""Niedbala, Gniewko"",""Piekutowska, Magdalena""}",hara_selectionindependentvariablescrop_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

The object-oriented segmentation method was used to segment the cultivated land patches and obtain cultivated land management patches. The landscape pattern software Fragstats 4.2, SPSS statistical software, and the geographical detector model were used to analyze the spatial distribution of centralized contiguous management of cultivated land in the four towns of Yunzhou District as well as its main influencing factors. The results show that the four towns of Yunzhou District were primarily located in the hinterland of Datong Basin with flat terrain, and the aggregation index was >80. The overall distribution of cultivated land patches was relatively concentrated, and the cultivated land with concentrated contiguous status of â…¢ and â…£ was larger than those of status â…  and â…¡, accounting for 58.63%.

Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Of Selective Logging In The State Of Mato Grosso Between 1992 And 2016,"Selective logging is a forestry activity that includes harvesting a group of tree species in native forests, usually those of higher value or commercial interest. Selective logging can be carried out legally, in forest management areas and forest areas previously authorized for deforestation, or illegally, in any other unauthorized cases that occur in a predatory manner. In this study, the spatiotemporal dynamic of selectively logged forests in the state of Mato Grosso was assessed based on a time-series (from 1992 to 2016) of logged forests detected using remotely sensed data. Visual interpretation and semi-automatic classification of Landsat imagery were used to detect forests impacted by selective logging activities in the study area. Based on the results, it was estimated that 41,926 km(2) of native forests were selectively logged at least once between 1992 and 2016 in the state of Mato Grosso, an annual average of 1,747 km(2). Selectively logged forests detected showing persistent or recurrent forest disturbances were more frequently observed in the most recent years of this analysis. Most of the selectively logged forests in the study area and period have not been deforested by 2016. It indicates that selective logging is a dissociated phenomenon with deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso. It was also observed that an average of 18 km(2).year(-1) and 268.18 km(2).year(-1) of native forests was selectively logged within Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands between 1992 and 2016. A significant tendency to increase or decrease logging activities within those protected areas in the analyzed period was not observed. Selectively logged forests were persistently detected in the old timber centers located in the central-northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, showing, potentially, new cutting cycles in those previously logged forests. More recently, selective logging activities have reached the last native forest frontier in northwestern Mato Grosso. Finally, it was concluded that selective logging is annually disturbing a considerable extension of native forests in the state of Mato Grosso and, therefore, needs to be adequately considered and monitored by environmental agencies due to its potential forest impacts and to support the definition of public policies to ensure the future sustainability of forest production in that state.","{""Ferreira, Nilson Clementino"",""Miguel, Eder Pereira"",""Moretti, Mariana Soares"",""Pedlowski, Marcos Antonio"",""Trondoli Matricardi, Eraldo Aparecido"",""da Costa, Olivia Bueno""}",moretti_spatiotemporaldynamicsselective_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Water Lead Exposure Risk In Flint, Michigan After Switchback In Water Source: Implications For Lead Service Line Replacement Policy","In February of 2016, the City of Flint, Michigan commenced the FAST start initiative with the aim â€œto get the lead out of Flintâ€ by replacing lead and galvanized steel service lines throughout the city. An estimated 29,100 parcels are scheduled for service line replacement (SLR) at an expected cost of $172 million. The lead exposure benefits of SLR are evaluated by analyzing Sentinel data on hundreds of repeatedly sampled homes in Flint from February 16, 2016 to July 21, 2017, comparing water lead (WL) in homes with and without lead service lines. Samples taken from homes with lead service lines were significantly more likely to exceed specified thresholds of WL than homes without lead service lines. Second, regardless of service line material type, sampled homes experienced significant reductions in WL with elapsed time from Flint's switchback to water provided by the Detroit Water and Sewage Department. Third, the risk of exceedance of WL > 15 Î¼g/L was uncorrelated with service line material type. These results are robust to sample restrictions, period stratification, time operations, reference group definitions, and statistical modeling procedures. On the question of what is gained from SLR over optimal corrosion control techniques, we simulated age-specific lead uptake (Î¼g/day) and blood lead levels (Î¼g/dL) for children in Flint at 16 and 90 weeks of elapsed time from Flint's switchback to Detroit water. At 90 weeks from the switchback in water source, the quantity of water lead consumed by children in homes with lead service lines decreased 93%, as compared to 16 weeks. Lead exposure benefits of SLR have declined in time, with modest differences in lead uptake across homes with different service lines. In light of results, policy considerations for Flint and nationwide are discussed. Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.","{""Keyes, C."",""McElmurry, S.

Identifying The Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of Forest Ecotourism Values With Remotely Sensed Images And Social Media Data: A Perspective Of Public Preferences,"Ecotourism, as a cultural ecosystem service, is an essential part of rural economic growth. Developing feasible methods and indicators for ecotourism values is vital to exploring the interactions between public preferences and ecosystems, thus providing information for sustainable ecosystem management. However, forest ecotourism value assessments at the regional scale still lack scientific frameworks covering the spatiotemporal dimension. Here, we proposed a framework to assess forest ecotourism values and explore the contributions of public preferences, selecting a typical and abundant forest area, Lin'an County, China. First, we applied a text mining approach on social comments to identify key variables related to public preferences. Then, we mapped these variables with remote sensing and GIS data and incorporated them with a Maxent model. This model revealed the spatiotemporal patterns of forest ecotourism value and its interaction with public preferences, over two periods, i.e., 2010-2014 and 2015-2019. Our results showed that albeit with a minor change magnitude in the entirety of ecotourism values (1-3\% overall decrease), about 34\% and 44\% of forests were observed as significant increases and decreases in ecotourism values, respectively. A large number of increases were concentrated in the village scenic areas, while decreases were observed in planted areas. Such notable changes were mainly attributable to changes in accessibility variables with 67\% of contributions in 2010-2014 and 72\% in 2015-2019. Variables related to human perception and vision (forest attribute and color diversity) also played a part.

Improved Deep Learning-Based Vehicle Detection For Urban Applications Using Remote Sensing Imagery,"Remote sensing (RS) data can be attained from different sources, such as drones, satellites, aerial platforms, or street-level cameras. Each source has its own characteristics, including the spectral bands, spatial resolution, and temporal coverage, which may affect the performance of the vehicle detection algorithm. Vehicle detection for urban applications using remote sensing imagery (RSI) is a difficult but significant task with many real-time applications. Due to its potential in different sectors, including traffic management, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and defense, the detection of vehicles from RS data, such as aerial or satellite imagery, has received greater emphasis. Machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), has proven to be effective in vehicle detection tasks. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely utilized to detect vehicles and automatically learn features from the input images. This study develops the Improved Deep Learning-Based Vehicle Detection for Urban Applications using Remote Sensing Imagery (IDLVD-UARSI) technique. The major aim of the IDLVD-UARSI method emphasizes the recognition and classification of vehicle targets on RSI using a hyperparameter-tuned DL model. To achieve this, the IDLVD-UARSI algorithm utilizes an improved RefineDet model for the vehicle detection and classification process. Once the vehicles are detected, the classification process takes place using the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) model. Finally, a Quantum-Based Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (QDMO) algorithm is applied to ensure an optimal hyperparameter tuning process, demonstrating the novelty of the work. The simulation results of the IDLVD-UARSI technique are obtained on a benchmark vehicle database. The simulation values indicate that the IDLVD-UARSI technique outperforms the other recent DL models, with maximum accuracy of 97.89\% and 98.69\% on the VEDAI and ISPRS Potsdam databases, respectively.","{""Abdushkour, Hesham A."",""Alshareef, Abdulrhman M."",""Alyoubi, Khaled H."",""Khadidos, Adil O."",""Khadidos, Alaa O."",""Ragab, Mahmoud""}",ragab_improveddeeplearningbased_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Quantification Of Groundwater Storage Variations And Stressed Areas Using Multi-Temporal Grace Data: A Case Study Of Upper Indus Plains, Pakistan","Groundwater is depleting at a more rapid rate than its replenishment in Indus Basin due to increased demand attributed to urbanization, inefficient water management practices especially in the agricultural sector and increase in impervious area in the name of development that can expose the country to severe challenge in the future. Through an unregulated groundwater exploitation now farmers often meet inadequacy in surface water supplies. The concurrent use of surface water and groundwater water now takes place on more than 70% of irrigated lands. Therefore, water resources should be monitored on frequent intervals to sensitize policy makers to formulate an optimal framework for water management practices. This study assessed the competence of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite (GRACE)â€”based estimation of changes in Ground Water Storage (GWS) as a substitute approach for groundwater quantitative approximation for management of groundwater resources in the Indus basin. The GRACE satellite Total Water Storage (TWS) data from 2011 to 2015 was used to calculate GWS. A common reduction trend was seen in the Upper Indus Plain (UIP) where the average net loss of groundwater was observed to be 1701.39 km3 of water amid 2011-2015. A net loss of around 0.34 km3/year groundwater storage was deduced for the UIP where flooding in 2014 assumed a fundamental part in natural replenishment of groundwater aquifer of the UIP. In view of TWS varieties three out of four doabs Bari, Rachna, Thal demonstrated a decrease in groundwater capacity though Chaj doab brought about increment of 0.09 km3. Based on this study, GRACE-Tellus satellite data is competent enough to hint for groundwater storage variations, however there is a vibrant need to calibrate GRACE-Tellus data with hydrological stations data periodically in order to take a maximum advantage for utility of GRACE to monitor groundwater variations on regional scale. Future studies should focus on this aspect. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","{""Amin, M."",""Jamil, A."",""Khan, M.

Spatial Prediction Of Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Distribution Using A Combination Of Remotely Sensed And Field-Observed Environmental Data,"Context. In New Zealand, the introduced brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, is a reservoir of bovine tuberculosis and as such poses a major threat to the livestock industry. Aerial 1080 poisoning is an important tool for possum control but is expensive, creating an ongoing need for ever more cost-effective ways of using this technique. Aims. To develop geographic information system (GIS) models to better predict spatial variation in the distribution of unmanaged possum populations, to facilitate better targeting of control activities. Methods. Relative abundance of possums and their distribution among habitat types were surveyed in a dry high-country area of the northern South Island. Two GIS-based models were developed to predict the relative abundance of possums on trap lines. The first model used remotely sensed (digital) environmental data; the second complemented the remotely sensed data with fine-scale habitat and topographic data collected on the ground. Key results. Digital environmental factors and habitat features proved to be key predictors of relative possum abundance. In both GIS models, height above valley floor, presence of forest cover and mean annual temperature were the strongest predictors. Conclusions. Predictive maps (projections) of relative possum abundance produced from these models can provide useful decision-support tools for pest-control managers, by enabling possum control to be targeted spatially. Implications. Spatially targeted pest control could allow effective control activities for invasive species or disease vectors to be applied at a lower cost for the same benefit.","{""Byrom, Andrea E."",""McKenzie, Joanna"",""Nugent, Graham"",""Porphyre, Thibaud"",""Shepherd, James"",""Yockney, Ivor""}",porphyre_spatialpredictionbrushtailpossum_2013,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Integrating Remote Sensing And Diver Observations To Predict The Distribution Of Invasive Lionfish On Bahamian Coral Reefs,"The ongoing invasion of coral reefs in the greater Caribbean region by Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.) poses challenges for managers. Although the dynamics and ecological effects of lionfish invasions have been examined in detail at the scale of individual reefs, relatively little information is available on the patterns of the invasion over larger areas. This study combined species counts and microhabitat observations from SCUBA surveys with satellite-derived bathymetry and habitat data to create predictive species distribution maps of lionfish in a 58 km(2) region along the southern edge of the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Models predicted lionfish presence, absence, and density, and were created iteratively using various resolutions and types of data to mimic the datasets that may be available to management in the region. The best-fit model for presence and absence, which combined physical variables derived from remotely sensed satellite data and diver-collected microhabitat data, predicted 89\% of lionfish presence and absence. The best-fit model for lionfish density used 2 resolutions of physical habitat data as well as biological data on densities of large native groupers and accurately predicted 67\% lionfish density. These results suggest that physical habitat may be more important for initial lionfish presence and that biotic interactions influence lionfish density on the reefs. Understanding the limitations and value of each type of data when creating models may be advantageous for planning targeted lionfish removals and prioritizing sites for conservation efforts.","{""Davis, Alexandra C.

A Call For Viewshed Ecology: Advancing Our Understanding Of The Ecology Of Information Through Viewshed Analysis,"There has been rapid increase of interest in the role that information acquisition plays in ecological process and in shaping life histories and their evolution. Compared to auditory and olfactory cues, the range at which visual cues are likely to be informative to animals is particularly sensitive to the spatial structure of the environment. However, quantification of and accounting for availability of visual information in fundamental and applied ecological research remains extremely limited. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of animal behaviour in a spatial context would greatly benefit from objective quantification of the area an animal can potentially obtain visual information from and therefore draw broad attention to viewshed analysis. This analysis identifies all cells of a gridded surface that are connected by lines-of-sight to a viewpoint, hence, providing information on how much of the environment surrounding a location can be seen. Although heavily used in non-ecological disciplines including civil planning and archaeology, viewshed analysis has seldom been applied in an ecological context. Here, we highlight the opportunity to make use of viewshed approaches in conjunction with three-dimensional remote sensing data and data from animal tracking to make major progress in understanding how visual information influences animal spatial behaviour, ecology and evolution.","{""Aben, Job"",""Pellikka, Petri"",""Travis, Justin M.

Spatial And Temporal Evolution Of Carbon Stocks In Dongting Lake Wetlands Based On Remote Sensing Data,"Wetlands are one of the important carbon reservoirs on earth, assessing the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetland carbon stocks and their driving mechanisms is critical for stabilizing and enhancing the carbon sink function of wetlands. In this study, the carbon stocks of Dongting Lake wetland during 1995-2020 were estimated using the Integrate Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Tool (InVEST) model and land use/cover data derived from remote sensing data. Subsequently, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was utilized to explore the driving mechanisms of the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks based on natural and socio-economic factors. Finally, evolution of land use status and carbon stocks was simulated based on patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model during 2030-2050 under different scenarios. The results showed that: 1) over the past 25 years, carbon stocks have been fluctuating in a 'decrease-increase-decrease' pattern, with an average decrease of 39.70 x 10(6) t per year; 2) compared with socio-economic factors, climate conditions have a greater influence on the change of carbon stocks distribution; 3) under the natural variation scenario, the carbon stocks in 2030 is 1345.36 x 10(6) t, which is increased compared with the year of 2020. However, the carbon stocks in 2040-2050 started to show a decreasing trend. Under the ecological conservation scenario, the increase in forest area leads to a significant increase in carbon stocks from 2030 to 2050, which showed a continuous growth trend and obviously enhanced the carbon sequestration capacity of the Ecological and Economic Circle around Dongting Lake. The results of this study are expected to provide a scientific basis for carbon balance, land use restructuring and wetland resource management planning in the ecological and economic circle around Dongting Lake.","{""An, Xuexian"",""Chen, Shudan"",""Jin, Wenping"",""Long, Xiangren"",""Qi, Shuaiyang"",""Zhang, Meng""}",an_spatialtemporalevolutioncarbon_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Gesanet: Geospatial-Awareness Network For Vhr Remote Sensing Image Change Detection,"The characteristics of very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images (RSIs) have higher spatial resolution inherently and are easier to obtain globally compared with hyperspectral images (HSIs), making it possible to detect small-scale land cover changes in multiple applications. RSI change detection (RSI-CD) based on deep learning has been paid attention to become a frontier research field in recent years and is currently facing two challenging problems. The first is high dependence on registration between bitemporal images caused by high spatial resolution. The other is high pseudo-change information response caused by low spectral resolution. In order to address the abovementioned two problems, a novel RSI-CD framework called geospatial-awareness network (GeSANet) based on the geospatial position matching mechanism (PMM) with multilevel adjustment and the geospatial content reasoning mechanism (CRM) with diverse pseudo-change information filtering is proposed. First, the PMM assigns independent 2-D offset coordinates to each position in the previous temporal image. Afterward, bilinear interpolation is employed to obtain the subpixel feature value after the offset, and the sparse results based on the difference are transmitted to the next level prediction to realize multilevel geospatial correction. The CRM extracts the global features from the corrected sparse feature map in terms of dimensions, implementing effective discriminant feature extraction on the basis of the original feature map in a stepwise refinement manner through the cross-dimension exchange mechanism, to filter out various pseudo-change information as well as maintain real change information. Comparison experiments with five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are carried out on two popular datasets with diverse changes, and the results show that the proposed method has good robustness and validity for multitemporal RSI-CD. In particular, it has a strong comparative advantage in detecting small entity changes and edge details.

4d-Var Inversion Of European Nh3 Emissions Using Cris Nh3 Measurements And Geos-Chem Adjoint With Bi-Directional And Uni-Directional Flux Schemes,"We conduct the first 4D-Var inversion of NH3 accounting for NH3 bi-directional flux, using CrIS satellite NH3 observations over Europe in 2016. We find posterior NH3 emissions peak more in springtime than prior emissions at continental to national scales, and annually they are generally smaller than the prior emissions over central Europe, but larger over most of the rest of Europe. Annual posterior anthropogenic NH3 emissions for 25 European Union members (EU25) are 25\% higher than the prior emissions and very close (<2\% difference) to other inventories. Our posterior annual anthropogenic emissions for EU25, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are generally 10\%-20\% smaller than when treating NH3 fluxes as uni-directional emissions, while the monthly regional difference can be up to 34\% (Switzerland in July). Compared to monthly mean in-situ observations, our posterior NH3 emissions from both schemes generally improve the magnitude and seasonality of simulated surface NH3 and bulk NHx wet deposition throughout most of Europe, whereas evaluation against hourly measurements at a background site shows the bi-directional scheme better captures observed diurnal variability of surface NH3. This contrast highlights the need for accurately simulating diurnal variability of NH3 in assimilation of sun-synchronous observations and also the potential value of future geostationary satellite observations. Overall, our top-down ammonia emissions can help to examine the effectiveness of air pollution control policies to facilitate future air pollution management, as well as helping us understand the uncertainty in top-down NH3 emissions estimates associated with treatment of NH3 surface exchange. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric ammonia contributes to air pollutants and excessive deposition of reactive nitrogen that is detrimental to sensitive ecosystems. Ammonia is emitted mainly by agricultural livestock and fertilizer use. While surface measurements of NH3 are sparse, satellite observations can provide near daily global coverage. Here we calculate monthly NH3 emissions over Europe, the only region adopting NH3 control policies, using an air quality model coupled with a process-based bi-directional NH3 flux scheme and NH3 measurements observed by the CrIS satellite instrument. Our CrIS-derived annual regional total anthropogenic NH3 emissions are close (<2\% difference) to statistic-based bottom-up estimates and are 10\%-20\% lower than when treating NH3 exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere as one-way emissions. Our top-down NH3 emissions estimates may help to assess the efficacy of NH3 abatement policies and provide quantitative support for future policy making.","{""Bash, Jesse O."",""Braban, Christine"",""Bruemmer, Christian"",""Cady-Pereira, Karen"",""Cao, Hansen"",""Capps, Shannon L."",""Dammers, Enrico"",""Ellermann, Thomas"",""Fauvel, Yannick"",""Feigenspan, Stefan"",""Flechard, Christophe"",""Geels, Camilla"",""Heath, Nicholas"",""Henze, Daven K."",""Kruit, Roy Wichink"",""Leeson, Sarah"",""Lonsdale, Chantelle"",""Meier, Mario"",""Miyazaki, Kazuyuki"",""Sanocka, Agnieszka"",""Schrader, Frederik"",""Seitler, Eva"",""Shephard, Mark W."",""Sitwell, Michael"",""Stephens, Amy C.

Longitudinal Associations Of Neighborhood Environment Features With Pediatric Body Mass Index,"Introduction: It has been posited that policies to promote child health and prevent obesity should target neighborhood environments but evidence on the impact of neighborhoods on child weight is conflicting and longitudinal studies (which have benefits for causal inference) are scarce. Methods: We used electronic health records (2007â€“2016) from an urban, pediatric integrated delivery system and linked children (N = 51,873, ages 6â€“19 years, 77% African American) to neighborhood-level data to investigate how changes in neighborhood environments relate to changes in body mass index (BMI). Measures of neighborhood environment were resources for healthy foods and physical activity (â€˜resourcesâ€™), greenness, violent crime rate, perceived safety and social cohesion. Fixed effects models estimated associations between changes in neighborhood environment exposures and changes in BMI z-score and whether effects differed by sex, baseline age, neighborhood socioeconomic status and population density. Results: Approximately 22% of the cohort was obese (BMI z-score â‰¥ 95th percentile). In adjusted models, increases in neighborhood greenness and perceived safety were associated with decreases in BMI z-score (mean change in BMI z-score for 1-SD increase for both: -0.012; 95% CI= (âˆ’0.018, âˆ’0.007)). Increases in neighborhood safety had a stronger effect in children ages 6â€“10 years than in older children. Increases in social cohesion were associated with increases in BMI z-score (mean change: 0.005 95% CI = (0.003, 0.008)) especially in boys. Increases in food and physical activity resources were not associated with changes in BMI. Conclusions: This study suggests that increasing neighborhood greenness and safety are potential approaches to reduce children's BMI. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd","{""Auchincloss, A.

Hazard Evaluation Of Secondary Geological Disaster Based On Gis And Information Value Method,"5Â·12 Wenchuan earthquake triggered a series of secondary landslides, landslides, debris flows, and other geological disasters, which posed a major threat to peoples lives and property and socio-economic development. For risk assessment of secondary geological hazards in the area, the worst-hit Wenchuan County was selected as the study area. Remote sensing and geographic information technology spatial data management and spatial data analysis platform have been applied to gain relevant information, to make a correlative analysis between secondary geological disasters in the study area and the topography, lithology, hydrology, earthquake rupture. In addition, information value method has been used to evaluate the risk of secondary geological disasters. It is found that the area of high risk, moderate risk and low risk is 1130.196 km2, 1739.584 km2, 1213.219 km2 respectively. The distribution of secondary geology disaster triggered by earthquake has the colony type distribution characteristic featured with a concentrated development of geological disasters in the fault zone and the nearby regions and a quick decay and the fragmentary distribution farther away form the fault zone areas. Analysis also shows that risk of secondary geological disaster in north and east areas of Wenchuan is heavy, while that in the west and south areas is light, which is coincident with the reality. The study further demonstrates that the geographical information system combined with information value model can quickly and effectively evaluate the spatial distribution and risk of secondary geological disasters.","{""Du, J."",""Xue, C.

Calculation Of Area Target Evapotranspiration In Yellow River Basin And Evaluation Of Water Resource Allocation,"Aiming at target ET calculation in water resources management model based on R - ET (runoff-evapotranspiration) in Yellow River basin, the paper puts forward calculation method and process. The first step is to formulate scheme set according to water resources in research area. The second step is to calculate the target ET of different sub item using the method such as the distributed hydrologic model, remote sensing estimation model, and the water use quota method. The third step is to evaluate each scheme based on the principle of sustainability, fairness and effectiveness, and to find the best scheme. Ordos is taken as the case study and five schemes were calculated in this paper. Scheme 1 is present situation of water resources utilization, and the target ET is 468.79 mm. Scheme 2 is increasing diverting water from the Yellow River, and the target ET is 450.89 mm. Scheme 3 is decreasing the ground water, and the target ET is 432.95 mm. Scheme 4 is to reduce diverting water from the Yellow River, and the target ET is 406.11 mm. Scheme 5 is a saving water plan, the target ET is 383.27 mm. Then, the scheme 5 is the optimal solutions and recommendations according to comprehensive evaluation. The comparison between Scheme 1 and 5 showed that, with the development of population, economy and society, target ET reduced gradually with the high water-saving measures. The proportion of target ET in cultivated land declined, because water consumption of cultivated land reduced. The proportion of residential and industrial land target ET increased due to the economic development. The second and third industry water demand and ecological water use will increase at the same time. In order to guarantee reliability and accuracy of the area target ET, calculation results of distributed hydrological model and the remote sensing estimation method verified the validity. Two methods calculation error of the area actual ET value is 0.78% and 1.22%, respectively. Target ET determination and evaluation in this study provide references for the next step to implement R - ET water management in the Yellow River basin.

New Opportunities For Low-Cost Lidar-Derived Snow Depth Estimates From A Consumer Drone-Mounted Smartphone,"Snow has significant impacts on springtime flooding, water resource management practices and the regional water-energy budget. In situ observations are considered some of the highest quality measurements of snow depth available, and are useful constraints for numerical weather prediction models and reanalysis system estimates of snow water equivalent. The application of laser altimetry (LiDAR-Light Detection and Ranging) for measuring snow depth has proven an effective method for quickly observing large areas, however this technique is expensive to perform due to the high cost of the necessary equipment coupled with required operator training. In this work, we examine the capabilities of the iPhone 12 Pro LiDAR (iLiDAR) when attached to a consumer-grade DJI Phantom 4 quadcopter in estimating snow depth at three study sites in southern Ontario, Canada. Initial comparisons between drone iLiDAR depth estimates and collocated snow ruler measurements demonstrate good agreement, with a root-mean-square error of 3 cm and absolute mean error of 2.5 cm. The intersection of these two technologies defines a novel, low-cost alternative to traditional LiDAR-based snow depth measurement systems, while maintaining a high level of observational accuracy and precision.

Control Charts For Improved Decisions In Environmental Management: A Case Study Of Catchment Water Supply In South-West Western Australia,"Environmental monitoring is becoming increasingly sophisticated with the widespread adoption of data loggers, sensor arrays and remote sensing, leading to larger scale, higher resolution and superior quality data. However, interpreting monitoring data and deciding when and how to apply environmental management remains a subjective and underdeveloped area of research. Control charts, developed in industrial settings to identify when manufacturing processes were beyond the acceptable bounds of production quality, represent one solution. Despite their potential utility, control charts have rarely been adopted in environmental monitoring. In theory, they are able to identify undesirable trends early and provide transparent and broadly consensual criteria for defining when management action should take place, that is action is triggered when parameter values are observed beyond the agreed control limits of the process. Once triggered, a predetermined management action is implemented. Possible actions are many and varied, and range from investigation and increased monitoring to intervention in the system. Here, the utility of control charts in monitoring water supply in south-western Australia from 1911 to 2010 is examined, and their ability to provide an early, transparent and easily understandable means of triggering management action is assessed. Two control chart types are applied: the X-bar chart and the CUSUM chart. X-bar charts varied widely in their ability to trigger action and were insensitive to many traditional threshold criteria (of which there are many to choose from). In contrast, standard CUSUM charts are specifically designed to detect subtler shifts away from a mean trend and hence provided a more consistent warning of the decline in water supply. While managers were aware of the decline in water supply from an early stage, we believe that control charts could have clearly communicated this earlier, enabling consensus among decision makers to be reached more rapidly.

Mapping Prospects For Artificial Groundwater Recharge Utilizing Remote Sensing And Gis Methods,"The indiscriminate use of groundwater and its overexploitation has led to a significant decline in groundwater resources in India, making it essential to identify potential recharge zones for aquifer recharge. A study was conducted to determine such potential recharge zones in the Nandhour-Kailash River watershed. The study area included 1481 streams divided into 12 sub-basins (SWS). The results show that the downstream Saraunj sub-basins (SWS-11) and Odra sub-basins (SWS-12) were high priority and required immediate soil and water conservation attention. Sub catchments Lobchla West (SWS-4), Deotar (SWS-5), Balot South (SWS-8), Nandhour (SWS-9), and Nakoliy (SWS-10) had medium priority and were designated for moderate soil erosion and degradation. In contrast, sub-catchments Aligad (SWS-1), Kundal (SWS-2), Lowarnala North (SWS-3), Bhalseni (SWS-6), and Uparla Gauniyarao (SWS-7) had low priority, indicating a low risk of soil erosion and degradation. Using the existing groundwater level data, the potential map of groundwater was validated to confirm its validity. According to the guidelines provided by the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD), the results of the groundwater potential zones for good to very good zones have been integrated at the slope and stream order. In a 120.94 km2 area with a slope of 0-5\% in first-order streams, 36 ponds were proposed, and in a 218.03 km2 area with a slope of 15\% in first- to fourth-order streams, 105 retention dams were proposed and recognized as possible sites for artificial groundwater recharge. The proposed water harvesting structure may aid in continuously recharging these zones and benefit water resource managers and planners. Thus, various governmental organizations can use the results to identify possible future recharge areas.","{""Abed, Salwan Ali"",""Al-Ansari, Nadhir"",""Gururani, Dheeraj Mohan"",""Kumar, Vinod"",""Kumar, Yogendra"",""Kuriqi, Alban"",""Mattar, Mohamed A."",""Singh, Kanwarpreet"",""Vishwakarma, Dinesh Kumar""}",gururani_mappingprospectsartificialgroundwater_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Baseline Health Indicators Of Eastern Pacific Green Turtles (Chelonia Mydas) From Baja California Sur, Mexico","Sea turtle health is an important component of conservation since these taxa is susceptible to infectious diseases that can cause illness leading to mortality.

The goal of Fengyun 3 is to acquire all-weather, multi-spectral and 3D observations of global atmospheric and geophysical elements, providing satellite observation data to medium-term numerical weather prediction; monitoring ecological environment and large-scale natural disasters; providing satellite meteorological information for global environmental change, global climate change research, and others. The medium-resolution spectral imager II (MERSI-II) is one of the main loads of Fengyun 3D (FY-3D) and is equipped with 25 channels, including 16 visible-near-infrared channels, 3 short-wave infrared channels, and 6 medium-long infrared channels. Among the 25 channels, 6 channels with 250 m ground resolution and 19 channels with 1 000 m ground resolution are obtained. The research used FY-3D to obtain high-precision soil moisture data and constructed a soil moisture monitoring technology system that can greatly reduce the dependence on foreign data, operating cost of large-scale monitoring systems, and improve system stability, safety, and monitoring timeliness. Improving the ability of meteorological services and level of domestic satellite applications is important. To obtain high spatial and temporal resolution soil moisture data using Fengyun satellite imagery, this study proposes a method of extracting soil moisture data using convolutional neural network(CNN). Method: CNN is a new machine learning technology that was newly developed in recent years and has attracted research attention because of its powerful autonomous learning ability. This technology has achieved great success in image classification, image segmentation, and other fields. This study constructed a soil moisture convolutional neural network (SMCNN) to achieve the goal of obtaining large-scale high-precision soil moisture monitoring using FY-3D remote sensing image. The SMCNN model includes seven parts, namely, input, temperature subnetwork, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extraction module, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) extraction module, surface albedo extraction module, soil moisture subnetwork, and output. The temperature and soil moisture subnetworks contain a feature extractor and an encoder. The feature extractor is used to generate a feature vector for each pixel, where the feature extractor of the temperature subnetwork has 11 convolutional layers, and the feature extractor of the humidity subnetwork consists of 9 convolutional layers, and the convolutional layer uses a 1Ã—1 type convolution kernel. The encoder is used to fit the extracted features to the target variable. Both subnetworks use the average variance as a loss function. In the model training stage, the preprocessed FY-3D image and corresponding observation point data are used as inputs, and in the model test phase, only the preprocessed FY-3D image is used as the input. The temperature subnetwork is used to obtain the ground temperature from the FY-3D image, the NDVI extraction module is used to extract the NDVI from the FY-3D image, the EVI extraction module is used to extract the EVI from the FY-3D image, and the surface albedo extraction module is used to obtain surface albedo. The extraction results of the aforementioned four parts are used as input to the soil moisture subnetwork. The soil moisture subnetwork uses the extracted ground temperature, NDVI, EVI, and ground albedo to retrieve soil moisture. The output of the model is the pixel-by-pixel soil moisture value. The model is trained using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and finally the tr ined model is used to extract regional soil moisture data. Result: Ningxia was selected as the experimental area. The FY-3D used in this study is all from the satellite ground receiving station of Ningxia Meteorological Bureau, including 161 images in 2018 and 92 images in 2019, with a total of 253. After the images were stitched together, a total of 92 images covering the entire territory of Ningxia were formed. The ground observation data used in this study came from the automatic weather station deployed by the Ningxia Meteorological Bureau. The time range was from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019. A total of 36 ground temperature stations and 37 soil moisture stations were observed. To verify the validity and rationality of this proposed method, we selected the linear regression and back propagation(BP) neural network models as the contrast models to conduct the data experiment. The mean square error was selected as the evaluation index. The comparison experimental results show that the RMSE of the SMCNN model is 0.006 7, which is higher than the comparison model. The experimental results show that the SMCNN model has advantages in extracting soil moisture from wind cloud images. Conclusion: The SMCNN model proposed in this paper fully utilizes deep learning technology to learn independently and improves the accuracy of obtaining soil moisture. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) Based on the analysis of the characteristics of FY-3D data, a step-by-step inversion strategy is established for the inversion of soil moisture requirements, and each step inversion uses a more relevant variable. The proposed strategy is an important reference for inverting other variables. 2) CNNs are used to construct network structures for inversion of surface temperature and soil moisture, and organized into a complete soil moisture inversion network structure. This structure enables direct access to soil moisture data from FY-3D data. 3) The feature value extracted by the 1Ã—1 type convolution kernel used can be regarded as a spectral index and has a physical meaning. The main disadvantage of this study is that in the late stage of crop growth, the effect of vegetation index becomes invalid due to the saturation problem, which influences the inversion effect. This study aims to find other suitable supplementary parameters to introduce into the model to solve the effect of vegetation index saturation.

Stereo Mapping Of Ming Great Wall With Remote Sensing,"Listed by UNESCO in 1987 as a World Heritage site, the world-famous Ming Great Wall stretches several thousands of kilometers across northern China, and served as a massive military defensive system which in recent times has a unique historical, artistic and scientific value. Due to historical reasons and lack of advanced technologies, construction resources and conservation status of Ming Great Wall have not been investigated in any systematic manner; indeed, the extent of the Great Wall has not even been measured. This has resulted in a shortage of reliable first-hand scientific information on actual size, spatially resource distribution and preservation status of this World Heritage site. Driven by the urgent need to establish protection, research, renovation and management of Ming Great Wall, a comprehensive investigation and spatial mapping was jointly organized and completed by the State Bureau of Survey and Mapping and State Administration of Culture Heritage. High resolution digital stereo models at 1:10000 map scale covering the whole length of the Ming Great Wall have been created by photogrammetric reconstruction using nearly ten thousand aerial images. Spatial distribution and attributes of the wall sections, trenches and various subsidiary facilities in the surroundings of the Great Wall were measured with the help of digital photogrammetry workstations and results from field studies. Reliable and precise information about the Ming Great Wall has now been obtained and documented, including surface lengths, resource distribution, and preservation status. For example, the total length of Ming Great Wall is 8851.8 km, of which 6259.6 km is of actual wall, 2232.5 km of natural terrain, and 359.7 km of trenches. In category lengths, 1828.8 km is constructed of stone, 3411.3 km of earth, 249.6 km in brick, 197.5 km of cliff wall and the rest 572.4 km of other means. Such information provides the scientific basis and strong platform in helping to delineate areas needing protection, in planning conservation and renovation programs, as well as digital archiving for posterity and web-based applications for modern promotions of one of the world's great attractions, the Ming Great Wall.","{""Chen Jun"",""Jin ShuPing"",""Liao AnPing"",""Rong DaWei"",""Yang ZhaoJun"",""Zhang HongWei"",""Zhao YouSong""}",chenjunandjinshupingandliaoanpingandzhaoyousongandzhanghongweiandrongdaweiandyangzhaojun_stereomappingmingwall_2010,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Ecological Restoration Evaluation Of Afforestation In Gudao Oilfield Based On Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data,"The growing petroleum industry poses significant ecological challenges, prompting an increased focus on ecological restoration projects in onshore oilfields. Current efforts focus on revegetation in deforested oilfields, while research remains limited on alternative ecological restoration strategies aimed at establishing new eco-systems in oilfields. This study employed multi-source remote sensing data from 1985 to 2022 to calculate a remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) and constructed an integrated forest health index (IFHI), in order to evaluate the ecological restoration effects in the Gudao shelterbelt of Shengli Oilfield in the Yellow River Delta, and investigated the impact of oil extraction by considering forest phenology. The RSEI of the shelterbelt showed an upward trend and reached a Good level of ecological environment quality from 1990 to 2003, but it declined after that, indicating the potential of RSEI to quickly assess ecological restoration effects and guide management at different stages. Comparing the restoration effects of different tree species, a Robinia pseudoacacia L. (RP) and Fraxinus velutina Torr. (FV) mixed forest demonstrated the greatest capacity to improve environ-mental quality, with the most years (25 years) of the Good and Excellent levels and the highest IFHI value (1.52). In contrast, Ulmus pumila L. (UP) and Sophora japonica L. (SJ) were unsuitable for mixed planting for ecological restoration. The study also found that monospecific RP forests within 30 m of oil wells were significantly impacted by oil extraction (P <= 0.05), necessitating tailored forest management. The research aims to serve as a reference for ecological restoration in global onshore oil production areas, particularly in delta regions and sparsely vegetated areas.","{""Cornelis, Wim"",""Li, Xiuneng"",""Li, Yongtao"",""Qin, Shuhong"",""Wang, Hong"",""Wang, Xin"",""Yang, Han""}",li_ecologicalrestorationevaluationafforestation_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Carrying Capacity As Tool For Beach Economic Value Assessment (Case Studies Of Italian Beaches),"This study developed a new integrated assessment method for sandy beaches, using three recreational Italian beaches as case study, with the purpose of obtaining their economic value. The method was based on a geomorphological assessment of the beaches and a carrying capacity evaluation; an economic analysis through the elicitation of the willingness to pay (WTP); a social assessment of beachgoers' attitude and opinion. For the selected beaches, which differed for typology, location, shape, level of urbanization and tourism, we identified the available surfaces for recreational uses trough the observation of satellite images. WTP results indicate that respondents would be willing to pay a contribution from 9 to 15(sic) per season. WTP is principally positive correlated with some variables like beach frequentation, residence in the localities, available services on the beach. The value of the selected beaches was calculated multiplying the sustainable carrying capacity of each site with their related maximum WTP. It was found that the values of the beaches varied from more than 50M(sic)/season at a popular urban beach to 1M(sic)/season at a remote natural beach. The comparison of beach valuation and investments made by managers of the beaches show a gap. Therefore, the huge non-market value of these beaches might need decision-makers to guarantee continuous beach restoration measures.","{""Carboni, Donatella"",""Corbau, Corinne"",""Madau, Fabio"",""Mazzanti, Massimiliano"",""Parente, Luigi"",""Rodella, Ilaria"",""Simeoni, Umberto""}",rodella_carryingcapacitytoolbeach_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
A Geoscience-Aware Network (Gaslumnet) Combining Unet And Convnext For Slum Mapping,"Approximately 1 billion people worldwide currently inhabit slum areas. The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 11.1) underscores the imperative of upgrading all slums by 2030 to ensure adequate housing for everyone. Geo-locations of slums help local governments with upgrading slums and alleviating urban poverty. Remote sensing (RS) technology, with its excellent Earth observation capabilities, can play an important role in slum mapping. Deep learning (DL)-based RS information extraction methods have attracted a lot of attention. Currently, DL-based slum mapping studies typically uses three optical bands to adapt to existing models, neglecting essential geo-scientific information, such as spectral and textural characteristics, which are beneficial for slum mapping. Inspired by the geoscience-aware DL paradigm, we propose the Geoscience-Aware Network for slum mapping (GASlumNet), aiming to improve slum mapping accuracies via incorporating the DL model with geoscientific prior knowledge. GASlumNet employs a two-stream architecture, combining ConvNeXt and UNet. One stream concentrates on optical feature representation, while the other emphasizes geo-scientific features. Further, the feature-level and decision-level fusion mechanisms are applied to optimize deep features and enhance model performance. We used Jilin-1 Spectrum 01 and Sentinel-2 images to perform experiments in Mumbai, India. The results demonstrate that GASlumNet achieves higher slum mapping accuracy than the comparison models, with an intersection over union (IoU) of 58.41%. Specifically, GASlumNet improves the IoU by 4.60~5.97% over the baseline models, i.e., UNet and ConvNeXt-UNet, which exclusively utilize optical bands. Furthermore, GASlumNet enhances the IoU by 10.97% compared to FuseNet, a model that combines optical bands and geo-scientific features. Our method presents a new technical solution to achieve accurate slum mapping, offering potential benefits for regional and global slum mapping and upgrading initiatives.

"Rs \& Gis-Based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Of The Balason River Basin, Darjeeling Himalaya, Using Logistic Regression (Lr) Model","The present study deals with the preparation of a landslide susceptibility map of the Balason River basin, Darjeeling Himalaya, using a logistic regression model based on Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing. The landslide inventory map was prepared with a total of 295 landslide locations extracted from various satellite images and intensive field survey. Topographical maps, satellite images, geological, geomorphological, soil, rainfall and seismic data were collected, processed and constructed into a spatial database in a GIS environment. The chosen landslide-conditioning factors were altitude, slope aspect, slope angle, slope curvature, geology, geomorphology, soil, land use/land cover, normalised differential vegetation index, drainage density, lineament number density, distance from lineament, distance to drainage, stream power index, topographic wetted index, rainfall and peak ground acceleration. The produced landslide susceptibility map satisfied the decision rules and -2 Log likelihood, Cox \& Snell R-Square and Nagelkerke R-Square values proved that all the independent variables were statistically significant. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the prediction accuracy of the landslide probability map was 96.10\%.

Predictive Soil Mapping Using Historic Bare Soil Composite Imagery And Legacy Soil Survey Data,"There is an increasing need for detailed soil property maps to support land use planning, soil carbon accounting, and precision agriculture. While soil maps exist in Saskatchewan, they are at coarse scales (1:100,000), which are not always suitable for detailed soil management. One emerging technique for predictive soil mapping is the use of bare soil composite imagery derived from multi-temporal satellite imagery. This study focused on using bare soil composite imagery along with legacy soil data (1958-1998) with high location uncertainty to predict soil organic carbon, clay, and cation exchange capacity. The bare soil composite images were created from Landsat 5 imagery (1985 to 1995) using Google Earth Engine. Predictive models were built using a Random Forest model for each parameter and evaluated using a 75-25 train-test split. The soil organic carbon model had an R-2 value of 0.55 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 percent, with the near infrared and visible light bands being the most important features in the model. The clay predictive model has an R-2 of 0.44 and a RMSE of 5.0 percent, with the shortwave infrared bands being most important. The cation exchange capacity model had an R-2 of 0.50 with a RMSE of 5.7 meq 100 g(-1), with the shortwave and near infrared bands as the most important predictors. Based on these results, bare soil composite imagery represents a valuable covariate for predictive soil mapping in the Canadian Prairies. This work also illustrates that for regions with extensive adoption of conservation farming practices, satellite imagery should be obtained for time periods before these practices were adopted from the months of the year where crop residues have decomposed. By combining historical soil survey data with historical imagery, maps of legacy soil properties can be generated to make comparisons against with modern data for applications such as monitoring soil organic carbon change over time.","{""Bedard-Haughn, A.

Modelling Land Use And Land Cover Dynamics Of Dedza District Of Malawi Using Hybrid Cellular Automata And Markov Model,"The spatiotemporal variation of any landscape patterns is as a result of complex interactions of social, economic, demographic, technological, political, biophysical and cultural factors. Modelling land use and land cover (LULC) changes is essential for natural resource scientists, decision-makers and planners in developing comprehensive medium and long-term plans for tackling environmental or other related sustainable development issues. The current study used an integrated approach that combines remote sensing and GIS to simulate and predict plausible LULC changes for Dedza district in Malawi for the years 2025 and 2035 based on Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov Chain model embedded in IDRISI Software. The model was validated using a simulated and actual LULC of 2015. The overall agreement between the two maps was 0.98 (98\%) with a simulation error of 0.03 (3.0\%). The more detailed analysis of validation results based on the kappa variations showed a satisfactory level of accuracy with a K-no, K-standard and K-location of 0.97, 0.95 and 0.97, respectively. The future projections indicate that water bodies, barren land and built-up areas will increase while agricultural land, wetlands and forest land will substantially decrease by 2025 and 2035 respectively. According to the transition probability matrix, almost 94.8\%, 97.6\% and 95.7\% of water bodies, agricultural land and barren land will more likely remain stable by 2025. In contrast, forest land exhibits the highest probability of change of 64.8\% and 85.9\% by 2025 and 2035 respectively. Results also indicate that the majority of the forest areas will be converted to barren land with a probability of 60.8\% and 79.6\% by 2025 and 2035, respectively. These findings serve as an important benchmark for planners, natural resource managers and policy-makers in the studied landscape to consider in pursuit of holistic sustainable development policies/strategies/guidelines for sustainable natural resource management.","{""Adeola, A."",""Botai, J."",""Davis, N."",""Munthali, M.

Geospatial Tools Address Emerging Issues In Spatial Ecology: A Review And Commentary On The Special Issue,"Spatial ecology focuses on the role of space and time in ecological processes and events from a local to a global scale and is particularly relevant in developing environmental policy and (mandated) monitoring goals. In other words, spatial ecology is where geography and ecology intersect, and high-quality geospatial data and analysis tools are required to address emerging issues in spatial ecology. In this commentary and review for the International Journal of GIS Special Issue on Spatial Ecology, we highlight selected current research priorities in spatial ecology and describe geospatial data and methods for addressing these tasks. Geoinformation research themes are identified in population ecology, community and landscape ecology, and ecosystem ecology, and these themes are further linked to the assessment of ecosystem services. Methods in spatial ecology benefit from explicit consideration of spatial autocorrelation, and applications discussed in this review include species distribution modeling, remote sensing of community and ecosystem properties, and models of climate change. The linkages of the Special Issue papers to these emerging issues are described.","{""Dawson, Terry P."",""Franklin, Janet"",""Pilesjo, Petter"",""Skidmore, Andrew K.""}",skidmore_geospatialtoolsaddressemerging_2011,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Mapping Winter-Wheat Biomass And Grain Yield Based On A Crop Model And Uav Remote Sensing,"Timely and accurately estimates of crop biomass and grain yield estimation are crucial for agricultural management. Optical remote sensing techniques can provide crop parameters (e.g., biomass, fractional vegetation cover (FVC)) at regional and larger scales. However, such techniques saturate at high crop canopy cover and cannot detect biomass stored in reproductive organs. The AquaCrop model can be used to estimate FVC, biomass, and grain yield output based on crop growth environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, rainfall, irrigation). In this work, we developed a method for estimating and mapping crop biomass and grain yield using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images and AquaCrop. The combination of low-cost UAV remote sensing data and AquaCrop can be used to map wheat biomass and grain yield before harvest. This work investigated whether biomass and grain yield can be predicted using measurements of biomass and FVC in several winter-wheat fields at an early growing stage using ground-based and remote sensing-based methods. FVC, biomass, and grain yield were measured at several key growing stages (jointing (S1), heading (S2), flowering (S3), grain filling (S4)) and harvest (H) during 2014-2015. We specifically evaluated the performances of using field- and UAV-based FVC and biomass measurements from different growing-stage combinations (e.g., S1-S4, S1-S3, and S1-S2) to calibrate the AquaCrop model and estimate biomass and grain yield. The results indicate that winter-wheat biomass and grain yield can be estimated by calibrating AquaCrop using (i) biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results also reveal that the biomass and grain yield estimated using FVC and AquaCrop have poor accuracy compared with the biomass and grain yield estimated using (i) only biomass and (ii) biomass and FVC. The results suggest that the combined use of UAV remote sensing and AquaCrop can be used to obtain maps of biomass and biomass yield. When estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one month (13 May) before harvest (11 June), the predicted biomass and grain yield agreed with the measured values (biomass: n = 96, coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.61, mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.69 t ha(-1), root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 2.10 t ha(-1), normalized RMSE (nRMSE) = 18.5\%; grain yield: n = 48, R (2) = 0.63, MAE = 0.96 t ha(-1), RMSE = 1.16 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 21.9\%). When estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one and a half months (26 April) before harvest (11 June), the predicted biomass and grain yield was lower than when estimating winter-wheat biomass and grain yield one month before harvest (biomass: n = 144, R (2) = 0.55, MAE = 2.52 t ha(-1), RMSE = 3.34 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 23.6\%; grain yield: n = 48, R (2) = 0.34, MAE = 1.68 t ha(-1), RMSE = 2.17 t ha(-1), nRMSE = 35.7\%).","{""Feng, Haikuan"",""Li, Zhenhai"",""Xu, Kaijian"",""Yue, Jibo"",""Zhou, Chengquan""}",yue_mappingwinterwheatbiomass_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Geospatial-Based Soil Management Analysis Using Novel Technique For Better Soil Conservation,"In the current times, anthropogenic activities and natural change in the processes cause much change in the world, causing multiple hazards and disturbing the natural flow. One such hazard is soil erosion, which is increasing day by day due to changes in climate and anthropogenic activities. Thus, identifying the soil erosion vulnerable zones and map such regions is extremely useful for the town and land planning. Such soil vulnerability mapping gives a quantifiable and reliable method to evaluate soil erosion in a wide variety of circumstances. In the current research, the soil erosion method, revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system (GIS), has been applied for soil erosion approximation in the Rawalpindi Tehsil situated in the province of Punjab in the northeast part of Pakistan. The Rawalpindi metropolis is a semi-arid area with a drainage area of 259 km(2) up to the gauging station. The datasets of the RUSLE model were valued from the remote sensing data, and the probable soil loss regions were estimated with the help of GIS. All the datasets, i.e., slope, soil, precipitation, crop management factor, was then used for soil erosion potential mapping. The potential map is generated from the weighted overlay method that gives an output showing that most of the study area is in medium (67.2\%) to high (20.2\%) erosion zone with erosion intensities of < 20 tons ha(-1) year(-1) and < 40 tons ha(-1) year(-1) respectively. Concurrently, few patches lie in high potential zones that need to be looked after and need to be pondered in terms of mitigation measures. Accuracy assessment for land-use and land-cover classes for the Rawalpindi watershed was also accomplished by comparing ground-truth with satellite data, and the Kappa coefficient of the agreement was also obtained. The overall accuracy was 85\%, and the Kappa coefficient was found to be 84\%, inferring the acceptability of results. Few mitigation solutions have also been described in this study, which might be helpful to minimize erosion. This research provides a positive impact on the execution of soil management and preservation practices to lessen the erosion of the soil in the Tehsil Rawalpindi.","{""Aslam, Bilal"",""Khalil, Umer""}",khalil_geospatialbasedsoilmanagement_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Enhancing The Farm Bill's Conservation Potential Through Land Prioritization,"The Farm Bill conservation programs serve as the primary tools for the creation and improvement of wildlife habitat on working lands. Wildlife conservation would benefit from a working land-prioritization system that integrates these programs. We developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)based system to prioritize land for inclusion in Farm Bill conservation programs. We designed the system to be applicable throughout the United States, to minimize potential conflicts of interest, and to facilitate simple implementation. We designated high conservation value (HCV) lands using habitats of greatest conservation need. We placed priority zones around HCV lands to determine high- and low-priority working lands. Nationwide implementation of this system would require gathering and manipulating data from multiple sources, as well as creation of a GIS layer denoting locations of working lands currently in conservation programs. This system would allow funding to be maximized through the ability to select participation based on property location and size, and to target landowners for participation. The wide-ranging potential benefits of this system make it well-suited for serving as the backbone to conservation on working lands.","{""Baccus, J. T."",""Brown, D. J."",""Connolly, A.

Guiding Decisions On The Future Of Dams: A Gis Database Characterizing Ecological And Social Considerations Of Dam Decisions,"In the United States and elsewhere, there are a growing number of dams which have exceeded their design life and will need to be repaired or removed in the coming decades. Most of these dams no longer serve their original purpose and removal can provide ecological benefits and eliminate future maintenance costs and hazards. However, many decision-makers have been ill-prepared by community resistance to proposals to remove dams. Given the number of dam removal initiatives that have failed or been delayed due to community resistance, both ecological and social attributes of dams need to be better mapped and conveyed in understandable ways. The goal of this study was to support future decisions regarding dams by 1) developing a set of metrics to assess the social and ecological dimensions of dams, and 2) using these metrics to develop a GIS database, for the 1000+ dams in the Narragansett Bay/Rhode Island area of southern New England. The database characterizes the ecological benefits of dam removal or modification, in terms of fish passage, and the social dimensions that may need to be considered when engaging a community in discussions about the future of a dam. Our emphasis was on small-head dams (i.e. <5 m tall) which comprise most dams in the study area. We created social value metrics that used GIS data to assess dams and their impoundments for potential benefits to waterfront properties, history, sense-of-place, and recreation. We modeled our ecological metrics and ranking system after the Nature Conservancy's Northeast Aquatic Connectivity study which considered factors relating to river connectivity and watershed quality. We evaluated our social and ecological metrics using case studies of dams in the study area that had been previously removed or modified. We assumed that both sets of dams were ecologically important, but the modified dams had higher social value that prohibited their removal. Dams that had been removed or modified were both ranked as high priority in terms of value for fish passage, particularly for diadromous fish. Dams that were modified to include fish passage had substantially larger impoundments, more waterfront properties, and more features associated with recreational or cultural value (e.g. boating opportunity, visibility, etc.). Our social metrics were consistent with expectations based on the limited case studies (7 removals, 19 modifications) available in the study area. We made the dam assessment metrics readily accessible to stakeholders through an interactive ArcGIS Online web map. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd","{""Gold, A. J."",""Lowder, K. A."",""Parent, J.

Optimization Of Vehicle Automatic Navigation Path Based On Remote Sensing And Gis,"Objective: Taking a general view of the continuous convenience of modern social life, according to the rapid development of traffic network and communication network, this paper studies the vehicle path optimization problem. Methods: This paper attempts to design a set of optimal vehicle path from the five aspects of algorithm development stage, algorithm solution idea, data storage mode, analysis data format and algorithm search strategy. According to the relevant theory of urban vehicle path, a mathematical model of vehicle path problem with time window restriction is constructed. Aiming at this model, a{*}, hierarchical algorithm, ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm are used Line analysis and discussion, and according to the relevant algorithm examples in the literature to verify the model and algorithm. Result: It is concluded that the combination of a{*}, ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm is more suitable for the optimization of vehicle routing, and the hierarchical algorithm, road quality, congestion and other real-time traffic obstacles are improved to establish the vehicle routing optimization system in the traffic network and communication network. During the experiment, five road networks of different sizes were used successively. The modulus of these road networks increased sequentially, and the ratio of the number of road sections to the number of road network nodes was about 1698.

Cost-Effectiveness Of Emissions Reduction Through Vehicle Repair Compared To Cng Conversion,"In return for a temporary waiver from converting five vehicles to operate on compressed natural gas (CNG) for the Denver Clean Fuels program, the University of Denver identified, tested, repaired, and retested nine employee commuter vehicles. The results of the study validated the concept that employer-based identification and repair programs can be carried out in a cost-effective way. On average, each repaired vehicle removed fifty times more carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from Denver air than each CNG conversion. The average cost of each repair was eight times less than the average cost of each conversion. The average fuel economy benefit from the repairs was enough to pay for the average cost of repairs in less than three years of normal driving. When the expected lifetimes of repairs and conversions are included, the targeted repair program appears to be over sixty times more cost-effective as a CO emissions reduction strategy than CNG conversion.

Meteorological Satellite Stakeholder Relationship Network Based On Social Network Analysis,"The meteorological satellite service range is extensive, and science and technology and related industries have become beneficiaries of it. The complex meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship warrants quantitative evaluation. This study investigates the meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network to provide a new research perspective for meteorological satellites in the field of management. For literature analysis, 16 meteorological satellite stakeholders are identified through keyword screening, classified, and coded. A meteorological satellite stakeholder relationship network model is then constructed through social network analysis (SNA). Ego, local, and overall networks are analyzed from three perspectives to measure the network principle and to form a relationship network coordination degree evaluation system. The improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is then used to determine index weights and evaluate the relationship network coordination process design comprehensively. In empirical analysis, data for the meteorological satellite Fengyun-4 are obtained through questionnaire survey and literature analysis. Ucinet6 is used to generate relationship networks and analyze various stakeholder roles and status, stakeholder relationship network coordination degree, and evaluation results. The results demonstrate that the competent meteorological satellite department, the meteorological administration, the National Meteorological Centre, and the government are in the center of the Fengyun-4 stakeholder relationship network, with coordination degree in an ""average"" state. Thus, establishing a stakeholder coordination mechanism may strengthen connection and promote the development of meteorological undertakings.","{""He Kongxin"",""Li Lu"",""Liu Yupeng""}",liluandliuyupengandhekongxin_meteorologicalsatellitestakeholderrelationship_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Place-Based Landscape Services And Potential Of Participatory Spatial Planning In Multifunctional Rural Landscapes In Southern Highlands, Tanzania","Context: Local scale assessments of ecosystem/landscape services in Africa are insufficient and lack relevance in landscape management. Also, few studies have explored the potential benefits of PGIS/PPGIS approaches for landscape management and stewardship among the participating stakeholders. Objectives: Our aim is (1) to establish an understanding of the realization of landscape services at the local scale across three multifunctional rural landscapes in Tanzania through PGIS/PPGIS approaches and (2) to create an understanding of these approachesâ€™ potential to support participatory spatial planning. Methods: Semi-structured surveys (n = 313) including participatory mapping of provisioning and cultural landscape services were organised to characterise their spatial patterns. The survey results were shared with the communities (n = 97) in workshops where services were ranked and the participants interviewed about their map-reading capacity, personal learning experiences, and their ability to use maps to express opinions. Results: The most abundant landscape services are sites for social gatherings and cultivation. The spatial patterns of provisioning services are realizations of human benefits from the patterns of the biophysical landscape. Overall, cultural landscape services show clustering and small spatial extent (except aesthetics). The PGIS/PPGIS approach allows for local-level, spatially specific discussions between stakeholders. The visual power of maps and satellite images is particularly emphasised. Conclusion: In the data-scarce context common in the Global South, the participatory mapping of landscape services has the potential to advance understanding of the benefits that the landscape has for the local communities and how this information, when mapped spatially, can be integrated with local-level planning practices.

"Flood Hazard Assessment In Large Plain Basins With A Scarce Slope In The Pampean Plain, Argentina","Floods are one of the most common natural phenomena and represent a serious hazard when they affect human activities. Structural measures are commonly used to mitigate them; however, these do not always give good results, mainly in plain areas with scarce slope. In this sense, the generation of a flood hazard map contributes to adequate hazard management and disaster prevention. The aim of this work is to evaluate the flood hazard areas in hydrological plain basins with scarce slope, taking as a case study the Samborombon river basin located in the Pampean Plain, Argentina. For this, a flood hazard map was made based on the analytical hierarchy process and using a GIS, taking into account physical aspects of the terrain, observations, and field measurements. Likewise, the map was validated using satellite images and the inhabitants in danger in the basin were quantified. The results show that the flood hazard areas correspond mainly to the floodplain of rivers and tributaries, while the main and secondary divide zones have low flood hazard sectors. On the other hand, numerous urban settlements were identified within flood hazard areas, these being urban settlements in the vicinity of old urban centers and new gated communities with high value homes, quantifying 1961 inhabitants at flood hazard and showing poor territorial planning. The methodology proposed gives to the management agencies the possibility of generating land use maps, as well as designing mitigation and contingency plans after a large rainfall event.","{""Borzi, Guido"",""Carol, Eleonora"",""Roig, Alejandro"",""Santucci, Lucia"",""Tanjal, Carolina"",""Tejada Tejada, Macarena""}",borzi_floodhazardassessmentplain_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Soft Classification Of Mixed Seabed Objects Based On Fuzzy Clustering Analysis Using Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Data,"Coastal seabed mapping is essential for a variety of nearshore management related activities including sustainable resource management, ecological protection, and environmental change detection in coastal sites. Recently introduced airborne LIDAR bathymetry (ALB) sensors allow, under favorable environmental conditions and mapping requirements, time and cost efficient collection of shallow coastal seabed data in comparison to acoustic techniques. One important application of these sensors, given ALB seabed footprint size on the order to several meters in diameter for shallow waters, is the development of seabed classification maps and techniques to classify both benthic species and seabed sediment. The coastal seabed is a complex environment consisting of diverse habitats and, thus, necessitates classification methods which readily account for seabed class heterogeneity. Recent ALB classification studies have relied on classification techniques that assign each ALB shot to a single seabed class (i.e., hard classification) instead of allowing for assignment to multiple seabed classes which may be present in an illuminated ALB footprint (i.e., soft classification). In this study, a soft seabed classification (SSC) algorithm is developed using unsupervised classification with fuzzy clustering to produce classification products accounting for a sub-footprint habitat mixture. With this approach, each shot is assigned to multiple seabed classes with a percentage cover measuring the extent to which each seabed class is present in the ALB footprint. This has the added benefit of generating smooth spatial ecological transitions of the seabed instead of sharp boundaries between classes or clusters. Furthermore, due to the multivariate nature of the SSC output (i.e., percentage cover for each seabed class for a given shot), a recently developed self-organizing map neural network-based approach to geo-visualization of seabed classification results was used to visualize seabed habitat diversity. An ALB dataset of an area approximately 20000 m(2) collected from Quebec, Canada was used. Cross-validation of the SSC approach yields percentage cover accuracy of approximately 71.7\% with 16 seabed classes for a real ALB dataset, while dominant seabed class prediction based on hardening of percentage cover predictions yielded 66\% accuracy for 4 seabed classes.

Modelling Of Stream Run-Off And Sediment Output For Erosion Hazard Assessment In Lesser Himalaya: Need For Sustainable Land Use Plan Using Remote Sensing And Gis: A Case Study,"Assessment and inventory on soil erosion hazard are essential for the formulation of successful hazard mitigation plans and sustainable development. The objective of this study was to assess and map soil erosion hazard in Lesser Himalaya with a case study. The Dabka watershed constitutes a part of the Kosi Basin in the Lesser Himalaya, India, in district Nainital has been selected for the case illustration. The average rate of erosion hazard is 0. 68 mm/year or 224 tons/km2/year. Anthropogenic and geo-environmental factors have together significantly accelerated the rate of erosion. This reconnaissance study estimates the erosion rate over the period of 3 years (2006-2008) as 1.21 mm/year (398 tons/km2/year) in the barren land having geological background of diamictite, siltstone and shale rocks, 0.92 mm/year (302 tons/km2/year) in the agricultural land with lithology of diamictite, slates, siltstone, limestone rocks, while in the forest land, it varies between 0. 20 mm/year (66 tons/km2/year) under dense forest land having the geology of quartzwacke and quartrenite rocks and 0.40 mm/year (132 tons/km2/year) under open forest/shrubs land having geological setup of shale, dolomite and gypsum rocks. Compared to the intensity of erosion in the least disturbed dense forest, the erosion rate is about 5-6 times higher in the most disturbed agricultural land and barren land, respectively. The erosion hazard zones delineated following scalogram modelling approach. Integrated scalogram modelling approach resulted in severe classes of soil erosion hazard in the study area with numerical values of Erosion Hazard Index (EHI) ranging between 01 (very low hazard) and 5 (very high hazard).

An Assessment Of The Use Of Remote Sensing To Map Habitat Features Important To Sustaining Lamprey Populations,"1. This study describes the use of colour aerial photography and Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) multispectral imagery (420-1050 nm) to map gravel-bed river habitats important to Sustaining river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis)-an aquatic species with high conservation interest in Europe. The accuracy of the remote sensing approach wits assessed by comparing the Output from automated mapping of physical habitat features using image analysis and GIS and habitat maps derived from field Survey. 2. Unsupervised classification of the aerial photography and ATM imagery mapped hydraulic habitat such as pools and riffles with overall accuracies of 57\% and 65.5\%, respectively. Submerged sand and silt deposits, which are important to river lamprey ammocoetes could not be identified on the imagery by simple unsupervised or Supervised classification. They Could be mapped indirectly, however, by association between their presence and morphological attributes such as backwaters and embayments in the bank profile detectable on the imagery. Remotely determining the likely presence and location of lamprey ammocoete habitat can be useful in planning detailed electrofishing campaigns to estimate lamprey densities, to assess conservation status and any change over time, and to determine the need for restoration strategies. 3. The results suggest that on rivers wider than 20m without a continuous wooded riparian fringe, and where there is good quality imagery, it is possible to automate mapping of physical habitat features; important to many river species with high nature conservation interest. As a result organizations charged with monitoring and conserving river species should consider investing in airborne imagery covering river sytems of high conservation value.

"Surface Coal Mining Impacts On Land Use Change And Ecological Service Value: A Case Study In Shengli Coalfield, Inner Mongolia","Coal plays a crucial role in global economic development and remains the most common and widely distributed fossil fuel worldwide. As the world's largest developing country, China's mining and utilization of coal resources have contributed significantly to the countryâ€™s rapid economic growth. Inner Mongolia is an ecologically fragile arid and semi-arid area of China. The exploitation of opencast mining has seriously hindered the sustainable use of regional land and the residents' well-being. Using ENVI-based remote sensing images from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, this study employed a random forest algorithm to divide land utilization types into construction land, vegetation, cultivated land, bare land, and water areas and analyzed the characteristics of land use and ecosystem service value changes over the past 20Â years. The results were as follows: (1) Construction land in the mining area changed minimally from 2000 to 2020; vegetation and water bodies showed a decreasing trend, whereas bare and cultivated lands showed an increasing trend. Bare land exhibited the largest change in area proportion and water bodies the smallest. (2) The total ecosystem service value of the mining area declined from 10.939 to 9.527 billion Yuan. Vegetation ecosystem service value was the highest, followed by cultivated land and water, with the bare land ecosystem service value the lowest. (3) On a spatial scale, the total ecosystem service value of the Shengli mining area decreased year by year, indicating that land use changes in the mining area do have an impact on ecosystem service value.

"A Geospatial Analysis For An Integrated Land Use And Water Strategy For Bagmati River In Kathmandu Valley, Nepal","Bagmati River in Kathmandu Valley is one of the most important and revered rivers in Nepal. However, it is the most polluted river in the country. The discharge of raw wastewater in the river, the dumping of garbage at the riverbanks, missing regulations of proper disposal and a lack of education of the population are resulting in an unsatisfactory condition of the river. Community involvement is not planned in the current state of the management strategy. This chapter is an assessment of the current state of Bagmati River based on three indicators: the role of local stakeholders in the management system, water quality and the role of water in the urban dynamics. On the basis of 240 household surveys we identified the income and financial reserves of the locals and the religious and cultural values. These aspects play a significant role in implementing new adaptions of technologies and in implementing new rules and guidelines. The spatial analysis was conducted with the use of GIS and remote sensing through updating the land use plan that was the basis for an interactive map enhanced by a photographic record built on site. The map facilitated us to locate 10 sampling sites along the stretch of Bagmati River and its main tributaries, where water samples were extracted. The samples were examined under physico-chemical, chemical and biochemical water quality parameters. The contrast of the land use map and the lab results enabled us to see the impact of the different urban land uses and urban activities on the water quality. The results reveal that the water quality of Bagmati River is currently extremely low and in urgent need of interventions from all types of stakeholders, for which we provide recommendations.

"Multi-Temporal Analysis Of Land Use. Valley Lo Campino, Quilicura","The present investigation deals with the change of land cover through a multitemporal analysis between the years 1998-2018, in the commune of Quilicura, Metropolitan Region, in an area called Valle Lo Campino, defined by Cerro Renca and its foothills. For this purpose, a supervised classification was carried out in five-year periods based on satellite images, Google Earth support and the land use thematic classification established by the National Forest Corporation in 2011. From this, it was determined qualitatively and quantitatively change the territory according to thematic cartography and a confusion matrix. In addition, the population increase was determined based on data published for 2017 by the Statistics Institute of Chile and the determination of potential vehicular load established in the field, with the support of sample units. Overall, the analysis is the basis for road identification and improvement of the area and its connectivity to structuring routes, from the perspective of objective image, with the support of methodologies and inputs from geomatics, topographic concepts, the projection of new alternatives vials and ground support. At the same time, a landscape proposal is proposed that enhances the geographical characteristics and the landscape value, obtained from the environmental assessment guide presented by the Environmental Impact Assessment Service and the nature of Cerro Renca island within the Metropolitan Region.

Assessment Of Mangrove Response To Projected Relative Sea-Level Rise And Recent Historical Reconstruction Of Shoreline Position,"We predict the decadal change in position of three American Samoa mangroves from analysis of a time series of remotely sensed imagery, a geographic information system, tide gauge data, and projections for change in sea-level relative to the mangrove surface. Accurate predictions of changes to coastal ecosystem boundaries, including in response to projected relative sea-level rise, enable advanced planning to minimize and offset anticipated losses and minimize social disruption and cost of reducing threats to coastal development and human safety. The observed mean landward migration of three mangroves' seaward margins over four decades was 25, 64, and 72 mma-1, 12 to 37 times the observed relative sea-level rise rate. Two of the sites had clear trends in reductions in mangrove area, where there was a highly significant correlation between the change in position of the seaward mangrove margin and change in relative sea-level. Here it can be inferred that the force of sea-level rise relative to the mangrove surface is causing landward migration. Shoreline movement was variable at a third site and not significantly correlated with changing sea-level, where it is likely that forces other than change in relative sea-level are predominant. Currently, 16.5%, 23.4%, and 68.0% of the three mangroves' landward margins are obstructed by coastal development from natural landward migration. The three mangroves could experience as high as a 50.0% reduction in area by the year 2100. A 12% reduction in mangrove area by the year 2100 is possible in the Pacific islands region.

A Remote Sensing-Based Approach To Estimating Montado Canopy Density Using The Fcd Model: A Contribution To Identifying Hnv Farmlands In Southern Portugal,"Mapping the land-cover pattern dominated by complex Mediterranean silvo-pastoral systems with an accuracy that enables precise monitoring of changing tree-cover density is still an open challenge. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the Forest Canopy Density (FCD) model in producing a remote sensing-based and detailed map of montado canopy density over a large territory in southern Portugal. This map will make a fundamental contribution to accurately identifying and assessing High Nature Value farmland in montado areas. The results reveal that the FCD model is an effective approach to estimating the density classes of montado canopy (overall accuracy = 78.0 \%, kappa value = 0.71). The study also shows that the FCD approach generated good user's and producer's accuracies for the three montado canopy-density classes. Globally, the results obtained show that biophysical indices such as the advanced vegetation index, the bare soil index, the shadow index and the thermal index are suitable for estimating and mapping montado canopy-density classes. These results constitute the first remote sensing-based product for mapping montado canopy density that has been developed using the FCD model. This research clearly demonstrates that this approach can be used in the context of Mediterranean agro-forestry systems.","{""Gil, Artur"",""Godinho, Sergio"",""Guiomar, Nuno"",""Neves, Nuno"",""Pinto-Correia, Teresa""}",godinho_remotesensingbasedapproach_2016,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Conflicts Of Interest And Emissions From Land Conversions: State Of New Jersey As A Case Study,"Conflicts of interest (COI) are an integral part of human society, including their influence on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. Individuals or entities often have multiple interests ranging from financial benefits to reducing climate change-related risks, where choosing one interest may negatively impact other interests and societal welfare. These types of COI require specific management strategies. This study examines COI from land-use decisions as an intersection of different perspectives on land use (e.g., land conservation versus land development), which can have various consequences regarding GHG emissions. This study uses the state of New Jersey (NJ) in the United States of America (USA) as a case study to demonstrate COI related to soil-based GHG emissions from land conversions between 2001 and 2016 which caused $722.2M (where M = million = 106) worth of â€œrealizedâ€ social costs of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) emissions. These emissions are currently not accounted for in NJâ€™s total carbon footprint (CF), which can negatively impact the stateâ€™s ability to reach its carbon reduction goals. The state of NJ Statutes Annotated 26:2C-37 (2007): Global Warming Response Act (GWRA) (updated in 2019) set a statewide goal of reducing GHG emissions to 80 percent below 2006 levels by 2050. Remote sensing and soil data analysis allow temporal and quantitative assessment of the contribution of land cover conversions to NJâ€™s CF by soil carbon type, soil type, land cover type, and administrative units (state, counties), which helps document past, and estimate future related GHG emissions using a land cover change scenario to calculate the amount of GHG emissions if an area of land was to be developed. Decisions related to future land conversions involve potential COI within and outside state administrative structures, which could be managed by a conflict-of-interest policy. The site and time-specific disclosures of GHG emissions from land conversions can help governments manage these COI to mitigate climate change impacts and costs by assigning financial responsibility for specific CF contributions. Projected sea-level rise will impact 16 out of 21 NJâ€™s counties and it will likely reach coastal areas with densely populated urban areas throughout NJ. Low proportion of available public land limits opportunities for relocation. Increased climate-change-related damages in NJ and elsewhere will increase the number of climate litigation cases to alleviate costs associated with climate change. This litigation will further highlight the importance and intensity of different COI. Â© 2022 by the authors.","{""Hao, Z."",""Lin, L."",""Mikhailova, E. A."",""Post, C. J."",""Post, G.

Multi-Variant Decision Support E-System For Device And Knowledge Based Intelligent Residential Environment,"Intelligent housing is a novelty in Lithuania yet. Such housing is not popular in our country. Specialists of automation claim that such situation occured not only because people lack knowledge but also because the concept of intelligent housing is interpreted erroneously (most people think that remotely controled door of garage, for instance, makes their housing intelligent). Intelligent helpers started to emerge in households only recently. Intelligent ambient assisted enviornment model, created by authors, helps to evaluate intelligent ambient assisted environment by social, cultural, political, legal, economical, technological and environmental factor analysis. Basing on this model also ambient assisted environment supply and demand as well as various criteria evaluation, the system able to select the best intelligent devices alternatives accordingly to each family needs was created. Through analysis of separate parts of an existing household, it is possible to distinguish intellingent devices that I study, ie intelligent lock, intelligent robot-cleaner, intelligent infant respiratory monitor, intelligent sentinel and intelligent keyboard. Users of intelligent devices are families of young people, who want to save time and who appreciate convenience and innovations. Advantages and benefits of devices used by families of young people are being analysed. In order to provide the best guarantee for rational selection of variants of intelligent devices, decisions must be based on the system of criteria which describes variants of intelligent devices, the decision support system must reflect consumer requirements to the best possible extent, and the data provided in the system must be real and updated easily. Computer and internet technologies, multi-variant evaluation methods as well as principles and requirements applicable to favourable residential environment are combined to achieve the goal.","{""Gulbinas, Andrius"",""Kaklauskas, Arturas"",""Naimaviciene, Jurga""}",naimaviciene_multivariantdecisionsupport_2007,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Optimization Of Soil Background Removal To Improve The Prediction Of Wheat Traits With Uav Imagery,"Grain yield and quality assessment based on remote sensing throughout the growth cycle may contribute to achieve efficient and sustainable wheat production. A trial was conducted to test the suitability of a multispectral sensor onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate yield, protein content, and nitrogen (N) output in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Furthermore, a method to improve predictions of wheat traits was proposed by sequentially removing soil pixels from the distribution of vegetation index (VI) values. The experimental area, located at Aranjuez (Madrid, Spain), was divided into four sectors with 133 plots in total. Different N doses were applied to the plots to create high experimental intravariability. In each plot, wheat traits were measured at harvest. An (UAV) was flown at growth stages (GS) â€“ GS32, GS39, and GS65 â€“ to ensure correct monitoring of the crop. Four VIs, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) and Blue-Red Index (BRI1) were selected based on the sensor spectral information and their suitability for estimating wheat traits. A sequential cutting method (threshold value optimization, TVO) was implemented to remove soil background pixels, based on threshold values computed from the VIs distributions. Then, the predictive performance of the VIs in each segmentation was evaluated. Our results indicated that NDVI, MSAVI, and NDRE were able to predict the wheat traits using sensors onboard a UAV. We proposed optimal thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 depending on the VI and the wheat trait. The TVO method showed an improvement in yield and N output estimation at the stem elongation growth stage (GS32). However, the TVO method achieved a limited improvement in estimating protein content at anthesis (GS65). Overall, our results suggest (a) that soil background reflectance is an essential element of UAV imagery that introduces uncertainty in the estimation of grain yield and quality based on VIs, and (b) that TVO may mitigate the soil effect.

Assessment Of Desertification In Eritrea: Land Degradation Based On Landsat Images,"Remote sensing is an effective way in monitoring desertification dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, we used a decision tree method based on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SAVI (soil adjusted vegetation index), and vegetation cover proportion to quantify and analyze the desertification in Eritrea using Landsat data of the 1970s, 1980s and 2014. The results demonstrate that the NDVI value and the annual mean precipitation declined while the temperature increased over the past 40 a. Strongly desertified land increased from 4.82Ã—104 km2 (38.5%) in the 1970s to 8.38Ã—104 km2 (66.9%) in 2014: approximately 85% of the land of the country was under serious desertification, which significantly occurred in arid and semi-arid lowlands of the country (eastern, northern, and western lowlands) with relatively scarce precipitation and high temperature. The non-desertified area, mostly located in the sub-humid eastern escarpment, also declined from approximately 2.1% to 0.5%. The study concludes that the desertification is a cause of serious land degradation in Eritrea and may link to climate changes, such as low and unpredictable precipitation, and prolonged drought.

Evolution Of Do-It-Yourself Remote Monitoring Technology For Type 1 Diabetes,"Background: The Nightscout Project is a leading example of patient-designed, do-it-yourself (DIY), open-source technology innovations to support type 1 diabetes management. We are unaware of studies that have described the evolution of patient-driven innovations from the Nightscout Project to date. Methods: We identified patient-driven, DIY innovations from posts and comments in the â€œCGM in the Cloudâ€ private Facebook group as well as data from Twitter, GitHub, and the Nightscout website. For each innovation, we described its intent or its unaddressed need as well as the associated features and improvements. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify overarching patterns among the innovations, features, and improvements, and compared the timeline of innovations in the DIY space with the timing of similar innovations in the commercial space. Results: We identified and categorized innovations in Nightscout with the most commonly appearing themes of: visualization improvements, equipment improvements, and user experience improvements. Other emerging themes included: Care Portal support, safety, remote monitoring, decision support, international support, artificial pancreas, pushover notifications, and open-source collaboration. Conclusions: This rapid development of patient-designed DIY innovations driven by unmet needs in the type 1 diabetes community reflects a revolutionary, bottomâ€“up approach to medical innovation. Nightscout users accessed features earlier than if they had waited for commercial products, and they also personalized their tools and devices, empowering them to become the experts of their own care.

"Coupling Relationship Between Ecosystem Service Value And Socioeconomic Development In The Qinba Mountains, China","The degree of coordination between ecosystem services and the level of socioeconomic development has essential implications for regional sustainability. The coordinated development of ecology and economy is a major theoretical and practical problem for the Qinba Mountains, which is once one of the 14 contiguous destitute areas in China. Based on the land use and cover change (LUCC) data interpreted by medium-resolution remote sensing images, this study adopted the modified equivalent factor method to calculate ecosystem service value (ESV) and its temporal and spatial variation in the Qinba Mountains. A comprehensive index system was constructed to measure the socioeconomic development level and to reveal the coupling relationship between the ESV and socioeconomic development. The results show that: (1) for 2000-2015, the ESV in these areas was increasing, the proportion of forest ESV was the largest, and it increased significantly. (2) The level of socioeconomic development was constantly improving, and the differences within the region were gradually emerging. (3) Except for the Hantai District, which has been in a highly uncoordinated state, the degree of coordination between ESV and socioeconomic development has improved year by year, and most counties were in a state of medium coordination, or above.

The developed system has been used to identify potential sites for water harvesting in the Song watershed, India. Basic input layers required for this study such as a digital elevation model, landuse, soils, drainage, geology, and buffer map for utility points were generated in a geographic information system (GIS). Technical guidelines suggested by the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD), and the Indian National Committee on Hydrology (INCOH), have been used as decision rules in the knowledge base shell of the developed SESS. Monthly water balance has been estimated using remote sensing and GIS techniques to augment the proposed water harvesting structures. The knowledge base can suitably be modified as and when required on the basis of other expert knowledge if found more judicious in this present context.

"People, Pollution And Pathogens - Global Change Impacts In Mountain Freshwater Ecosystems","Mountain catchments provide for the livelihood of more than half of humankind, and have become a key destination for tourist and recreation activities globally. Mountain ecosystems are generally considered to be less complex and less species diverse due to the harsh environmental conditions. As such, they are also more sensitive to the various impacts of the Anthropocene. For this reason, mountain regions may serve as sentinels of change and provide ideal ecosystems for studying climate and global change impacts on biodiversity. We here review different facets of anthropogenic impacts on mountain freshwater ecosystems. We put particular focus on micropollutants and their distribution and redistribution due to hydrological extremes, their direct influence on water quality and their indirect influence on ecosystem health via changes of freshwater species and their interactions. We show that those changes may drive pathogen establishment in new environments with harmful consequences for freshwater species, but also for the human population. Based on the reviewed literature, we recommend reconstructing the recent past of anthropogenic impact through sediment analyses, to focus efforts on small, but highly productive waterbodies, and to collect data on the occurrence and variability of microorganisms, biofilms, plankton species and key species, such as amphibians due to their bioindicator value for ecosystem health and water quality. The newly gained knowledge can then be used to develop a comprehensive framework of indicators to robustly inform policy and decision making on current and future risks for ecosystem health and human well-being.

Forest-Scale Phenotyping: Productivity Characterisation Through Machine Learning,"Advances in remote sensing combined with the emergence of sophisticated methods for large-scale data analytics from the field of data science provide new methods to model complex interactions in biological systems. Using a data-driven philosophy, insights from experts are used to corroborate the results generated through analytical models instead of leading the model design. Following such an approach, this study outlines the development and implementation of a whole-of-forest phenotyping system that incorporates spatial estimates of productivity across a large plantation forest. In large-scale plantation forestry, improving the productivity and consistency of future forests is an important but challenging goal due to the multiple interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, the long breeding cycle, and the high variability of growing conditions. Forest phenotypic expression is highly affected by the interaction of environmental conditions and forest management but the understanding of this complex dynamics is incomplete. In this study, we collected an extensive set of 2.7 million observations composed of 62 variables describing climate, forest management, tree genetics, and fine-scale terrain information extracted from environmental surfaces, management records, and remotely sensed data. Using three machine learning methods, we compared models of forest productivity and evaluate the gain and Shapley values for interpreting the influence of categorical variables on the power of these methods to predict forest productivity at a landscape level. The most accurate model identified that the most important drivers of productivity were, in order of importance, genetics, environmental conditions, leaf area index, topology, and soil properties, thus describing the complex interactions of the forest. This approach demonstrates that new methods in remote sensing and data science enable powerful, landscape-level understanding of forest productivity. The phenotyping method developed here can be used to identify superior and inferior genotypes and estimate a productivity index for individual site. This approach can improve tree breeding and deployment of the right genetics to the right site in order to increase the overall productivity across planted forests.","{""Bombrun, Maxime"",""Dash, Jonathan P."",""Dungey, Heidi S."",""Pearse, Grant D."",""Pont, David"",""Watt, Michael S.""}",bombrun_forestscalephenotypingproductivity_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Holidays In Lights: Tracking Cultural Patterns In Demand For Energy Services,"Successful climate change mitigation will involve not only technological innovation, but also innovation in how we understand the societal and individual behaviors that shape the demand for energy services. Traditionally, individual energy behaviors have been described as a function of utility optimization and behavioral economics, with price restructuring as the dominant policy lever. Previous research at the macro-level has identified economic activity, power generation and technology, and economic role as significant factors that shape energy use. However, most demand models lack basic contextual information on how dominant social phenomenon, the changing demographics of cities, and the sociocultural setting within which people operate, affect energy decisions and use patterns. Here we use high-quality Suomi-NPP VIIRS nighttime environmental products to: (1) observe aggregate human behavior through variations in energy service demand patterns during the Christmas and New Year's season and the Holy Month of Ramadan and (2) demonstrate that patterns in energy behaviors closely track sociocultural boundaries at the country, city, and district level. These findings indicate that energy decision making and demand is a sociocultural process as well as an economic process, often involving a combination of individual price-based incentives and societal-level factors. While nighttime satellite imagery has been used to map regional energy infrastructure distribution, tracking daily dynamic lighting demand at three major scales of urbanization is novel. This methodology can enrich research on the relative importance of drivers of energy demand and conservation behaviors at fine scales. Our initial results demonstrate the importance of seating energy demand frameworks in a social context.","{""Roman, Miguel O."",""Stokes, Eleanor C.""}",roman_holidayslightstrackingcultural_2015,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Digital Transformation Of Education,"For society to benefit fully from its investment in Earth Observation, the data must be accessible and familiar to a global community of users who have the skills, knowledge and understanding to use the observations appropriately in their work. Future 'Environmental Data Scientists' will need to draw on multiple data and information sources, using data analysis, statistics and models to create knowledge that is communicated effectively to decision-makers in government, industry, and civil society. Networks, cloud computing and visualization will become increasingly important as citizen scientists, data journalists and politicians increasingly use Earth observation products to give their arguments and decisions scientific credibility. The overarching aim of Earth Observation education must therefore be to support life-long learning, allowing users at all levels to remain up-to-date with EO technologies and communication mechanisms that are relevant to their individual needs. Current and emerging methodologies for interactive education (such as ""MOOCs"" and mobile learning), and hands-on engagement with real data (such as through citizen science projects) will be central to outreach, training and formal education in this field. To achieve this, it will be important to engage a wider community of experts from a range of disciplines, and to establish a comprehensive network of educators, technical experts, and content producers. It will also be important to encourage ""crowd-sourcing"" of new contributions, to help maintain scientific and educational quality.

An Integrated Approach For Mapping Groundwater Potential Applying Geospatial And Mif Techniques In The Semiarid Region,"Geospatial methods play an important role in the identification, monitoring, assessment, and conservation of groundwater resources. An integrated approach combining the geospatial techniques and multi-influencing factors (MIF) was adapted for the determination of potential groundwater zone in the Purulia District of West Bengal, Eastern India. The present groundwater is underexploited for agricultural and other activities. This study would also benefit in identifying the artificial recharge zone for further research and developmental activity in the region. The important parameters including slope, landuse/cover, lineament, drainage, geology, and soil affecting potential groundwater occurrence were generated from Topo Maps, Landsat remote sensing imagery, and various ancillary data. Various thematic layers were allocated a fixed score as weightage using MIF technique. Thereafter, the weighted layers were statistically computed in the overlay analysis to generate the groundwater prospect map. The groundwater potential map demonstrated five zones, viz. very good (13.8\%), good (34.9\%), moderate (48.3\%), poor (2.8\%), and very poor (0.2\%). The findings of the research study would enable to carry out future research and propose effective planning and management of groundwater development.","{""Bhattacharya, Soumik"",""Das, Sandipan"",""Das, Swarupa"",""Kalashetty, Mahesh"",""Warghat, Sumedh R.""}",bhattacharya_integratedapproachmappinggroundwater_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Estimation Of Surface Water Runoff For A Semi-Arid Area Using Rs And Gis-Based Scs-Cn Method,"The proper planning of storage structures, waterways, irrigation schemes, water harvesting, erosion control structures, and groundwater development strategies requires accurate estimation of surface runoff. However, hydrologists in Saudi Arabia face serious challenges, specifically due to the rare availability of surface runoff data. In this study, the soil conservation service-curve number (SCS-CN) method integrated with geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) was utilized to estimate the surface runoff in Wadi-Uranah basin, in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Different thematic maps such as slope, hydrologic soil group (HSG), land use/land cover (LULC), and daily rainfall have been created in GIS environment and processed to generate the curve number (CN) and surface runoff maps. Based on the soil classification results, the study area was categorized into two HSGs (B and C). The dominant HSG was group C, representing about 98.8\% of the total area. The LULC analysis showed four main land use types in the study region: urban, rocks, barren soil, and agricultural areas. Furthermore, the finding results showed that CN values for the normal conditions (CNII) ranged between 74 and 93 in agricultural and both urban and rock areas, respectively. The CN(II)values were further corrected using slope data to derive slope-adjusted CNII. Moreover, the rainfall-runoff results showed an increase in the daily runoff of the study region with a minimum of 15 mm to a maximum of 74 mm. Another interesting result was rainfall-runoff linear regression analysis that showed a good correlation of 0.98. Additionally, the peak runoff hydrograph flows for 10-, 50-, and 100-year return periods obtained from the SCS-based dimensionless unit hydrograph were 828, 1353, and 1603 m(3)/s, respectively. Therefore, this study highlights that the SCS-CN method integrated with RS and GIS deserves further attention for estimating runoff of ungauged basins for better basins management and conservation purposes.","{""Al-Ghobari, Hussein"",""Alataway, Abed"",""Dewidar, Ahmed""}",alghobari_estimationsurfacewaterrunoff_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Overview Of Toxic Cyanobacteria And Cyanotoxins In Ibero-American Freshwaters: Challenges For Risk Management And Opportunities For Removal By Advanced Technologies,"The increasing occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms worldwide represents an important threat for both the environment and public health. In this context, the development of risk analysis and management tools as well as sustainable and cost-effective treatment processes is essential. The research project TALGENTOX, funded by the Ibero-American Science and Technology Program for Development (CYTED-2019), aims to address this ambitious challenge in countries with different environmental and social conditions within the Ibero-American context. It is based on a multidisciplinary approach that combines ecology, water management and technology fields, and includes research groups from Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Spain. In this review, the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in freshwaters from these countries are summarized. The presence of cyanotoxins has been confirmed in all countries but the information is still scarce and further monitoring is required. In this regard, remote sensing or metagenomics are good alternatives at reasonable cost. The risk management of freshwaters from those countries considering the most frequent uses (consumption and recreation) has been also evaluated. Only Spain and Peru include cyanotoxins in its drinking water legislation (only MC-LR) and thus, there is a need for regulatory improvements. The development of preventive strategies like diminishing nutrient loads to aquatic systems is also required. In the same line, corrective measures are urgently needed especially in drinking waters. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have the potential to play a major role in this scenario as they are effective for the elimination of most cyanotoxins classes. The research on the field of AOPs is herein summarized considering the cost-effectiveness, environmental character and technical applicability of such technologies. Fenton-based processes and photocatalysis using solar irradiation or LED light represent very promising alternatives given their high cost-efficiency. Further research should focus on developing stable long-term operation systems, addressing their scale-up. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.","{""Carmona-JimÃ©nez, J."",""Caro-Borrero, A."",""Casas, J.

"Assessing Forest Health Using Remote Sensing-Based Indicators And Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process In Valmiki Tiger Reserve, India","Anthropogenic activities, climate variability and environmental stresses have greatly affected forest ecosystems globally. Thus, monitoring of forest health is essential for proper planning and effective management. The present study employed an integrated approach of remote sensing and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to assess the forest health in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in India. Advanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, forest fragmentation, rainfall and soil types were derived from remote sensing data. Multiple buffer zones of villages, roads, railways and canals were also determined for analyzing the forest health status. These layers were prepared in the geographical information system. These layers were given weightage using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. These layers were integrated to prepare forest health map using weighted overlay method. The results revealed that the largest forest area was found under moderately healthy forest (37\%) followed by healthy forest (31\%) and unhealthy forest (13\%). Of the total area of the Reserve, 19\% area was under non-forest category. Human-induced disturbances such as encroachment, illegal sand mining, livestock grazing and forest conversion to agriculture have been attributed to the unhealthy forest in the Reserve. The receiver operating characteristic curve value and area under curve (0.792) show reliability of forest health map. The findings of this study may be helpful for forest managers, conservationists and local communities in devising sustainable strategies for effective management of the forest. The methodological framework adopted in this study may be utilized in other geographical regions interested in assessing forest health.","{""Ahmed, R."",""Masroor, M."",""Rahaman, M.

"Satellite-Based Streamflow Simulation Using Chirps Satellite Precipitation Product In Shah Bahram Basin, Iran","Precipitation is the most important climate variable in hydrological practices, so accurate estimation of its intensity and volume is very crucial for hydrological applications. Remote sensing precipitation estimations have recently been widely employed in water resources management due to the lack of observed precipitation measurements in remote areas. However, remote sensing precipitation estimations are not free from systematic errors. This study aims to bias-correct the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) satellite precipitation estimations using the Gaussian-Copula approach and illustrates how it improves the simulated flow characteristics in the Shah Bahram basin in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, southwestern Iran. The Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) calculated between the original CHIRPS precipitation estimation and observation in the Shah Bahram basin equals - 0.14; however, when bias-corrected CHIRPS data was compared to observation, the NSE increased to 0.23, suggesting about 158\% improvement in the CHIRPS precipitation estimation when bias-corrected with the Gaussian-Copula approach. Next, the bias-corrected precipitation time series were utilized as the hydrologic modeling system inputs to simulate flow specifications such as discharge and peak value. Then, the simulation of the flow parameters was carried out with both original and bias-corrected CHIRPS satellite precipitation estimations and the ground-based precipitation. Though the NSE statistic of the simulation for the testing period has not changed significantly, the Pbias statistic has considerably improved. The result of the study indicates the good performance of the proposed bias correction approach in reducing the CHIRPS satellite estimations errors, concluding that it is a suitable approach for bias correction of the other satellite precipitation estimations in areas that suffer from the lack of ground-based observations necessary for flood forecasting and other hydrological practices.","{""Mokhtari, Shirin"",""Raziei, Tayeb"",""Sharafati, Ahmad""}",mokhtari_satellitebasedstreamflowsimulation_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Research Progress On Exposure And Health Effects Of Green Space,"Accumulating studies suggest that green space exposure is related to a variety of health benefits; however, limited studies have been conducted in China. We reviewed the methods of exposure assessment, study designs, and main findings of previous studies regarding to green space exposure and its acute and chronic health effects. In the aspect of exposure assessments, different types of indicators were employed in the epidemiological studies, such as land use types of green space, greenness index retrieved from satellite remote sensing data, and green space expsosure data extracted from the images of street view. Epidemiological studies of green space exposure have the following features: 1) The majority of the studies were conducted in developed countries rather than developing ones; 2) Green space exposure was suggested to have potential health effects in various stages of the life cycle from pregnancy, infancy, adolescence, adulthood to senior years; 3) Results were consistent that exposure to green space might improve birth weight and be protective against mortality, whereas failed to be consistent on other health outcomes; 4) The mechanisms of health benefits of green space were still unclear.

A Landsat-Based Energy Balance And Evapotranspiration Model In Western Us Water Rights Regulation And Planning,"The quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) from irrigated projects is important for water rights management, water resources planning and water regulation. Traditionally, ET has been estimated by multiplying a weather-based reference ET by crop coefficients (Kc) determined according to the crop type and the crop growth stage. However, there is typically question regarding whether crops grown compare with the conditions represented by the Kc values, especially in water short areas. In addition, it is difficult to estimate the correct crop growth stage dates for large populations of crops and fields. METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) is an image-processing model for calculating ET as a residual of the surface energy balance. METRIC is a variant of SEBAL, an energy balance process developed in the Netherlands by Bastiaanssen and was extended to provide tighter integration with ground-based reference ET. METRIC was applied with Landsat images in southern Idaho to predict monthly and seasonal ET for water rights accounting and for operation of ground water models. ET ""maps"" (i.e., images) provide the means to quantify, in terms of both the amount and spatial distribution, the ET on a field by field basis. The ET maps have been used in Idaho to quantify net ground-water pumpage in areas where water extraction from underground is not measured and to estimate recharge from surface-irrigated lands. Application and testing of METRIC indicates substantial promise as an efficient, accurate, and relatively inexpensive procedure to predict the actual evaporation fluxes from irrigated lands throughout a growing season.

"Estimation Of Rainfall-Runoff Using Scs-Cn Method And Gis Techniques In Drought-Prone Area Of Upper Kangsabati Watershed, India","Purulia is one of the most intense drought-prone districts of the western part of West Bengal, India. Acute form of water scarcity is a common phenomenon in this area during the hot-summer period. The water scarcity in this study region is due to the presence of monsoonal vagaries, unfavorable lithological condition and availability of poor groundwater. Therefore, watershed management is the primary concern for sustainable development of natural resources like water and land for optimal development of watershed and economic activities. Therefore, optimal measurement of rainfall-induced runoff is indeed necessary to understand the hydrological behavior. Several traditional statistical and advanced machine learning methods has been used previously to measure surface runoff among the researchers. It is difficult to simulate the required runoff with physical-based models due to the complexity and non-linear behavior of the runoff phenomena, as well as the absence of relevant historical data in all places. Thus, in the present research study of gravelly dominated drought-prone area of Upper Kangsabati Watershed (UKW) is considered to assess rainfall-induced surface runoff using most reliable method of Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN), and considering remote sensing and geographic information system platform. The SCS-CN method is very much reliable and till now has been frequently used among the global hydrological community to optimal assessment of surface runoff and adaptation of proper watershed management strategies. Henceforth, in this study SSC-CN method is used in the hard rock terrain landscape of extended plateau fringe of western West Bengal. The estimated result of runoff depth and runoff volume is 979.45 mm and 280.85 m(3), respectively, and the rainfall-runoff is strongly positively correlated with (r) value being 0.98. Additionally, the applied statistical methods and the outcomes of this study will be helpful among the hydrological communities, different stakeholders and policy makers for sustainable watershed management in terms of optimal conserve of water resources and reduced threating of drought condition.","{""Ghosh, Manoranjan"",""Pal, Subodh Chandra"",""Saha, Asish""}",saha_estimationrainfallrunoffscs_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Mapping Beach Morphodynamics Remotely: A Novel Application Tested On South African Sandy Shores,"Sandy beaches have been identified as threatened ecosystems but despite the need to conserve them, they have been generally overlooked. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) has emerged as an efficient method of selecting areas for conservation priority. However, SCP analyses require digital shapefiles of habitat and species diversity. Mapping these attributes for beaches from field data can take years and requires exhaustive resources. This study thus sought to derive a methodology to classify and map beach morphodynamic types from satellite imagery. Since beach morphodynamics is a strong predictor of macrofauna diversity, they could be considered a good surrogate for mapping beach biodiversity. A dataset was generated for 45 microtidal beaches (of known morphodynamic type) by measuring or coding for several physical characteristics from imagery acquired from Google Earth. Conditional inference trees revealed beach width to be the only factor that significantly predicted beach morphodynamic type, giving four categories: dissipative, dissipative-intermediate, intermediate and reflective. The derived model was tested by using it to predict the morphodynamic type of 28 other beaches of known classification. Model performance was good (75\% prediction accuracy) but misclassifications occurred at the three breaks between the four categories. For beaches around these breaks, consideration of surf zone characteristics in addition to beach width ameliorated the misclassifications. The final methodology yielded a 93\% prediction accuracy of beach morphodynamic type. Overlaying other considerations on this classification scheme could provide additional value to the layer, such that it also describes species' spatial patterns. These could include: biogeographic regions, estuarine versus sandy beaches and short versus long beaches. The classification scheme was applied to the South African shoreline as a case study. The distribution of the beach morphodynamic types was partly influenced by geography. Most of the long, dissipative beaches are found along the west coast of the country, the south coast beaches are mostly dissipative-intermediate, and the east coast beaches range from short, estuarine pocket and embayed beaches in the former Transkei (south east), to longer intermediate and reflective beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (in the north east). Once combined with the three biogeographic regions, and distinguishing between estuarine and sandy shores, the South African coast comprised 24 different beach types. Representing shorelines in this form opens up potential for numerous spatial analyses that can not only further our understanding of sandy beach ecology at large spatial scales but also aid in deriving conservation strategies for this threatened ecosystem.

Characterization Of Water Quality And The Effects Of Land Use And Seasonality On Springs In Eastern Amazonia,"Land-use changes followed by inadequate management may cause serious impacts to springs, generating losses in quality and availability. An alternative to minimize or mitigate potential future impacts is to monitor the water quality parameters of micro-watersheds in the medium-and long-term. This monitoring is essential for planning purposes and governmental environmental regulation, especially in highly altered regions in the Amazon, such as Paragominas, in the state of ParÃ¡. This study investigated the influence of land use change and seasonality on the quality of springs. For this purpose, physicochemical parameters characteristic of water quality in five collection points of springs with a surrounding area of distinct land use history were analyzed between 2015 and 2017. Following the current legislation, the only parameter in imbalance was dissolved oxygen (DO). However, these are common values, considering springs. The results showed that most of the parameters presented variation to different land uses. This interpretation was intensified mainly by the variations in Sodium, TN, DO and temperature. However, few of these variables were related to local seasonality (only turbidity, sulfate and potassium). These results prove that it is possible to integrate the change in the use and occupation of the basin, determined by the variations observed in the sampled points. Thus, studies and diagnostics that can subsidize management in basin areas are an important tool to direct public policies to improve environmental and social quality for the population living around these basins.

Remote Sensing Classification Of Urban Black-Odor Water Based On Decision Tree,"Remote sensing monitoring of black-odor water is an important method for understanding the current status of urban water quality, and comprehensively evaluating the effect of urban water environment treatment. A total of 171 samples were collected in Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Yangzhou cities and water quality parameters and optical parameters were measured simultaneously. Based on the analysis of the water color and optical characteristics of the black-odor water and non-black-odor water (denoted as general water), a decision tree was constructed to identify the severe, mild black-odor water, and general water as green and yellow water. The results found that: (1)According to the water color, the water bodies can be divided into six types. Among them, type 1 to 4 water bodies are black-odor water, which are gray black, dark gray, gray, and light gray water, respectively, and type 5 and 6 water bodies are general water, which are green and yellow water, respectively; (2)Type 1 water body contains high contents of non-pigmented particulate matter and colored dissolved organic matter(CDOM), however, the absorption of pigmented particulate matter is not dominant. Type 2 and 5 water bodies are dominated by pigmented particulate matter. Type 3, 4, and 6 water bodies are dominated by non-pigmented particulate matter; (3)After water color classification, and according to the differences of the reflection spectrums of the six types of water bodies, the difference of black-odorous water index (DBWI), green-red-nir area water index (G-R-NIR AWI), the green band reflectance and the normalized difference black-odorous water index (NDBWI) were used to construct a decision tree to identify the severe, mild black-odor water, and general water; (4)The decision tree was applied to the PlanetScope satellite image of Yangzhou City on April 9, 2019, and 10 synchronous sampling points were used for verification. The overall recognition accuracy reached 80.00%, and the K value reached 0.67. The urban water classification model, after water color classification, can be applied to other similar water bodies, and provides a technical method for the supervision of black-odor water bodies.

Alluvial Groundwater Recharge Estimation In Semi-Arid Environment Using Remotely Sensed Data,"Data limitations on groundwater (GW) recharge over large areas are still a challenge for efficient water resource management, especially in semi-arid regions. Thus, this study seeks to integrate hydrological cycle variables from satellite imagery to estimate the spatial distribution of GW recharge in the Ipanema river basin (IRB), which is located in the State of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. Remote sensing data, including monthly maps (2011-2012) of rainfall, runoff and evapotranspiration, are used as input for the water balance method within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Rainfall data are derived from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Version 7 (3B43V7) product and present the same monthly average temporal distributions from 15 rain gauges that are distributed over the study area (r = 0.93 and MAE = 12.7 mm), with annual average estimates of 894.3 (2011) and 300.7 mm (2012). The runoff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) method, which is based on regional soil information and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor image, represents 29\% of the TMPA rainfall that was observed across two years of study. Actual evapotranspiration data, which were provided by the SEBAL application of MODIS images, present annual averages of 1213 (2011) and 1067 (2012) mm. The water balance results reveal a large inter-annual difference in the IRB GW recharge, which is characterized by different rainfall regimes, with averages of 30.4 (2011) and 4.7 (2012) mm year(-1). These recharges were mainly observed between January and July in regions with alluvial sediments and highly permeable soils. The GW recharge approach with remote sensing is compared to the WTF (Water Table Fluctuation) method, which is used in an area of alluvium in the IRB. The estimates from these two methods exhibit reliable annual agreement, with average values of 154.6 (WTF) and 124.6 (water balance) mm in 2011. These values correspond to 14.89 and 13.53\% of the rainfall that was recorded at the rain gauges and the TMPA, respectively.

"Comparison Of Land Surface Temperature Before, During And After The Covid-19 Lockdown Using Landsat Imagery: A Case Study Of Casablanca City, Morocco","Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important variable within global climate change. With the appearance of remote sensing techniques and advanced GIS software, it is now possible to estimate LST. In this study, the effect of lock-down during COVID-19 on the LST was assessed using Landsat 8 Imagery. LST dynamic was investigated for three different periods: Before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. The study was conducted in Casablanca City. The results showed that during the emergence of COVID-19 with lock-down policy applied, the LST decreases remarkably compared to the previous 4-yearsâ€™ average LST. After the easing of restrictions, the LST increased to exceed the previous 4-year mean LST. Furthermore, throughout all studied periods, the LST recorded its higher values in industrial zones and areas with high urban density and urban transportation, which indicates the conspicuous impact of anthropogenic activities on the LST variation. These findings indicate an ability to assess the feasibility of planned lockdowns intended as a potential preventive mechanism to reduce LST peaks and the loss of air quality in metro-politan environments in the future.

"Investigating The Spatiotemporal Distributions Of No2, So2 And Their Association With Ndvi In Lahore (Pakistan) And Its Adjoining Region Of Punjab (India)","Developing country like Pakistan is severely affected by poor air quality and is globally ranked in third position for mortality cases caused by air pollution. Air Pollution is severely degrading the quality of air and climatic systems and is affecting the health of the people and plants. This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal distributions of some selected air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) and their association with NDVI in Lahore and its adjoining regions from July 2018 to December 2020. The present study utilized air pollutants (NO2 and SO2) observations obtained from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5P, and NDVI retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra satellite. The mean annual high NO2 concentrations of 163.0 Ã— 10â€“6Â molÂ mâˆ’2, 160.0 Ã— 10â€“6Â molÂ mâˆ’2, and 154.0 Ã— 10â€“6Â molÂ mâˆ’2 were found over northwestern, central, and southern boundaries of Lahore, respectively, while the SO2 concentration of 315.4 Ã— 10â€“6Â molÂ mâˆ’2 was observed over the northwestern boundary of Lahore. Moreover, the mean annual NDVI ranging from 0.5 to 0.65 was observed in the east, northeast, southeast and outside the boundary of Lahore towards Amritsar. The monthly time series analyses show that the highest values of NO2, SO2 and NDVI are found to be 149 Ã— 10â€“6 Â± 1.58 Ã— 10â€“5 (mole mâˆ’2), 544 Ã— 10â€“6 Â± 1.68 Ã— 10â€“4 (mole mâˆ’2), and 0.670 Â± 0.12 in January 2019, December 2020 and February 2019, respectively. The highest correlation between NO2 and SO2 with NDVI is found to be 0.95 and 0.87, respectively in the southwest, and southeast directions. These findings will be helpful for concerned departments such as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC), and the scientific community to formulate policies and take measures to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on the agricultural sector.

"Geomorphic And Land Cover Identification Of Dust Sources In The Eastern Great Basin Of Utah, Usa","This study identifies anthropogenically disturbed areas and barren playa surfaces as the two primary dust source types that repeatedly contribute to dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of western Utah, U.S.A. This semi-arid desert region is an important contributor to dust production in North America, with this study being the first to specifically identify and characterize regional dust sources. From 2004 to 2010, a total of 51 dust event days (DEDs) affected the air quality in Salt Lake City, UT. MODIS satellite imagery during 16 of these DEDs was analyzed to identify dust plumes, and assess the characteristics of dust source areas. A total of 168 plumes were identified, and showed mobilization of dust from Quaternary deposits located within the Bonneville Basin. This analysis identifies 4 major and 5 secondary source areas for dust in this region, which produce dust primarily during the spring and fall months and during moderate or greater drought conditions, with a Palmer Drought Index (PDI) of 2 or less. The largest number of observed dust plumes (similar to 60\% of all plumes) originated from playas (ephemeral lakes) and are classified as barren land cover with a silty clay soil sediment surface. Playa surfaces in this region undergo numerous recurrent anthropogenic disturbances, including military operations and anthropogenic water withdrawal. Anthropogenic disturbance is necessary to produce dust from the vegetated landscape in the eastern Great Basin, as evidenced by the new dust source active from 2008 to 2010 in the area burned by the 2007 Milford Flat Fire; this fire was the largest in Utah's history due to extensive cover of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) along with drought conditions. However, dust mobilization from the Milford Flat Burned Area was limited to regions that had been significantly disturbed by post-fire land management techniques that consisted of seeding, followed by chaining or tilling of the soil. Dust storms in the eastern Great Basin negatively impact air quality and transportation in the populated regions of Utah; this study details an improved forecasting protocol for dust storm events that will benefit transportation planning and improve public health.

Rangeland Productivity Partitioned To Sub-Pixel Plant Functional Types,"Understanding and monitoring the dynamics of rangeland heterogeneity through time and across space is critical for the effective management and conservation of rangeland systems and the sustained supply of the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Conventional approaches (both field-based and remote sensing) to monitoring rangeland productivity fail to effectively capture important aspects of this heterogeneity. While field methods can effectively capture high levels of detail at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, they are limited in their applicability and scalability to larger spatial extents and longer time periods. Alternatively, remote sensing based approaches that scale broad spatiotemporal extents simplify important heterogeneity occurring at fine scales. We address these limitations to monitoring rangeland productivity by combining a continuous plant functional type (PFT) fractional cover dataset with a Landsat derived gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) model. Integrating the annual PFT dataset with a 16-day Landsat normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) composite dataset enabled us to disaggregate the pixel level NDVI values to the sub-pixel PFTs. These values were incorporated into the productivity algorithm, enabling refined estimations of 16-day GPP and annual NPP for the PFTs that composed each pixel. We demonstrated the results of these methods on a set of representative rangeland sites across the western United States. Partitioning rangeland productivity to sub-pixel PFTs revealed new dynamics and insights to aid the sustainable management of rangelands.","{""Allred, Brady W."",""Erickson, Tyler A."",""Jones, Matthew O."",""Moreno, Alvaro"",""Naugle, David E."",""Robinson, Nathaniel P.""}",robinson_rangelandproductivitypartitionedpixel_2019,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Governance Issues Constraining The Deployment Of Flood Resilience Strategies In Maroua, Far North Region Of Cameroon","Purpose - Cities across the globe, particularly those of the less developed world, face long-term challenges associated with floods which impact negatively on the resilience of city systems and their inhabitants. In the city of Maroua, most urban management stakeholders have been unable to integrate flood resilience research into urban development issues. It is against this background that the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the governance issues constraining the deployment of flood resilience strategies implemented by residents in flood-prone zones and those used by the government via administrative authorities and institutions charged with urban development to flood-related risks in the city of Maroua, Far North Region of Cameroon. Design/methodology/approach - Field surveys, participant observations, interviews, and on-the-spot appraisals were carried out with residents in flood-prone neighbourhoods and municipal authorities on the state of recurrent floods including mitigating strategies being implemented. Findings - The results revealed that Maroua has a fragile ecological setting which has increased the vulnerability of the town to flood-related risks. This is further aggravated by the fact that municipal authorities are yet to have a thorough mastery of such recurrent flood incidences due to their limited planning horizons, rendering the urban poor disproportionately susceptible to flood-related stresses. This exposes them to unavoidable flood associated hazards such as water borne diseases (typhoid and cholera) as they are bogged down by physical and financial limitations. Besides, decision-making processes in relation to managing urban systems are not guided by good governance as efforts to enhance and integrate the local population for flood resilience are neither participatory nor inclusive, ushering the urban environment of Maroua into a frivolous path to profligacy. Originality/value - For resilience to be deeply entrenched, the paper proffers for the mainstreaming of flood resilience strategies into urban development plans through multi-stakeholder involvement across different sectors and departments, as well as the setting up of a practical time table for monitoring the progress of these measures through geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and geographical information systems.","{""Ndi, Roland Akoh"",""Wanie, Clarkson Mvo""}",wanie_governanceissuesconstrainingdeployment_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Multi-Objective Optimization Of Crop Planting Structure Based On Remote Sensing And Ant Colony Algorithm,"A water saving and multi-objective planting structure optimization model was put forward against the mismatching between regional planting structure and water resources. Based on the matching degree between water requirement at different crop growing stages and the regional precipitation as well as the crop planting structure obtained by remote sensing, a planting structure optimization model with multiple objectives such as water saving, economic and ecological benefits in the irrigated area was established. With Wuquan irrigation district in Baojixia as an example, the model was optimized with ant colony algorithm. The total water requirements for irrigation district of plan 1 and plan 2 is respectively 85.4% and 83.4% of the present situation. The income of plan 1 is lower 5.4% and the plan 2 is higher7.1% than common years. Meanwhile the income of plan 1 is lower 5.9% and the project 2 is higher 7.3% than the droughty years. The coupling degree of precipitation of plan 1 and plan 2 is respectively higher 12.6% and 15.6% than common years while higher 17.5% and 28.6% than droughty years. The comparison between the two plans of controlled optimization shows that the second one is the better readjustment plan because, without changing the planting area, the structure optimization helps not only maintain the sustainable development of the environment but also improve the economic income dramatically. It is practically and theoretically for agricultural water saving planning.","{""Chen, J."",""Li, Y."",""Liu, J."",""Wang, Z."",""Zhang, Z.""}",zhang_multiobjectiveoptimizationcrop_2011,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA

The results showed that the average RSEI of Nanjing decreased from 0.626 to 0.618 during 2000-2017. The RSEI values could be divided into five grades: bad, poor, fair, good and excellent. The proportion of area above good grade decreased from 61.0% to 57.1%, while that below poor grade increased slightly. Compared with 2000, the proportion of areas with improved ecological environment quality was 34.5%, 34.7% area had deteriorated, and 30.8% area remained unchanged in 2017. Among them, the ecological quality of main urban area had significantly improved, and the area with improved ecological quality exceeded that of deterioration. The ecological quality of new urban area and suburbs had deteriorated. The area with poor ecological environment exceeded the area of improvement. Among the three ecological protection areas, the ecological quality of Zijin Mountain was significantly better than that of Laoshan Mountain and Jiangxinzhou. The urbanization rate was negatively correlated with RSEI, with a correlation coefficient of -0.91. The urbanization process would have negative impacts on the ecological environment in general.

A Spatio-Temporal Prediction Model Theory Based On Deep Learning To Evaluate The Ecological Changes Of The Largest Reservoir In North China From 1985 To 2021,"Miyun Reservoir, located in the Miyun District, Beijing, China, is the largest comprehensive water conservancy project and is an important ecological protection area in the North China region. Changes within the basin are the driving factors affecting the ecosystem in the watershed; therefore, it is important to analyze the changes in the ecological environment of Miyun Reservoir. For the analysis of a long time series of image data remotely sensed by satellite, the outliers caused by atmospheric, lighting, and sensor measurement errors are significant, and it is difficult for traditional algorithms to effectively recover the true image value. To address this, this paper proposes a theoretical model for predicting spatio-temporal variation based on deep learning to identify and correct invalid and anomalous values in extended time series data. This study corrected and analyzed the results of Remote Sensing based Ecological Index inversion of Landsat data of the Miyun Reservoir watershed from 1985 to 2021. The findings and conclusions of this study are important for the analysis of long time series image data from satellite remote sensing and for improving regional ecological evaluation and sustainable development planning.","{""Feger, Karl-Heinz"",""Li, Guoyuan"",""Mo, Fan"",""Sun, Shiyi"",""Tang, Xinming"",""Yao, Jiaqi"",""Zhai, Haoran"",""Zhang, Lulu"",""Zhu, Hong""}",yao_spatiotemporalpredictionmodel_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"An Integrated Approach Of Machine Learning And Remote Sensing For Evaluating Landslide Hazards And Risk Hotspots, Nw Himalaya","Landslides have become more frequent in the last decade in the NW Himalayan region, threatening people and damaging infrastructure. The study presented here aims to identify landslide hazards and risk hotspots in the NW Himalaya. The area is strategically important due the many holy pilgrimage sites and major hydropower projects.

To determine the spatial landslide vulnerability, land use and land cover components were taken into account with their respective monetary values. The landslide risk map is the combination of landslide hazard and vulnerability maps, showing that âˆ¼5% of the area falls in high and very high-risk zones, âˆ¼6% in moderate, âˆ¼47% in low, and âˆ¼42% in very low landslide risk zones. High to very high landslide risk zones are mainly confined to Uttarkashi and its surroundings in the southwestern part of the study area, as well as the Tehri, Karanprayag, and Pithoragarh regions in the southern area. Societal risk was also analyzed and revealed that âˆ¼53% of the human population resides in high to very high landslide risk-prone areas.

A Quantitative Framework For Analysing Long Term Spatial Clustering And Vegetation Fragmentation In An Urban Landscape Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data,"Rapid urbanization threatens urban green spaces and vegetation, demonstrated by a decrease in connectivity and higher levels of fragmentation. Understanding historic spatial and temporal patterns of such fragmentation is important for habitat and biological conservation, ecosystem management and urban planning. Despite their potential value, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) measures have not been sufficiently exploited in monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban areas. LISA statistics are an important structural measure that indicates the presence of outliers, zones of similarity (hot spots) and of dissimilarity (cold spots) at proximate locations, hence they could be used to explicitly capture spatial patterns that are clustered, dispersed or random. In this study, we applied landscape metrics, LISA indices to analyse the temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation patterns of vegetation patches in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe using Landsat series data for 1994, 2001 and 2017. Analysis of landscape metrics showed an increase in the fragmentation of vegetation patches between 1994-2017 as shown by the decrease in mean patch size, an increase in number of patches, edge density and shape complexity of vegetation patches. The study further demonstrates the utility of LISA indices in identifying key hot spot and cold spots. Comparatively, the highly vegetated northern parts of the city were characterised by significantly high positive spatial autocorrelation (p < 0.05) of vegetation patches. Conversely, more dispersed vegetation patches were found in the highly and densely urbanized western, eastern and southern parts of the city. This suggest that with increasing vegetation fragmentation, small and isolated vegetation patches do not spatially cluster but are dispersed geographically. The findings of the study underline the potential of LISA measures as a valuable spatially explicit method for the assessment of spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban vegetation patterns.","{""Dube, Timothy"",""Kowe, Pedzisai"",""Mutanga, Onisimo"",""Odindi, John""}",kowe_quantitativeframeworkanalysingterm_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Overview Of The Ocean Climatology And Its Variability In The Azores Region Of The North Atlantic Including Environmental Characteristics At The Seabed,"Obtaining a comprehensive knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations of the environmental factors characterizing the Azores region is essential for conservation and management purposes. Although many studies are available for the region, there is a need for a general overview of the best available information. Here, we assembled a comprehensive collection of environmental data and briefly described the ocean climatology and its variability in the Azores. Data sources used in this study included remote sensing oceanographic data for 2003-2013 (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, particulate inorganic carbon, and particulate organic carbon), derived oceanographic data (primary productivity and North Atlantic oscillation index) for 2003-2013, and in situ data (temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate and silicate) obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. We have produced 78 geographic datasets of environmental data for the Azores region that were deposited at the World Data Center Pangaea and also made available at the SIGMAR Azores website. As with previous studies, our results confirmed a high spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variability of the marine environment in the Azores region, typical of mid-latitudes. For example, lower sea surface temperature was found in the northern part of the study area coinciding with higher values for chlorophyll-a concentration, net primary production (NPP), and particulate organic and inorganic carbon. Higher values for some of these parameters were also found on island slopes and some seamounts. Compiled data on the environmental conditions at near-seabed revealed some notable variations across the study area (e.g., oxygen and nutrients) and with depth (e.g., temperature, salinity, and oxygen). Knowledge of these patterns will help improve our understanding of the distribution of many deep-sea organisms such as fish, cold-water corals, and sponges, thereby supporting the implementation of marine spatial planning and other management measures. It should be noted that the assembled datasets suffer from a number of limitations related to the accuracy of remote sensing and global bathymetry data, or to the limited and unevenly distributed collection of environmental observations. Accordingly, an effective observing system for detecting oceanic change with adequate accuracy and precision is still required.","{""Amorim, Patricia"",""Cardigos, Frederico"",""Juliano, Manuela"",""Morato, Telmo"",""Peran, Antonio D."",""Pham, Christopher K."",""Tempera, Fernando""}",amorim_overviewoceanclimatologyvariability_2017,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
The Role Of Mncs And Information Flow On Institutional Change,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of large business corporations, particularly media corporations, such as television (e.g. satellite networks), newspapers and social media (e.g. Facebook), on institutional change in the Arab world, which directly impact political and civil liberties in the region. Design/methodology/approach - Although there are several methods to measure institutional change, this paper relied on Kaufmann et al. (2010)'s governance indicators that capture, historically, how authority is exercised in a nation state. As the focus of this paper is on how information flows have empowered citizens in the Arab world, we built a panel database around one relevant governance indicator: ""Voice and Accountability"". As a measure of governance, ""Voice and Accountability"" summarizes the condition of political, civil and human rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of association in a given country. This indicator takes scores ranging from 2.5, corresponding to strong governance, to -2.5, corresponding to weak governance. Findings - As predicted, the information flows variable has a positive and significant effect on institutional change. Table II also suggests that political globalization has a positive and significant effect on institutional change in the Arab world. In contrast, the variables for cultural proximity and human capital are associated with negative effects on institutional change.

Cost Factors In Urban Telemedicine,"This paper reports on the cost effectiveness of a pediatric primary care system utilizing nurse practitioners (NPs) linked to a physician consultant through bidirectional interactive cable television. In addition, it discusses ways in which multiple uses enhance the economic feasibility of a telemedicine consultation link in a given geographic area. The overall consultation rate during periods of remote physician coverage was 21 per cent, compared with 24 per cent during on-site coverage. The telephone became a partial substitute for the TV for some uses but could not replace it in diagnostic decisions. As telemedicine is obviously underutilized in a one-satellite system, we compare a five-satellite network with other ways of delivering service. The resulting estimated cost of $18.50 an hour, or 2/3 of the cost of a physician providing direct care, includes a TV component of $5.30 an hour of use in a 1,750-hour year. The critical factor is that the NP can be a physician substitute if there is TV backup. The TV appears to prevent unnecessary referrals compared to a physician on site. Whether TV increases the length of the consult compared to the phone for conditions of equal severity is not entirely clear. If TV is compared to transporting a patient to a central place, the implicit value of transport time and disutility required to justify using TV is $7.55 per consult in a five-clinic network. Geographic and other barriers to physician availability enhance the potential for application of telemedicine. Â© Lippincott-Raven Publishers.","{""Cunningham, N."",""Krasneh, M."",""Marshall, C.

Decadal Changes In Land Use And Land Cover: Impacts And Their Influence On Urban Ecosystem Services,"The steady growth of the cities alters the urban environmental pattern and functions, posing significant challenges to urban ecological as well as environmental governance. Under this setting, analyzing the relationship between urban growth and ecological services is critical for management and policy-related sustainable urban development. The primary goal of this research is to analyse the dynamic urbanization and its influence on urban ecosystem services via changes in LULC of Mangaluru city agglomeration, India. For five decades (1980,1990, 2000, 2010, and 2022), the ecosystem service values (ESVs) are analysed using remote sensing data and GIS techniques corresponding with the global value coefficient (VC) to estimate total ecosystem service values (ESVt) and individual ecosystem service function change. The study shows that ecosystem service values (ESVs) declined by US\$ 116.89 million to US\$ 85.14 million due to 9.54 and 63.44\% decreases in agricultural land and wasteland/shrubland between 1980 and 2022. In terms of individual ecosystem service functions, regulating services increased from 1980 to 2022, with nutrient cycling (45.64\%), raw material (15.59\%), and erosion control (12.13\%) contributing the most. The loss in total and certain individual ESV in the study landscape necessitates immediate action to improve urban ecosystem sustainability via proper planning and policy.HIGHLIGHTSThe quantification of ecosystem services (ES) plays an important role in properly understanding and efficiently managing social-ecological systems. The decrease in agricultural land and shrubland/wasteland is the main reason for the degradation of ecosystem services. The findings point out that regional or local-level ecosystem services-related work is immensely important and a hotspot of current research.","{""Devi, Nandineni Rama"",""Nayak, Deeksha"",""Shukla, Anoop Kumar""}",nayak_decadallandlandcover_2024,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Towards A Comprehensive And Consistent Global Aquatic Land Cover Characterization Framework Addressing Multiple User Needs,"Aquatic land cover represents the land cover type that is significantly influenced by the presence of water over an extensive part of a year. Monitoring global aquatic land cover types plays an essential role in preserving aquatic ecosystems and maintaining the ecosystem service they provide for humans, while at the same time their accurate and consistent monitoring for multiple purposes (e.g. climate modelling, biodiversity conservation, water resource management) remains challenging. Although a number of global aquatic land cover (GALC) datasets are available for use to monitor aquatic ecosystems, there are prominent variabilities among these datasets, which is primarily caused by the inconsistency between different land versus water-related monitoring approaches and character-ization schemes. As aquatic land cover exists in many different forms on Earth (e.g. wetland, open water) and can be mapped by different approaches, it is necessary to consider a much more consistent and comprehensive characterization framework that not only ensures the consistency in the monitoring of aquatic land cover but also serves the needs of multiple users (e.g. climate users, agricultural users) interested in different aspects of aquatic lands. In this study, we addressed this issue by 1) reviewing 33 GALC datasets and user needs identified from the citing papers of current datasets and international conventions, policies and agreements in relation to aquatic ecosystems, 2) proposing a global characterization framework for aquatic land cover based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classifier principles and the identified user needs, and 3) highlighting the opportunities and challenges provided by remote sensing techniques for the implementation of the proposed framework. Results show that users require or prefer various kinds of information on aquatic types including vegetation type, water persistence, the artificiality of cover (i.e. artificial vs natural), water salinity, and the accessibility to the sea (i.e. coastal vs inland). Datasets with medium to high spatial resolution, intra-annual dynamics and inter-annual changes are needed by many users. However, none of the existing datasets can meet all these requirements and a rigorous quantitative accuracy assessment is lacking to evaluate its quality for most of the GALC datasets. The proposed framework has three levels and users are allowed to derive their aquatic land cover types of interest by combining different levels and classifiers of information. This comprehensive mapping framework can help to bridge the gap between user needs and current GALC datasets as well as the gap between generic and aquatic land cover monitoring. The implementation of the framework can benefit from evolving satellite-data availability, improved computation capability and open-source machine learning algorithms, although at the same time it faces challenges mainly coming from the complexity of aquatic ecosystems. The framework proposed in this study provides insights for future operational aquatic land cover monitoring initiatives and will support better understanding and monitoring of complex aquatic ecosystems.","{""Clevers, Jan G.

Assessment Of Water Quality Based On Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager Associated With Human Activities In Korea,"Water pollution such as green algae blooms and eutrophication in freshwater fatally influences both water quality and human society. Water quality issues in the 4 major rivers in Korea, including the Nakdong, have recently become a major concern. For this reason, it is essential to monitor water quality parameters (WQPs) that have a widespread characteristic to ensure maintenance of an effective water management system. The possibility of utilizing remote sensing technology for monitoring water quality on a regional scale has been recently investigated. The main objective of this study is to evaluate potential applications of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for estimating water quality in the Nakdong River, Korea. Correlations between Landsat 8 bands and in situ measurements are determined, and water quality models are established for estimating suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and total phosphorus (TP). The results demonstrate that WQPs correlated well with band reflectance values from Landsat 8. Band 5 was reasonably correlated with all WQPs, particularly with SS (R = âˆ’0.74) and Chl-a (R = âˆ’0.71). This study constructed multiple regression equations for WQPs based on correlation analysis through band combination and band ratio. The spatial distribution of WQPs in the Nakdong River on October 27, 2013 and May 16, 2014 indicate that the river was nearly eutrophic from human activities. Based on the results, the Landsat 8 OLI may be an appropriate data for estimating and monitoring water quality parameters on a regional scale. However, further validation is required to support the findings of this study.

"Optimizing Natural Boundary Definition And Functional Zoning In Protected Areas: An Integrated Framework Encompassing Species, Landscapes And Ecosystems","To promote the harmonized development of economic construction and ecological protection, our study introduces an integrated framework that employs various methodologies to delineate natural reserve boundaries and spatial zoning. These methodologies aim to address issues such as insufficient protected area, excessive human-induced influences, and inadequate protection of endangered animals within nature reserve boundaries. Leveraging comprehensive data from diverse sources, including ground surveys and remote sensing detection, we conducted a survey using the Chebaling National Nature Reserve in China and its environs as a case study. Models such as the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), Fragstats, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) were employed to identify areas with highly suitable habitats, significant landscape diversity, and superior ecosystem quality for 16 key species. Subsequently, the irreplaceable value of the research area was calculated using the Marxan model, leading to the establishment of a novel natural boundary and development plan. We propose expanding the original nature reserve to 1344 kmÂ², dividing it into a core reserve (321 kmÂ², 23.88%) and a general control area (1023 kmÂ², 76.12%). Additionally, we recommend further division of the general protected area into several functional zones to facilitate the integration of functional diversity and ecological protection. This contributes to a more scientifically informed and rational management approach for the Chebaling National Nature Reserve. Moreover, this integrated framework offers valuable insights for assessing and identifying animal habitats globally and spatially zoning other nature reserves.

Pollution Assessment For Sustainable Practices In Applied Sciences And Engineering,"Pollution Assessment for Sustainable Practices in Applied Sciences and Engineering provides an integrated reference for academics and professionals working on land, air, and water pollution. The protocols discussed and the extensive number of case studies help environmental engineers to quickly identify the correct process for projects under study. The book is divided into four parts; each of the first three covers a separate environment: Geosphere, Atmosphere, and Hydrosphere. The first part covers ground assessment, contamination, geo-statistics, remote sensing, GIS, risk assessment and management, and environmental impact assessment. The second part covers atmospheric assessment topics, including the dynamics of contaminant transport, impacts of global warming, indoor and outdoor techniques and practice. The third part is dedicated to the hydrosphere including both the marine and fresh water environments. Finally, part four examines emerging issues in pollution assessment, from nanomaterials to artificial intelligence. There are a wide variety of case studies in the book to help bridge the gap between concept and practice. Environmental Engineers will benefit from the integrated approach to pollution assessment across multiple spheres. Practicing engineers and students will also benefit from the case studies, which bring the practice side by side with fundamental concepts. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","{""Howari, F.

Topographic Diversity As An Indicator For Resilience Of Terrestrial Protected Areas Against Climate Change,"Habitat loss from unrelenting human pressure is causing an unprecedented decline in global biodiversity. Protected areas (PAs) are meant to counteract loss and fragmentation of ecosystems and today PAs form the backbone of conservation strategies worldwide. However, anthropogenic climate change can severely reduce the effectiveness of PAs. Conservation professionals are in need of concrete spatial information on climatic changes within PAs in order to put forward practicable strategies to safeguard PA effectiveness in the face of climate change. In this study, we take advantage of openly accessible data on the disappearing climate index (DCI) to examine which PA characteristics are linked to climate change resilience on a global scale. DCI provides a measure of the relative area (percent of total area) within a PA that exhibits certain climatic conditions that will either disappear entirely or move outside the boundaries of the PA by the year 2070. Our results show that topographic diversity is highly correlated with reduced climate change impacts in PAs worldwide. We analyzed three different PA characteristics representing topographic diversity: PA area, maximal elevational difference (MED) and median terrain ruggedness (TR). All three characteristics are highly correlated with a decrease in the disappearing climate index (DCI). These results hold true across localities and even PA management practices. IUCN management category IV (habitat/species management area) and V (protected landscape/seascape) exhibit on average the highest DCI values. As an indicator for PA resilience under climate change, topographic diversity can be assessed easily through publicly available data and remote sensing products. This ease-of-use leaves topographic diversity standing in marked contrast to overall environmental diversity as an actionable conservation metric. Of course, topographic diversity alone is not a sufficient criterion on which to base conservation decisions. However, neither should the potential usefulness of topographic diversity be underestimated. As an actionable and complementary metric in combination with biological information topographic diversity can be an exceptional tool for decision making by PA managers, conservation practitioners and politicians.

Potential For Return On Investment In Rehabilitation-Oriented Blue Carbon Projects: Accounting Methodologies And Project Strategies,"Opportunities to boost climate change mitigation and adaptation (CCMA) and sustainable conservation financing may lie in enhancing blue carbon sequestration, particularly in developing nations where coastal ecosystems are extensive and international carbon markets offer comparatively attractive payments for environmental stewardship. While blue carbon is receiving increased global attention, few credit-generating projects are operational, due to low credit-buyer incentives with uncertainty in creditable emissions reductions and high project costs. Little empirical guidance exists for practitioners to quantify return-on-investment (ROI) and viability of potential projects, particularly for rehabilitation where multiple implementation options exist with diverse associated costs. We map and model drivers of mangrove natural regeneration (NR) using remote sensing (high-resolution satellite imagery segmentation and time-series modeling), and subsequent carbon sequestration using field- and literature-derived data, across abandoned aquaculture ponds in the Philippines. Using project-specific cost data, we then assess ROI for a hypothetical rehabilitation-focused mangrove blue carbon project at a 9.68 ha abandoned pond over a 10-year timeframe, under varied rehabilitation scenarios {[}NR vs. assisted natural regeneration (ANR) with planting], potential emissions reduction accreditation methodologies, carbon prices and discount rates. NR was faster in lower-lying ponds with lower tidal exposure (greater pond dike retention). Forecasted carbon sequestration was 3.7- to 5.2-fold and areal ""greenbelt"" regeneration 2.5- to 3.4-fold greater in our case study under ANR than NR. Variability in modeled sequestration rates drove high uncertainty and credit deductions in NR strategies. ROI with biomass-only accreditation was low and negative under NR and ANR, respectively. ROI was greater under ANR with inclusion of biomass and autochthonous soil carbon; however, neither strategy was highly profitable at current voluntary market carbon prices. ANR was the only scenario that fulfilled coastal protection greenbelt potential, with full mangrove cover within 10 years. Our findings highlight the benefits of ANR and soils inclusion in rehabilitation-oriented blue carbon projects, to maximize carbon sequestration and greenbelt enhancement (thus enhance pricing with potential bundled credits), and minimize forecasting uncertainty and credit-buyers' perceived risk. An ANR rehabilitation strategy in low-lying, sea-facing abandoned ponds with low biophysical intervention costs may represent large blue carbon CCMA opportunities in regions with high aquaculture abandonment.","{""Duncan, Clare"",""Hill, Nicholas A.

Feasibility Study Of Using Crowdsourcing To Identify Critical Affected Areas For Rapid Damage Assessment: Hurricane Matthew Case Study,"The rapid damage assessment plays a critical role in crisis management. Collection of timely information for rapid damage assessment is particularly challenging during natural disasters. Remote sensing technologies were used for data collection during disasters. However, due to the large areas affected by major disasters such as Hurricane Matthew, specific data cannot be collected in time such as the location information. Social media can serve as a crowdsourcing platform for citizens' communication and information sharing during natural disasters and provide the timely data for identifying affected areas to support rapid damage assessment during disasters. Nevertheless, there is very limited existing research on the utility of social media data in damage assessment. Even though some investigation of the relationship between social media activities and damages was conducted, the employment of damage-related social media data in exploring the fore-mentioned relationship remains blank. This paper, for the first time, establishes the index dictionary by semantic analysis for the identification of damage-related tweets posted during Hurricane Matthew in Florida. Meanwhile, the insurance claim data from the publication of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation is used as a representative of real hurricane damage data in Florida. This study performs a correlation analysis and a comparative analysis of the geographic distribution of social media data and damage data at the county level in Florida. We find that employing social media data to identify critical affected areas at the county level during disasters is viable. Damage data has a closer relationship with damage-related tweets than disaster-related tweets.","{""Liu, Rui"",""Yuan, Faxi""}",yuan_feasibilitystudycrowdsourcingidentify_2018,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Spatial Planning For Biodiversity Conservation: Assessment Of Forest Landscapes' Conservation Value Using Umbrella Species Requirements In Poland,"Maintenance of biodiversity requires spatial planning for the conservation of species habitats. In this study, the distribution of the White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) in Poland was used to assess the usefulness of a demographic model compared to an area-based model for predicting the occurrence of breeding pairs in local landscapes. The models were applied to the European Forest Map and to CORINE land cover data, two spatial databases derived from remote sensing. We tested the performance of the models by comparing predicted occurrence of the species with actual occurrence in 10 km x 10 km of the Polish Ornithological Atlas Database (POAD). Both models proved useful for identifying areas with high potential for hosting breeding woodpeckers. However, the demographic model performed consistently better at predicting the presence of at least one breeding pair in local landscapes. In north-eastern and south-eastern Poland, expected occurrences coincided with the actual occurrence of the species according to POAD. In north-western Poland, however, occurrence was predicted but not confirmed by the atlas data. The eastern regions are situated at the border to Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. These countries hold large areas of high conservation value forests and large populations of White-backed Woodpecker. This pattern evokes the need for cross-border governance, and planning with an eco-regional perspective that considers both EU and non-EU countries. Moreover, the results stress the need to incorporate population requirements when assessing the distribution of forests with high conservation value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Monitoring Wind Farms Occupying Grasslands Based On Remote-Sensing Data From China's Gf-2 Hd Satellite-A Case Study Of Jiuquan City, Gansu Province, China","Wind power is a clean and renewable resource, and it is rapidly becoming an important component of sustainable development and resource transfer. However, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. In this study, we verified whether China's GF-2 HD satellite (GF-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the Landsat 8 OLI and China's GF-1 HD satellite (GF-1). We performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. We evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km2 per device. The construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m2 of grassland. The average area of grassland damaged by 3 MW and 1.5 MW turbines was 5757 m2 and 2496 m2, respectively. Approximately 2.44 km2 of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. Roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. The average difference between the measured and calculated GF-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. Therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and GF-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. In addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed. In this study, grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development.

Wetlands: An Overview,"While many indigenous people and rural populations still depend on local wetlands and waters for their livelihood (e.g., Schuyt 2005), most if not all nations now recognize wetlands as one of the worldâ€™s most valuable natural resources. Besides their intrinsic value to specially adapted plants and animals, wetlands produce a wealth of environmental services that directly benefit human societies (Table 1.1). Given this recognition, there has been increasing attention given to wetland conservation around the globe (e.g., Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Wetlands have been acquired as nature preserves, sanctuaries, and wildlife management areas or identified as globally important for water birds or vital for storing carbon to help ameliorate the effect of human-induced greenhouse gases on atmospheric temperature. Wetland restoration has become a subject for scientific investigation as well as for commercial enterprise. Some governments have enacted laws and/or policies to protect wetlands or regulate conversion of these valued resources and initiated wetland inventories to aid wetland management and conservation. Since this book focuses on advances in remote sensing technology to perform such inventories, a brief overview of wetlands seems warranted. This chapter is intended to provide that introduction and includes a list of references for readers to gain a more complete understanding of wetlands.

Assessing The Cooling Effect Of Blue-Green Spaces: Implications For Urban Heat Island Mitigation,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a significant concern in todayâ€™s rapidly urbanising cities, with exacerbating heatwavesâ€™ impact, urban livelihood, and environmental well-being. This study aims to assess the cooling effect of blue-green spaces in Bhubaneswar, India, and explore their implications for mitigating UHI effects. Satellite images were processed with Google Earth Engine (GEE) to produce information on the blue-green spacesâ€™ land surface temperatures (LST). The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were employed to quantify the presence and characteristics of these blue-green spaces. The findings revealed significant spatial variations in the LST, with higher temperatures observed in bare land and built-up areas and lower temperatures in proximity to the blue-green spaces. In addition, a correlation analysis indicated the strong influence of the built-up index (NDBI) on the LST, emphasising the impact of urbanisation on local climate dynamics. The analysis demonstrated the potential of blue-green spaces in reducing surface temperatures and mitigating UHI effects. Based on these results, strategic interventions were proposed, such as increasing the coverage of green spaces, optimising access to water bodies, and integrating water-sensitive design principles into urban planning to enhance the cooling effects and foster a more sustainable and resilient urban environment. This study highlighted the importance of leveraging remote sensing and GEE for urban UHI analyses. It provides valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to prioritise nature-based solutions for heat mitigation in Bhubaneswar and other similar cities. Future research could delve deeper into a quantitative assessment of the cooling benefits of specific blue-green infrastructure interventions and explore their socio-economic impacts on urban communities.

"Dairy Farming In The Eastern Himalayan Foothills: Perspectives From The Lower Dibang Valley, India","Dairying in the far-flung rural areas of Arunachal Pradesh in the Eastern Himalayas forms an important source of livelihood. The Himalayan foothill region of Lower Dibang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh, India is dotted with dairy farming units, locally known as Khutti (cowsheds). The semi-pastoral traditional practice of dairying among the Nepali community has its own economic, geographical and social ramifications. The khuttis or the goths (dairy units) move from one place to another depending on fodder availability and seasonality. This chapter seeks to identify the cost and production, price and profitability of dairying livelihood; the status of livelihood of the dairy farming households and its relationship with the changing climatic conditions in the study area. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the study. Primary data was collected with the help of structured survey schedule. A handheld geographical positioning system (GPS) device was used to derive accurate longitudinal and latitudinal positions of the dairy farms and other features. Topographic maps and satellite imageries were used for the construction of maps. A simple cost-benefit analysis was carried out to assess the cost and profitability of the dairy units. Generally the households manage to stay marginally above the poverty level, with the standards of living being generally low. Buffaloes tended to provide better returns from dairying than cows. The markedly traditional mode of dairying has aided the gradual improvement of the livelihood of the dairying community although their tenuous existence could be undermined by climate change in the coming years.

Use Of Hedgerows By Mammals In An Intensive Agricultural Landscape,"Agricultural intensification causes habitat modification, sometimes leading to habitat loss and subsequent loss of connectivity. Remaining species in these agriculture-dominated landscapes often use hedgerows, such as windbreaks or riparian strips, as movement corridors or even as habitats. However, the understanding of the use of these hedgerows by mammals is limited and could be improved with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data, which are unbiased, detailed and repeatable. The aim of this study was to assess the attributes that affect medium- and large-sized mammals' use of hedgerows, with in situ and remotely sensed data (including LiDAR and multispectral images) in an agriculture-dominated landscape in southern Quebec. Twenty-three hedgerows were selected and characterized with both field surveys and remote sensing analyses, like LiDAR metrics and vegetation indices. Wildlife frequentation of each hedgerow was measured using camera traps, from late spring to early fall in 2018. 431 mammal detections were obtained among all 23 hedgerows. From this, seven species were recorded, all of them opportunistic and well adapted to agricultural environment. Results showed significant differences in mammal use of hedgerows. Coefficients of the better-ranked models based on AICc indicated a positive relationship between hedgerow length and their use by mammals, and a negative relationship with the hedgerow width. Hedgerow use by mammals also increased as tree cover and understory density increased, and as human disturbance decreased. These results characterized for the first time the variables influencing hedgerow use by a broad set of medium- and large-sized mammal species and confirmed their use as movement corridors and/or habitat. This study also confirmed the complementary usefulness of variables derived from remote sensing combined with field data. The low explanatory power of variables often cited in the literature (e.g. NDVI, gappiness) also highlights the need to further explore their specific influence on mammals. The information provided by this study supports the beneficial role played by hedgerows for wildlife conservation in intensive agricultural landscapes. Management guidelines are provided as well as future research avenues.","{""Dupras, J."",""Pelletier-Guittier, C."",""Theau, J.""}",pelletierguittier_hedgerowsmammalsintensiveagricultural_2020,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Forest And Land Fires, Toxic Haze And Local Politics In Indonesia","Forest and land fires are among the major catastrophic events that occur in Indonesia. They are a major cause of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Their multiple sources are most diverse and root in nature and society. The immediate fire effects directly and the long-term landscape ecosystem degradations indirectly cause major and persisting and serious problems of public health and ecosystem service. Smoke haze from the forest and land fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2015 caused significant environmental and economic losses in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. We describe the different types of land uses and land cover where fires and smoke haze took place, and how local politics have affected fire use from 2001 to 2017. We calculated hot spots from satellite imageries as proxies for fire occurrences and applied regression analysis to understand the link between fire and local politics in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The results show that the greatest frequency of hot spots occurred in wood and oil palm plantations and logging concessions (47\%), followed by conservation areas (31\%) and community land (22\%). Local elections involve land transactions, and fires were used as a cheap way to increase the land value. The use of fire as means of land clearing was strongly influenced by local politics. Their frequency and abundance obviously increased about a year prior to local elections. The reasons behind the correlation need to be understood so that appropriate incentives and sanctions can be put in place and deter political leaders from using fire as an incentive to their advantage.","{""Achdiawan, R."",""Dermawan, A."",""Dewayani, A.

An Evaluation Of The Economic Viability Of Environmental Offsets In The Saltworks Industry,"The extraction of sea salt depends on the occupation of large areas at the estuary banks, many of them inserted in Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs). Thus, the objective was to evaluate the economic viability of Environmental Offsets (EO) as an alternative to the unoccupied PPAs in the saltworks. In order to do so, 27 solar saltworks installed in the region of the Brazilian White Coast were evaluated for the occupation of PPAs-measured using images from satellite, georeferenced, vectored with corresponding PPA bands generated-and estimated to EO (Impact Degree x Sum of the investments necessary to implement the project) and Economic Impact (Net Present Value, with long-term interest rate of 7%) of vacating PPAs. It was considered that EO was feasible whenever the costs resulting from it were lower than the economic impact caused by the vacancy of the PPAs. The PPAs were tthe productive area of â€‹the saltworksthat occupied 13.70% of PPAs. For all the evaluated enterprises the value corresponding to EO was lower than the Economic Impact resulting from the vacancy of the PPAs. Thus, EO is an economically viable and more attractive alternative to the eviction of PPAs by the saltworks industry and may also provide environmental gains due to the financing of conservation units in the areas of influence of the enterprises. However, there is a need to improve the methodology used to estimate the EO, since a maximum limit is set, the environmental impacts caused by the projects are underestimated.

Measurement Of Snow Depth Using A Low-Cost Mobile Laser Scanner,"In this letter, we demonstrate the potential of a small, robust, and low-cost mobile scanner for snow-depth studies. Snow-surface model and depth data are needed for purposes such as flood forecasting, agriculture, optimal management of water resources, and in formulating global climate-change scenarios. Traditionally, manual snow-depth measurements are laborious, time-consuming, and costly. A mobile mapping system comprised of an Ibeo Lux laser scanner, operating at a wavelength of 905 nm, and a NovAtel SPAN-CPT inertial navigation system was used to produce geo-referenced point clouds. The data were acquired first in the fall when the ground was free of snow and then a second time in winter when there was snow on the ground. Reference values from a total of 94 locations were collected with an RTK GPS pole. The maximum reference snow depth was 80 cm. The obtained snow-depth bias was 0.3 cm, which indicated that the proposed data-processing approach was capable of avoiding errors due to laser penetration into the snow, and the root-mean-squared error was 5.5 cm. Mobile laser scanning appears to be a promising technology for cryospheric studies having potential, e.g., to calibrate gravimetric measurements and earth observation satellite data, especially when reference data are needed for areas that are too large for terrestrial laser scanning.","{""Hyyppa, Juha"",""Jaakkola, Anttoni"",""Puttonen, Eetu""}",jaakkola_measurementsnowdepthlow_2014,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
S2net: A Multitask Learning Network For Semantic Stereo Of Satellite Image Pairs,"Stereo matching and semantic segmentation are two significant tasks in remote sensing. Recently, deep learning approaches have been applied to these tasks separately. However, the lack of semantic supervision makes the training of stereo matching model susceptible to data disturbance, resulting in inferior generalization ability; foreground objects are sometimes confused with background pixels in RGB images, limiting the classification accuracy. By exploring the relationship between these two tasks, semantic stereo solves these problems simultaneously with multitask learning. Previous methods took semantic stereo as two parallel processing tasks, so they did not take full advantages of the additional information from both tasks and only obtained slight improvement. In this work, we designed a multitask learning framework semantic stereo network (S2Net). The proposed network generates cost volumes with feature maps supervised by semantic information to estimate disparity maps and fuses RGB-D feature maps to predict classification maps, therefore gathering multitask learning information. To enhance the performance of trained model, we also considered the continuity of disparity values and the duality of stereo image pairs in data augmentation. When applied in datasets without training, S2Net obtained 2.937% D1-Error in the WHU dataset, lower than 4.297% of the previous best method, depicting the generalization ability improvement from semantic supervision. In terms of semantic segmentation, the introduction of disparity maps increases the mean intersection over union (mIoU) from 61.375% to 69.096% in the US3D datasets. The experiments on the KITTI semantics benchmark show that our proposed method obtains 60.76% mIoU, achieving state-of-the-art among multitask learning methods .

Land Use/Land Cover Classification And Its Change Detection Using Multi-Temporal Modis Ndvi Data,"Detailed analysis of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) using remote sensing data in complex irrigated basins provides complete profile for better water resource management and planning. Using remote sensing data, this study provides detailed land use maps of the Lower Chenab Canal irrigated region of Pakistan from 2005 to 2012 for LULC change detection. Major crop types are demarcated by identifying temporal profiles of NDVI using MODIS 250 m x 250 m spatial resolution data. Wheat and rice are found to be major crops in rabi and kharif seasons, respectively. Accuracy assessment of prepared maps is performed using three different techniques: error matrix approach, comparison with ancillary data and with previous study. Producer and user accuracies for each class are calculated along with kappa coefficients (K). The average overall accuracies for rabi and kharif are 82.83\% and 78.21\%, respectively. Producer and user accuracies for individual class range respectively between 72.5\% to 77\% and 70.1\% to 84.3\% for rabi and 76.6\% to 90.2\% and 72\% to 84.7\% for kharif. The K values range between 0.66 to 0.77 for rabi with average of 0.73, and from 0.69 to 0.74 with average of 0.71 for kharif. LULC change detection indicates that wheat and rice have less volatility of change in comparison with. both rabi and kharif fodders. Transformation between cotton and rice is less common due to their completely different cropping conditions. Results of spatial and temporal LULC distributions and their seasonal variations provide useful insights for establishing realistic LULC scenarios for hydrological studies.","{""Abbas, A."",""Liedl, R."",""Shahid, M.

Slope Instabilities In Steep Cultivation Systems: Process Classification And Opportunities From Remote Sensing,"The cultivation of steep slopes is a widespread practice in hilly and mountainous areas around the world. Such environments often result in particular agricultural systems linked with unique local values of historical and cultural heritage, economy, and food security. However, steep-slope agriculture is inherently exposed to slope instability processes, which are now widely aggravated due to natural (e.g., growing rainfall aggressiveness) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., unsuitable maintenance or agronomic practices). In the literature, among the many articles published on soil erosion, a specific focus on the analysis of slope instabilities in steep cultivation systems is lacking. The purpose of this article is, therefore, to create a specific overview of this problem, with some useful insights into the role of remote sensing. We introduce the problem first, highlighting the main issues related to slope instabilities in steep cultivated areas. Then we provided a classification of key published papers, based on the different types of mass movements studied and their location in the world.

Time-Series Analysis Of Landsat-Mss/Tm/Oli Images Over Amazonian Waters Impacted By Gold Mining Activities,"Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the TapajÃ³s River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the TapajÃ³s River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the TapajÃ³s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.

Artificial Intelligence Based Methods For Smart And Sustainable Urban Planning: A Systematic Survey,"The worldâ€™s cities are facing various challenges such as rapid urbanization, poverty, climate change, pollution, sustainable and inclusive development. Building futuristic smart and sustainable cities is proving to be a response to these challenges. Recent publications show that urban planning decision support is increasingly using artificial intelligence through machine learning methods to address these challenges. 172 papers were published in 2020 compared to 8 before 2010 with a forecast of at least 200 papers in 2021. Despite the explosive number of scientific publications on applications artificial intelligence for urban planning decision support, few studies have made a systematic assessment of the state of the art to inform future research. This would help focus on the approaches used, the planning problems most commonly addressed, the data used and even the study areas. We found that the top 5 most addressed urban planning issues include: land use/cover, urban growth, urban buildings, urban mobility and urban environment. Furthermore, a large amount of data was used from sensors and simple or ensemble machine learning methods were more used in this case. Deep learning methods are more used for land use/cover, buildings and climate issues which are mostly based on satellite image data. On the other hand, China and the United States are the most studied territories while Africa is almost not. A high intensity of collaboration between researchers affiliated with Chinese, American and English institutions was observed. Thus, urban planning researchers should benefit from this synthesis work by understanding the general idea of the application of machine learning methods in urban planning, its trends, issues, current challenges and future research directions.

Using Satellite-Based Estimates Of Evapotranspiration And Groundwater Changes To Determine Anthropogenic Water Fluxes In Land Surface Models,"Irrigation is a widely used water management practice that is often poorly parameterized in land surface and climate models. Previous studies have addressed this issue via use of irrigation area, applied water inventory data, or soil moisture content. These approaches have a variety of drawbacks including data latency, accurately prescribing irrigation intensity, and a lack of conservation of water volume for models using a prescribed soil moisture approach. In this study, we parameterize irrigation fluxes using satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) compared to ET from a suite of land surface models without irrigation. We then incorporate the irrigation flux into the Community Land Model (CLM) and use a systematic trial-and-error procedure to determine the ground- and surface-water withdrawals that are necessary to balance the new irrigation flux. The resulting CLM simulation with irrigation produces ET that matches the magnitude and seasonality of observed satellite ET well, with a mean difference of 6.3 mm month(-1) and a correlation of 0.95. Differences between the new CLM ET values and satellite-observed ET values are always less than 30 mm month(-1) and the differences show no pattern with respect to seasonality. The results reinforce the importance of accurately parameterizing anthropogenic hydrologic fluxes into land surface and climate models to assess environmental change under current and future climates and land management regimes.","{""Anderson, R.

"Integrated Studies To Identify Site-Specific Parameters For Environmentally Benign Mining Operations: A Case Study From The Sukari Gold Mine, Egypt","This study integrates observations from field and remote sensing data, along with geochemical and isotopic analyses, to assess the environmental impacts of cyanidation and mining activities in the Sukari gold mine (SGM), Eastern Desert, Egypt, in particular, and the orogenic gold deposits of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) in general. Our findings indicate: (1) groundwater flows south to north in the highly fractured basement aquifer related to the brittle deformation associated with the Najd Fault System; (2) massive gabbroic bodies separate the fractured basement aquifer into east and west conduits; (3) the tailings storage facility (TSF) pond and leach pad were constructed over the west conduit; and (4) cyanide-rich wastewater has leaked downward through tears and cuts in the lining of the TSF pond into the fractured aquifer and cyanide contaminants have migrated northward along the west conduit. Evidence for the latter includes: (1) toxic concentrations of cyanide (total: 0.018â€“9.4 mg/L; free weak-acid dissociable: 0.003â€“0.7 mg/L) were observed in groundwater samples north of the TSF pond; (2) similarities in electrical conductivity (EC) values and chloride/bromide (Clâˆ’/Brâˆ’) ratios between groundwater north of the pond (EC: 88.8 mS/cm; Clâˆ’/Brâˆ’: 346 to 363) and those of the TSF pond water (mean EC: 99 mS/cm; Clâˆ’/Brâˆ’: 242 to 383) were observed; (3) the geochemical (e.g., sodium [Na+], Clâˆ’) and isotopic compositions (Î´18O and Î´2H values) of groundwater are consistent with mixing of groundwater upgradient from the SGM with isotopically enriched pond water; and (4) cyanide contamination could not have resulted from an overflow of the TSF pond during flash flood events, given that rainfall is negligible and effective flood control systems are in place. Our findings show that the international codes/regulations do not fully address site-specific characteristics and highlight the importance of considering these parameters in mining of orogenic gold deposits in the ANS.

The Spatial Pattern Of Scirpus Mariqueter Expansion And The Associated Mechanism Of Self-Organization Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles And Its Significance For Coastal Wetland Restoration,"Understanding the spatial expansion process of salt marshes and quantifying the factors driving this expansion are crucial for the management and restoration of coastal wetlands. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the expansion process of Scirpus mariqueter using drone remote sensing and quantify its relationship with habitat quality. Our hypothesis was that landscape metrics could serve as valuable indicators for prioritizing habitat restoration efforts along the coast. We utilized drone remote sensing and adopted the simple Greenness Index to reflect the growth status of S. mariqueter. Using this index, we computed the standard deviation ellipse and growth center. To evaluate habitat quality, we developed a method based on our previous research and other relevant reports. We then conducted a quantitative analysis of the expansion process of S. mariqueter in areas with varying habitat quality. We found that S. mariqueterâ€™s optimal elevation was 3.7Â m, with a range of 2.5 to 4.3Â m. The threshold value for soil total nitrogen was 0.3Â g/kg, and the tolerance threshold for soil salinity was 2500Â ppm. These three factors, elevation, soil total nitrogen, and soil salinity, collectively influenced habitat quality, with weights of 0.68, 0.23, and 0.09, respectively, as determined through geodetector analysis. During the summer, we observed a dominance of dispersal in S. mariqueter, with the species primarily spreading to areas with increased habitat quality. Patch shapes tended to be compact and regular in this season. In contrast, during the autumn, a dominance of decline was observed, with S. mariqueter mainly distributing to areas exhibiting decreased habitat quality. Patch shapes tended to be complex and irregular in the autumn season. Eventually micro-geomorphic modification and patch shape filling methods based on UAV observations are proposed to aid wetland restoration. These findings are of utmost importance for the restoration of coastal wetlands and the enhancement of ecosystem resilience.

Semisupervised Change Detection With Feature-Prediction Alignment,"Change detection (CD) has received raising attention for its broad application value. However, traditional fully supervised CD methods have a huge demand for pixel-level annotations, which are laborious and even impossible in some few-shot scenarios. Recently, several semisupervised CD (SSCD) methods have been proposed to utilize numerous unlabeled remote sensing image (RSI) pairs, which can largely reduce the annotation dependence. These methods are mainly based on: 1) adversarial learning, whose optimization direction is difficult to control as a black-box method, or 2) feature-consistency learning, which has no explicit physical meaning. To deal with these difficulties, we propose a novel progressive SSCD framework in this article, termed feature-prediction alignment (FPA). FPA can efficiently utilize unlabeled RSI pairs for training by two alignment strategies. First, a class-aware feature alignment (FA) strategy is designed to align the area-level change/no-change feature extracted from different unlabeled RSI pairs (i.e., across regions) with the awareness of their locations, in order to reduce the feature difference within the same classes. Second, a pixelwise prediction alignment (PA) is devised to align the pixel-level change prediction of strongly augmented unlabeled RSI pairs to the pseudo-labels calculated from the corresponding weakly augmented counterparts, in order to reduce the prediction uncertainty of various RSI transformations with physical meaning. Experiments are carried out on four widely used CD benchmarks, including Learning, Vision and Remote Sensing Laboratory (LEVIR-CD), Wuhan University building CD (WHU-CD), CDD, and GZ-CD, and our FPA achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/zxt9/FPA-SSCD.

"Changing Mountain Farmscapes: Vulnerability And Migration Drivers In The Paute River Watershed, Southern Ecuador","Abrupt changes in land use/land cover have often characterized Andean rural landscapes. This is particularly notorious in the Paute River watershed in southern Ecuador. We seek to show how, under tenets of the global economy, rural mountain landscapes suffer constant modifications due to the agricultural practices of dwellers and migrants. Erosion of arable slopes takes center stage in analyzing vulnerability due to the high erodibility factor found in this watershed. By using remote sensing and GIS applications, we analyzed the potential erodibility with intersections of rural development constraining of ecosystem services, including the production of water, food, and cultural values in the Paute River watershed. We found six sources of migratory flows and analyzed topographic and elevation effects in potential erodibility indexes of agroecological options to ameliorate the environmental stress. We identified factors associated with migration trends observed in the area and assessed vulnerability issues of resource management that could prevent deforestation, soil erosion, and acculturation amidst the pressures of development in the region. We conclude that sustainable development options can be implemented with a watershed management approach oriented to diminish emigration. This approach shall be integrative, inclusive, and respectful of the rich biocultural diversity heritage conservation of southern Ecuador.","{""Donoso, Mario E."",""Sarmiento, Fausto O.""}",donoso_changingmountainfarmscapesvulnerability_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Synthetic Biology In Space: Considering The Broad Societal And Ethical Implications,"Although the field of synthetic biology is still in its infancy, there are expectations for great advances in the coming decades, both on Earth and potentially in space. Promising applications for long duration space missions include a variety of biologically engineered products and biologically aided processes and technologies, which will undoubtedly be scrutinized for risks and benefits in the broad context of ethical, legal and social realms. By comparing and contrasting features of Earth-based and space-applied synthetic biology, it is possible to identify the likely similarities and differences, and to identify possible challenges ahead for space applications that will require additional research, both in the short and long terms. Using an analytical framework associated with synthetic biology and new technologies on Earth, this paper analyses the kinds of issues and concerns ahead, and identifies those areas where space applications may require additional examination. In general, while Earth- and space-based synthetic biology share many commonalities, space applications have additional challenges such as those raised by space microbiology and environmental factors, legal complications, planetary protection, lack of decision-making infrastructure(s), long duration human missions, terraforming and the possible discovery of extraterrestrial (ET) life.

Spatial Features Of Urban Vitality And The Impact Of Built Environment On Them Based On Multi-Source Data: A Case Study Of Shenzhen,"As a key index to evaluate whether a city is attractive or has a healthy, comprehensive, and sustainable development potential, urban vitality is critical to the future development and construction of a city. Exploring the mechanism of how the built environment influences urban vitality from the perspective of urban morphology can be conducive to future urban space planning and design and can provide city planners with quantitative and scientific decision-making support. This study uses urban POI, cellular signaling, and nighttime light remote sensing data from Shenzhen to measure its cultural, social, and economic vitality, which constitutes a comprehensive vitality assessment of the city. Spatial features of these urban vitalities were then analyzed to further illustrate their distribution patterns. Using Bivariate Moran's I method, the spatial autocorrelations between economic, social, and cultural vitality were calculated. From the five dimensions of Density, Design, Diversity, Distance to Transit, and Destination Accessibility, the 5D detection index system was constructed to measure the urban built environment. This study also used GeoDetector to detect and analyze the spatial differentiation between various built environmental factors and comprehensive, economic, social, and cultural vitality and to explore the mechanism of the influence of the built environment on urban vitality. The results show that: 1) The spatial distribution of comprehensive vitality is extremely uneven in Shenzhen, with a higher vitality in the southern and western regions of Shenzhen city and a lower vitality in the northern and eastern regions. Areas with higher comprehensive vitality usually developed along the main roads and metro lines and are distributed in strips along the coastline of central-southern and western Shenzhen. The high-value areas of the urban comprehensive vitality center are primarily concentrated in city- or district-level commercial centers, and employment centers. Comprehensive vitality in Shenzhen reflects social vitality. 2) Urban comprehensive, economic, social, and cultural vitality are significantly affected by the built environment, as indicated by the 5D system. High POI and building density, average building floors, and land use entropy, have significant positive impacts on urban vitality. However, residential population density did not have a significant impact on each aspect of urban vitality. 3) Some interactions between built environment factors had a greater impact on urban comprehensive vitality, such as residential population density, road network density, land use entropy, and road network density. Overall, the interaction between building density, average building floors, land use entropy, and other factors, have a more positive impact on each aspect of urban vitality. 4) The presentation of urban comprehensive vitality is the result of multiple dimensions and factors. In the influencing mechanism of urban comprehensive vitality, building density and average building floors were the fundamental factors. POI density and land use entropy were the direct driving factors. Residential population density was an inducing factor. Distance from the administrative center, intersection density, road network density, metro station density, and bus station density were adjustive factors. The research results therefore provide valuable suggestions for the optimal allocation of resources and the rational layout of urban functional facilities in Shenzhen.

Nitrogen Measurement For Variable-Rate N Management In Maize,"Numerous proximal and remote soil and plant-testing methods are available to guide variable-rate N management in maize production. These include preseason and late spring soil nitrate tests, late season stalk nitrate tests, handheld chlorophyll meter readings, remote sensing of soil and crop canopy properties, site-specific data from yield monitors and soil electrical conductivity maps. Field applicators have even been equipped to sense the N status of a crop and direct the application of any needed N on-the-go. However, the adoption rates of variable-rate N management are low worldwide despite the potential economic and environmental benefits of this practice and the availability of variable-rate application technology in key areas of maize production. A major obstacle is the finding that recommended N fertilizer rates based on yield goal are often poorly correlated with actual economically optimum N rates. Nitrogen response patterns are often field and season specific and can vary widely within the same field, further complicating adoption. Paired field comparisons of uniform- and variable-rate N management have revealed no consistent advantages for either strategy in yields achieved, whole-field N usage or N use efficiency by plants. Research with other agronomic crops also indicates that the scale for determining crop N need may be as low as 1 m(2). An additional constraint is that growers implementing variable-rate N techniques often are required to install several adequately fertilized N reference strips in their fields that have proven to be both hybrid and season specific. In addition to these agronomic and logistical challenges, the maximum potential benefit of a variable N strategy vs. a conventional uniform-rate N strategy is typically between 12 and 37 USD(\$)/ha. When the cost of developing and executing the variable-rate strategy is considered, the practice shows a low economic return. In the future, innovations in N soil testing, better crop simulation models, and improved N sensing and application equipment may assist growers in capturing the benefits of site-specific N management in maize production.","{""Doerge, TA""}",doerge_nitrogenmeasurementvariablerate_2005,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Testing Early Warning Metrics For Drought-Induced Tree Physiological Stress And Mortality,"Climate change-driven drought stress has triggered numerous large-scale tree mortality events in recent decades. Advances in mechanistic understanding and prediction are greatly limited by an inability to detect in situ where trees are likely to die in order to take timely measurements and actions. Thus, algorithms of early warning and detection of drought-induced tree stress and mortality could have major scientific and societal benefits. Here, we leverage two consecutive droughts in the southwestern United States to develop and test a set of early warning metrics. Using Landsat satellite data, we constructed early warning metrics from the first drought event. We then tested these metrics' ability to predict spatial patterns in tree physiological stress and mortality from the second drought. To test the broader applicability of these metrics, we also examined a separate drought in the Amazon rainforest. The early warning metrics successfully explained subsequent tree mortality in the second drought in the southwestern US, as well as mortality in the independent drought in tropical forests. The metrics also strongly correlated with spatial patterns in tree hydraulic stress underlying mortality, which provides a strong link between tree physiological stress and remote sensing during the severe drought and indicates that the loss of hydraulic function during drought likely mediated subsequent mortality. Thus, early warning metrics provide a critical foundation for elucidating the physiological mechanisms underpinning tree mortality in mature forests and guiding management responses to these climate-induced disturbances.","{""Anderegg, Leander D.

Current Situation And Existing Problems Of Agricultural Informatization In China,"This paper analyzes the development trends of frontier technology for agricultural informatization including five aspects of agricultural sensor technology, precision farming technology, agricultural robot technology, agricultural internet of things technology, and agricultural information service technology. It also discusses the existing problems in the development of frontier technology for agricultural informatization in China and proposes corresponding countermeasures. Firstly, the paper introduces the frontier techniques for agricultural informatization. For advanced agricultural sensor technology, three types of techniques are described, namely life information sensing technique, environmental information sensing technique, and comprehensive information collecting technique. For precision farming technology and intelligent equipment, onboard farmland information collection technique, precision farming positioning and controlling technique, decision model and prescription generating technique, and precise implementation technique are described. For agricultural intelligent robot technology, terrestrial mobile platform navigation and control technique and action planning technique are introduced. For agricultural internet of things technology and equipment, several issues are discussed including the sophisticated monitoring and scheduling of resources, ecological environment monitoring and management, agricultural product quality safety traceability, etc. For agricultural information service technology, frontier techniques and applications for agricultural remote sensing and agricultural information resource value-added services are evaluated. Major problems existed in the development of agricultural informatization technology in China are also discussed. For agricultural sensor technology, the existing problems include that the agricultural information dynamic sensing technique needs to be improved, advanced agricultural sensor technique and industry development are not perfect, and agricultural sensor after-sales supports arenot sufficient. For precision farming technology and intelligent equipment, China has not had its 3S technical support system that is suitable for agricultural applications and its intelligent equipment research and development is not sufficient. For agricultural robot technology, the research direction selection is very subjective, and the research content mainly focuses on the planting industry. Leading robot research agencies rarely involve the agriculture domain. For the industrialization of agricultural robot, related domestic patents are not sufficient and foreign companies take a large market share. For agricultural internet of things technology and equipment, there are also some problems in the technology standard, security, industrialization, application and promotion. For agricultural information services, agricultural remote sensor practicality needs to be improved, software development capability is not sufficient, and the service targets are not well trained. Finally, suggestions are proposed as countermeasures to the existing problems. Agricultural information technology innovation needs to be accelerated. Major engineering projects need to be established to support the informatization development. Subsidies for agricultural informatization need to be implemented. Agricultural informatization standards and evaluation system need to be improved. Researches show that agricultural sensor technology is the basis of agricultural information acquisition and informatization. Precision farming technology represents today's advanced level of agricultural equipment. Agricultural robot technology is an important research direction for agricultural intelligent equipment in the future. Agricultural internet of things technology is an effective means of agricultural supervision and quality monitoring. Agricultural information service technology is more and more focusing on the key technical problems of cloud storage, cloud computing, cloud service and mobile internet in agricultural info mation services.","{""Chen, W."",""Guo, S.""}",chen_currentsituationexistingagricultural_2013,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
"Habitat Conservation, Ethanol, And Recent Us Federal Farm Bills: A Gis Study Exploring Conservation Reserve Program Trends Pre-And Post-Ethanol Expansion In The Upper Midwest","Farmland in the Upper Midwest, USA, planted to corn has increased significantly in the past decade due to a rush toward ethanol production for fuel. Much of this increase came from fields that were previously protected under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a Federal land retirement incentive. This Geographic Information Systems (GIS) study quantifies these land changes in Minnesota, a northern state in the U.S. Corn Belt, prior to the past decade using 1997 and 2008 CRP GIS data layers for individual fields. Currently available CRP enrollment data by county masks significant changes occurring on a field-level scale, data which is no longer publicly available. Results suggest that marginal lands better suited for riparian wildlife habitat and surface water protection were plowed under in favor of industrial corn production. This was especially notable with fields in close proximity to refineries or those in drinking water supply management or groundwater contamination susceptibility areas. Federal ethanol mandates, farm bill policies, and high corn prices contribute to the pressure to farm these sensitive lands. Currently, CRP enrollments are capped at 9.7 million hectares, reduced from a long-standing 13-million-hectare cap by the 2014 farm bill. Discussions are now underway in the U.S. Congress to craft the 2018 farm bill and farming and conservation interests are strongly urging the Federal government to restore the 13-million-hectare enrollment cap. Ecosystem functions and benefits are optimized when conservation efforts are maintained over long periods and not interrupted by short-Term political or economic trends.

Biophysical And Policy Drivers Of Landscape Change In A Central Vietnamese District,"Conservation in a dynamic setting requires understanding the factors leading to landscape change. This study integrated traditional remote sensing and geographic information systems analysis techniques with a narrative policy analysis to assess the 19752004 land cover changes and their determinants in Nam Dong district (central Vietnam). Total forest cover of Nam Dong remained stable, but there were major transitions within forest and non-forest categories. Recent policy initiatives, particularly forest land allocation, have resulted in short-term benefit maximization through land speculation and illegal logging, while increased awareness of the economic potential of forests and their products have motivated people to access forests more frequently, leading to a highly dynamic landscape and increased barriers to forest conservation. This study suggests that (1) state-sponsored logging needs to be reduced, (2) forest allocation should proceed more rapidly to give farmers better incentive to improve and protect allocated forests, and (3) small-scale industry should increase. Forest conservation policy must be amended. More research is needed to link household land-use choices with policies, and determine how those choices lead to changes in the landscape.","{""Honda, Kiyoshi"",Thiha,""Webb, Edward L.""}",thihaandwebb_biophysicalpolicydriverslandscape_2007,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Monitoring Of Wetland Inundation Dynamics In The Delmarva Peninsula Using Landsat Time-Series Imagery From 1985 To 2011,"Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, the provision of which is largely controlled by fluctuations in inundation and soil saturation. Inundation is highly dynamic and can vary substantially through time in response to multiple drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration. This research focused on developing a practical and effective framework for regional, long-term monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics using airborne LiDAR intensity data (Lang et al., 2013) and Landsat time-series imagery. Subpixel water fraction (SWF) maps indicating the percent of surface water within each 30-m pixel were generated on an annual basis over the entire Delmarva Peninsula on the East Coast of the United States from 1985 to 2011. Comprehensive accuracy assessments of the SWF maps were conducted using historical high-resolution aerial photography to determine the reference condition. The assessment resulted in an estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.78% for the sample of open water areas (mean SWF was ~ 40% for this region of the map). Moreover, a separate accuracy assessment targeting inundation in wetlands (i.e. presence or absence of water) yielded an overall accuracy of 93%. Accuracies derived indicated that Landsat data can be calibrated to accurately extract long-term water information at the regional scale. Characteristics of inundation were examined with respect to different wetland types defined by water regime and dominant vegetation types, as well as different physical drivers. Results showed that tidal wetlands typically exhibited more intensive inundation than nontidal wetlands, and a higher degree of inundation was associated with emergent wetlands compared to wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation. Analysis of change drivers revealed that tide exerted a statistically significant influence on coastal inundation with r2 values of 32â€“36% and p < 0.01, whereas inundation changes in inland wetland areas were in part driven by precipitation with r2 values of 25â€“34% and p < 0.08. Because an up-to-date archive of Landsat imagery is globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable, the developed framework can be easily implemented to generate a continuous inundation record in many regions of the globe to assist in ongoing and future studies focused on wetland hydrology and wetland management.

"Estimating Aboveground Biomass Using Sentinel-2 Msi Data And Ensemble Algorithms For Grassland In The Shengjin Lake Wetland, China","Wetland vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) directly indicates wetland ecosystem health and is critical for water purification, carbon cycle, and biodiversity conservation. Accurate AGB estimation is essential for the monitoring and supervision of ecosystems, especially in seasonal floodplain wetlands. This paper explored the capability of spectral and texture features from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for modeling grassland AGB using random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in Shengjin Lake wetland (a Ramsar site). We use five-fold cross-validation to verify the model effectiveness. The results indicated that the RF and XGBoost models had a robust and efficient performance (with root mean square error (RMSE) of 126.571 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.844 for RF, RMSE of 112.425 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.869 for XGBoost), and the XGBoost models, by contrast, performed better. Both traditional and red-edge vegetation indices (VIs) obtained satisfactory results of AGB estimation (RMSE = 127.936 g center dot m(-2), RMSE = 125.879 g center dot m(-2) in XGBoost models, respectively), with the red-edge VIs contributed more to the AGB models. Moreover, we selected eight gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures calculated by four processing window sizes using the mean value of four offsets, and further analyzed the results of three analysis sets. Textures derived from traditional and red-edge bands using a 7 x 7 window size performed better in biomass estimation. This finding suggested that textures derived from the traditional bands were as important as the red-edge bands. The introduction of textures moderately improved the accuracy of modeling AGB, whereas the use of textures alo ne was not satisfactory. This research demonstrated that using the Sentinel-2 MSI and the two ensemble algorithms is an effective method for long-term dynamic monitoring and assessment of grass AGB in seasonal floodplain wetlands, which can support sustainable management and carbon accounting of wetland ecosystems.","{""Li, Chunhua"",""Xu, Wenbin"",""Zhou, Lizhi""}",li_estimatingabovegroundbiomasssentinel_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Annual Change Analysis Of Mangrove Forests In China During 1986-2021 Based On Google Earth Engine,"Mangroves are a key type of protected coastal wetland, with a range of benefits such as protection from wave damage, sand fixation, water purification and ecological tourism. As the academic knowledge of mangroves has gradually increased, the use of remote sensing to monitor their dynamic changes in China has become a hot topic of discussion and has received attention in academic circles. Remote sensing has also provided necessary auxiliary decision-making suggestions and data support for the scientific and rational conservation, restoration and management of mangrove resources. In this paper, we used Landsat satellite series data combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and adaptive threshold partitioning (OTSU method) to monitor mangrove dynamics in coastal China from 1986 to 2021 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE), with three main results. (1) Based on the massive data and efficient computational capability of the GEE platform, we achieved large-scale interannual mangrove distribution extraction. The overall classification accuracy for 2019 exceeded 0.93, and the mangrove distribution extraction effect was good. (2) The total mangrove area and the mean patch size in China showed overall increasing trends, and Guangdong and Guangxi were the top two provinces in China in terms of the largest mangrove area. (3) Except for Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve, the mangrove areas in other national mangrove reserves mainly showed increasing trends, confirming the effectiveness of the reserves. Data on the spatial structure and area trends of mangroves in China can provide scientific references for mangrove conservation and development, and serve in the further restoration of mangrove ecosystems.","{""Cao, Jingjing"",""Liu, Kai"",""Peng, Liheng"",""Wang, Ziyu"",""Wen, Xin""}",wang_annualchangeanalysismangrove_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
How Federal Health-Care Policies Interface With Urban And Rural Areas: A Comparison Of Three Systems,"Global public health policies span national borders and affect multitudes of people. The spread of infectious disease has neither political nor economic boundaries, and when elevated to a status of pandemic proportions, immediate action is required. In federal systems of government, the national level leads the policy formation and implementation process, but also collaborates with supranational organisations as part of the global health network. Likewise, the national level of government cooperates with sub-national governments located in both urban and rural areas. Rural areas, particularly in less developed countries, tend to have higher poverty rates and lack the benefits of proper medical facilities, communication modes and technology to prevent the spread of disease. From the perspective of epidemiological surveillance and intervention, this article will examine federal health policies in three federal systems: Australia, Malaysia and the USA. Using the theoretical foundations of collaborative federalism, this article specifically examines how collaborative arrangements and interactions among governmental and non-governmental actors help to address the inherent discrepancies that exist between policy implementation and reactions to outbreaks in urban and rural areas. This is considered in the context of the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, which spread significantly across the globe in 2009 and is now in what has been termed the 'post-pandemic era'.

"The Influence Of ""Green"" Roofs On The Energy Efficiency Of Residential Buildings In The City Of Tula","The need to improve the thermal engineering characteristics of the enclosing structures of construction objects and the increasing interest of the state in the development of environmental policy increase the prospects for studying the technology of ""green"" roofs because they are capable to solve comprehensively issues of energy efficiency and environmental safety. The object of the study is modern technological solutions of ""green"" roofs, the subject of the study is the analysis of the thermo-physical properties of coatings using ""green"" roof systems, the objectives of the study include: justification of the need to implement the above systems in the current climatic conditions, market analysis of the solutions offered by leading manufacturers of ""green"" coatings, the implementation of comparative thermal engineering calculations, calculations of stationary and non-stationary heat transfer in the thickness of coating structures. In the course of the study, data from official statistics websites, publicly available satellite images of remote sensing and also mathematical analysis methods, including methods of correlation and regression analysis, forecasting trends based on the obtained indicators were used. To perform the calculations, the Excel software package and the ELCUT engineering analysis computer program that allows two-dimensional modelling in solving thermal problems were used. Statistical data on the provision of residents of the region with public green spaces have been formed and analysis of the environmental parameters of the territory was carried out with the creation of a correlation and regression model, also forecast values. The results of the temperature distribution fields for stationary and non-stationary heat transfer of two types of ""green"" roof construction are obtained, taking into account various parameters of finishing the inner surface of the coating. Statistical environmental data that was generated using mathematical analysis methods made it possible to determine the environmental risks of the region, to create a basis for further research on the territory of the Tula region. The energy efficiency indicators of various types of ""green"" roofs, obtained as a result of thermal engineering calculations, as well as the identified accumulation capabilities, allowed us to draw conclusions about the prospects for the introduction of ""green"" technologies and the need for further research in the field of energy conservation and thermal inertia of enclosing structures of construction objects.","{""Lapin, Alexei Yu."",""Sysoeva, Elena V.""}",lapin_influencegreenroofsenergy_2023,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Assessment And Attribution Of Mangrove Forest Changes In The Indian Sundarbans From 2000 To 2020,"The Indian Sundarbans, together with Bangladesh, comprise the largest mangrove forest in the world. Reclamation of the mangroves in this region ceased in the 1930s. However, they are still subject to adverse environmental influences, such as sediment starvation due to migration of the main river channels in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta over the last few centuries, cyclone landfall, wave action from the Bay of Bengal-changing hydrology due to upstream water diversion-and the pervasive effects of relative sea-level rise. This study builds on earlier work to assess changes from 2000 to 2020 in mangrove extent, genus composition, and mangrove 'health' indicators, using various vegetation indices derived from Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery by performing maximum likelihood supervised classification. We show that about 110 km(2) of mangroves disappeared within the reserve forest due to erosion, and 81 km(2) were gained within the inhabited part of Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) through plantation and regeneration. The gains are all outside the contiguous mangroves. However, they partially compensate for the losses of the contiguous mangroves in terms of carbon. Genus composition, analyzed by amalgamating data from published literature and ground-truthing surveys, shows change towards more salt-tolerant genus accompanied by a reduction in the prevalence of freshwater-loving Heiritiera, Nypa, and Sonneratia assemblages. Health indicators, such as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), show a monotonic trend of deterioration over the last two decades, which is more pronounced in the sea-facing parts of the mangrove forests. An increase in salinity, a temperature rise, and rainfall reduction in the pre-monsoon and the post-monsoon periods appear to have led to such degradation. Collectively, these results show a decline in mangrove area and health, which poses an existential threat to the Indian Sundarbans in the long term, especially under scenarios of climate change and sea-level rise. Given its unique values, the policy process should acknowledge and address these threats.","{""Chanda, Abhra"",""French, Jon R."",""Giri, Sandip"",""Hazra, Sugata"",""Mondal, Partho P."",""Nicholls, Robert J."",""Samanta, Sourav""}",samanta_assessmentattributionmangroveforest_2021,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Development And Validation Of The Medication Regimen Simplification Guide For Residential Aged Care (Mrs Grace),"Background: Residents of aged care facilities use increasingly complex medication regimens. Reducing unnecessary medication regimen complexity (eg, by consolidating the number of administration times or using alternative formulations) may benefit residents and staff. Objective: To develop and validate an implicit tool to facilitate medication regimen simplification in aged care facilities. Method: A purposively selected multidisciplinary expert panel used modified nominal group technique to identify and prioritize factors important in determining whether a medication regimen can be simplified. The five prioritized factors were formulated as questions, pilottested using non-identifiable medication charts and refined by panel members. The final tool was validated by two clinical pharmacists who independently applied the tool to a random sample of 50 residents of aged care facilities to identify opportunities for medication regimen simplification. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohenâ€™s kappa. Results: The Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE (MRS GRACE) was developed as an implicit tool comprising of five questions about 1) the resident; 2) regulatory and safety requirements; 3) drug interactions; 4) formulation; and 5) facility and follow-up considerations. Using MRS GRACE, two pharmacists independently simplified medication regimens for 29/50 and 30/50 residents (Cohenâ€™s kappa=0.38, 95% CI 0.12â€“0.64), respectively. Simplification was possible for all residents with five or more administration times. Changing an administration time comprised 75% of the two pharmacistsâ€™ recommendations. Conclusions: Using MRS GRACE, two clinical pharmacists independently simplified over half of residentsâ€™ medication regimens with fair agreement. MRS GRACE is a promising new tool to guide medication regimen simplification in aged care. Â© 2018 Chen et al.","{""Alderman, C. P."",""Bell, J. S."",""Chen, E. Y.

Vocational Education And Training: The Terra Incognita Of Innovation Policy,"Is what is known from research on systemic innovation reflected in innovation policy, both as guiding principles and as actions? This paper highlights a major paradox in the translation of research on innovation into innovation policy in Australia. The innovation studies literature has established the central role of the vocational education and training (VET) system and VET-trained workers in technology generation, diffusion and incremental innovation. Research has also established that the pattern of innovation in Australia, compared with that in many other OECD countries, makes firms more reliant on VET skills to implement innovation. Despite this recognition in the innovation literature, this paper argues that the VET system is largely excluded from government innovation policy and programmes in Australia. Evidence for this exclusion is derived from a textual analysis of the principal Australian government policy statements and government-sponsored studies of the Australian innovation system, and from an analysis of the interest groups represented on government innovation advisory and policy structures. Tentative explanations are advanced for this exclusion and a number of important benefits are identified for the VET system and the wider innovation system arising from closer integration of VET into innovation policy","{""Dalitz, Robert"",""Toner, Phillip""}",toner_vocationaleducationtrainingterra_2012,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
Investigation Of Satellite Precipitation Product Driven Rainfall-Runoff Model Using Deep Learning Approaches In Two Different Catchments Of India,"Rainfall-runoff models are valuable tools for flood forecasting, management of water resources, and drought warning. With the advancement in space technology, a plethora of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) are available publicly. However, the application of the satellite data for the data-driven rainfall-runoff model is emerging and requires careful investigation. In this work, two satellite rainfall data sets, namely Global Precipitation Measurement-Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrieval Product V6 (GPM-IMERG) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), are evaluated for the development of rainfall-runoff models and the prediction of 1-day ahead streamflow. The accuracy of the data from the SPPs is compared to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)-gridded precipitation data set. Detection metrics showed that for light rainfall (1-10 mm), the probability of detection (POD) value ranges between 0.67 and 0.75 and with an increasing rainfall range, i.e., medium and heavy rainfall (10-50 mm and.50 mm), the POD values ranged from 0.24 to 0.45. These results indicate that the satellite precipitation performs satisfactorily with reference to the IMD-gridded data set. Using the daily precipitation data of nearly two decades (2000-2018) over two river basins in India's eastern part, artificial neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), and long short-time memory (LSTM) models are developed for rainfall-runoff modelling. One-day ahead runoff prediction using the developed rainfall-runoff modelling confirmed that both the SPPs are sufficient to drive the rainfall-runoff models with a reasonable accuracy estimated using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient, correlation coefficient, and the root-mean-squared error. In particular, the 1-day streamflow forecasts for the Vamsadhara river basin (VRB) using LSTM with GPM-IMERG inputs resulted in Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSC) values of 0.68 and 0.67, while ELM models for Mahanadhi river basin (MRB) with the same input resulted in NSC values of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, during training and validation stages. At the same time, the LSTM model with CHIRPS inputs for the VRB resulted in NSC values of 0.68 and 0.65, and the ELM model with CHIRPS inputs for the MRB resulted in NSC values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively, in training and validation stages. These results indicated that both the SPPs could reliably be used with LSTM and ELM models for rainfall-runoff modelling and streamflow prediction. This paper highlights that deep learning models, such as ELM and LSTM, with the GPM-IMERG products can lead to a new horizon to provide flood forecasting in flood-prone catchments.

"A Preliminary Study Of The Strata And Age Of Ancient Agricultural Terraces In The Ganjia Basin, Northeastern Tibetan Plateau","Agricultural terraces are a manifestation of man's ability to transform nature during the past thousands of years, and they have played an important role in the development of human society. The Ganjia Basin in Xiahe County, Gansu Province, is located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. A large area of banded landscape is distributed on the hills and piedmonts in the Ganjia Basin, which is claimed to be composed of large-scale abandoned ancient terraces. Based on fieldwork, satellite remote sensing data and GIS analysis in the present study, we found that the ancient terraces cover an area of 42.2 km2 and are mainly distributed on slopes between 2936 and 3326 m a.m.s.l. (meters above mean sea level) on both sides of the Yangqu River and its tributaries in the basin. Additionally, we analyzed various environmental proxies, including magnetic susceptibility (MS), grain size, the contents of total organic carbon (nitrogen) (TOC, TN), and palynological assemblages, from three representative sections of ancient agricultural terraces (GJAT-1, GJAT-1, and GJAT-3), and compared them with the MS values and clay content of a natural profile with accurate chronological control in the Ganjia Basin. The results indicate that the terraces are reclaimed paleosols dating to the Late Holocene (3000 kyr BP), and that the homogeneous MS values of the top 25-35 cm of the terrace profiles differ from those of the natural soil section, which confirms the existence of a cultivation layer in the terraces. However, the increases in the contents of TOC and TN above the cultivated layer, and the fact that the trend of MS in the terrace profile is broadly in line with the natural profile, indicate that the terraces were only used for a short interval and have been abandoned for a relatively long time. Combined with historical documentary evidence, we infer that the ancient Xiahe agricultural terraces were constructed as a result of the ""Gongjianshou (bowman) militia farming"" policy during the Northern Song China (1074-1125 CE). Climate reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere and northern China demonstrate that the temperature was higher and that the precipitation increased during this interval, providing a favorable environment for agricultural production. Overall, our results provide a typical example of societal adaptation to climate change in the past. Â© 2022, Science Press.

Land Use/Land Cover Analysis And Ecosystem Services Valuation In The Central Highlands Of Ethiopia,"We assessed the land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics and its associated changes in ecosystem service values for the Toke Kutaye district (ca 72,700Â ha) in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Four satellite images of the study area, distributed between 1973 andÂ 2014 were analyzed using Arc GIS software to assess the LULC changes of the area. In addition, we carried out an ecosystem services valuation, based on the identified LULC types and on the ecosystem services values database. Six LULC types were identified in the study area (forest, shrub/bush land, grassland, cultivated land, settlement, and bare land). Forest cover decreased 83% between 1973 and 2014. Settlement and cultivated land increased by 471 and 222%, respectively. The overall ecosystem services value reduced by 68%, and this was mainly due to deforestation. The use of LULC analysis combined to ecosystem services valuation improved our understanding of deforestation trends in the study area. We recommend the integration of LULC analysis and ecosystem service valuation as a tool that could better inform land managers and policy-makers in their decision-making processes.

Remote Sensing Prescription For Rice Nitrogen Fertilizer Recommendation Based On Improved Nfoa Model,"Precise fertilization of rice depends on the timely and effective acquisition of fertilizer application recommended by prescription maps in large-scale cropland, which can provide fertilization spatial information reference. In this paper, the prescription map was discussed based on the improved nitrogen fertilizer optimization algorithm (NFOA), using satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, and supplemented by meteorological data. Based on the principles of NFOA, firstly, remote sensing data and meteorological data were collected from 2019 to 2021 to construct a prediction model for the potential yield of rice based on the in-season estimated yield index (INSEY). Secondly, based on remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) and spectral features of bands, the grain nitrogen content (GNC) prediction model constructed using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to improve the values of GNC taken in the NFOA. The nitrogen demand for rice was calculated according to the improved NFOA. Finally, the nitrogen fertilizer application recommended prescription map of rice in large-scale cropland was generated based on UAV multispectral images, and the economic cost-effectiveness of the prescription map was analyzed. The analysis results showed that the potential yield prediction model of rice based on the improved INSEY had a high fitting accuracy (R-2 = 0.62). The accuracy of GNC estimated with the RF algorithm reached 96.3\% (RMSE = 0.07). The study shows that, compared with the non-directional and non-quantitative conventional tracking of N fertilizer, the recommended prescription map based on the improved NFOA algorithm in large-scale cropland can provide accurate information for crop N fertilizer variable tracking and provide effective positive references for the economic benefits of rice and ecological benefits of the field environment.","{""Li, Zhongyuan"",""Meng, Yang"",""Song, Xiaoyu"",""Xu, Sizhe"",""Xu, Xingang"",""Xue, Hanyu"",""Yang, Guijun"",""Yang, Min"",""Yang, Xaiodong"",""Zhu, Qilei""}",yang_remotesensingprescriptionrice_2022,FALSE,NA,sample_1000,NA,NA
An Assessment On The Change Of National Key Ecological Functional Zones Of Biodiversity Maintenance In 2011 And 2019,"Timely evaluation of habitat quality on national key ecological function zones for biodiversity conservation is an important scientific basis for the strategic planning and implementation measures of national biodiversity conservation. In this study, three factors including structure and function of ecosystem, ecological stress from social activities and response of human, were given priority consideration in the process of constructing a comprehensive index system of biodiversity assessment combining with previous research and pressure-state-response (PSR) framework model. Also, all indicators were processed by using weighted processing and normalization method and the comprehensive evaluation method of regional biodiversity were constructed based on remote sensing and GIS technology. Finally, the habitat quality status were assessed on the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance in 2011 and 2019. The results show that:(1) The population emigration generally occupy the dominant position in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance from 2011 to 2019, but road net density has increased significantly. The human interference index and the fragmentation degree of ecological space increases accordingly. (2) The comprehensive index of biological diversity assessment (BDI) in all ecological function zones generally were maintained at above 0.4, and ecological environment quality status were in mid and good grade in 2011 and 2019. (3) The average BDI value of ecological function zones increased from 0.582 to 0.606, and the proportion of ecological function zones in the mid and good grade increased from 61.5% to 76.9% from 2011 to 2019. (4) The BDI value of two ecological function zones has decreased, occupied 15.4% from 2011 to 2019. In the last ten years, the habit qualities in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance generally presents a trend toward better change. But controlling density of population, road network construction and ecological space fragmentation, and the construction of protection pattern based on the new territorial space planning, still are the key issues of biological diversity protection within a certain period. But population density, is critical pressures to biodiversity protection during future period of time, and increasing the area of nature reserve and strictly controlling is an effective pathway to relieve the stress. This evaluation method and index system had the characteristics of strong timeliness, simple operation and high efficiency, which could better reflect the actual status and change characteristics of biodiversity in the national key ecological function zones of biodiversity maintenance, and could be applied to regional scale biodiversity monitoring and evaluation.

Desertification Risk Analysis And Assessment In Northern Nigeria,"Changes in climatic conditions and human activities have led to increase in surface temperature, potential evapotranspiration and decrease in rainfall, thereby increasing desertification risk in the study area. Data used included Landsat images and meteorological data (1984â€“2015). Land use land cover change (LULCC) was estimated using maximum likelihood supervised classification. Land surface temperature (LST) was computed from thermal bands while desertification risk index was calculated using meteorological data from 5 weather stations and Normalized Differential Index (NDVI) values. The results from the LULCC revealed a significant reductions in rangeland by 13,418 Km2; while water body and rock out-crop were also affected by 1255 Km2 and 2592 Km2 respectively. The result also showed built-up and barren land with increase estimated at 5755 Km2 and 2016 11,512 Km2 respectively. LST increased by 2.8 Â°C from 1984 to 1999 and 2.7 Â°C from 1999 to 2014 with values at 43.8 Â°C in 1984, 46.6 Â°C in 1999 and 49.3 Â°C in 2015. A similar trend was observed from climatic data obtained while reduction in amount of rainfall was recorded over the years. Desertification Risk Index (DRI) was used to identify areas at risk with notable increase in 2014 encroaching south-ward. Desertification risk between 1984 and 1999 recorded the least threat with 1.32 and 8.53 as the lowest and highest risk rate while in 2014 it increased with the highest at 9.1 and the least value of 1.97.

An Air Quality Balance Index Estimating The Total Amount Of Air Pollutants At Ground Level,"A new index named Air Quality Balance Index (AQBI), which is able to characterise the amount of pollution level in a selected area, is proposed. This index is a function of the ratios between pollutant concentration values and their standards; it aims at identifying all situations in which there is a possible environmental risk even when several pollutants are below their limit values but air quality is reduced. AQBI is evaluated by using a high-resolution three-dimensional dispersion model: the air concentration for each substance is computed starting from detailed emissions sources: point, line and area emissions hourly modulated. This model is driven with accurate meteorological data from ground stations and remote sensing systems providing vertical profiles of temperature and wind; these data are integrated with wind and temperature profiles at higher altitudes obtained by a Local Area Model. The outputs of the dispersion model are compared with pollutant concentrations provided by measuring stations, in order to recalibrate emission data. A three-dimensional high resolution grid of AQBI data is evaluated for an industrial area close to Alessandria (Northern Italy), assessing air quality and environmental conditions. Performance of AQBI is compared with the Air Quality Index (AQI) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. AQBI, computed taking into account all pollutants, is able to point out situations not evidenced by AQI, based on a preset limited number of substances; therefore, AQBI is a good tool for evaluating the air quality either in urban and in industrial areas. The AQBI values at ground level, in selected points, are in agreement with in situ observations.

"Monitoring Of Urban Growth Of A Desert City Through Remote Sensing: Al-Ain, Uae, Between 1976 And 2000","The objective of this article is to investigate the development of Al Ain city, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), between 1976 and 2000, with particular reference to the spaceâ€“time relationship. Al Ain is the fastest changing city in the Arabian Peninsula. It has gone from a desert oasis to a thriving modern city in just over 30 years. Maps, colour aerial photographs, satellite imagery, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used as an aid for understanding the development of the city. Change and development in the city is evident from comparison of old maps, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery taken during 1976, 1978, 1984, 1994, 1998 and 2000. The city was found to have a tendency for major expansion in the direction of the west and south-west. Expansion in any direction was found to be governed by the availability of utilities (water, electricity), economic activities along roads (agriculture, industry), geographical constraints (valleys, sand dunes, mountains), and legal factors (boundary with Sultanate of Oman, planning and institutional rules). Many cities around the world are developed at the cost of agricultural areas, which are the main source of food. For example, in Tempe, Arizona between 1970 and 1979 and in Cairo. However, in Al Ain the research concludes that the development is based on conservation of agricultural areas (oases) and reclamation of the desert. Revenue from oil is a significant drive for this development, but even more important is the determination of the UAE government to proceed with the development.

Construction And Analysis Of Global World Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graph Based On Big Earth Data,"The global world cultural heritage ont and its environmental data are the basis for the recognition and protection of heritage values, as well as for the research, demonstration and sustainable use of heritage in the age of big data.Based on the network and earth big data, this paper constructs the knowledge map of the world cultural heritage by using the techniques of natural language processing, spatial analysis and domain knowledge map, and analyzes the landscape features, cultural continuity and spatial relationship between site and city and community based on knowledge map.A global world cultural heritage data set including 869 heritage sites and more than 200 types of attributes is reconstructed, and records the rich ontology of world cultural heritage and information about the characteristics of the environment. Then the data were organized in the form of a knowledge map. The research shows that the world cultural heritage site has the characteristics of distribution along the mountains and water systems, so it can refer to the geographical units, form the cultural heritage management and protection system with regional characteristics, and promote the sustainable development of the heritage site as a whole; Changes of the spatial distance between sites and cities or communities can be divided into three phases: the constant proximity period of 1990-2000, the slowdown in 2000-2015 and the acceleration of 2015-2018.The global world cultural heritage data were organized in the form of a knowledge map, which can support multiple attributes associated graph data mining and provide a basis for data reuse and deep processing. Based on the newly constructed data set, we also analyzed and verified the data set and knowledge map from the perspectives of the era and historical process of the heritage, the typical occurrence environment around the heritage, such as the distribution of mountains and water systems, and the changes of cities and communities, so as to meet the needs of global big data monitoring in the protection of world cultural heritage. And changes of the spatial relation between sites and cities show that continued attention needs to be paid to the impact of changes in urban and heritage site spatial relations on the sustainable development of heritage in the future.

Questionnaire Survey Of Hospitals In Saitama Prefecture Regarding The Shortage Of 99mtc-Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals And 99mo/99mtc Generators,"Objective and methods A questionnaire survey was conducted at all 32 hospitals in Saitama Prefecture to investigate the current difficult situation in terms of nuclear medicine management in the face of the mTc shortage due to insufficient supply, and 29 hospitals (90.6%) replied. Results Of the 29, 15 (51.7%) reported a reduction in the number of nuclear medicine studies performed due to the shortage of supply, although the reduction was small. The decrease per month was less than 20 studies in 73% of the institutions. Of the nuclear medicine studies that involve the use of mTc, the studies whose reduction in number most seriously affected patient management were, in decreasing order: mTc-MAA lung perfusion scans, mTc-MAG3, mTc-DTPA, or mTc-DMSA renoscans, mTc-MDP bone scans, mTc-HMPAO or ECD brain SPECT studies, mTc-MIBI or tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT studies, mTc-radiocolloid sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, mTc-HSA-D or pyrophosphate bleeding scans, mTc-GSA hepatic function reserve scans, and mTc-MIBI parathyroid scans. The reduction is probably ascribable to factors such as cancellations of emergency studies, absence of substitute studies, sequential studies using the same radiopharmaceutical, and higher cost of the syringe-type products than the vial-type products. Substitutes for mTc studies were performed at 52% (15/29) of the institutions. Myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl chloride was the most common substitute study. Conclusions The results of this survey suggested the several procedures to resolve the issues related to the shortage. The staffs at all institutions except one gave the impression that their nuclear medicine ordering systems had been greatly affected by the shortage of supply.

A Bayesian Approach To Decision Making In Applied Meteorology,"The problem of decision making in applied meteorology is approached from the point of view of decision theory and subjectivist statistics. The modern concept of ""utility"" is discussed, and optional rules for decision making based on the availability of a limited amount of meteorological data are presented and discussed. Bayes' theorem forms the basis for the statistical estimation of the frequencies of various alternative weather events. The method is applied to a single example for the purpose of illustration, but it is emphasized that the generality of these techniques is great and that they warrant further study.","Epstein, Edward S.",epstein_bayesianapproachdecisionapplied_1962,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,a bayesian approach to decision making i,1962

A Conceptual Framework For Assessing The Benefits Of A Global Earth Observation System Of Systems,"The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-ofSystems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Specifically, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and specifically, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the benefits of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal benefit areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a â€œbenefit chainâ€ concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the benefits, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and benefit curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.","Fritz, Steffen",fritz_conceptualframeworkassessingbenefits_2008,TRUE,"Benefit chain concept - causal pathway from incremental improvements in the observing system (cost = investment cost for marginal increase in EO effort) to better management and outcomes (benefit = marginal increase in societal benefits given a marginal increase in effort) - marginal cost-benefit ratio, i.e., shape of a logistic benefit-cost curve, max incremental benefit:cost is where the slope is steepest",soc_ben_repo,a conceptual framework for assessing the,2008
A Cost-Benefit Analysis Of The National Map,"The Geography Discipline of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted this cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of The National Map. This analysis is an evaluation of the proposed Geography Discipline initiative to provide the Nation with a \nmechanism to access current and consistent digital geospatial data. This CBA is a supporting document to accompany the Exhibit 300 Capital Asset Plan and Business Case of The National Map Reengineering Program. \nThe framework for estimating the benefits is based on expected improvements in processing information to perform any of the possible applications of spatial data. This analysis does not attempt to determine the benefits and costs of performing geospatial-data applications. Rather, it estimates the change in the differences between those benefits and costs with The National Map and the current situation without it. The estimates of total costs and benefits of The National Map were based on the projected implementation time, development and maintenance costs, rates of data inclusion and integration, expected usage levels over time, and a benefits estimation model. \nThe National Map provides data that are current, integrated, consistent, complete, and more accessible in order to decrease the cost of implementing spatial-data applications and (or) improve the outcome of those applications. The efficiency gains in per-application improvements are greater than the cost to develop and maintain The National Map, meaning that the program would bring a positive net benefit to the Nation. The average improvement in the net benefit of performing a spatial data application was multiplied by a simulated number of application implementations across the country.

A Decision Support System For Forest Fire Management,"Forest fires are considered natural phenomena but the magnitude of the problem can be attributed to poor forest management and to the extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, the abolishment of traditional activities related to forests has sent away people from the forests that they used to protect them. The aforementioned reasons result in the annual destruction of large forest areas, agricultural cultivations, industries, animals and even human lives. At the same time, catastrophic floods entail the gradual desolation of the affected areas and large amounts of carbon dioxide along with smoke particles aggravate air quality. In the present paper, a Decision Support System is proposed capable to support policy makers and services to counteract wildfires destruction danger in lowland Pine forests. The system is composed of two major components: (a) A Wildfire Destruction Danger Index useful for preventive and suppressive measures planning and decision policy making and (b) a Forest Management Planning Decision Support System useful for fire risk reduction through forest management plan. The open architecture of the system allows incorporation of data coming from external sources e.g. satellite systems, meteorological stations etc. All its subsystems can stand alone so as to satisfy the needs of responsible organisations (peripheral institutions of fire brigade, forest inspection and local authorities). The proposed system can be both used as an intergraded operational tool in forest fire management and as a training tool for personnel of various services involved.","Kaloudis, S.T.",kaloudis_decisionsupportsystemforest_2005,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,a decision support system for forest fir,2005
A Design For A Data And Information Service To Address The Knowledge Needs Of The Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus And Strategies To Facilitate Its Implementation,"Food security is essential to sustain human societies. Food production flourishes when water, energy, and land are abundant, but more often it is limited by scarcities in one or more of these resources. In particular, food production is limited by the relatively fixed amount of water that circulates in the hydrosphere, the lack of new land for crops in many countries, and the depletion of critical minerals and fossil fuels in many source regions. An integrated Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus planning and management approach promises improved resource efficiencies, new business opportunities, more coherent resource and environmental policies, and economies of scale for the data and information services underpinning better decision-making. This paper distills discussions on data and information from four regional workshops held as part of a Future Earth W-E-F Nexus Cluster project. The workshops reviewed ways to enhance the sustainability of the W-E-F Nexus through better governance; collecting, analyzing, and communicating data and information; and integrating both with management for better planning and decision-making. The focus of this paper is to explore the potential application of an integrated data and information system to enhance water, energy, and food sustainability. In particular, this paper's objective is to explore how a multisector W-E-F Nexus data and information system could be developed and operated to meet the planning and decision-making information needs of practitioners and to facilitate the implementation of the W-E-F Nexus concept. This â€œHypothesis and Theoryâ€ paper provides a hypothesis and system design and proposes steps that could be taken to implement and test the system in a W-E-F Nexus environment. Data and information, along with modern technologies, can play a central role in facilitating paradigm shifts that reinforce the W-E-F Nexus by explicitly assessing environmental services, meeting the growing urban food demand, valuing water and other resources used to produce food and energy for export, promoting resource use efficiency through integrated planning and management, and strengthening links between the W-E-F Nexus and appropriate Sustainable Development Goals.","Lawford, Richard",lawford_designdatainformationservice_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,a design for a data and information serv,2019
"A New Process For Organizing Assessments Of Social, Economic, And Environmental Outcomes: Case Study Of Wildland Fire Management In The Usa","Ecological risk assessments typically are organized using the processes of planning (a discussion among managers, stakeholders, and analysts to clarify ecosystem management goals and assessment scope) and problem formulation (evaluation of existing information to generate hypotheses about adverse ecological effects, select assessment endpoints, and develop an analysis plan). These processes require modification to be applicable for integrated assessments that evaluate ecosystem management alternatives in terms of their ecological, economic, and social consequences. We present 8 questions that define the steps of a new process we term integrated problem formulation (IPF), and we illustrate the use of IPF through a retrospective case study comparing 2 recent phases of development of the Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system, a planning and budgeting system for the management of wildland fire throughout publicly managed lands in the United States. IPF extends traditional planning and problem formulation by including the explicit comparison of management alternatives, the valuation of ecological, economic and social endpoints, and the combination or integration of those endpoints. The phase 1, limited prototype FPA system used a set of assessment endpoints of common form (i.e., probabilities of given flame heights over acres of selected land-resource types), which were specified and assigned relative weights at the local level in relation to a uniform national standard. This approach was chosen to permit system-wide optimization of fire management budget allocations according to a cost-effectiveness criterion. Before full development, however, the agencies abandoned this approach in favor of a phase 2 system that examined locally specified (rather than system-optimized) allocation alternatives and was more permissive as to endpoint form. We demonstrate how the IPF process illuminates the nature, rationale, and consequences of these differences, and argue that its early use for the FPA system may have enabled a smoother development path.","Bruins, Randall",bruins_processorganizingassessmentssocial_2009,FALSE,This is more about an improved decisionmaking process rather than anything about the ESI that goes into the decisionmaking,soc_ben_repo,a new process for organizing assessments,2009
A Scalable Earth Observations-Based Decision Support System For Hydropower Planning In Africa,"Hydropower is a key part of the increasing shift in power production from nonrenewables to renewable energy. In regions such as Africa, hydropower reservoirs are vital for achieving several sustainable development goals, including clean water, energy, and poverty elimination. However, the operations of hydropower reservoirs are often suboptimal due to the lack of hydrologic data for generating reliable inflow forecasts. Here, we present a decision support system (DSS) framework for hydropower planning at daily to seasonal time scales by combining data from earth observation satellites (EOS) with ensemble climate forecasts from dynamical models and hydrologic modeling. The large uncertainty inherent in satellite-based datasets is overcome by using a data validation framework which does not require ground-based measurements. In addition, an EOS evapotranspiration product is used as a proxy for streamflow in calibrating hydrologic models. Compared to a DSS forced with a climatological forecast (zero-skill), the hydropower production with the new DSS increased by 20%. The study highlights the advantage of using data from EOS in overcoming the issue of data scarcity in water resources applications, particularly in developing regions of the world such as Africa.","Koppa, Akash",koppa_scalableearthobservationsbased_2021,TRUE,Hydropower production improved through use of EO data instead of climatological forecast to inform inflow forecasts,soc_ben_repo,a scalable earth observations based deci,2021
A Transformative Concept: From Data Being Passive Objects To Data Being Active Subjects,"The exploitation of potential societal benefits of Earth observations is hampered by users having to engage in often tedious processes to discover data and extract information and knowledge. A concept is introduced for a transition from the current perception of data as passive objects (DPO) to a new perception of data as active subjects (DAS). This transition would greatly increase data usage and exploitation, and support the extraction of knowledge from data products. Enabling the data subjects to actively reach out to potential users would revolutionize data dissemination and sharing and facilitate collaboration in user communities. The three core elements of the transformative DAS concept are: (1) â€œintelligent semantic data agentsâ€ (ISDAs) that have the capabilities to communicate with their human and digital environment. Each ISDA provides a voice to the data product it represents. It has comprehensive knowledge of the represented product including quality, uncertainties, access conditions, previous uses, user feedbacks, etc., and it can engage in transactions with users. (2) A knowledge base that constructs extensive graphs presenting a comprehensive picture of communities of people, applications, models, tools, and resources and provides tools for the analysis of these graphs. (3) An interaction platform that links the ISDAs to the human environment and facilitates transaction including discovery of products, access to products and derived knowledge, modifications and use of products, and the exchange of feedback on the usage.

A User-Driven Approach To Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities For Societal Benefit,"In order to help data providers make informed decisions regarding the availability and accessibility of Earth observations for societal benefit, a cross-sectoral meta-analysis of observation priorities was conducted from the perspective of users. The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observationsâ€™ (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Usersâ€™ needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs. The 10 highest ranked observations are: (1) Precipitation, (2) Soil Moisture, (3) Surface Air Temperature, (4) Land Cover, (5) Surface Wind Speed (6) Vegetation Cover, (7) Surface Humidity, (8) Urbanization, (9) Vegetation Type, and (10) Surface Wind Direction and Sea Surface Temperature (tie). This study represents one viable method to assess the priority of Earth observations from the perspective of users. The list of critical Earth observation priorities from this study is a foundation for engagement between data providers and users in regard to observation priorities.","Zell, Erica",zell_userdrivenapproachdetermining_2012,FALSE,Keep in mind for identifying gaps later on - papers that present priorities compared to implementations,soc_ben_repo,a user driven approach to determining cr,2012
A Benefit-Cost Analysis Of A Regional Global Ocean Observing System: Seawatch Europe,"The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a joint effort of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, the World Meteorological Organlsation (WMO) and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). GOOS will provide long-term ocean data based on a globally coordinated strategy. These data will be used for climate forecasting. The Seawatch Europe project of the European Marine environment programme (EUROMAR) Is an on-line monitoring and surveillance system of the North Sea and Is a regional component of GOOS. Seawetch forecasts and environmental data are distributed to public authorities, aquecuiture/fish farming, commercial fishing, tourist Industry, research Institutes, navy and coastguards. The Seawatch system Is now operative In Norway and Thailand. it is at present Installed In Spain, and Indonesia Seawatch has aroused considerable Interest In Sweden, The Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Mexico, China, Korea and the USA. In this paper some of the results of a benefit-coat analysis of the Seawatch System are discuseed. So far the main revenues occur in the oll and gas exploitation, commercial flsherless end fish farming, tourism, meteorological forecasting, crises management etc. It is calculated that in the North Sea, a delay of 105 minutes in startup of the productional of a well will cover the costs of Seawatch. The global potential for the Seawatch System in the Exclusive Economic Zone is an estimated 50 units of ten buoys with a running cost of $100 million per year. A strong point of the Seawatch system is that it is commercially off-the-shelf technology. Seawatch is, however, still competing with academic and governmental institutions for funds when viewed as either a research venture or an operational programme. It is important for public authorities at the national and international level to participate in Seawatch and help to steer it towards the potential it was designed to fulfil namely a building stone of GOOS.","Stel, Jan H.",stel_benefitcostanalysisregional_1996,TRUE,"Not satellite, bu network of global ocean observing system - cost-benefit analysis, societal benefits relative to cost.

A Method For Estimating The Socioeconomic Impact Of Earth Observations In Wildland Fire Suppression Decisions,"A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations is proposed and deployed. The core of the method is the analysis of outcomes of hypothetical fire suppression scenarios generated using a coupled atmosphereâ€“fire behaviour model, based on decisions made by an experienced wildfire incident management team with and without the benefits of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite observations and the WRF-SFIRE wildfire behaviour simulation system. The scenarios were based on New Mexicoâ€™s 2011 Las Conchas fire. For each scenario, fire break line location decisions served as inputs to the model, generating fire progression outcomes. Fire model output was integrated with a property database containing thousands of coordinates and property values and other asset values to estimate the total losses associated with each scenario. An attempt to estimate the socioeconomic impact of satellite and modelling data used during the decision-making process was made. We analysed the impact of Earth observations and include considerations for estimating other socioeconomic impacts.","Herr, Vincent",herr_methodestimatingsocioeconomicimpact_2020,TRUE,Hypothetical scenarios of fire suppression decisions with and without MODIS data.

"A Performance, Semantic And Service Qualityenhanced Distributed Search Engine For Improving Geospatial Resource Discovery","Geospatial resource discovery is a critical step for developing geographic science applications. With the increasing number of geospatial resources available online, many Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) components (e.g. catalogues and portals) have been developed to help manage and discover geospatial resources. However, efficient and accurate geospatial resource discovery is still a big challenge because of the heterogeneity and complexity of decentralized network environments and interdisciplinary semantics. In this article, we report a search engine framework for efficient geospatial resource discovery, which reduces integration costs by leveraging existing Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) components. Specifically, (1) the framework provides integration capability and flexibility by adopting the brokering approach, implementing a â€˜plug-inâ€™-based framework for metadata processing and proposing a dynamically configurable search workflow; (2) the asynchronous messaging and batch processing-based metadata record retrieval mode enhances the search performance and user interactivity; (3) an embedded semantic support system improves the discovery recall level and precision by providing semantic-based search rule creation and result similarity evaluation functions and (4) the engine assists user decision-making by integrating a service quality monitoring and evaluation system, data/service visualization tools, multiple views and additional information. Experiments and a search example show that the proposed engine helps both scientists and general users search for more accurate results with enhanced performance and user experience through a user-friendly interface.","Gui, Zhipeng",gui_performancesemanticservicequalityenhanced_2013,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,a performance semantic and service quali,2013
"A Political History Of U.s. Commercial Remote Sensing, 1984-2007: Conflict, Collaboration, And The Role Of Knowledge In The High-Tech World Of Earth Observation Satellites","The political history of U.S. commercial remote sensing began in 1984 when the U.S. government first attempted to commercialize its civil earth observation satellite system â€“ Landsat. Since then, the high technology of earth imaging satellite systems has generated intense debates and policy conflicts, primarily centered on U.S. government concerns over the national security and foreign policy implications of high-resolution commercial satellite systems. Conversely, proponents of commercial observation satellites have urged U.S. policymakers to recognize the scientific and socio-economic utility of commercial remote sensing and thus craft and implement regulatory regimes that allow for a greater degree of information openness and transparency in using earth observation satellite imagery. This dissertation traces and analyzes that tumultuous political history and examines the policy issues and social construction of commercial remote sensing to determine the role of knowledge in the effective crafting and execution of commercial remote sensing laws and policies.\nAlthough individual and organizational perspectives, interests, missions, and cultures play a significant role in the social construction of commercial observation satellite systems and programs, the problem of insufficient knowledge of the myriad dimensions and complex nature of commercial remote sensing is a little studied but important component of this social construction process. Knowledge gaps concerning commercial remote sensing extend to various dimensions of the subject matter, such as the global, economic, technical, and legal/policy aspects.\nNumerous examples of knowledge voids are examined to suggest a connection between deficient knowledge and divergent policy perceptions as they relate to commercial remote sensing. Relevant knowledge voids are then structurally categorized to demonstrate the vastness and complexity of commercial remote sensing policy issues and to offer recommendations on how to fill such knowledge gaps to effect increased collaboration between the US government and the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry. Finally, the dissertation offers suggestions for future STS studies on policy issues, particularly those that focus on the global dimensions of commercial remote sensing or on applying the knowledge gap concept advanced by this dissertation to other areas of science and technology policymaking.","Kenneth, Thompson",kenneth_politicalhistoryu.scommercial_2007,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,a political history of u s commercial re,2007

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has recently funded activities to enhance remote sensing inputs to FEWS NET. A professional review was conducted to elicit Earth observation requirements for FEWS NET. It focused upon operational requirements of FEWS NET end-users to determine qualities of useful remote sensing data and data products. In this manner, properties of certain biophysical predictions that would be beneficial as FEWS NET supplementary inputs could be ascertained. Reviewers were asked to evaluate the importance of environmental variables and spatiotemporal requirements for Earth science data inputs, particularly for rainfall and vegetation products. The review was implemented in 2007 as an online questionnaire and was completed by more than 40 experts from around the world. This professional review questionnaire was shown to be a viable tool for the rapid derivation, compilation, and analysis of requirements necessary to enhance FEWS NET.

Agricultural Producers' Willingness To Pay For Real-Time Mesoscale Weather Information,"Mesoscale weather networks can provide improved weather information to agricultural producers. This technology can potentially improve production decisions, reduce irrigation and pesticide inputs, and reduce weather-related losses. Developing a mesoscale network to disseminate real-time mesoscale weather information requires a substantial investment. In addition, there are costs associated with maintenance of the system and distribution of the information available. While public funds may be available to support initial development of the system, there may be less public support for maintaining the system and subsidizing users' access to the information. This study uses the contingent valuation technique to determine the willingness of Oklahoma farmers and ranchers, as one set of potential users, to pay for real-time mesoscale weather information.

Agricultural Value Of Enso Information Under Alternative Phase Definition,"The El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect has been found to be associated with regional climate variations in many regions of the world, and, in turn, with variation in crop yields. Previous studies have found that early releases of ENSO phase information could permit agricultural producers to make adjustments in their decisions and in turn generate an increase in agricultural sector welfare. This study examines whether the value of the agricultural responses can be enhanced by releasing more detailed ENSO information. Namely we evaluate the implications for projected agricultural welfare under release and adaptation to the Stone and Auliciems five phase definition of ENSO states as opposed to the more standard three phase definition. This value is estimated using a stochastic, U.S./global agricultural model representing 22 climate years. The results indicate that the release and exploitation of the more detailed ENSO phase definition almost doubles the welfare impact.

An Analysis Of The Value Of Additional Information Provided By A Water Quality Measurement Network,"European Community policy concerning water is placing increasing demands on the acquisition of information about the quality of aquatic environments. The cost of this information has led to a reflection on the rationalization of monitoring networks and, therefore, on the economic value of information produced by these networks. The aim of this article is to contribute to this reflection. To do so, we used the Bayesian framework to define the value of additional information in relation to the following three parameters: initial assumptions (prior probabilities) on the states of nature, costs linked to a poor decision (error costs) and accuracy of additional information. We then analyzed the impact of these parameters on this value, particularly the combined role of prior probabilities and error costs that increased or decreased the value of information depending on the initial uncertainty level. We then illustrated the results using a case study of a stream in the Bas-Rhin department in France.","Destandau, Francois",destandau_analysisadditionalinformationprovided_2016,TRUE,VOI/Bayesian decision theory - economic benefit of improved decision in water quality measurement network,soc_ben_repo,an analysis of the value of additional i,2016
An Economic Value Of Remote-Sensing Information: Application To Agricultural Production And Maintaining Groundwater Quality,"Does remote-sensing information provide economic benefits to society, and can a value be assigned to those benefits? Can resource management and policy decisions be better informed by coupling past and present Earth observations with groundwater nitrate measurements? Using an integrated assessment approach, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) applied an established conceptual framework to answer these questions, as well as to estimate the value of information (VOI) for remote-sensing imagery. The approach uses moderate-resolution land-imagery (MRLI) data from the Landsat and Advanced Wide Field Sensor satellites that has been classified by the National Agricultural Statistics Service into the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Within the constraint of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s public health threshold for potable groundwater resources, the USGS modeled the relation between a population of the CDLâ€™s land uses and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers in a case study region in northeastern Iowa. Employing various multiscaled, multitemporal geospatial datasets with MRLI to maximize the value of agricultural production, the approach develops and uses multiple environmental science models to address dynamic nitrogen loading and transport at specified distances from specific sites (wells) and at landscape scales (for example, across 35 counties and two aquifers). In addition to the ecosystem service of potable groundwater, this effort focuses on the use of MRLI for the management of the major land uses in the study regionâ€”the production of corn and soybeans, which can impact groundwater quality. Derived methods and results include (1) economic and dynamic nitrate-pollution models, (2) probabilities of the survival of groundwater, and (3) a VOI for remote sensing. For the northeastern Iowa study region, the marginal benefit of the MRLI VOI (in 2010 dollars) is $858 million Â± $197 million annualized, which corresponds to a net present value of $38.1 billion Â± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits in perpetuity. Given that these economic estimates are derived from one case study in a part of only one State, the estimates provide a lower estimate related to the potential value of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission.","Forney, W.M.",forney_economicremotesensinginformation_2012,TRUE,"Model of regulations that affect crop prices and input costs, summed over time, to optimize agricultural production/profit while avoiding increase in groundwater pollytion? then feeds into a VOI comparison looking at outward expansion of PPF due to new tech",soc_ben_repo,an economic value of remote sensing info,2012

The accumulated annual benefit to farmers in the Merredin region (an area with 754 farm holdings over 35,500 km2 of land) is approximately 2 million dollars. Hence, support is given for the development of seasonal forecasting techniques in Western Australia.","Petersen, E.H.",petersen_assessmentseasonalforecastingtechnology_2001,TRUE,NA,soc_ben_repo,an assessment of the value of seasonal f,2001
Analysis Of Past Funding For Noaa's Satellite Programs,"This report provides an analysis of Federal funding for the operational civil environmental satellite program during the fiscal years 1971 through 1985. Both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budgets are examined. Four reasons for recent NOAA satellite funding increases are discussed: (1) responsibilities shifted from NASA to NOAA; (2) NASA decisions that required NOAA system changes; (3) an expanded NOAA satellite mission; and (4) exceptional inflation in the aerospace industry. The analysis reveals a decrease in the real cost of the service component of the satellite program over the years. It also concludes that there has been no growth in the cost of those program components traditionally funded by NOAA, and that only a few percent increase in cost has been experienced in the sum of program funding provided by both NOAA and NASA over the 15-year period.

"Application Of Earth Observation Dataset And Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Technique For Forest Fire Risk Assessment In Sikkim, India","Forest fire is one of the primary and recurring problems in Sikkim, India impacting the ecological heritage of the region. The article presents a fire risk model based on the identification of the major factors that contribute to forest fire, namely, vegetation type, vegetation density, land surface temperature, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance from settlements, rivers and roads, and then integrating them using a multi-criteria decision-making technique in a GIS framework. We document that more than 50% of the area of all the districts except North Sikkim falls into high to moderate risk zones. The model shows that 61% of fire information for resource management system data for the last 16 years coincide with the mapped high-risk zone of the state. Areas with low slope and with moderate vegetation density fall into very high risk, whereas areas with high slope and with high vegetation density correspond to moderate risk zones. Further, aspect and density of human intervention differentiate the very high and high-risk zones of the region. This model has provided a robust geographical representation of fire ignition probability and identification of high-risk areas at different regions for the entire state of Sikkim.","Laha, Arnab",laha_applicationearthobservationdataset_2021,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,application of earth observation dataset,2021

As Seen From Space: Tele-Epidemiological Data As Pandemic Memory,"In the modern world, data is instrumental in historical storytelling. The magnitude of events, who they impacted, and the degree to which the events were managed are all, very often, told through the lens of data. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of such data-driven history, where statistics on infections, death, vaccination, and average mobility are used to tell the story of how the pandemic unfolded in a given locale. While such statistical history is useful, it can also efface the histories of locations that lack access to the proper surveillance infrastructure, or are otherwise unable to deploy it. This produces an erasure of pandemic memory in healthcare-challenged areas, as deaths and infections go unrecorded and undocumented. This paper proposes the use of satellites to correct this, using Earth observation technologies to track viral vectors and find and document mass burial sites to produce a fuller picture of pandemic history, with an emphasis on filling the statistical gaps between the developed and developing world.","Gleason, Louis",gleason_spaceteleepidemiologicaldata_2022,FALSE,"Tele-epidemiology - addressing disparities in data to fill gaps and provide a better understanding of pandemic history.

Ascribing Societal Benefit To Environmental Observations Of Earth From Space: The Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (Misr),"At the request of managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this paper describes frameworks for and illustrates societal benefits associated with Earth observations from an experimental satellite known as the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). MISR is a unique camera that images Earth's atmosphere and other characteristics simultaneously from nine angles. This multiangle perspective enhances our ability to measure and monitor dimensions of climate, weather, air quality, natural hazards, and the biosphere. ""Societal benefit"" in this paper generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit. The paper has two objectives: to demonstrate how several societal benefit frameworks work, and to highlight some of these benefits in the case of MISR. Such consideration of practical benefits is timely, as their realization is becoming a prominent objective of future space remote sensing activities. At least four groups of experts recommend that societal benefit serve as a heavily weighted criterion for prioritizing Earth science research opportunities. The National Academy of Sciences' forthcoming decadal survey for U.S. Earth science applications from space, the U.S. Climate Change Research Program, the framework for the international Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS), and the new world water program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) all argue that societal benefit should be a determining factor in selecting the next Earth-observing spacecraft missions and instruments. If these recommendations are implemented, the frameworks and illustrations below may prove useful in guiding benefit descriptions in future space-derived Earth observation programs.","Macauley, Molly",macauley_ascribingsocietalbenefitenvironmental_2006,FALSE,"Multiple types of benefits: realized, options, and knowledge.

The survey urges that all missions explicitly identify potential societal benefits in mission planning and operation. In this paper, our retrospective look at MISR offers approaches which mission planning for future instruments could operationalize. ""Societal benefit"" generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit.

Assessing The Economic Value Of Early Warning Systems,"As of today, investments into early warning systems are, to a large extent, politically motivated and â€œdisaster drivenâ€. This means that investments tend to increase significantly if a disaster strikes, but are often quickly reduced in the following disaster-free years. Such investment patterns make the continuous operation, maintenance and development of the early warning infrastructure a challenging task and may lead to sub-optimal investment decisions. The paper presented here proposes an economic assessment model for the tangible economic impact of early warning systems. The model places a focus on the false alert problematic and goes beyond previous approaches by incorporating some socio-cultural factors (qualitatively estimated as of now). By doing so, it supports policymakers (but also private investors) in their investment decisions related to early warning applications.","Klafft, Michael",klafft_assessingeconomicwarningsystems_2011,FALSE,"Contingent valuation vs. cost avoidance for disaster response early warning systems - recommends cost avoidance approach due to challenges and biases in contingent valuation.

Assessing The Full Effects Of Public Investment In Space,"Many space-related impact studies have been carried out in the past, but there is no conclusive, comprehensive evaluation of the economic and social effects of public investments in space. Such evaluations are not easy to perform, for several reasons: the space sector is not a recognised category in official statistics; social benefits, which are likely to be very important, are hard to assess; and impacts from R&D are complex and occur in the long term. However, important steps can be made towards better evaluation of impacts. The full set of impacts of space investments may be simultaneously evaluated from both a ""bottom-up"" and a ""top-down"" perspective. In the bottom-up perspective, each effect is measured separately, while the top-down perspective provides a framework for integrating the effects. Although both perspectives have their own advantages and drawbacks, combining them yields both detailed and integrated results. Our discussion of the bottom up approach starts by identifying an extensive list of impacts. Next, data availability issues and methodological improvements are identified, leading to recommendations on programmes to collect data and perform case studies. Finally, suggestions are made for presenting impacts in the form of a scoreboard. The core of the top-down evaluation methodology proposed is social cost benefit analysis. Effects are weighted, where possible, on the basis of observed market prices or other estimations of monetary values. For effects that are hard to measure or monetize, multi-criteria analysis can be applied using surveys and expert opinion. Our core recommendations are to clearly define the space sector, to collect additional data, and to use improved methodologies. Social, strategic and environmental impacts deserve special attention, aiming at a more comprehensive coverage of impacts. Comprehensive evaluations can contribute to more upport for space expenditures.","Clark, John",clark_assessingeffectspublicinvestment_2014,TRUE,"Categorizes impacts of investment in space technology across economic, social, strategic, and environmental including spillover effects and such - a meta-analysis.

Assessing The Usability And Potential Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts In Land Management Decisions In The Southwest Uk: Challenges And Reflections,"The potential usability and benefits of seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) to help inform decision-making processes is widely accepted. However, the practical use of SCF in Europe is still fairly recent and, as such, current knowledge of the added benefits of SCF in supporting and improving decision-making is limited. This study is based on research conducted to co-develop a semi-operational climate service prototype â€“ the Land Management Tool (LMTool) â€“ with farmers in South West regions of the UK. The value of the SCF provided to the farmers was examined to help us understand the usability and (potential) value of these forecasts in farmers' decisions during the winter months of 2015/2016. The findings from the study point to the need to explore and develop (new) research methods capable of addressing the complexity of the decision-making processes, such as those in the farming sector. The farmers who used the SCF perceived it as useful and usable as it helped them change and adapt their decision-making and thus, avoid unnecessary costs. However, to fully grasp the potential value of using SCF, farmers emphasised the need for the provision of SCF for longer periods of time to allow them to build trust and confidence in the information provided. This paper contributes to ongoing discussions about how to assess the use and value of SCF in decision-making processes in a meaningful and effective way.","Bruno Soares, Marta",brunosoares_assessingusabilitypotentialseasonal_2017,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,assessing the usability and potential va,2017
Assessing The Value Of Earth Observation For Managing Coral Reefs: An Example From The Great Barrier Reef,"The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reefprotection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.","Bouma, Jetske A.",bouma_assessingearthobservationmanaging_2011,TRUE,"VOI/Bayesian decision theory, elicitation of decision maker perceptions - marine conservation, Great Barrier Reef",soc_ben_repo,assessing the value of earth observation,2011
Assessing The Value Of Information For Water Quality Management In The North Sea,"Global Earth Observation (GEO) is one of the most important sources of information for environmental resource management and disaster prevention. With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from â€˜in situâ€™ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.","Bouma, Jetske A.",bouma_assessinginformationwaterquality_2009,TRUE,"VOI/Bayesian decision theory, stakeholder perception elicitation - marine water quality",soc_ben_repo,assessing the value of information for w,2009
Assessing The Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Decision-Making,"Seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) can support decision-making and thus help society cope with and prepare for climate variability and change. The demand for understanding the value and benefits of using SCF in decision-making processes can be associated with different logics. Two of these would be the need to justify public and private investment in the provision of SCF and demonstrating the gains and benefits of using SCF in specific decision-making contexts. This paper reviews the main factors influencing how SCF is (or can be) valued in supporting decision-making and the main methods and metrics currently used to perform such valuations. Our review results in four key findings: (a) there is a current emphasis on economic ex ante studies and the quantification of SCF value; (b) there are fundamental differences in how the value of SCF is defined and estimated across methods and approaches; (c) most valuation methods are unable to capture the differential benefits and risks of using SCF across spatiotemporal scales and groups; and (d) there is limited involvement of the decision-makers in the valuation process. The paper concludes by providing some guiding principles towards more effective valuations of SCF, notably the need for a wider diversity and integration of methodological approaches. These should particularly embrace ex-post, qualitative, and participatory approaches which allow co-evaluation with decision-makers so that more comprehensive and equitable SCF valuations can be developed in future.","Bruno Soares, Marta",brunosoares_assessingseasonalclimateforecasts_2018,FALSE,"good examination of the term ""value"" in context of seasonal climate forecasts though",soc_ben_repo,assessing the value of seasonal climate ,2018
Assimilation Of Grace Terrestrial Water Storage Data Into A Land Surface Model: Results For The Mississippi River Basin,"Assimilation of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system of satellites yielded improved simulation of water storage and fluxes in the Mississippi River basin, as evaluated against independent measurements. The authors assimilated GRACE-derived monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies for each of the four major subbasins of the Mississippi into the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) using an ensemble Kalman smoother from January 2003 to May 2006. Compared with the open-loop CLSM simulation, assimilation estimates of groundwater variability exhibited enhanced skill with respect to measured groundwater in all four subbasins. Assimilation also significantly increased the correlation between simulated TWS and gauged river flow for all four subbasins and for the Mississippi River itself. In addition, model performance was evaluated for eight smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, all of which are smaller than the scale of GRACE observations. In seven of eight cases, GRACE assimilation led to increased correlation between TWS estimates and gauged river flow, indicating that data assimilation has considerable potential to downscale GRACE data for hydrological applications.","Zaitchik, Benjamin",zaitchik_assimilationgraceterrestrialwater_2008,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,assimilation of grace terrestrial water ,2008

Banda Aceh-The Value Of Earth Observation Data In Disaster Recovery And Reconstruction: A Case Study,"On 26 December 2004, Banda Aceh in Indonesia was at the center of one of the worst natural disasters to affect mankind. Large amounts of international aid poured in to assist in the relief and reconstruction efforts. Amongst this effort, were investments in basic earth observation data from in-situ, airborne and space observations. While the use of this data is assumed to be crucial, few efforts have gone into quantifying the benefits of its acquisition. The objectives of this study were to interview a cross-section of agencies operating in Banda Aceh and across the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam on the use, sources and quality of earth observation data in the relief/reconstruction effort; and to analyze and quantify the value that earth observation data brings to the relief/reconstruction effort based on the survey results and specific examples. Key findings from the interviews point to an overall improvement in the spatial data situation since the tsunami.

Bayesian Framework For Assessing The Value Of Scientific Space Systems: Value Of Information Approach With Application To Earth Science Spacecraft,"Space systems play an important role in today's society by generating or transmitting information from source to sink(s). The acquisition of the space system is often justified by the type, quantity and quality of information provided or transmitted. This work posits that the value of a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through the value of information these systems provide. To this effect, a Bayesian framework is developed to assess system value in which systems are viewed as information sources, and stakeholders as information recipients. Information has value to stakeholders as it helps to update their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher expected pay-offs than in the absence of information. This increase in expected pay-offs is ascribed to the value of the system. Based on this idea, a new metric, Value-of-Design (VOD), is introduced to quantify the value of a class of space systems with unpriced services. The Bayesian framework assesses the Value-of-Design for the space system by considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these actions. The framework here developed is then applied to the case of an Earth Science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig operators in the Gulf of Mexico. Probability models of stakeholdersâ€™ beliefs, and economic models of pay-offs are developed and integrated with a spacecraft design tool. Results from the application point to clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value, and minimum information thresholds below which it is difficult to justify the acquisition of the system. Additionally, the system is analyzed in Cost-VOD trade space to provide program managers with additional insights into the coupling of a system's predicted value generation and its associated lifecycle cost.","Brathwaite, Joy",brathwaite_bayesianframeworkassessingscientific_2013,TRUE,"VOI/Bayesian decision theory, disaster early warning systems for hurricanes with respect to oil rigs",soc_ben_repo,bayesian framework for assessing the val,2013
Benefits And Beneficiaries Of The Oklahoma Mesonet: A Multisectoral Ripple Effect Analysis,"Since the Oklahoma Mesonet (the stateâ€™s automated mesoscale weather station network) was established in 1994, it has served a number of diverse groups and provided public services to foster weather preparedness, education, and public safety, while also supporting decision-making in agricultural production and wildland fire management. With 121 monitoring stations across the state, the Oklahoma Mesonet has developed an array of technologies to observe a variety of atmospheric and soil variables in 5- to 30-min intervals. These consistent observations have been especially critical for predicting and preparing for extreme weather events like droughts, floods, ice storms, and severe convective storms as well as for development of value-added tools. The tools, outreach programs, and mesoscale data have been widely utilized by the general public, state decision-makers, public safety officials, Kâ€“12 community, agricultural sector, and researchers, thus generating wide societal and economic benefits to many groups. Based on practical application examples of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet, this paper analyzes both benefits generated by Oklahoma Mesonet information to the public and decision-makers and ripple effects (spreading amplified outcomes/implications) of those benefits in the short and long term.

Benefits Of Meteorological Services In South Eastern Europe,"The study evaluated the impacts and potential benefits of meteorological and hydrological information services in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro. The services were analysed for the sectors of transport, construction industry, energy production, flood protection and agriculture production. The study was part of a larger project for the development of weather and climate observation networks and meteorological services in South Eastern Europe countries. In Albania advanced meteorological information services would produce annual savings worth 24 to 26 million euro. In Bosnia-Herzegovina the potential annual benefits were estimated to be about 10 to 22 million euro, in the FYR Macedonia 12 to 40 million euro and in Moldova 12 to 19 million euro per year. For Montenegro the data available did not enable the differentiation from Serbia for aviation and agriculture sectors. For road transport, construction industry and flood protection the annual savings resulting from better hydrometeorological information would be 1 to 3 million euro. Due to the lack of source information only part of the approximate potential benefits could be estimated at magnitude level, even though, the results show that hydrometeorological services are beneficial and worth developing further. The benefits are to a large extent due to higher predictability rates and better planning of operations as well as better preparedness for accidents and the reduction of human and material losses caused by these accidents. The realisation of the potential benefits requires comprehensive development of the hydrometeorological service systems. This means further development of observation infrastructure, data and transmission systems as well as service processes, operation models and know-how. Not only should the services be developed, but their availability and usability should be improved. The utilisation of communications technology should be enhanced and the awareness of the benefits of various services should be raised.","Hautala, Raine",hautala_benefitsmeteorologicalservicessouth_2008,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,benefits of meteorological services in s,2008

Ceos Contributions To Informing Energy Management And Policy Decision Making Using Space-Based Earth Observations,"Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS has become the ""space arm"" for the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) vision. It is directly supporting the space-based, near-term tasks articulated in the GEO three-year work plan.

We discuss the importance of engagement with stakeholders and understanding their decision support needs in successfully increasing the uptake of Earth observation products for societal benefit. Several case studies are presented, demonstrating the importance of providing data sets in formats and units familiar and immediately usable by decision makers.

California's Covid-19 Economic Shutdown Reveals The Fingerprint Of Systemic Environmental Racism,"Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States often experience higher-than-average exposures to air pollution. However, the relative contribution of embedded institutional biases to these disparities can be difficult to disentangle from physical environmental drivers, socioeconomic status, and cultural or other factors that are correlated with exposures under status quo conditions. Over the spring and summer of 2020, rapid and sweeping COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders around the world created large perturbations to local and regional economic activity that resulted in observable changes in air pollution concentrations, compositions, and distributions. Here, we use the pandemic-related emergency order and subsequent economic slowdown to causally estimate pollution exposure disparities in California. Using both public ground-based sensor data and a citizen-science network of monitors for respirable particulate matter (PM2.5), along with satellite records of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), we show that the initial sheltering-in-place period produced disproportionate air pollution reduction benefits for Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and low- income communities. By linking these pollution data with weather, geographic, socioeconomic, and mobility data in difference-in-differences models, we demonstrate that these disparate pollution reductions cannot be explained by environmental conditions, geography, income, or local economic activity and are instead driven by non-local activity. This study thus provides causally-identified evidence of systemic racial and ethnic bias in pollution control under business-as-usual conditions.","Blum, Richard",blum_california'scovid19economic_2020,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,california s covid 19 economic shutdown ,2020
Capacity Building Approach And Application: Utilization Of Earth Observation Data And Geospatial Information Technology In The Hindu Kush Himalaya,"While the Earth observation (EO) data and geospatial information technology (GIT) are getting more open and accessible, lack of skilled human resources and institutional capacities are limiting effective applications in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This paper aims to present the capacity building approach and applications designed to fill these gaps and empower decision makers and practitioners in using EO data and GIT through information education and training. The capacity building approach consists of four components: assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring (ADIM). The assessment component focuses on identifying the needs and priorities of capacity building for targeted groups or institutions. The design component develops training content in order to execute the plan in coordination with subject matter experts (SME). The implementation component executes the capacity building activity in any of these four formatsâ€”standard training, training of trainers, on-the-job training, and exposure learning. The monitoring component helps to identify the participantsâ€™ expectations, learning achievements, and feedback so as to improve future capacity building events. In the application of ADIM, we conducted needs assessment in four countries, designed 26 types of capacity building contents and implemented 39 capacity building events. A range of thematic topicsâ€”from agriculture and food security, water resources and hydro-climatic disasters, land use, land cover and ecosystem, weather and climate services, to crosscutting issuesâ€”were covered in the events. Altogether, the activities reached out to over 1,000 individuals (35% of them women) from over 200 unique institutions in 30 countries. Institutional capacity was built for universities in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to design and deliver courses independently. The capacity of partner agencies were built to co-design and co-develop data and applications. The approach also experienced challenges in the nomination process and in identifying women participants due to the lack of women professionals in the field and in the respective agencies. The ADIM approach and its workflow focused on bridging the gap between the current trend and progression in EO and GIT fields and the existing state of capacity of the agencies involved in the decision-making process. It promoted gender equity, adopted frontier technologies, engaged SMEs and provided sustainable solutions, which are starting to bring success stories in the region.","Thapa, Rajesh",thapa_capacitybuildingapproachapplication_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,capacity building approach and applicati,2019
Cloud Services With Big Data Provide A Solution For Monitoring And Tracking Sustainable Development Goals,"To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), high-quality data are needed to inform the formulation of policies and investment decisions, to monitor progress towards the SDGs and to evaluate the impacts of policies. However, the data landscape is changing. With emerging big data and cloud-based services, there are new opportunities for data collection, influencing both official data collection processes and the operation of the programmes they monitor. This paper uses cases and examples to explore the potential of crowdsourcing and public earth observation (EO) data products for monitoring and tracking the SDGs. This paper suggests that cloud-based services that integrate crowdsourcing and public EO data products provide cost-effective solutions for monitoring and tracking the SDGs, particularly for low-income countries. The paper also discusses the challenges of using cloud services and big data for SDG monitoring. Validation and quality control of public EO data is very important; otherwise, the user will be unable to assess the quality of the data or use it with confidence.","Wu, Bingfang",wu_cloudservicesdataprovide_2020,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,cloud services with big data provide a s,2020
Communicating Climate-Change And Natural Hazard Risk And Cultivating Resilience,"This edited volume emphasizes risk and crisis communication principles and practices within the up-to the minute context of new technologies, a new focus on resiliency, and global environmental change. It includes contributions from experts from around the globe whose research, advocacy, teaching, work, or service in the natural or social sciences deals with risk communication and/or management surrounding natural and technological disasters, with a particular focus on climate change-related phenomena. Resilience and good communication are intimately linked and with climate change precipitating more numerous and onerous weather-related catastrophes, a conversation on resilience is timely and necessary. The goal is robust communities that are able to withstand the shock of disaster.

Connecting Earth Observation To High-Throughput Biodiversity Data,"Understandably, given the fast pace of biodiversity loss, there is much interest in using Earth observation technology to track biodiversity, ecosystem functions and ecosystem services. However, because most biodiversity is invisible to Earth observation, indicators based on Earth observation could be misleading and reduce the effectiveness of nature conservation and even unintentionally decrease conservation effort. We describe an approach that combines automated recording devices, high-throughput DNA sequencing and modern ecological modelling to extract much more of the information available in Earth observation data. This approach is achievable now, offering efficient and near-real-time monitoring of management impactson biodiversity and its functions and services.","Bush, Alex",bush_connectingearthobservationthroughput_2017,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,connecting earth observation to high thr,2017

"Contingent Valuation Study Of The Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Maize Farmers In The Republic Of Benin, West Africa","This study aims to assess the economic benefits of seasonal climate forecasts in West Africa based on a random survey of 354 maize farmers and to use the contingent valuation method. Results indicate that farmers need accurate seasonal climate forecasts between 1 and 2 months before the onset of rains. The most desirable dissemination channels are radio, local elders, local farmer meetings and extension agents. The most likely used farming strategies are change of: planting date, crop acreage, crop variety, and production intensification. The vast majority of farmers are willing to pay for seasonal climate forecasts, and the average annual economic value of seasonal climate forecasts are about USD 5492 for the 354 sampled farmers and USD 66.5 million dollar at the national level. Furthermore, benefits of seasonal climate forecasts are likely to increase with better access to farmer based organisation, to extension services, to financial services, to modern communication tools, intensity of use of fertilizer and with larger farm sizes. Seasonal climate forecasts are a source of improvement of farmersâ€™ performance and the service should be integrated in extension programmes and in national agricultural development agenda.","Amegnaglo, Coco",amegnaglo_contingentvaluationstudybenefits_2017,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,contingent valuation study of the benefi,2017
Cost And Value Of Multidisciplinary Fixed-Point Ocean Observatories,"Sustained ocean observations are crucial to understand both natural processes occurring in the ocean and human influence on the marine ecosystems. The information they provide increases our understanding and is therefore beneficial to the society as a whole because it contributes to a more efficient use and protection of the marine environment, upon which human livelihood depends. In addition the oceans, which occupy 73% of the planet surface and host 93% of the biosphere, play a massive role in controlling the climate. Eulerian or fixed-point observatories are an essential component of the global ocean observing system as they provide several unique features that cannot be found in other systems and are therefore complementary to them. In addition they provide a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work, combining physical, chemical and biological observations on several time scales. The fixed-point open ocean observatory network (FixO3) integrates the 23 European open ocean fixed-point observatories in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. The programme also seeks to improve access to key installations and the knowledge they provide for the wider community, from scientists, to businesses, to civil society. This paper summarises the rationale behind open ocean observatories monitoring the essential ocean variables. It also provides an estimate of the costs to operate a typical fixed-point observatory such as those included in the FixO3 network. Finally an assessment of the type of data and services provided by ocean observations and their value to society is also given.","Cristini, Luisa",cristini_costmultidisciplinaryfixedocean_2016,TRUE,"Cost-benefit analysis?

Creation And Operation Of A Global Earth Observation System Of Systems,"Integrated global measurements and the information derived from these observations provide critical inputs for sound management decisions on a local national and international scale. For this reason, 72 nations and 44 international organizations have come together to form the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The purpose of GEOSS is to achieve comprehensive, coordinated and sustained observations of the Earth system to meet the need for timely, quality, long term global information. GEOSS builds on, and adds value to, existing regional, national and international Earth observation systems by coordinating their efforts, addressing critical gaps, supporting their interoperability, sharing information, reaching a common understanding of user requirements and improving delivery of information to users. GEOSS is a complex system of sensors, communication devices, storage systems, computational and other devices used to observe the Earth and gather the data needed for a better understanding of the Earthâ€™s processes. In addition, GEOSS includes models and processes to create information from the observational data.

Data Poverty: A Global Evaluation For 2009 To 2013 - Implications For Sustainable Development And Disaster Risk Reduction,"The article presents a time series (2009â€“2013) analysis for a new version of the â€œDigital Divideâ€ concept that developed in the 1990s. Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and resource management. The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of theSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015â€“2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction.

Decision Analysis For Tornado Warning And Evacuation,"Uncertainties associated with decision making regarding tornado warnings can lead to false warnings and missed events. A false warning is a situation when the public is warned about a tornado and one does not actually occur. A missed event is a catastrophic situation where a tornado touchdown occurs without an advance warning. This paper mainly focuses on how false warnings and missed events influence the decision-making process of households and forecasters. The underlying factors for false warnings and missed events are analyzed in detail. Forecastersâ€™ decision making about tornado warnings and the publicâ€™s decision to respond to a warning are analyzed using a probabilistic decision-tree approach. A logical basis for decision making is developed, and a fundamental inequality for decisions regarding tornado warnings is identified. This logical basis is applicable to other disasters as well. False warning and missed event probabilities are analyzed using the data from the Canadian Prairies. The overall analysis is applicable to improve the tornado-warning performance in the Canadian Prairies.\n\n","Durage, Samanthi",durage_decisionanalysistornadowarning_2016,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,decision analysis for tornado warning an,2016
"Decision Support Model And Visualization For Assessing Environmental Phenomena, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, And Satellite Design Using Earth Observation Data","With the increasing availability of Earth Observation (EO) data has come a commensurate rise in EO applications. To address the dual needs of processing data for applications and designing missions with applications in mind, we present a multi-disciplinary, integrated modeling framework to advance environmental management, policymaking, and observation platform design. This core modeling framework is called Environment-Vulnerability-DecisionTechnology (EVDT). EVDT is not the model itself, it is the framework that guides the creation of an integrated model customized to each application with a specific set of stakeholders in mind and designed using Systems Architecture. The EVDT framework can be customized to build integrated models specific to a certain application. Individual models in the framework include certain core models (Environment, Vulnerability, Decision, Technology) and optional models such as Public Health which are added when needed for a specific application. The Environment Model uses earth science methods to estimate the state of environmental phenomena; The Vulnerability Model captures societal impact of environmental changes including ecosystem services; the Decision Model captures human behavior and policy consequences; and the Technology Model provides tools to design earth observation systems or select among earth observation technologies such as satellites, airborne sensors, and in-situ sensors. The intent in developing this framework and its applications is to lead to the development of a standard to facilitate the re-use of models and the design of future remote observation systems. The presented prototype specifically focuses on two case studies. The first case study considers the dynamics of human and environmental behavior related to the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. The second case study considers the relevancy of this framework in approaching coronavirus-related public health decisions in Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and elsewhere.","Reid, Jack",reid_decisionsupportmodelvisualization_2020,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,decision support model and visualization,2020
Decision-Analytic Assessment Of The Economic Value Of Weather Forecasts: The Fallowing/Planting Problem,"A decision-analytic approach is taken to the problem of assessing the economic value of imperfect weather forecasts. Emphasis is placed on measures of the quality of such information and on the relationship between quality and economic value. The fallowing/planting problem for a spring wheat farmer is examined in detail as a specific application. It is assumed that the farmer's goal is to maximize the total expected discounted return over an infinite horizon, which places this problem within the general framework of Markov decision processes. By means of stochastic dynamic programming, the economic value to the farmer of currently available seasonal precipitation forecasts, as well as of hypothetical improvements in the quality of such forecasts, is estimated. Because the relationship between the quality and value of forecasts is highly nonlinear, the need to explicitly determine value-of-information estimates, rather than relying on quality as a surrogate for value, is made clear.","Katz, Richard",katz_decisionanalyticassessmenteconomic_1987,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,decision analytic assessment of the econ,1987
"Demonstrating The Value Of Earth Observations - Methods, Practical Applications, And Solutions - Group On Earth Observations Side Event Proceedings","The U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the European Association for Remote Sensing Companies, and the European Space Agency in coordination with the GEOValue Community hosted a side event to the Group on Earth Observations Plenary on October 23-24, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The workshop, entitled ""Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations: Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions,"" brought together more than 60 international experts including economists, scientists, and engineers to consider the state of the science and applications of valuing Earth observations (EO).\n\nThis 2-day workshop built upon previous activities developed under the GEOValue initiative. This workshop brought together expert analysts from multiple disciplines and backgrounds who are developing methods to identify and measure the value of information generated from the use of satellite and in-situ data. The mix of government agencies, international financial institutions, and independent consultants who participated in the workshop blended to develop a rich mix of views, approaches, and outcomes.\n\nDuring the first part of the workshop, the focus was on the latest science in valuing EO. A number of methodologies were described. Approaches generally assess the societal benefits of specific actions (for example, investments in EO). Some methods focus on broad measures of economic activity (for example, gross domestic product) or methods to assess total economic value such as contingent valuation surveys. Alternatively, use-case approaches (a use case is defined as an evaluation in which one or more decisions, applications, or other uses of data, information, and information products are specifically considered) start with the specific actions and how information is used to support decision making and affect outcomes. \n\nThe second part of the meeting was focused on the use and development of value chains and decision trees. A value chain can be defined as the set of value-adding activities that one or more organizations perform in creating and distributing goods and services. In terms of EO, the value chain approach can be applied to consider societal benefits of the data and assess the value of data and data features. The EO value chain considers the geospatial data sources and the processing of the data into value added information to be incorporated into decision-support systems, leading to decision maker's actions. To understand the value of EO, one would also need to recognize the demand side of the equation or how EO benefits users. Extending the value chain concept and incorporating tenets of Bayesian decision making, a decision tree would include one or more use cases. The value provided by the marginal increase in information could flow from one or several parts of the supply side of the value chain. The decision tree is based on the premise that information has no value if it is not used in at least one decision. By connecting the value chain and the decision tree, a framework is created that allows for conceptualizing the value of EO in its many uses. One can then apply economic techniques to monetize the marginal benefit of an outcome with information versus one without. \n\nA third part of the meeting applied the value chain and decision-tree frameworks to five specific thematic areas, each with the focus of using information for a decision point: \n- Effect of increasing temperatures on human health; \n- Flooding- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts to safety and property damage; \n- Energy and mineral supply- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts of shortfalls on the economy; and\n- Effects of natural hazards on transportation systems- Effects on mobility, safety, and the economy.\n\nDuring the working session, five separate groups worked to define and delineate the value chains and decision trees associated with each topic, discussing the related challenges and data needs. The outcomes were reported back to the full group. Because of the complexity of the topics, most groups first identified a network of value chains and then narrowed the scope to develop a single value chain to address their group's topic. Although they worked separately and on different topics, the groups came to similar conclusions, concurring that the value chain and decision-tree frameworks are very effective for informing quantitative impact assessments and developing a relatable narrative to assist the public in understanding the link between EO and citizens.","Pearlman, Francoise",pearlman_demonstratingearthobservationsmethods_2019,FALSE,"Workshop looking at valuing EO, value chains",soc_ben_repo,demonstrating the value of earth observa,2019
Digital Earth Australia- Unlocking New Value From Earth Observation Data,"Petascale archives of Earth observations from space (EOS) have the potential to characterise water resources at continental scales. For this data to be useful, it needs to be organised, converted from individual scenes as acquired by multiple sensors, converted into â€œanalysis ready dataâ€, and made available through high performance computing platforms. Moreover, converting this data into insights requires integration of non-EOS data-sets that can provide biophysical and climatic context for EOS. Digital Earth Australia has demonstrated its ability to link EOS to rainfall and stream gauge data to provide insight into surface water dynamics during the hydrological extremes of flood and drought. This information is supporting the characterisation of groundwater resources across Australiaâ€™s north and could potentially be used to gain an understanding of the vulnerability of transport infrastructure to floods in remote, sparsely gauged regions of northern and central Australia.","Dhu, Trevor",dhu_digitalearthaustraliaunlocking_2017,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,digital earth australia unlocking new va,2017
Do Users Benefit From Additional Information In Support Of Operational Drought Management Decisions In The Ebro Basin?,"We follow a user-based approach to examine how information supports operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin and how these can benefit from additional information such as from remote sensing data. First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information. Risk-averse farmers were found to benefit least from the additional information, while less risk-averse farmers stand to benefit most as the additional information helps them take better informed decisions when weighing their options.","Lines, Clara",lines_usersbenefitadditionalinformation_2018,TRUE,"Drought forecasting for farmers and water managers, improvements by including remote-sensed snowfall information.

Earth Observation In A Cost-Benefit Analysis Perspective: Cosmo Skymed Satellites Of The Italian Space Agency,"Over the past decade, an increasing number of high-resolution satellite images have become available to public administration, policymakers and scientists, boosting the amount of information they can obtain to manage and analyse different issues. Satellites allow observing different natural and socio-economic phenomena that would be very hard and costly to monitor from the ground with the same optimal coverage, accuracy and consistency, providing valuable information both to the private and public sector. These phenomena include global societal challenges, such as climate change and air pollution, as well as local ones such as precision farming, urbanisation and transport infrastructures monitoring. This working paper aims at paving the way to a comprehensive assessment of the socio-economic impact of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) concerning the creation of innovative products and services generated by the Earth Observation (EO)1. Although the wide range of potential applications of EO satellite data, little is known about the effective use of Cosmo SkyMed (CSK) data so far. Most of the benefits related to their availability remain potential, unexpressed and undervalued.

Earth Observations As Decision Support For Adaptation And Mitigation Strategies In Response To Coastal Sea Level Rise,"Local Sea Level (LSL) rise is among the major anticipated impacts of future global warming. Policy makers face a trade-off between imposing today the very high costs of mitigation, adaptation, and coastal protection upon national economies and leaving the costs of major disasters for future generations. Predictions of future LSL trajectories with reliable estimates of uncertainties are a crucial input to risk and vulnerability assessments in support of informed decisions. Current aleatory uncertainties in observations related to past and current LSL variations combined with epistemic uncertainties in some of the global, regional and local processes forcing LSL changes produce a large range of plausible future LSL trajectories and weak estimates of uncertainties. Therefore, policy makers often lack sound scientific support for the development of reasonable mitigation and adaptation strategies in the coastal zone. Additional spaceborne and in situ observations are needed in order to improve decision support by reducing the uncertainties in LSL predictions.","Plag, Hans-Peter",plag_earthobservationsdecisionsupport_2009,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,earth observations as decision support f,2009
Earth Observations In Social Science Research For Management Of Natural Resources And The Environment: Identifying The Landsat Contribution,"This paper surveys the peer-reviewed social science literature in which Landsat data are used to inform public policy in managing natural resources and the environment.

The studies surveyed in this paper are selected from a wide range of publications within the social sciences. Selection uses social science-oriented bibliographic search indices. Searching the social science literature leads to identification of applications of Landsat by a community of experts unlikely to be identified by surveys or overviews of the Landsat program. Surveys and overview studies have tended to target researchers specializing in remote sensing or photogrammetry rather than researchers drawn from the social sciences. The usefulness of Landsat data as a basis for public investment in the Landsat proogram is underestimated in the absence of recognizing this body of research.","Macauley, Molly K.",macauley_earthobservationssocialscience_2009,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,earth observations in social science res,2009
Earth Observation And The Public Good,"The term â€˜public goodâ€™ is often used in satellite Earth observation to indicate that Earth observation data are of value or interest to the public. In fact, the term â€˜public goodâ€™ has a more specific meaning, originating in the discipline of Economics, which carries with it a set of assumptions and implications about how markets operate. In this context a public good has two main characteristics: non-rivalry and nonexcludability. In their most common digital format, Earth observation data can appear to be both nonrivalrous and non-excludable. However, it is not the digital medium itself which controls the â€˜publicnessâ€™ of a good but the conditions of access to that good. This paper explores the meaning of the concept of public goods in an Earth observation context by, first, examining public good theory and related concepts of categories of goods and, second, applying the concepts to nine Earth observation missions, programmes and data.","Harris, Ray",harris_earthobservationpublic_2011,TRUE,"Public goods theory; framework of thinking about satellite data in terms of rivalry and excludability, with nine EO missions placed in various locations on this plane.

Earth Observation From Space - The Issue Of Environmental Sustainability,"Remote sensing scientists work under assumptions that should not be taken for granted and should, therefore, be challenged. These assumptions include the following:\n 1. Space, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO), will always be available to governmental and commercial space entities that launch Earth remote sensing missions. \n 2. Space launches are benign with respect to environmental impacts. \n 3. Minimization of Type 1 error, which provides increased confidence in the experimental outcome, is the best way to assess the significance of environmental change. \n 4. Large-area remote sensing investigations, i.e. national, continental, global studies, are best done from space. \n 5. National space missions should trump international, cooperative space missions to ensure national control and distribution of the data products. \nAt best, all of these points are arguable, and in some cases, theyâ€™re wrong. Development of observational space systems that are compatible with sustainability principles should be a primary concern when Earth remote sensing space systems are envisioned, designed, and launched. The discussion is based on the hypothesis that reducing the environmental impacts of the data acquisition step, which is at the very beginning of the information stream leading to decision and action, will enhance coherence in the information stream and strengthen the capacity of measurement processes to meet their stated functional goal, i.e. sustainable management of Earth resources. We suggest that unconventional points of view should be adopted and when appropriate, remedial measures considered that could help to reduce the environmental footprint of space remote sensing and of Earth observation and monitoring systems in general. This article discusses these five assumptions in the context of sustainable management of Earthâ€™s resources. Taking each assumption in turn, we find the following: \n(1) Space debris may limit access to Low Earth Orbit over the next decades. \n(2) Relatively speaking, given that theyâ€™re rare event, space launches may be benign, but study is\nmerited on upper stratospheric and exospheric layers given the chemical activity associated with rocket combustion by-products. \n(3) Minimization of Type II error should be considered in situations where minimization of Type I error\ngreatly hampers or precludes our ability to correct the environmental condition being studied. \n(4) In certain situations, airborne collects may be less expensive and more environmentally benign,\nand comparative studies should be done to determine which path is wisest. \n(5) International cooperation and data sharing will reduce instrument and launch costs and mission redundancy. Given fiscal concerns of most of the major space agencies e e.g. NASA, ESA, CNES e it seems prudent to combine resources.","Durrieu, Sylvie",durrieu_earthobservationspaceissue_2013,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,earth observation from space the issue o,2013

Earth Observation Science Strategy For Esa: A New Era For Scientific Advances And Societal Benefits,"Thanks to the ERS and Envisat workhorse satellites and the series of ongoing and planned Earth Explorer missions, our scientific understanding of Earth has come a long way in recent decades. While science continues to reap the benefits of these missions, we are now in a new era where Earth observation also plays a pivotal role in environmental management systems to benefit society at large and everyday life. The launch of the first Sentinel mission for Europeâ€™s environmental monitoring Copernicus programme signalled a new beginning for operational monitoring. Accordingly, ESAâ€™s new Earth observation science strategy takes a holistic approach that responds to both scientific and societal challenges. Developing new and integrated observing systems, ensuring sustained observations and capabilities to fill gaps in current observing systems, building on well-established international cooperation and taking advantage of the major technological advances in computing capabilities, modelling and data handling not only advances knowledge, but also has cross-cutting impacts. The value of Earth observation is increasingly recognised beyond the traditional fields. Todayâ€™s paradigm shift towards open access to data, big data and exascale computing, collaborative approaches and analyses, as well as new ways of visualising and communicating data mean that Earth observation is at societyâ€™s fingertips. In essence, as these rapidly evolving technologies become more commonplace and improvements in the ways in which data can be exploited and transformed into knowledge, the better we can address environmental, scientific and societal challenges, adapt to change and improve our way of life.

The Health Societal Benefit Area (SBA) spans the science-to-decision-making continuum through three tasks: Information Systems for Health, Monitoring and Prediction Systems for Health, and End-to-End Projects for Health. Projects within each overarching task focus on building connections between basic research, tools, and tangible decisions. Current foci within the Health SBA include: aerosol impacts on health, air quality forecasting, global monitoring of persistent organic pollutants and mercury, meningitis in Africa, developing malaria early warning systems, and decision support tools for ecosystems, biodiversity and health.","Barrie, L.",barrie_earthobservationshealthdecisions_2010,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,earth observations and health decisions,2010
Earth Observations Can Enable Cost-Effective Conservation Of Eastern North Pacific Blue Whales: A Value Of Information Analysis,"We conduct an analysis to estimate the value of information (VOI) of Earth observations for prospective regulation of marine shipping to conserve Eastern North Pacific blue whales in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States. Outcomes are driven by differences across two data products that can be used to inform regulations to limit ship strikes. In the reference case, vessel speed limits depend on species distribution data from shipboard surveys. In the counterfactual case, speed limits depend on species distributions predicted by WhaleWatch, a federal data product incorporating information from several remote sensing technologies. The VOI is identified as the difference in costs to marine shipping operators under the reference and counterfactual cases for regulation of vessel speeds. We estimate that the annual VOI of WhaleWatch is US $21â€“332 million, depending on the conservation goals of the modeled regulation. Conserving more blue whalesâ€”averting more ship strikesâ€”increases the VOI.","Bernknopf, Richard",bernknopf_earthobservationsenablecost_2021,TRUE,VOI/bayesian decision - marine conservation,soc_ben_repo,earth observations can enable cost effec,2021
Earth Observations For Terrestrial Biodiversity And Ecosystems,"Earth observations, comprising satellite, aerial, and in situ systems, are increasingly recognized as critical observations for monitoring the Earth system and systems. Earth observation data are especially needed to fulfil the requirements of a host of international treaties and conventions, and to provide data and information to support conservation and resource management. The Group on Earth Observations, GEO was established to implement the Global Earth Observing Systems of Systems, GEOSS, which includes in its mandate the protection of ecosystems â€” Improving the management and protection of terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems, and understanding, monitoring, and conserving biodiversity.

Economic Assessment Of The Use Value Of Geospatial Information,"Geospatial data inform decision makers. An economic model that involves application of spatial and temporal scientific, technical, and economic data in decision making is described. The value of information (VOI) contained in geospatial data is the difference between the net benefits (in present value terms) of a decision with and without the information. A range of technologies is used to collect and distribute geospatial data. These technical activities are linked to examples that show how the data can be applied in decision making, which is a cultural activity. The economic model for assessing the VOI in geospatial data for decisionmaking is applied to three examples: (1) a retrospective model about environmental regulation of agrochemicals; (2) a prospective model about the impact and mitigation of earthquakes in urban areas; and (3) a prospective model about developing privateâ€“public geospatial information or an ecosystem services market. Each example demonstrates the potential value of geospatial information in a decision with uncertain information.","Bernknopf, Richard",bernknopf_economicassessmentgeospatialinformation_2015,TRUE,"VOI/bayesian - theory/framework with examples from agrochemicals, earthquake hazards, and ecosystem service markets, looking at how data expands the production possibilities frontier (Pareto efficiency).

Economic Benefits Expected From Earth Observation Applications. The Case Of The Eu Fp7 Itaca Project,"This paper offers a contribution of how Earth Observation Applications can give economic benefits to the community of End Users. A short overview of EO benefits is given with specific reference to cultural heritage applications. In particular, the paper focuses on the case of a EU FP7 Project ITACA (Innovation Technologies and Applications for Coastal Archaeological sites), which started in January 2014 and it is currently underway. The paper briefly describes the ITACA project and its aims. During the project an economic impact assessment is carried out, initially from a qualitative point of view, through the submission of a questionnaire to the partners involved in the project. The same questionnaire was given also to identified End-Users in order to investigate the precise stakeholders' nature and behaviour and the likely economic modifications they will undergo once the project takes shape and new technical propositions are made potentially available also by way of different service models. Factors affecting positively and negatively the various stakeholderâ€™s communities will be listed and discussed in full. Next stage is involving the quantification of potential benefits ITACA project may produce. Therefore, an evaluation of effects on economic activities of the areas and on communities the archaeological sites is being made. Once qualitative and quantitative assessments are completed, a business plan outlining also the appropriate road/roads to market is going to be prepared and suggestions will be made about which organizational/governance model best fit the expected results. This paper also deals with considerations about strength, weakness, opportunities and threats before during and after projectâ€™s deployment.

Economic Potential Of Oil Palm Plantation Using Remote Sensing-Based Technology In Indonesia,"The productivity of Indonesia's palm oil was considered low when referring to the 14.6 million ha land area in 2019, with the production of national palm oil only reaching 3.2 tons of CPO/ha/year. The uses of remote sensing technology as a means of monitoring and supervising, were expected to increase oil palm production in line with productivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the economic potential based on oil palm plantation productivity, with and without using remote sensing-based technology, as well as other variables likely to affect productivity. Primary and secondary data collection methods were also used in this research. There were three quantitative methods being used in this study, namely (i) Multiple regression model with panel data, (ii) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) tool, and (iii) Multinomial logistic regression technique. The results showed that the generated economic potential from the utilization of the remote sensing model, had efficient opportunity value of 10.48, which was higher than the non-usage of the technology. Therefore, the main variables that affected productivity in this study, were fertilizer and labour.","Diana, Shinta",diana_economicpotentialoilpalm_2021,TRUE,Statistical methods to tease out effects of remote sensing to improve management efficiency (fertilization) in oil palm production,soc_ben_repo,economic potential of oil palm plantatio,2021
Economic Value Of Current And Improved Weather Forecasts In The U.s. Household Sector,"The National Weather Service (NWS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the primary federal agency responsible for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of weather forecast information. With an annual budget of about $1,383 million, the average U.S. household pays about $13 a year for the services of the NWS. There is little if any reliable economic information indicating whether these services are worth this $13 a year to households, although it is widely assumed that the benefits far exceed the costs. Furthermore, there is even less information on the value to households of potential improvements to or changes in current weather forecasting services. As NOAA considers new programs and implements new technologies, it is likely to be asked to justify proposed new expenditures using a benefit-cost framework. This study was commissioned to assist in evaluating and quantifying, to the extent possible, the benefits to households of potential improvements in weather forecasting services, as well as how the public values current forecast services. Table S-1 presents this studyâ€™s best estimates of annual per household values for improved and current weather forecasts. Based on Census estimates of about 105 million U.S. households, total national values for improving weather forecasts to the maximum levels proposed in the survey are estimated to be $1.73 billion per year. We also calculate an annual national value of $11.4 billion for current weather forecast services (which includes the value of all weather forecast information services from public and private sectors).","Lazo, Jeffrey",lazo_economiccurrentimprovedweather_2002,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,economic value of current and improved w,2002
Economic Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Agriculture: Review Of Ex-Ante Assessments And Recommendations For Future Research,"Advanced information in the form of seasonal climate forecasts has the potential to improve farmersâ€™ decision making, leading to increases in farm profits. Interdisciplinary initiatives seeking to understand and exploit the potential benefits of seasonal forecasts for agriculture have produced a number of quantitative ex-ante assessments of the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts. The realism, robustness, and credibility of such assessments become increasingly important as efforts shift from basic research toward applied research and implementation. This paper surveys published evidence about the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts for agriculture, characterizing the agricultural systems, approaches followed, and scales of analysis. The climate forecast valuation literature has contributed insights into the influence of forecast characteristics, risk attitudes, insurance, policy, and the scale of adoption on the value of forecasts. Key innovations in the more recent literature include explicit treatment of the uncertainty of forecast value estimates, incorporation of elicited management responses into bioeconomic modeling, and treatment of environmental impacts, in addition to financial outcomes of forecast response. It is argued that the picture of the value of seasonal forecasts for agriculture is still incomplete and often biased, in part because of significant gaps in published valuation research. Key gaps include sampling of a narrow range of farming systems and locations, incorporation of an overly restricted set of potential management responses, failure to consider forecast responses that could lead to â€œregime shifts,â€ and failure to incorporate state-of-the-art developments in seasonal forecasting. This paper concludes with six recommendations to enhance the realism, robustness, and credibility of ex-ante valuation of seasonal climate forecasts.","Meza, Francisco",meza_economicseasonalclimateforecasts_2008,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,economic value of seasonal climate forec,2008

Economic And Social Benefits Of Meteorology And Climatology In Switzerland,"National Meteorological Services provide meteorological data, information, forecasts and various related products, which are important for the smooth functioning of many aspects in economy, administration and society. The merit of meteorological services cannot be deduced directly from the consumption of services. Rather, it emerges from the improvement of decisions by economic stakeholders thanks to weather and climate information. These services are purchased by users in order to be able to offer optimally or demand a certain service or, with respect to security, these services aim at helping to prevent damage from extreme events.\n\nA rough estimate for a number of selected sectors shows that benefits from weather services in Switzerland are in the region of hundreds of millions Swiss Francs (1 Swiss Franc âˆ¼ â‚¬0.66, US$0.83 as at 2008).\n\nThis pilot study shows that it is not possible to estimate one single figure representing the overall benefit from weather services in a country. Concerning the economic sector, a benefit analysis should therefore concentrate on those sub-sectors where weather services are particularly relevant, i.e. agriculture, construction, energy, insurance, telecommunication, tourism, transport, logistics and water availability. Analysis of benefits from climate data is of particular interest to MeteoSwiss since the Federal Office is the main source for climate data in Switzerland. Climate data form the basis on which climate change and possible climate threats can be detected.\n\nThis study estimates for the first time the socio-economic benefits of meteorological and climatic information in Switzerland as a small developed European country and gives an outlook of how a further study might be designed.","Frei, Thomas",frei_economicsocialbenefitsmeteorology_2010,FALSE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,economic and social benefits of meteorol,2010
Economic Benefit Of Meteorology In The Swiss Road Transportation Sector,"Meteorological services involve the provision of information on the state of the atmosphere and the ground surface. They provide data, information, forecasts and various related products, which are important for the smooth functioning of many aspects of the economy, government and society. The economic value or benefit of weather forecasts consists in generally improving financial and related outcomes resulting from the use of such forecasts. The merit of meteorological services cannot directly be deduced from the consumption of services. Rather, it emerges from the improvement of decisions made by economic stakeholders thanks to weather-related information. This is the first empirical study on this topic for Switzerland which includes economic data from interviewed users. The results show that the use of meteorology in the road transportation sector in Switzerland generates an economic benefit to the national economy of 65.7â€“79.77 million Swiss francs (1 Swiss franc âˆ¼0.90 â‚¬, 1.20 US$ as of August 2011). In relation to its budget the overall benefit to the national meteorological service might be several times that amount, considering that many other economic sectors such as agriculture, aviation, construction, energy, media and tourism were not included in this study. Furthermore, climate services were not taken into account in this study and, therefore, the economic benefit for the road traffic sector alone might in fact be even higher.","Frei, Thomas",frei_economicbenefitmeteorologyswiss_2014,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,economic benefit of meteorology in the s,2014
Economic Benefits Of Meteorological Services,"There is an increasing need for more rigorous and more broadly based determination of the economic value of meteorological services as an aid to decision-making on the appropriate level of funding to be committed to their provision at the national level. This paper develops an overall framework for assessment of the economic value of meteorological services based on the recognition that most national meteorological infrastructure and services possess the non-rival properties of public goods. Given this overall framework for determination of both total and marginal benefits, four main methodologies appropriate for use in valuation studies â€“ market prices, normative or prescriptive decision-making models, descriptive behavioural response studies and contingent valuation studies â€“ are outlined and their strengths and limitations described. Notwithstanding the methodological limitations and the need for a much more comprehensive set of studies for the various application sectors, it is clear that the actual and potential benefits to individuals, firms, industry sectors and national economies from stateof-the-art meteorological and related services are substantial and that, at this stage, they are inadequately recognised and insufficiently exploited in many countries.","Freebairn, John",freebairn_economicbenefitsmeteorologicalservices_2002,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,economic benefits of meteorological serv,2002
Economic Evaluation Of Research To Improve The Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System,"Canada is a largely forested country, and the economic, environmental, and social effects of the country's wildland fire management are of great importance from an industry and public policy perspective. Investment in research can improve the efficiency of wildland fire management and has an important role in the decision-making process. There is a long history of research investment in Canada related to wildland fire management, including the development of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS). To demonstrate the range of net benefits of the CFFDRS to Canadian society, a cost-benefit study was conducted on research related to enhancing the current system. The benefits of research were measured as the difference in economic returns with additional investment in research, primarily achieved through reduction in damages to timber resources and savings in suppression expenditure (the â€œwith-research scenarioâ€) and those that would have resulted with no changes to the current CFFDRS (the â€œwithout-research scenarioâ€). A triangular probability distribution was used to address uncertainty and the results indicated high levels of net economic benefit if the CFFDRS were to be enhanced by additional research investment, with â€œmost likelyâ€ estimates of net present value ranging from $30 million to $1.5 billion ($Cdn).","Gould, James",gould_economicevaluationresearchimprove_2012,FALSE,"This looks more like valuing a decision support tool, rather than the information itself",soc_ben_repo,economic evaluation of research to impro,2012
Economic Value Of Environmental And Weather Information For Agricultural Decisions - A Case Study For Oklahoma Mesonet,"For the past 24 years, weather information and monitoring provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet (the stateâ€™s largest weather and environmental monitoring network) has been used by many farmers across the state to optimize their farm operations and improve profitability of agricultural production. Several research studies delineated advantages of Mesonet weather information for efficient agricultural decision-making. However, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative research in this field is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for Oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on profitability analysis, USDA NASS and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center. The results show that the cumulative economic benefits for agricultural production in Oklahoma from utilizing Mesonet information (assuming the profitability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying Mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006â€“2014 (combining generated profits and prevented losses in agricultural production). Mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic benefits in terms of prevented losses than additional production profits, especially in drought years. A regional analysis for Oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative benefits of Mesonet applications in the Southwest ($45.9 million), North Central region ($38.2 million), and in Panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006â€“2014. Also, high temporal variations were found for all Oklahoma climate regions.This research is focused on the agricultural sector, while it also sets the baseline for a more holistic understanding of the economic value and benefits of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet that can further be applied to other sectors in the state.","Ziolkowska, Jadwiga R.",ziolkowska_economicenvironmentalweatherinformation_2018,TRUE,NA,soc_ben_repo,economic value of environmental and weat,2018
Economic Value Of Hurricane Forecasts: An Overview And Research Needs,"Hurricane forecasting is in part an economic problem, because it commits scarce resources to save lives, reduce injuries, and lessen economic impacts.

Estimating forecast value can help show if improved forecast provision and dissemination would offer more benefit to society than alternative public investments such as infrastructure or forecasts of other hazards. We review research that has estimated the economic value of the hurricane forecast and warning system and the value of improving forecast quality. We recommend developing a comprehensive theoretical understanding of economic value of hurricane forecasts to diverse stakeholders across all time scales.

Engaging Global Youth In Participatory Spatial Data Creation For The Un Sustainable Development Goals: The Case Of Open Mapping For Malaria Prevention,"Practitioners bemoan lack of data as one of the biggest obstacles to progress towards global sustainable development goals. This paper explores a scaled-up participatory method developed by YouthMappers, for creating missing geospatial data derived from remotely sensed imagery in order to contribute to persistent data needs in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explore the application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from different countries.

Enhancing Access And Usage Of Earth Observations In Environmental Decision-Making In Eastern And Southern Africa Through Capacity Building,"Major strides have been made in the development of remote sensing, reanalysis, and model-based earth observations (EOs), which can be used for long-term climate variability mapping, as well as real-time environmental monitoring and forecasting. Such EOs are particularly valuable for environmental decision-making (e.g., for environmental resources management and disaster mitigation) in the Eastern and Southern Africa (E & SA) region, where ground-based EOs are sparse. Nonetheless, operational application of those EOs to inform decision-making in the region remains limited. This paper reports on a recently concluded (as of June 2019) NASA SERVIR-supported Applied Science Team project that contributed to the uptake of EO applications to inform decision-making in this region. This project was conducted in close collaboration with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)â€”the NASA SERVIR regional hub in E & SA. The capacity-building efforts leveraged RCMRDâ€™s existing environmental service capacity, their long experience in capacity building in the region, and their extensive network of regional partners, with the goal of increasing RCMRD and their regional partnersâ€™ ability to uptake EOs to enhance their environmental services and, hence, improve the environmental decision-making process. The project focused on: (1) Transfer of technologyâ€”Transition and implementation of web-based tools to RCMRD to allow easy processing and visualization of EOs and (2) Capacity trainingâ€”training of representatives from regional and national environmental service agencies in EO application based on targeted case studies.

Enhancing The Application Of Earth Observations For Improved Environmental Decision-Making Using The Early Warning Explorer (Ewx),"The mitigation of losses due to extreme climate events and long-term climate adaptation requires climate informed decision-making. In the past few decades, several remote sensing and modeled-based Earth observations (EOs) have been developed to provide an unprecedented global overview and routine monitoring of climate and its impacts on vegetation and hydrologic conditions, with the goal of supporting informed decision-making. However, their usage in decision-making is particularly limited in climate-risk vulnerable and in situ data-scarce regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to EOs. Here, we describe the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX), which was developed to address this crucial limitation and facilitate the application of EOs in decision-making, particularly in the food and water-insecure regions of the world. First, the EWXâ€™s core framework, which includes (i) the Viewer, (ii) GeoEngine, and (iii) Support Applications, is described. Then, a comprehensive overview of the Viewer, which is a web-based interface used to access EOs, is provided. This includes a description of (i) the maps and associated features to access gridded EO data and anomalies for different temporal averaging periods, (ii) time series graphs and associated features to access EOs aggregated over polygons such as administrative boundaries, and (iii) commonly used EOs served by the EWX that provide assessments of climate and vegetation conditions. Next, examples are provided to demonstrate how EWX can be used to monitor development, progression, spatial extent, and severity of climate-driven extreme events to support timely decisions related to mitigation of food insecurity and flooding impacts. Finally, the value of a regional implementation of EWX at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, is highlighted. Regional implementation of the EWX facilitates access to regionally focused EOs and their availability at polygon boundaries most relevant to the local decision-makers. Similar instances of EWX implemented in other regions, especially those susceptible to food and water security, will likely further enhance the application of EOs for informed decision-making.","Shukla, Shraddhanand",shukla_enhancingapplicationearthobservations_2021,FALSE,"Looks like introduction and application of a DST, and demonstration of how it supports value, but not actually calculating value",soc_ben_repo,enhancing the application of earth obser,2021
Enhancing The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index By Integrating Spatiotemporal Information From Satellite And In Situ Data,"Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.","Oikonomou, Panagiotis",oikonomou_enhancingstandardizeddroughtvulnerability_2019,FALSE,"Incorporates satellite data into an updated Standardized Drought Vuln Index, but doesn't quite get to the point of showing how the new information improves value? so close!",soc_ben_repo,enhancing the standardized drought vulne,2019
Essential Earth Observation Variables For High-Level Multi-Scale Indicators And Policies,"Several holistic approaches are based on the description of socio-ecological systems to address the sustainability challenge.

Essential Variables For Environmental Monitoring: What Are The Possible Contributions Of Earth Observation Data Cubes?,"Environmental sustainability is nowadays a major global issue that requires efficient and effective responses from governments. Essential variables (EV) have emerged in different scientific communities as a means to characterize and follow environmental changes through a set of measurements required to support policy evidence. To help track these changes, our planet has been under continuous observation from satellites since 1972. Currently, petabytes of satellite Earth observation (EO) data are freely available. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized because many big data challenges and complexity barriers hinder their effective use. Consequently, facilitating the production of EVs using the wealth of satellite EO data can be beneficial for environmental monitoring systems. In response to this issue, a comprehensive list of EVs that can take advantage of consistent time-series satellite data has been derived. In addition, a set of use-cases, using an Earth Observation Data Cube (EODC) to process large volumes of satellite data, have been implemented to demonstrate the practical applicability of EODC to produce EVs.

Estimating The Social Value Of Geologic Map Information: A Regulatory Application,"People frequently regard the landscape as part of a static system. The mountains and rivers that cross the landscape, and the bedrock that supports the surface, change little during the course of a lifetime. Society can alter the geologic history of an area and, in so doing, affect the occurrence and impact of environmental hazards. For example, changes in land use can induce changes in erosion, sedimentation, and ground-water supply. As the environmental system is changed by both natural processes and human activities, the systemâ€™s capacity to respond to additional stresses also changes. Information such as geologic maps describes the physical world and is critical for identifying solutions to land use and environmental issues. In this paper, a method is developed for estimating the economic value of applying geologic map information to siting a waste disposal facility. An improvement in geologic map information is shown to have a net positive value to society. Such maps enable planners to make superior land management decisions.","Bernkopf, Richard",bernkopf_estimatingsocialgeologicmap_1997,TRUE,not satellite,soc_ben_repo,estimating the social value of geologic ,1997
Estimating The Value Of El Nino Southern Oscillation Information In A Regional Water Market With Implications For Water Management,"This study employs both a stochastic programming without recourse model and a regression approach to estimate the value of the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) information in the Northern Taiwan regional water market. The empirical estimation results provide several useful implications for water resource management. First, the precipitation of this region is significantly affected by El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation events, which increases the uncertainty of regional water supply. Secondly, the damage caused by the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation events to this regional water market could reach up to NT$ 146 million (i.e., US$ 4.56 million). Finally, the possible water management strategies, which include water transfer activities among different demand groups, with a perfect El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation forecast could substantially mitigate the damage and result in a benefit of NT$ 370 million (i.e., US$ 11.56 million).","Liao, Shu-Yi",liao_estimatingelninosouthern_2010,TRUE,NA,soc_ben_repo,estimating the value of el nino southern,2010
Extending Data For Urban Health Decision-Making: A Menu Of New And Potential Neighborhood-Level Health Determinants Datasets In Lmics,"Area-level indicators of the determinants of health are vital to plan and monitor progress toward targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tools such as the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART) and UN Habitat Urban Inequities Surveys identify dozens of area-level health determinant indicators that decisionmakers can use to track and attempt to address population health burdens and inequalities. However, questions remain as to how such indicators can be measured in a cost-effective way. Area-level health determinants reflect the physical, ecological, and social environments that influence health outcomes at community and societal levels, and include, among others, access to quality health facilities, safe parks, and other urban services, traffic density, level of informality, level of air pollution, degree of social exclusion, and extent of social networks. The identification and disaggregation of indicators is necessarily constrained by which datasets are available. Typically, these include household- and individual-level survey, census, administrative, and health system data. However, continued advancements in earth observation (EO), geographical information system (GIS), and mobile technologies mean that new sources of area-level health determinant indicators derived from satellite imagery, aggregated anonymized mobile phone data, and other sources are also becoming available at granular geographic scale. Not only can these data be used to directly calculate neighborhood- and city-level indicators, they can be combined with survey, census, administrative and health system data to model household- and individual-level outcomes (e.g., population density, household wealth) with tremendous detail and accuracy. WorldPop and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have already modeled dozens of household survey indicators at country or continental scales at resolutions of 1 Ã— 1 km or even smaller. This paper aims to broaden perceptions about which types of datasets are available for health and development decision-making. For data scientists, we flag area-level indicators at city and sub-city scales identified by health decision-makers in the SDGs, Urban HEART, and other initiatives. For local health decision-makers, we summarize a menu of new datasets that can be feasibly generated from EO, mobile phone, and other spatial dataâ€”ideally to be made free andpublicly availableâ€”and offer lay descriptions of some of the difficulties in generating such data products.","Thomson, Dana",thomson_extendingdataurbanhealth_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,extending data for urban health decision,2019

"Fire Monitoring - The Use Of Medium Resolution Satellites (Avhrr, Modis, Tet) For Long Time Series Processing And The Implementation In User Driven Applications And Services","This paper introduces fire monitoring works of two different projects, namely TIMELINE (TIMe Series Processing of Medium Resolution Earth Observation Data assessing Long â€“Term Dynamics In our Natural Environment) and PHAROS (Project on a Multi-Hazard Open Platform for Satellite Based Downstream Services). It describes the evolution from algorithm development from in applied research to the implementation in user driven applications and systems. Concerning TIMELINE, the focus of the work lies on hot spot detection. A detailed description of the choice of a suitable algorithm (round robin approach) will be given. Moreover, strengths and weaknesses of the AVHRR sensor for hot spot detection, a literature review, the study areas and the selected approach will be highlighted. The evaluation showed that the contextual algorithm performed best, and will therefore be used for final implementation. Concerning the PHAROS project, the key aspect is on the use of satellite-based information to provide valuable support to all phases of disaster management. The project focuses on developing a pre-operational sustainable service platform that integrates space-based EO (Earth Observation), terrestrial sensors and communication and navigation assets to enhance the availability of services and products following a multi-hazard approach.","Fuchs, Eva-Maria",fuchs_firemonitoringmediumresolution_2015,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,fire monitoring the use of medium resolu,2015
"Fire And Smoke Observed From The Earth Observing System Modis Instrument-Products, Validation, And Operational Use","The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, launched on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terra satellite at the end of 1999, was designed with 36 spectral channels for a wide array of land, ocean, and atmospheric investigations. MODIS has a unique ability to observe fires, smoke, and burn scars globally. Its main fire detection channels saturate at high brightness temperatures: 500 K at 4 Âµm and 400 K at 11 Âµm, which can only be attained in rare circumstances at the 1 km fire detection spatial resolution. Thus, unlike other polar orbiting satellite sensors with similar thermal and spatial resolutions, but much lower saturation temperatures (e.g. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Along Track Scanning Radiometer), MODIS can distinguish between low intensity ground surface fires and high intensity crown forest fires. Smoke column concentration over land is for the first time being derived from the MODIS solar channels, extending from 0.41 Âµm to 2.1 Âµm. The smoke product has been provisionally validated both globally and regionally over southern Africa and central and south America. Burn scars are observed from MODIS even in the presence of smoke, using the 1.2 to 2.1 Âµm channels. MODIS burned area information is used to estimate pyrogenic emissions. A wide range of these fire and related products and validation are demonstrated for the wild fires that occurred in northwestern USA in Summer 2000. The MODIS rapid response system and direct broadcast capability is being developed to enable users to obtain and generate data in near real-time. It is expected that health and land management organizations will use these systems for monitoring the occurrence of fires and the dispersion of smoke within two to six hours after data acquisition.","Kaufman, Y.J.",kaufman_firesmokeobservedearth_2003,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,fire and smoke observed from the earth o,2003
Forest Service Spending On Large Wildfires In The West,"Since the 1970s, federal spending on wildfire suppression in the United States has grown, reaching $1 billion annually over the past decade. The USDA Forest Service has also increasingly used private contractors to conduct fire suppression. As with all activities that the Forest Service performs, the agency can employ staff directly, contract with outside businesses, or enter into agreements with nonprofit and other government entities to perform fire suppression. Historically, the Forest Service primarily used agency personnel for much of its suppression activities. However, with the decline of Forest Service personnel in the 1990s, the agency turned to contractors more frequently. Despite these growing costs and the larger role of private businesses in fire suppression, relatively little is known outside the land management agencies about what these funds are spent on, how they are spent, which activities are contracted out, and where this spending occurs. Yet, the choices that the Forest Service makes in wildfire suppression spending affect communities and economies near wildfires. In particular, local and regional capture of suppression contracts and local employment of agency staff can help mediate the negative economic impacts of a wildfire.","Ellison, Autumn",ellison_forestservicespendingwildfires_2012,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,forest service spending on large wildfir,2012
Free Satellite Imagery And Digital Elevation Model Analyses Enabling Natural Resource Management In The Developing World: Case Studies From Eastern Indonesia,"Decentralization of governance and natural resource management is an ongoing process in many parts of Africa and Asia. Natural resource management requires spatial land resource data for planning. However, currently the financial and human capacity for natural resource mapping, monitoring and modelling remains low in local governments. In this context, this paper explores how new opportunities provided by the increasing availability of free satellite imagery, digital elevation data and open source spatial analysis software, can be applied by local government and NGOs to conduct sophisticated natural resource mapping and modelling in ways that meet their needs and incorporates local knowledge. Reported are cases of a local government using free geospatial data and GIS software to improve evidence-based natural resource management in the developing world with a focus on raster data applications for satellite image analysis and terrain modelling. It is argued that, through removing barriers to uptake, such applications provide a means of decentralizing landscape analysis skills to improve local natural resource management. This hypothesis is supported through examples of a local government applying these tools in eastern Indonesia, and within this context barriers to wider adoption are explored.","Fisher, Rohan",fisher_freesatelliteimagerydigital_2017,FALSE,"Might conflate GIS and EO dataâ€¦ â€œThe paper evaluates the mentioned case studies against criteria suggested by McCall and Dunn (2012) for participatory GIS to contribute to good governance, including strengthening legitimacy, creating respect for local knowledge, developing equity, demonstrating competence, and creating accountabilityâ€",soc_ben_repo,free satellite imagery and digital eleva,2017
From Science To Applications: Determinants Of Diffusion In The Use Of Earth Observations,"We demonstrate the diffusion in use of Earth observations data in social science research. Our study is motivated by the continuing debate among policymakers over the value of the nationâ€™s investment in Earth observations. We also consider the role of related factors including the spread of geographical information systems (GIS; a complementary tool for using Earth observations data) and the role of data prices. We first estimate a diffusion curve and then draw from standard bibliometric methods to evaluate further the extent to which the research field is growing. We realize that these aspects of the value of Earth observations are often part of policy debate, but we offer insights into how to substantiate \nand document these claims. We find evidence of increasingly widespread use of Earth observations in an ever-widening number of applications and geographic regions. GIS and data prices influence this diffusion. However, we see less evidence of a community of practice within the large social science literature represented in our data. These findings have implications for steps to take to increase the benefits of Earth observations.","Macauley, Molly",macauley_scienceapplicationsdeterminantsdiffusion_2010,FALSE,"Lit review, regression to examine factors influencing diffusion of EO data - does not seem to value data explicitly, but factors that increase diffusion might hint at aspects that are valued",soc_ben_repo,from science to applications determinant,2010

Geoessential- Mainstreaming Workflows From Data Sources To Environmental Policy Indicators With Essential Variables,"When defining indicators on the environment, the use of existing initiatives should be a priority rather than redefining indicators each time. From an Information, Communication and Technology perspective, data interoperability and standardization are critical to improve data access and exchange as promoted by the Group on Earth Observations. GEOEssential is following an end-user driven approach by defining Essential Variables (EVs), as an intermediate value between environmental policy indicators and their appropriate data sources. From international to local scales, environmental policies and indicators are increasingly percolating down from the global to the local agendas. The scientific business processes for the generation of EVs and related indicators can be formalized in workflows specifying the necessary logical steps. To this aim, GEOEssential is developing a Virtual Laboratory the main objective of which is to instantiate conceptual workflows, which are stored in a dedicated knowledge base, generating executable workflows. To interpret and present the relevant outputs/results carried out by the different thematic workflows considered in GEOEssential (i.e. biodiversity, ecosystems, extractives, night light, and food-water-energy nexus), a Dashboard is built as a visual front-end.

GEOValue explores each step in this complex value chain from the viewpoint of domain experts spanning disciplines that range from the technical side of data acquisition and management to the social sciences that provide the framework to assess the benefit to society. The book is intended to provide foundational understanding of the techniques and complexities of each step in the process. As such it is intended to be assessable to a reader without prior training in data acquisition systems, information systems, or valuation methods. In addition, a number of case studies are provided that demonstrate the use of geospatial information as a critical input for evaluation of policy pertaining to a wide range of application areas, such as agricultural and environmental policy, natural catastrophes, e-government and transportation systems.","Kuse, Jamie",kuse_geovaluesocioeconomicgeospatialinformation_2017,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,geovalue the socioeconomic value of geos,2017

Geographic Microtargeting Of Social Assistance With High-Resolution Poverty Maps,"Hundreds of millions of poor families receive some form of targeted social assistance. Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learningâ€“based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learningâ€“based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion. Based in part on these findings, the Government of Nigeria used this approach to geographically target emergency cash transfers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Smythe, Isabella",smythe_geographicmicrotargetingsocialassistance_2022,TRUE,Compares performance of ML/EO based maps survey-based maps for targeting poverty alleviation in Nigeria,soc_ben_repo,geographic microtargeting of social assi,2022

Getting The Most Out Of Ensemble Forecasts: A Valuation Model Based On User-Forecast Interactions,"A flexible theoretical model of perceived forecast value is proposed that explicitly includes the effects of user and ensemble characteristics and their interactions. The model can be applied to arbitrary decision problems and is sensitive to a much wider range of factors than traditional forecast valuation models. A simple illustration of its application to the costâ€“loss decision problem familiar from the forecast valuation literature is discussed. It is shown that perceived value is highly sensitive to perceived model accuracy and that in most cases a high level of perceived accuracy is required for the forecasts to be thought to have any value at all. Decisions with a costâ€“benefit ratio that is close to the climatological probability of the adverse event are shown to be less sensitive to perceived accuracy. The model shows that it is possible for perceived value to remain unchanged when perceived accuracy increases, thus suggesting an explanation for why forecast uptake often does not increase after improvements in model performance are made. Last, it is argued that attempts to increase forecast uptake should be targeted at those users whose costâ€“benefit ratios fall in a restricted range that depends on the climatological probability of the event and an objective measure of the ensemble accuracy.","Millner, Antony",millner_ensembleforecastsvaluationmodel_2008,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,getting the most out of ensemble forecas,2008

Global Warming Uncertainties And The Value Of Information: An Analysis Using Ceta,"In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of optimal carbon control strategies to parameters of the Carbon Emissions Trajectory Assessment (CETA) Model, and we use CETA in a simple decision tree framework to estimate the value of information about global warming uncertainties. We find that if an optimal control policy is used under uncertainty, the eventual resolution of uncertainty has high value relative to current research budgets, and resolving uncertainty about the costs of warming is nearly as important as resolving uncertainty about the extent of warming. In addition, we find that there is not a high premium on immediate resolution of uncertainty, if resolution would otherwise occur within, say, twenty years; this implies that time is available to plan and execute a carefully designed research program. On the other hand, we find that if the real world political process would result in a suboptimal control policy being chosen under uncertainty, and this choice could be prevented by early resolution of uncertainty, the benefit of early resolution may be as much as three orders of magnitude greater.","Peck, Stephen",peck_globalwarminguncertaintiesinformation_1993,FALSE,this is  about carbon emissions trajectory and policy rather than any kind of remote observation-related information,soc_ben_repo,global warming uncertainties and the val,1993

Additional remote-sensing information and output from land surface models were used to identify that groundwater losses are the major source of this trend. The approach used in this study provides an example of â€˜â€˜best current capabilitiesâ€™â€™ in regions like the Middle East, where data access can be severely limited. Results indicate that the region lost 17.3 +/- 2.1 mm yr^-1 equivalent water height of groundwater during the study period, or 91.3 +/-10.9 km^3 in volume.

How To Measure The Economic Health Cost Of Wildfires - A Systematic Review Of The Literature For Northern America,"There has been an increasing interest in the economic health cost from smoke exposure from wildfires in the past 20 years, particularly in the north-western USA that is reflected in an emergent literature. In this review, we provide an overview and discussion of studies since 2006 on the health impacts of wildfire smoke and of approaches for the estimation of the associated economic cost. We focus on the choice of key variables such as cost estimators for determining the economic impact of mortality and morbidity effects. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion and guidance on the functioning, advantages and challenges of BenMAP-CE, freely available software of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that has been used in a growing number of studies to assess cost from wildfire smoke. We highlight what generates differences in outcomes between relevant studies and make suggestions for increasing the comparability between studies. All studies, however, demonstrate highly significant health cost from smoke exposure, in the millions or billions of US dollars, often driven by increases in mortality.

Identifying Methods For Quantifying The Societal Impacts Of The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) generates tremendous value for the nation. The Agency provides critical environmental data, forecasts, cutting edge knowledge, management and stewardship that the United States needs to plan for and react to in a constantly changing global environment. The Agency, however, needs to do more to understand and measure exactly how its activities, products and services affect the well-being of the nation. Existing and emerging social science methods can be harnessed to help the Agency assess the degree to which we are meeting our mission goals and to improve the value we provide to society. The first NOAA Science Challenge workshop brought together policy makers at NOAA with social science leaders from inside and outside of the Agency to explore methods for better quantifying the ways in which NOAA affects society. As an initial step in better understanding the broader societal impacts of NOAA, we focused on the NOAA line offices and programs that deal most directly with the public: the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (including the National Sea Grant College Program), and the programs that support climate activities at NOAA (the Climate Program Office and the National Climate Data Center). While it is easy to see why society needs NOAA, the workshop revealed just how difficult it can be to rigorously quantify the societal impact of NOAAâ€™s activities, products, and services. As a first step, the line offices identified specific NOAA products, services, and activities (outputs) for which they would like to quantify societal impacts. These examples were meant to highlight a diversity of products and services. We focused initially on relatively straightforward examples that could serve as both a departure for discussion and illustrations of how programs within the Agency might begin thinking about quantifying the societal impact of their work. For each output, the line offices developed a narrative (story) that linked the output with a sector of society and ultimately a state of societal well-being. Workshop participants further developed these stories and explored methods and approaches to better quantify how these NOAA outputs affect societal well-being. The workshop identified many methods that can be applied to better understand the way the Agency affects society. One class of methods is data denial, in which intermediate and final users of NOAA data products are asked to operate in the absence of NOAA data. Other methods involve retrospective analyses of the ways in which the public and private sector have used NOAA outputs. Still other approaches require that users imagine how their decisions would differ in the absence of NOAA activities, products and services.Table 1 provides a sampling of value chains, metrics, and methods developed at the workshop. The participants identified a variety of metrics to measure societal well-being and change including revenues, economic value, lives saved, sense of place, preferences and attitudes, property damages, and crop yields. While one day is insufficient to fully develop these methods and approaches, the workshop was an important opportunity for policy makers at NOAA and social scientists to work together to understand how the Agency can harness social science methods to do a better job of meeting its mission goals. Certain line offices are still more adept at measuring the baseline of societal well-being than in trying to tease out the contribution of any single program or activity. This corresponds, in large part, to the enterprise nature of many activities at the Agency â€“ many programs inside and outside of the Agency combine to achieve our mission goals. As the Agency moves forward in its efforts to understand how NOAA affects society, the methods and metrics used to do so will be refined and improved. Possible next steps in the process include:\nâ—‹ More enterprise level approaches to developing value chains and valuations.\nâ—‹ Follow-up workshops or symposia on methods for quantifying the societal impacts of specific types of NOAA outputs including: research, information, and weather.",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,nationaloceanicandatmosphericadministration_identifyingmethodsquantifyingsocietal_2011,FALSE,This reports results from a workshop; examples are not strictly a review but were not applied by the authors,soc_ben_repo,identifying methods for quantifying the ,2011

Improved Hydrological Decision Support System For The Lower Mekong River Basin Using Satellite-Based Earth Observations,"Multiple satellite-based earth observations and traditional station data along with the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model were employed to enhance the Lower Mekong River Basin region's hydrological decision support system. A nearest neighbor approximation methodology was introduced to fill the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrieval for the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (IMERG) grid points from 2001 to 2014, together with the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) data points for continuous precipitation forcing for our hydrological decision support system. A software tool to access and format satellite-based earth observation systems of precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures was developed and is presented. Our results suggest that the model-simulated streamflow utilizing TRMM and IMERG forcing data was able to capture the variability of the observed streamflow patterns in the Lower Mekong better than model-simulated streamflow with in-situ precipitation station data. We also present satellite-based and in-situ precipitation adjustment maps that can serve to correct precipitation data for the Lower Mekong region for use in other applications. The inconsistency, scarcity, poor spatial representation, difficult access and incompleteness of the available in-situ precipitation data for the Mekong region make it imperative to adopt satellite-based earth observations to pursue hydrologic modeling.","Mohammed, Inrahim N.",mohammed_improvedhydrologicaldecisionsupport_2018,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,improved hydrological decision support s,2018
In Situ Observations,"In situ observations are defined as those made at the point where the instrument is located. Since a large variety of techniques have been used for in situ measurements, the general features, capabilities and problems of these techniques are reviewed. To illustrate capabilities and problems more specifically, examples of recent measurements are presented which have a bearing on the chlorofluoromethane-ozone problem. These include: (1) resonance fluorescence for the measurement of Cl and ClO, (2) grab and cryogenic collection of whole air samples for the measurement of CFC13 and CF2C12 (as well as CHO, H2, CO and N20), (3) impregnated filters for acid chloride, and (4) matrix isolation for HO2 and NO.","Ehalt, D.H.",ehalt_situobservations_1980,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,in situ observations,1980
Inclusive Design Of Earth Observation Decision Support Systems For Environmental Governance: A Case Study Of Lake Nokoue,"Earth Observation (EO) data can enhance understanding of human-environmental systems for the creation of climate data services, or Decision Support Systems (DSS), to improve monitoring, prediction and mitigation of climate harm. However, EO data is not always incorporated into the workflow for decision-makers for a multitude of reasons including awareness, accessibility and collaboration models. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a collaborative model that addresses historical power imbalances between communities. This paper highlights a case study of a climate harm mitigation DSS collaboration between the Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab and Green Keeper Africa (GKA), an enterprise located in Benin. GKA addresses the management of an invasive plant species that threatens ecosystem health and economic activities on Lake NokouÃ©. They do this through a social entrepreneurship business model that aims to advance both economic empowerment and environmental health. In demonstrating a Space Enabled-GKA collaboration model that advances GKAâ€™s business aims, this study first considers several popular service and technology design methods and offer critiques of each method in terms of their ability to address inclusivity in complex systems. These critiques lead to the selection of the Systems Architecture Framework (SAF) as the technology design method for the case study. In the remainder of the paper, the SAF is applied to the case study to demonstrate how the framework coproduces knowledge that would information DSS with Earth Observation data. The paper offers several practical considerations and values related to epistemology, data collection, prioritization and methodology for performing inclusive design of climate data services.","Ovienmhada, Ufuoma",ovienmhada_inclusivedesignearthobservation_2021,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,inclusive design of earth observation de,2021
Indian Earth Observation Programme Towards Societal Benefits: Geoss Perspective,"Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme, since its inception has been applications driven and national development has been its main motivation. In order to meet the observational requirements of many societal benefit areas, a series of EO systems have been launched in both polar and geo synchronous orbits. Starting from Bhaskara, the first experimental EO satellite in 1979 to Cartosat-1 successfully launched in May 2005, a large number of sensors operating in optical and microwave spectral regions, providing data at resolutions ranging from 1 km to a meter have been built and flown. Data reception and processing facilities have been established not only in the country but also at various international ground stations. Remotely sensed data and its derived information have become an integral component of the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS), a unique concept evolved and established in the country. The paper discusses the evolution of IRS satellite systems, application programmes in different societal benefit areas and the road ahead.

Information Systems In Support Of Wildland Fire Management Decision Making In Canada,"This paper provides an overview of four national forest fire management information systems currently used in Canada. The Canadian forest fire danger rating system (CFFDRS) is a non-spatial system, which provides the science framework for fire danger rating in Canada. The spatial fire management system (sFMS) is a geographic information system based fire management information system that implements two core subsystems of the CFFDRS, along with other models and systems. The sFMS is the spatial engine that has been used to implement both of Canada's national forest fire management information systems, the Canadian wildland fire information system (CWFIS) and the fire monitoring, mapping and modeling system (Fire M3). The CWFIS is Canada's national fire management information system; it presents daily information on fire weather, fire behavior potential and selected upper atmospheric conditions. Fire M3 integrates the use of satellite technology for monitoring and mapping large fire occurrence in Canada. Fire M3 also incorporates information from CWFIS to model the impacts of large forest fires based on fire weather conditions and potential fire behavior.","Lee, B.S.",lee_informationsystemssupportwildland_2002,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,information systems in support of wildla,2002
Intangible Economic Benefit Of Remote Sensing Data In Indonesia,"Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) as a space ecosystem runner government institution of the space agency in Indonesia is mandated by Indonesia space law of 2013 to carry out remote sensing activities that are not only strategic nationally in nature but also charged being benefits economically. This study investigated the intangible economic benefits of remote sensing activities in Indonesia. This research explored qualitatively the advantage of the use of remote sensing information by users obtained from the results of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The conceptual framework of intangible benefit is based on the information system success model by the De-Lone and McLean Information Value model. The results showed that the quality of remote sensing was good. This can be seen from most responses of user respondents on the Perceived System Quality and Information Quality indicators giving a good rating. The response of the user respondents caused a sense of satisfaction and also caused the use of the system to be more intense. These had a good impact on the performance of respondents, both individually and organizationally. Strengthened by indepth interviews showed that economically provide benefits with an average of 64% increasing in the efficiency of the performance by Agriculture and Palm Oil sectors.

Integrated National-Scale Assessment Of Wildfire Risk To Human And Ecological Values,"The spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of wildfire risk are challenging U.S. federal land management agencies to meet societal needs while maintaining the health of the lands they manage. In this paper we present a quantitative, geospatial wildfire risk assessment tool, developed in response to demands for improved risk-based decision frameworks. The methodology leverages off recent and significant advancements in wildfire simulation models and geospatial data acquisition and management. The tool is intended to facilitate monitoring trends in wildfire risk over time and to develop information useful in prioritizing fuels treatments and mitigation measures. Wildfire risk assessment requires analyzing the likelihood of wildfire by intensity level, and the magnitude of potential beneficial and negative effects to valued resources from fire at different intensity levels. This effort is designed to support strategic planning by systematically portraying how fire likelihood and intensity influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values at the national scale. We present results for the continental United States, analyze high risk areas by geographic region, and examine how risk evaluations changes under different assumptions with sensitivity analysis. We conclude by discussing further potential uses of the tool and research needs.","Thompson, Matthew",thompson_integratednationalscaleassessment_2011,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,integrated national scale assessment of ,2011
Integrating Earth Observation Data Into Geospatial Databases That Support Public Health Decisions,"There are several reasons why public health communities do not use information from Earth observations routinely. Most notable among them are: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that would deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly in their already heavy workloads. The Public Health Applications in Remote Sensing (PHAiRS) project is engineering elements of an enhanced disease surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the desert southwest of the United States. Several Earth observations (EO) data sets are replacing parameters traditionally used in dust forecasting models to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement. Output from the enhanced dust forecasting model is nested within a regional version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (Eta version) model (NCEP/Eta). Simulations using the enhanced dust model have been compared to actual dust episodes recorded by NCEP/Etaâ€™s atmospheric patterns and by dust data from a ground-based Continuous Air Monitoring System (CAMS). The simulations were rerun after replacing the land cover layer with land cover classes derived from MODIS (MOD-12). For the CAMS test cases, this resulted in a significant improvement in dust episode patterns. Additional EO data assimilations investigate whether further improvements can be gained by replacing the topographic layer with higher resolution digital elevation data from SRTM, dustgenerating areas derived from MOD-15â€™s Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, soil moisture data from AMSR-E, and aerodynamic surface roughness. Ongoing simulations aim eventually to measure hourly, daily, and weekly model improvements from EO data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis. The overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several EO data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of EO data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c), develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence.","Morain, S.A.",morain_integratingearthobservationdata_2006,TRUE,Dust forecasting - compares model outputs using higher-resolution EO data to see how model performs? no valuation of information except for model performance,soc_ben_repo,integrating earth observation data into ,2006
Integration Of Earth Observation And In-Situ Spatial Data For The Development Of A Decision Support Tool For Technological Risk Management,"In this study, the design and implementation of a GIS based tool for the support of technological risk management is presented. This Decision Support Tool is based on the detection and space-time monitoring of plumes caused by technological accidents, by integrating moderate and high-resolution satellite imagery and in-situ spatial data. The Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) on board the NOAA satellites has been used for the detection of fire as well as for the detection and monitoring of plumes. The detection algorithms have been presented in previous studies for past accidents in Europe. AVHRR images, were adjusted to the broader area of Athens in order to develop a major technological accident scenario based on real plumes. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on board the EOS AM-1 satellite has been used for the extraction of topographic information, land cover and spatial distribution of vegetation, as well as for the depiction of urban areas, road network and major industrial installations. The scenario was used to present the functionality of the developed GIS tool for the support of decision making during the crisis, as well as for the assessment of the accident's impact to natural and human environment.","Chrysoulakis, Nektarios",chrysoulakis_integrationearthobservationsitu_2003,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,integration of earth observation and in ,2003
"Interactive Model For Assessing Mangrove Health, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, And Satellite Design In Rio De Janeiro Using Earth Observation Data","There is an increasing need for tools to translate Earth Observation (EO) data into societally relevant metrics to inform human decision-making. To address this need, we present a multi-disciplinary, interactive modeling framework to advance ecological forecasting and policymaking using EO data. This framework will integrate four model components into one tool: Earth Science, Social Impact, Human Behavior and Satellite Design. The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management of EO and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing, machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering. This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study: the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence shing, preventing coastal erosion, and attracting an ecotourism industry. The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model components. The Earth Science Model builds upon work by NASA biospheric scientists to use EO data, cloud computing and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a 600 km2 area, as well as work by the Espa co research group at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro on the local mangrove ecosystem. To create the Human Decision Making model, we have partnered with Instituto Pereira Passos (the data science o ce of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand the policy history and socioeconomic factors. To build the Social Impact model, we are collaborating with ecosystem services economists to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact socioeconomic wellbeing. The Satellite Design Model accounts for the types of data collection used by policy makers since 1985. Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive model that policymakers can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes? This case study is demonstrative of the viability of a similar approach for ecosystems around the world.","Reid, Jack",reid_interactivemodelassessingmangrove_2020,FALSE,"Causal impacts between EVDT components - e.g., environment (EO data) and decision (socioeconomic benefit?).

Investigating The Global Socio-Economic Benefits Of Satellite Industry And Remote Sensing Applications,"In recent years we have seen a growth in the revenues and investments of satellite industry. Originally, satellites, remote sensing (RS), and other navigations systems were only employed for government and military purposes. However, in the past two decades there has been an increase use of these tools for commercial purposes. In particular, satellites and RS can be used for space and earth observations, support military operations, precision agriculture, meteorological forecasting, communication and internet connectivity to lesser-known applications such as in transport tracking and monitoring of utility networks. In this paper, we analyse the current trends, benefits and limitations of the use of satellites and RS. In particular, we try to identify the main socio-economic benefits deriving from the use of RS in several sectors. We also seek to introduce economists to the science of RS data, and give a flavour of how this new fountain of data can be utilized so far and what might be done in the future.","Alvino, Letizia",alvino_investigatingglobalsocioeconomic_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,investigating the global socio economic ,2019
"Investigation Of Aquaculture Dynamics At A Ramsar Site, Using Earth Observation Systems In Conjunction With A Socio-Economic Assessment","This study presents a comprehensive site-scale analysis conducted within the global wetland inventory and mapping (GWIM) project. GWIM was developed and promoted by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) through global partnerships to investigate wetland analyses at multiple scales. The present study investigates the complexity of an inland freshwater wetland system, presenting a conceptual framework for mapping and monitoring the dynamics of Lake Kolleru (a wetland of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention), utilizing a geospatial platform. Illustrating the pace of land use changes leading to the progressive elimination of the wetland ecosystem of freshwater Lake Kolleru, this study also highlights the impacts of such changes on the socio-economic system. A comprehensive temporal analysis (1977â€“2007) provided a structural base to schematically analyse the dynamics of biophysical and ecological changes to the wetland by effectively using a spectrum of remote sensing data. The present status and changing trends in ecological dimensions of Lake Kolleru were illustrated, utilizing information from spatial analyses, complimented with socio-economic assessment. Attention is drawn to the potential of utilizing earth resources systems in exploring spaceâ€“time interactions in freshwater ecosystems heavily modified through aquaculture interventions. Further, the spatial derivatives are meant as reference material for local authorities and decision-makers to rehabilitate the economic livelihood activities to the social community dependent on the lake ecosystem. The disseminated message emphasizes the applicability of geospatial tools to enhance the efficacy of the decision-making process by facilitating regular monitoring of ecosystem dynamics and providing updated information on wetland patterns and uses.","Nagabhatla, Nidhi",nagabhatla_investigationaquaculturedynamicsramsar_2009,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,investigation of aquaculture dynamics at,2009
Knowledge Formalization For Earth Science Informed Decision-Making: The Geoessential Knowledge Base,"During the past two centuries, the world has undergone deep societal, political, and economical changes that\nheavily affected human life. The above changes contributed to an increased awareness about the deep impact\nthat policy decisions have at the local and the global level. Therefore, there is a strong need that policy-making\nand decision-making processes for a sustainable development be based on the best available knowledge about\nEarth system and environment.\nThe recent advance of information technologies enables running complex models that use the large amount of\nEarth Observation datasets available. However, data and model interoperability are still limited to the syntactic\nlevel allowing to access and process datasets independently of their structural characteristics (data format, co-\nordinate reference systems, service interface, ...) but with no clear reference to their content (the semantic level)\nand context of use (the pragmatic level). This poses heavy limitations to the reusability of scientific processes and\nrelated workflows.\nThe paper presents a general framework to address this issue through the design of a Knowledge Base sup-\nporting data and model semantic (and pragmatic) interoperability. In this framework, a general ontology rep-\nresents the knowledge generation process for policy relevant decision-making, while multiple vocabularies\nformalize the semantics of data and models, identifying different types of observables, process variables, and\nindicators/indices. To evaluate the proposed approach to semantic interoperability of data and models, the\nKnowledge Base has been integrated with an advanced model-sharing framework, and a proof-of-concept has\nbeen developed for the assessment of one of the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the\nUnited Nations.","Mazzetti, Paolo",mazzetti_knowledgeformalizationearthscience_2022,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,knowledge formalization for earth scienc,2022
Knowledge Generation Using Satellite Earth Observations To Support Sustainable Development Goals (Sdg): A Use Case On Land Degradation,"Land degradation is a critical issue globally requiring immediate actions for protecting biodiversity and associated services provided by ecosystems that are supporting human quality of life. The latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Landmark Assessment Report highlighted that human activities are considerably degrading land and threating the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion\npeople. In order to reduce and ideally reverse this prevailing situation, national capacities should be strengthened to enable effective assessments and mapping of their degraded lands as recommended by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The indicator 15.3.1 (â€œproportion of land that is degraded over total land areaâ€) requires regular data production by countries to inform and assess it through space and time. Earth\nObservations (EO) can play an important role both for generating the indicator in countries where it is missing, as well complementing or enhancing national official data sources. In response to this issue, this paper presents an innovative, scalable and flexible approach to monitor land degradation at various scales (e.g., national, regional, global) using various components of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) platform to leverage EO resources for informing SDG 15.3.1. The proposed approach follows the Data-Information-Knowledge pattern using the Trends.Earth model (http://trends.earth) and various data sources to generate the indicator. It also implements additional components for model execution and orchestration, knowledge management, and visualization. The proposed approach has been successfully applied at global, regional and national scales and advances the vision of (1) establishing data analytics platforms that can potentially support countries to discover, access and use the necessary datasets to assess land degradation; and (2) developing new capacities to effectively and efficiently use EO-based resources.","Giuliani, Gregory",giuliani_knowledgegenerationsatelliteearth_2020,FALSE,Approach to monitor land degradation at various scales using EO data toward an indicator for SDG 15.3.1.,soc_ben_repo,knowledge generation using satellite ear,2020

However, most geo-referenced information comes without sufficient information on quality and applicability. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) has embarked on establishing a so-called GEO Label that would provide easy-to-understand, globally available information on aspects of quality, user rating, relevance, and fit-for-usage of the products and services accessible through the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS).

Landsat Data Ecosystem Case Study: Actor Perceptions Of The Use And Value Of Landsat,"It is well-known that Earth observation (EO) data plays a critical role in scientific understanding about the global environment. There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts.

Landsat In Contexts: Deconstructing And Reconstructing The Data-To-Action Paradigm In Earth Remote Sensing,"There is a common theme at play in our talk of data generally, of digital earth data more specifically, and of environmental monitoring most specifically: more data leads to more action and, ultimately, to societal good. This data-to-action framework is troubled. Its taken-for grantedness prevents us from attending to the processes between data and action. It also dampens our drive to investigate the contexts of that data, that action, and that envisioned societal good. In this dissertation, I deconstruct this data-to-action model in the context of Landsat, the United States' first natural resource management satellite. First, I talk about the ways in which Landsat's data and instrumentation hold conflicting narratives and values within them. Therefore, Landsat data does not automatically or easily yield action toward environmental preservation, or toward any unified societal good. Furthermore, I point out a parallel dynamic in STS, where critique is somewhat analogous to data. We want our critiques to yield action, and to guide us toward a more just technoscience. However, critiques- like data- require intentional, reconstructive interventions toward change. Here is an opportunity for a diffractive intervention: one in which we read STS and remote sensingthrough each other, to create space for interdisciplinary dialogue around environmental preservation. A focus on this shared goal, I argue, is imperative. At stake are issues of environmental degradation, dwindling resources, and climate change. I conclude with beginnings rather than endings: with suggestions for how we might begin to create infrastructure that attends to that forgotten space between data, critique, action, and change.","Fried, Samantha",fried_landsatcontextsdeconstructingreconstructing_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,landsat in contexts deconstructing and r,2019
Landscape Analysis Of Cobalt Mining Activities From 2009 To 2021 Using Very High Resolution Satellite Data (Democratic Republic Of The Congo),"The cobalt mining sector is well positioned to be a key contributor in determining the success of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Despite the important contribution to the DRCâ€™s economy, the rapid expansion of mining operations has resulted in major social, health, and environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the cumulative impact of mining activities on the landscape of a prominent cobalt mining area in the DRC. To achieve this, an object-based method, employing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, was used to map land cover across the city of Kolwezi and the surrounding mining areas, where long-term mining activity has dramatically altered the landscape. The research used very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery (2009, 2014, 2019, 2021) to map the spatial distribution of land cover and land cover change, as well as analyse the spatial relationship between land cover classes and visually identified mine features, from 2009 to 2021. Results from the object-based SVM land cover classification produced an overall accuracy of 85.2â€“90.4% across the time series. Between 2009 and 2021, land cover change accounted to: rooftops increasing by 147.2% (+7.7 km2); impervious surface increasing by 104.7% (+3.35 km2); bare land increasing by 85.4% (+33.81 km2); exposed rock increasing by 56.2% (+27.46 km2); trees decreasing by 4.5% (âˆ’0.34 km2); shrub decreasing by 38.4% (âˆ’26.04 km2); grass and cultivated land decreasing by 27.1% (âˆ’45.65 km2); and water decreasing by 34.6% (âˆ’3.28 km2). The co-location of key land cover classes and visually identified mine features exposed areas of potential environmental pollution, with 91.6% of identified water situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature, and vulnerable populations, with 71.6% of built-up areas (rooftop and impervious surface class combined) situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature. Assessing land cover patterns over time and the interplay between mine features and the landscape structure allowed the study to amplify the findings of localised on-the-ground research, presenting an alternative viewpoint to quantify the true scale and impact of cobalt mining in the DRC. Filling geospatial data gaps and examining the present and past trends in cobalt mining is critical for informing and managing the sustainable growth and development of the DRCâ€™s mining sector.","Brown, Chloe",brown_landscapeanalysiscobaltmining_2022,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,landscape analysis of cobalt mining acti,2022

Linking Earth Observation And Mobile Technologies For Improved Decision-Support In Case Of Droughts And Related Food Insecurity,"Droughts are complex events that constitute a natural part of the climate. Among all natural disasters they show the largest spatio-temporal extent, cause enormous economic loss and numerous casualties. Although droughts pose a threat to both industrialized and developing countries the latter often suffer from chronic poverty and vulnerability, which pave the way for wide-ranging impacts. Earth observation can support aid organizations that are often struggling to cope with the impact of large-scale drought events. However, exploiting the added-value of new technologies requires tools that are adapted to individual user requirements and in-depth knowledge transfer. Within the framework of a project named SATIDA (Satellite Technologies for Improved Drought Risk Assessment) this dissertation links satellite-derived information that aims at the detection of environmental anomalies to information about socio-economic conditions, collected via a corresponding open-source mobile application. The satellite component is based on the combination of different satellite observations (rainfall, soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation health) in an Enhanced Combined Drought Index (ECDI). The soil moisture component, which is considered a key variable between atmospheric and land surface conditions, is improved by linking near-real-time (NRT) observations from active and passive microwave sensors to an offline dataset that was generated within the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). This way, it is possible to detect soil moisture anomalies based on more than 37 years of data (19782015). Supported by Doctors without Borders, the tests were conducted in the Central African Republic and in Ethiopia. The dissertation results in three key findings. First, current NRT observations of soil moisture are mature enough to be considered for operational drought monitoring. Second, the method to combine different variables in the ECDI facilitates exploiting the individual strengths of all input datasets, and the robust detection of major drought events.

Low accessibility may cause compromise on living conditions, low economic growth, high unemployment, social seclusion, and long-term social inequalities. In developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, surveys fail to keep up with the pace of rapid urbanization. Additionally, numerous location-based data sets, including mobile phone location data and Google Maps travel time, enable near-real-time observations of actively changing mobility dynamics. In this study, we use these novel data sets to assess various facets of accessibility and corresponding poverty-based inequalities within the Greater Maputo region in Mozambique. A data-based approach is seldom used in the Sub-Saharan African context. Consistent poverty-based inequalities in access to opportunities by driving, transit, and walking are observed. The transit system was ascertained to be more inefficient in the poorer regions. The richer regions witnessed most decreased access to opportunities because of high congestion. People living in the poorest regions were observed to travel much longer distances to access facilities than did those living in the richest regions. These differences were particularly significant for essential services of education, healthcare, and employment. These results can help urban planners and policymakers identify disadvantaged communities and develop policies to ameliorate the conditions. This assists in measuring the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and investigating areas of concern. Moreover, this study shows the applicability of various data sets and methods in a data-deprived scenario in Africa, and motivates more scholars and practitioners to partake in this technology leapfrogging.","Mattal, Shagun",mattal_linkingpovertybasedinequalities_2022,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,linking poverty based inequalities with ,2022
Live Monitoring Of Earth Surface (Limes): A Framework For Monitoring Environmental Changes From Earth Observations,"Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale.This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.","Giuliani, Gregory",giuliani_livemonitoringearthsurface_2017,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,live monitoring of earth surface limes a,2017
Market-Based Methods For Monetizing Uncertainty Reduction,"New measurement systems are often expensive and need a solid economic justification. Traditional tools based on the value of information are sometimes difficult to apply. When risks are traded in a market, it may be possible to use market instruments to monetize the reductions in uncertainty. This paper illustrates such market-based methods with a satellite system designed to reduce uncertainty in predicting soil moisture in the USA. Soil moisture is a key variable in managing agricultural production and predicting crop yields. Using data on corn and soybean futures, we find that a 30% reduction in the weather-related component of uncertainty in corn and soybean futures pricing yields a yearly US consumer surplus of $1.44 billion. The total present value of information from the satellite system for the USAâ€”calculated with a 3% discount rateâ€”is about $22 billion, assuming the system is in operation for 20 years. The global value of the improvements in weather forecasting could be $63 billion.","Cooke, Roger",cooke_marketbasedmethodsmonetizing_2020,TRUE,"Options pricing to assess VOI/Bayesian, based on improved accuracy of weather forecasting",soc_ben_repo,market based methods for monetizing unce,2020

Wecompared the costs associated with producing a Burn Area Reflectance Classification map and implementing a BAER when imagery from satellites (either Landsat or a commercial satellite) was available to when the response team relied on information collected solely by aerial reconnaissance. The case study included two evaluations with and without Burn Area Reflectance Classification products: (a) savings of up to US$51,000 for the Elk Complex wildfire incident request and (b) savings of a multi-incident map production program.

Monitoring Sustainable Development By Means Of Earth Observation Data And Machine Learning: A Review,"This paper presents and explores the different Earth Observation approaches and their contribution to the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A review on the Sustainable Development concept and its goals is presented followed by Earth Observation approaches relevant to this field, giving special attention to the contribution of Machine Learning methods and algorithms as well as their potential and capabilities to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, it is observed that Earth Observation plays a key role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals given its cost-effectiveness pertaining to data acquisition on all scales and information richness. Despite the success of Machine Learning upon Earth Observation data analysis, it is observed that performance is heavily dependent on the ability to extract and synthesise characteristics from data. Hence, a deeper and effective analysis of the available data is required to identify the strongest features and, hence, the key factors pertaining to Sustainable Development. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, given the relevance and growing amount of data generated through Earth Observation, it is concluded that there is an increased need for new methods and techniques strongly suggesting the use of new Machine Learning techniques.","Ferreira, Bruno",ferreira_monitoringsustainabledevelopmentmeans_2020,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,monitoring sustainable development by me,2020

Near Real-Time Wildfire Management Using Distributed Satellite System,"Climate action (SDG-13) is an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations (UN), and wildfire is one of the catastrophic events related to climate change. Large-scale forest fires have drastically increased in frequency and size in recent years in Australia and other nations. These wildfires endanger the forests and urban areas of the world, demolish vast amounts of property, and frequently result in fatalities. There is a requirement for real-time/near real-time catastrophic event monitoring of fires due to their growing frequency. In order to effectively monitor disaster events, it will be feasible to manage them in real-time or near real-time, thanks to the advent of the Distributed Satellite System (DSS). This research examines the possible applicability of DSS for wildfire surveillance. For spacecraft to continually monitor the dynamically changing environment, satellite missions must have broad coverage and revisit intervals that DSS can fulfil. A feasibility analysis, as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, are included in this paper to enable prompt action and swiftly provide alerts. In our previous research, it is shown that on-board implementation, i.e., data processing utilising hardware accelerators, is feasible. To enable Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operation (TASO), the same will be included in the proposed DSS architecture, and the outcomes will be provided. To demonstrate the applicability, the suggested DSS architecture will be tested in several geographic locations to demonstrate the system-wide coverage.","Thangavel, Kathiravan",thangavel_realtimewildfiremanagement_2022,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,near real time wildfire management using,2022

"On-Going European Space Agency Activities On Measuring The Benefits Of Earth Observations To Society: Challenges, Achievements And Next Steps","Understanding the Earth system and its physical and societal processes is crucial for helping humankind develop in a sustainable way, and for designing effective policies across a wide range of applications that include mitigating the effects of climate change, the sustainable management of natural resources, food security and public health. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide regular and accurate observations of the entire planet that can greatly support improvements in such understanding. The European Space Agency (ESA) is committed to supporting international efforts to decipher the processes and phenomena that regulate life on Earth, by building world class EO space missions and making data available to scientists and citizens across the world. How successful is ESA in this endeavour? Given the variable and dynamic nature of EO data use, it is difficult to answer the question through established figures. Yet, it is crucial that ESA be able to discriminate and assess the benefits brought by the use of its EO missions, in order to demonstrate its achievements, to keep improving its systems, to better design and plan future missions, and to promote further uptake. In this article, after recalling its commitments in support of Earth system sciences, ESAâ€™s attempts to conduct valuations of the impact of its own space missions are described. In particular, the challenges encountered in measuring such impacts and the solutions pursued by the Agency to improve its assessment capabilities are detailed, together with the open issues and the current lines of work.","Tassa, Alessandra",tassa_europeanspaceagencyactivities_2022,TRUE,"Methods to estimate societal benefits - cost-benefit analysis, socioeconomic indicators; mentions case studies in agriculture, CC mitigation, disaster management, public health.",soc_ben_repo,on going european space agency activitie,2022
Open Data Policies And Satellite Earth Observation,"From the Heads of State of the G8 nations, the European Union, international organisations, through to national laws and policies, there is a strong momentum for full, free and open access to public sector digital data so that the benefits of public investment in such data can be maximised with as few barriers to use as possible. While open data for society at large is a relatively new phenomenon, the space sector has been accustomed to open data for all of its existence, especially in astronomy and navigation, but also in Earth observation. In the context of the open data debate, the purpose of this paper is to examine 21 policy and legal instruments concerning open data made by a range of organisations that in one way or another relate to Earth observation data and therefore contribute to the critical examination of the effectiveness of the open data movement. Based on these documents, the paper discusses common issues such as changing perspectives on the desirability of open data, commercial use, and licences and exceptions, and concludes that open access to Earth observation data requires more specification in order to clarify the conditions of access and so to realise fully the potential benefits.","Harris, Ray",harris_datapoliciessatelliteearth_2015,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,open data policies and satellite earth o,2015

This effort brought together people from the operational forecasting and satellite remote-sensing communities, academia, and the private sector. This diverse gathering of skill and experience yielded documentation of the impacts of these data in the operational short-term warning and forecasting environment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAAâ€™s) National Weather Service, improvement in the use of these data in the public and private sectors, and the transition of promising research results into the operational environment.

Position Paper: Evaluation Methods And Techniques,"This paper reviews methodologies in economics for valuing the benefits of geospatial data and services; including the value of open data. Section 2 explores the meaning of socioeconomic value and reviews the methodologies underpinning value assessment. It explains the theoretical background to economic welfare analysis, total turnover analysis and value added analysis. The use of different methods for economic impact assessment is then outlined. The methods include benefit cost analysis, multiplier analysis and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling1. This section also outlines the background to value chain analysis and real options analysis. Examples of the application of these techniques are discussed. They include the application of earth observation to agricultural and water resource management and the use of mapping to improve decision making in areas such as emergency management, managing endangered species, conducting property tax assessments and verifying insurance claims. These examples illustrate the potential for geospatial data to deliver value over a wide and growing range of applications. Section 3 addresses the issues that arise in applying these techniques. It points out that the methodology selected must address the questions being asked by policy makers and/or users of geospatial data. In the current defensive fiscal environment experienced by governments in many OECD countries, it is important that the valuation method links the use of geospatial data services to a clearly defined and quantifiable outcome. There needs to be a â€˜line of sightâ€™ between application of geospatial data services and the benefits that are identified. The paper suggests that evaluations should clearly outline such relationships and suggests a hierarchy of methods that can be applied in such circumstances. The methods include cost effectiveness analysis, benefit cost analysis and regional and economy wide economic modelling. Section 4 comments on the issues that arise draws some conclusions and raises some questions for discussion. It concludes that there is a need to: align methodology to the decision makerâ€™s needs; develop better evidence based economic assessments; adopt more structured approaches to addressing the rapid evolution in the use and application of geospatial data; develop greater capability in building better business cases; and reaching a consensus on internationally recognised methodologies. It also raises the possibility of greater international collaboration and research into building better business cases and establishing a community of experts to help advance the discipline of socioeconomic evaluation as applied to geospatial data and services.","Smart, Alan",smart_positionpaperevaluationmethods_2014,FALSE,"more like a primer on methods, with references to studies where those methods are used.

Potential Benefits Of Climate Forecasting To Agriculture,"Climate variability leads to economic and food security risks throughout the world because of its major influences on agriculture. Accurate forecasts of climate 3â€“6 months ahead of time can potentially allow farmers and others in agriculture to make decisions to reduce unwanted impacts or take advantage of expected favorable climate. However, potential benefits of climate forecasts vary considerably because of many physical, biological, economic, social, and political factors. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential economic value of climate forecasts for farm scale management decisions in one location in the Southeast USA (Tifton, GA; 31Â°23â€²N; 83Â°31â€²W) for comparison with previously-derived results for the Pampas region of Argentina. The same crops are grown in both regions but at different times of the year. First, the expected value of tailoring crop mix to El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases for a typical farm in Tifton was estimated using crop models and historical daily weather data. Secondly, the potential values for adjusting management of maize (Zea maize L.) to different types of climate forecasts (perfect knowledge of (a) ENSO phase, (b) growing season rainfall categories, and (c) daily weather) were estimated for Tifton and Pergamino, Argentina (33Â°55â€²S; 60Â°33â€²W). Predicted benefits to the farm of adjusting crop mix to ENSO phase averaged from US$ 3 to 6 haâˆ’1 over all years, depending on the farmerâ€™s initial wealth and aversion to risk. Values calculated for Argentina were US$ 9â€“15 for Pergamino and up to US$ 35 for other locations in the Pampas. Varying maize management by ENSO phase resulted in predicted forecast values of US$ 13 and 15 for Tifton and Pergamino, respectively. The potential value of perfect seasonal forecasts of rainfall tercile on maize profit was higher than for ENSO-based forecasts in both regions (by 28% in Tifton and 70% in Pergamino). Perfect knowledge of daily weather over the next season provided an upper limit on expected value of about US$ 190 haâˆ’1 for both regions. Considering the large areas of field crop production in these regions, the estimated economic potential is very high. However, there are a number of challenges to realize these benefits. These challenges are generally related to the uncertainty of climate forecasts and to the complexities of agricultural systems.","Jones, J.W.",jones_potentialbenefitsclimateforecasting_2000,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,potential benefits of climate forecastin,2000
Potential Benefits Of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems To Alaskan Commercial Fisheries,"In this article we attempt to illustrate the potential benefits to Alaskan commercial fisheries expected from enhancements to the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) through changes in fishery management strategies. In particular we show how the use of improvedAOOSdata in research, stockassessment, andultimately fisheriesmanagement has the potential to result in significant benefits in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish and Kodiak king crab fisheries. We show through a case study approach that information such as might be provided by an enhanced AOOS could conceivably contribute over $600 million in additional annual revenue in Alaskaâ€™s groundfish fishery. In addition we estimate that had the information from such a system been available in the 1970s and 1980s the Kodiak king crab stock collapse could have been avoided and $60 million in annual revenues generated. Benefit estimates (as measured by revenue increases) are based on the assumptions that when better data is delivered those data will be integrated into stock assessment models; when better data are integrated into the models the new data will actually improve the reliability of the models; and when the reliability of the models is improved predictions will be accepted by managers or industry members.","Wellman, Katharine",wellman_potentialbenefitscoastalocean_2008,TRUE,"VOI/Bayesian - how do fisheries management decisions benefit from access to an enhanced coastal ocean observing system, e.g., stock assessment models, reducing uncertainty in management decisions",soc_ben_repo,potential benefits of coastal ocean obse,2008
Potential Value Of Gcm-Based Seasonal Rainfall Forecasts For Maize Management In Semi-Arid Kenya,"We estimate the potential value of general circulation model (GCM)-based seasonal precipitation forecasts for maize planting and fertilizer management decisions at two semi-arid locations (Katumani and Makindu) in Southern Kenya. Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. Octoberâ€“February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions â€“ representing upper and lower bounds of predictability â€“ and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15â€“30% of the average gross value of production and 24â€“69% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. GCM predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24% at Katumani and 9% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the studyâ€™s assumptions, despite high probability (25% at Katumani, 34% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts.","Hansen, James",hansen_potentialgcmbasedseasonal_2009,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,potential value of gcm based seasonal ra,2009

Program Goals For The Nasa/Noaa Earth Observation Program Derived From A Stakeholder Value Network Analysis,"The 2007 US National Research Council Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space was the first consensus perspective produced by the US Earth Science community of the relative priorities among a sequence of 17 satellite missions over the course of the next decade. However, the Decadal Survey only captured the perspective of the science community, leading to questions about the inclusion of broader priorities from constituent communities and stakeholders. We present a stakeholder value network analysis for the NASA/NOAA Earth Observation Program. The analysis includes a rigorous articulation of the needs and objectives of 13 major stakeholders and a complete stakeholder value network with 190 individual â€œvalue flowsâ€ that capture the interactions between all the stakeholders. It produces a novel stakeholder map, graphically indicating the outputs most likely to create a lasting Earth Science program. The most important value loops and program outputs are used to derive a set of highlevel program goals that suggest what NASA and NOAA should do, as well as how they should conduct business. The analysis concludes that international partnerships represent a strong potential partner for certain science missions with greater potential value delivery than currently-prioritized efforts with defense stakeholders and concludes that weather and land-use missions, in addition to climate missions, should be given highest priority; water, human health, and solid Earth missions should be given lower priority based on each science categoryâ€™s potential for delivering value to the entire stakeholder network.","Sutherland, Timothy",sutherland_programgoalsnasanoaa_2012,FALSE,"Stakeholder value network analysis (questionnaires?

Quantifying The Cost Reduction Potential For Earth Observation Satellites,"In the present budget environment, there is a strong need to dramatically drive down the cost of space missions. There is the perception that SmallSats are inherently much lower cost than more traditional larger satellites and can play a central role in reducing overall space mission cost, but this effect has been difficult to quantify. Without quantifiable evidence of their value, SmallSats are under-utilized as a method for reducing space mission cost. The purpose of this study is to quantify the relationship between cost and performance for space systems, by creating a Performance-Based Cost Model (PBCM). Today, most acquisition performance analyses focus on cost overruns, or how much the system costs relative to what it is expected to cost. Instead, PBCM allows us to focus on more important questions, such as, how much performance we can achieve for a given cost, or what the cost is for a given level of performance. In this paper, we present the relationship between cost vs. orbit altitude for a fixed resolution and coverage requirement, cost vs. resolution, and cost vs. coverage. Traditional cost models for space systems are typically weight-based, primarily because mass allocation is determined early in mission design and has historically correlated well with actual hardware cost. To provide the underlying cost data for this study, we apply 3 cost models widely used throughout the aerospace cost modeling community: the Unmanned Space Vehicle Cost Model (USCM), the Aerospace Corp. Small Satellite Cost Model (SSCM), and the NASA Instrument Cost Model (NICM). Our first application of the PBCM is for Earth observation systems. Past Earth observation systems have used traditional space technology to achieve the best possible performance, but have been very expensive. In addition, low-cost, responsive dedicated launch has not been available for SmallSats. Space system mass is proportional to the cube of the linear dimensionsâ€”equivalent to saying that most spacecraft have about the same density. This means that by flying at lower altitudes, satellites can reduce their payload size and therefore the entire mass of the satellite, thus reducing the cost of the system dramatically. We conclude that for an Earth observation system, an increase in performance, reduction in cost, or both, is possible by using multiple SmallSats at lower altitudes when compared to traditional systems. Specifically,\nBy using modern microelectronics and light-weight materials such as composite structures, future SmallSats\nobservation systems, operating at a lower altitude than traditional systems, have the potential for:\nâ€“ Comparable or better performance (resolution and coverage)\nâ€“ Much lower overall mission cost (by a factor of 2 to 10)\nâ€“ Lower risk (both implementation and operations)\nâ€“ Shorter schedules\nRelevant secondary advantages for the low-altitude SmallSats include:\nâ€“ Lower up-front development cost\nâ€“ More sustainable business model\nâ€“ More flexible and resilient\nâ€“ More responsive to both new technologies and changing needs\nâ€“ Mitigates the problem of orbital debris\nThe principal demerits of the approach are the lack of low-cost launch vehicles, the need for a new way of doing business, and changing the way we think about the use of space assets. This paper provides the basis for this assessment, estimates for the level of cost reduction, and reports on additional results since the 2013 Reinventing Space Conference and AIAA Space 2014 Conference.","Shao, Anthony",shao_quantifyingcostreductionpotential_2014,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,quantifying the cost reduction potential,2014
Quantifying The Human Health Benefits Of Using Satellite Information To Detect Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms And Manage Recreational Advisories In U.s. Lakes,"Significant recent advances in satellite remote sensing allow environmental managers to detect and monitor cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB), and these capabilities are being used more frequently in water quality management. A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately $370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly ($55,000â€“$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.","Stroming, Signe",stroming_quantifyinghumanhealthbenefits_2020,TRUE,Satellite data used to improve forecasts of HABs,soc_ben_repo,quantifying the human health benefits of,2020
"Realizing The Potential Benefits Of Climate Prediction To Agriculture: Issues, Approaches, Challenges","Advances in our ability to predict climate fluctuations months in advance suggest opportunity to improve management of climatic risk in agriculture, but only if particular conditions are in place. This paper outlines prerequisites to beneficial forecast use; highlights key issues, approaches and challenges related to each; and suggests an evolutionary strategy. The first prerequisite is that forecast information must address a need that is both real and perceived. Second, benefit arises only through viable decision options that are sensitive to forecast information. Third, benefit depends on prediction of the components of climate variability that are relevant to viable decisions. Fourth, appropriate forecast use requires effective communication of relevant information. Finally, sustained use requires institutional commitment and favorable policies. It is useful to consider three phases of effort: an exploratory phase to gain understanding and assess potential, a pilot phase characterized by co-learning between researchers and target decision makers, and an operational phase focusing on engaging and equipping relevant institutions. Although examples of use and potential use, and advances in institutional support, are cause for optimism, use of climate prediction by agriculture is still too new to support strong generalizations about its value.","Hansen, James",hansen_realizingpotentialbenefitsclimate_2002,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,realizing the potential benefits of clim,2002

Reimagining The Potential Of Earth Observations For Ecosystem Service Assessments,"The benefits nature provides to people, called ecosystem services, are increasingly recognized and accounted for in assessments of infrastructure development, agricultural management, conservation prioritization, and sustainable sourcing. These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide.","Ramirez-Reyes, Carlos",ramirezreyes_reimaginingpotentialearthobservations_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,reimagining the potential of earth obser,2019
Remote Sensing In Environmental Justice Research-A Review,"Human health is known to be affected by the physical environment. Various environmental influences have been identified to benefit or challenge peopleâ€™s physical condition. Their heterogeneous distribution in space results in unequal burdens depending on the place of living. In addition, since societal groups tend to also show patterns of segregation, this leads to unequal exposures depending on social status. In this context, environmental justice research examines how certain social groups are more affected by such exposures. Yet, analyses of this per se spatial phenomenon are oftentimes criticized for using â€œessentially aspatialâ€ data or methods which neglect local spatial patterns by aggregating environmental conditions over large areas. Recent technological and methodological developments in satellite remote sensing have proven to provide highly detailed information on environmental conditions. This narrative review therefore discusses known influences of the urban environment on human health and presents spatial data and applications for analyzing these influences. Furthermore, it is discussed how geographic data are used in general and in the interdisciplinary research field of environmental justice in particular. These considerations include the modifiable areal unit problem and ecological fallacy. In this review we argue that modern earth observation data can represent an important data source for research on environmental justice and health. Especially due to their high level of spatial detail and the provided large-area coverage, they allow for spatially continuous description of environmental characteristics. As a future perspective, ongoing earth observation missions, as well as processing architectures, ensure data availability and applicability of â€™big earth dataâ€™ for future environmental justice analyses.","Weigland, Matthias",weigland_remotesensingenvironmentaljustice_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,remote sensing in environmental justice ,2019
Remote Sensing For Biodiversity Monitoring: A Review Of Methods For Biodiversity Indicator Extraction And Assessment Of Progress Towards International Targets,"Recognizing the imperative need for biodiversity protection, the convention on biological diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets. Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions during the last years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified. For each headline indicator a number of recent remote sensing approaches able for the extraction of related properties are reviewed. Methods cover a wide range of fields, including: habitat extent and condition monitoring; species distribution; pressures from unsustainable management, pollution and climate change; ecosystem service monitoring; and conservation status assessment of protected areas. The advantages and limitations of different remote sensing data and algorithms are discussed. Sorting of the methods based on their reported accuracies is attempted, when possible. The extensive literature survey aims at reviewing highly performing methods that can be used for large-area, effective, and timely biodiversity assessment, to encourage the more systematic use of remote sensing solutions in monitoring progress towards the Aichi targets, and to decrease the gaps between the remote sensing and management communities.","Petrou, Zisis",petrou_remotesensingbiodiversitymonitoring_2015,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,remote sensing for biodiversity monitori,2015
Reviewing Innovative Earth Observation Solutions For Filling Science-Policy Gaps In Hydrology,"Improved data sharing is needed for hydrological modeling and water management that require better integration of data, information and models. Technological advances in Earth observation and Web technologies have allowed the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) for improved data sharing at various scales. International initiatives catalyze data sharing by promoting interoperability standards to maximize the use of data and by supporting easy access to and utilization of geospatial data. A series of recent European projects are contributing to the promotion of innovative Earth observation solutions and the uptake of scientific outcomes in policy. Several success stories involving different hydrologistsâ€™ communities can be reported around the World. Gaps still exist in hydrological, agricultural, meteorological and climatological data access because of various issues. While many sources of data exists at all scales it remains difficult and time-consuming to assemble hydrological information for most projects. Furthermore, data and sharing formats remain very heterogeneous. Improvements require implementing/endorsing some commonly agreed standards and documenting data with adequate metadata. The brokering approach allows binding heterogeneous resources published by different data providers and adapting them to tools and interfaces commonly used by consumers of these resources. The challenge is to provide decision-makers with reliable information, based on integrated data and tools derived from both Earth observations and scientific models. Successful SDIs rely therefore on various aspects: a shared vision between all participants, necessity to solve a common problem, adequate data policies, incentives, and sufficient resources. New data streams from remote sensing or crowd sourcing are also producing valuable information to improve our understanding of the water cycle, while field sensors are developing rapidly and becoming less costly. More recent data standards are enhancing interoperability between hydrology and other scientific disciplines, while solutions exist to communicate uncertainty of data and models, which is an essential pre-requisite for decision-making. Distributed computing infrastructures can handle complex and large hydrological data and models, while Web Processing Services bring the flexibility to develop and execute simple to complex workflows over the Internet. The need for capacity building at human, infrastructure and institutional levels is also a major driver for reinforcing the commitment to SDI concepts.","Lehmann, Anthony",lehmann_reviewinginnovativeearthobservation_2014,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,reviewing innovative earth observation s,2014

Satellite Image Analysis For Disaster And Crisis-Management Support,"This paper describes how multisource satellite data and efficient image analysis may successfully be used to conduct rapid-mapping tasks in the domain of disaster and crisis management support. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has set up a dedicated crosscutting service, which is the so-called ""Center for satellite-based Crisis Information"" (ZKI), to facilitate the use of its Earth-observation capacities in the service of national and international response to major disaster situations, humanitarian relief efforts, and civil security issues. This paper describes successful rapid satellite mapping campaigns supporting disaster relief and demonstrates how this technology can be used for civilian crisis-management purposes. During the last years, various international coordination bodies were established, improving the disaster-response-related cooperation within the Earth-observation community worldwide. DLR/ZKI operates in this context, closely networking with public authorities (civil security), nongovernmental organizations (humanitarian relief organizations), satellite operators, and other space agencies. This paper reflects on several of these international activities, such as the International Charter Space and Major Disasters, describes mapping procedures, and reports on rapid-mapping experiences gained during various disaster-response applications.

As a result, the private sector has become active in providing Satellite Earth Observation services for many ecological problems.\nA number of private companies have made their mark in the Nigerian S.E.O market. In the past, most private earth observation service companies were subsidiaries of foreign companies offering services in the construction and crude oil sectors. As the importance of remote sensing and GIS technologies became better known, the number of companies and organizations offering GIS services increased with the indigenous people also setting up smaller outfits.

Satellite Observations Of No2 Indicate Legacy Impacts Of Redlining In U.s. Midwestern Cities,"Redlining was a practice of financial discrimination in the mid-20th century in which banks refused loans or increased interest rates based on the grade of an applicantâ€™s neighborhood as designated by the federally sponsored Home Ownerâ€™s Lending Commission (HOLC). The HOLC primarily graded neighborhoods from â€œAâ€ (best) to â€œDâ€ (hazardous) based on characteristics including the racial demographics and economic status of the residents, with neighborhoods with higher percentages of non-white and/or recent immigrant residents given lower grades; this and similar discriminatory practices can be traced to modern-day economic and environmental inequalities between neighborhoods. The legacy of redlining and related housing discrimination on modern-day urban air quality, which presents a significant threat to public health, remains an important issue in addressing environmental injustice in U.S. cities. In our study, we used remotely sensed estimates of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) collected with the TROPOMI satellite sensor, and shapefiles of redlined neighborhoods, to determine whether air quality varies among historic HOLC grades in 11 U.S. Midwestern metropolitan areas. This approach allowed us to test these tools for within-city analysis of NO2 for which high spatial and temporal resolution measurements are not often available, despite their importance for monitoring impacts on human health. We found that NO2 levels were as much as 16% higher in neighborhoods that were graded â€œDâ€ compared to those graded â€œAâ€ (as in Chicago), with the mean difference across all cities an increase of 7.3% Â± 5.9%. These results present evidence of persistent modern-day inequality in urban air quality associated with historic discriminatory policies and should be used as an argument for government action improving air quality in neighborhoods that were poorly graded by the HOLC.","Hrycyna, Elizabeth",hrycyna_satelliteobservationsno2legacy_2022,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,satellite observations of no2 indicate l,2022

Simulating The Value Of El Nino Forecasts For The Panama Canal,"The Panama Canal relies on rain-fed streamflow into Gatun Lake, the canalâ€™s primary storage facility, for operationsâ€”principally ship passage and hydropower generation. Precipitation in much of Panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and this relationship is reflected in Gatun Lake inflows. For example, the correlation coefficient between wet season (Julyâ€“December) inflow and NINO3 SST is -0.53 over the period 1914â€“1997. Operational capabilities to predict\ntropical Pacific SSTs have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such SST forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inflows (compared with climatological expectations). Because substantial reductions in lake inflow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inflows, coupled with a method for translating that information into effective operational policy, might result in more efficient canal management. A combined simulation/optimization/assessment â€˜â€˜virtualâ€™â€™ canal system was implemented and exercised using operational El Nino forecasts over the period 1981â€“1998. The results show the following main points:\n(i) At current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to flow forecasts) unless flows are substantially reduced (i.e., during El Nino episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate.\n(ii) The inclusion of accurately specified levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneficial policies.\n(iii) The situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inflows are relatively high, and those where storage and inflows are relatively low. In the former case, demands can be met without the benefit of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments.\n(iv) For a nominally configured canal system, the use of operational El Nino forecasts with appropriately specified uncertainty resulted in approximately $US 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic climatological forecasts.","Graham, Nicholas",graham_simulatingelninoforecasts_2006,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,simulating the value of el nino forecast,2006
Societal And Economic Research And Applications For Weather Forecasts,"Despite the meteorological community's long-term interest in weather-society interactions, efforts to understand socioeconomic aspects of weather prediction and to incorporate this knowledge into the weather prediction system have yet to reach critical mass. This article aims to reinvigorate interest in societal and economic research and applications (SERA) activities within the meteorological and social science communities by exploring key SERA issues and proposing SERA priorities for the next decade.\n\nThe priorities were developed by the authors, building on previous work, with input from a diverse group of social scientists and meteorologists who participated in a SERA workshop in August 2006.

Socio-Economic Benefits From The Use Of Earth Observation,"The aim of this document is to report on the workshop on â€œSocio-economic Benefits of Earth Observationsâ€ hold at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Ispra, on 11-13th July 2011. This workshop has been conducted as part of GEO Task US-09-02a: â€œSocio-Economic Benefits of GEO and GEOSSâ€, led by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the International Institute for Advanced Spatial Applications (IIASA), and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC). It was organized by these three organizations, and by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Twenty-five experts from America, Europe and Australia have gathered in Ispra to present their experience in the field of the evaluation of the benefits from Earth Observations obtained by in-situ, remote and the new citizenâ€™s sensors. The discussion was based on the outcomes of two previous workshops held in 2010 on the same issue, in US and in Europe. The background section presents the rationale behind the need of understanding the benefits Earth Observations, supported by several initiatives at the continental (e.g. INSPIRE Directive in Europe) and at the global (e.g. GEOSS) level. The aim of the workshop, described in the second section of this document, was to support the development of international capabilities to determine, quantify and document the socioeconomic benefits from EO and their use, and to jointly develop a programme of activities to be followed in the next few years by the research group. The foreseen activities of the programme were the consolidation of the body of literature in the field, the collection and analysis of suitable methodologies to assess Earth Observationsâ€™ benefits, and of evidence of benefits from existing case studies, the development of appropriate outreach initiatives, the strengthening of the existing community of researchers and the link with other communities of scientists, to set up multidisciplinary studies. To this aim, each participant brought his/her own experience in the analysing and assessing the impacts of Earth Observation in their own field of research, generating an interesting list of multifaceted examples and case studies in which the same problem is analysed from different perspectives. Section 3 contains a summary of each presentation, which gave the elements for the subsequent discussion among experts, leading to the preliminary programme of activities. Among the several subject of discussions there were the value to be ascribed to Earth Observation data, the need of complementing ex-ante impact assessments with monitoring and ex-post evaluations, the need of clearly communicating the benefits to policy makers in order to fund research and as well to provide a service to the society. These discussion topics are summarised in section 4, describing also the view of the experts as regard possible activities for the creation of a body of knowledge about the field, for the definition of a methodology for the estimation of Earth Observationsâ€™ benefits, the criteria for selecting suitable case studies to show such benefits and proposal for outreach and dissemination activities. As final recommendations from the workshop, priority should be given to: \nâ€¢ the development of an accepted scientific paradigm and of a General Economic Framework to measure EO costs and benefits; \nâ€¢ the establishment of a community of practice bringing together demand and supply; \nâ€¢ the support to increase the number of researchers active in this field research group; \nâ€¢ the showcase of concrete projects clearly communicating the benefits achieved. \nMoreover, concrete suggestions were given aimed at developing research activities to establish a consolidated state of the art, mainly consisting in meta-analysis of existing studies and production of high-impact articles or special issues in well-recognised scientific journals.","Borzacchiello, Maria-Teresa",borzacchiello_socioeconomicbenefitsearth_2011,FALSE,Report from a workshop; looks like lots of good ideas in here,soc_ben_repo,socio economic benefits from the use of ,2011

Spatio-Temporal Design For A Water Quality Monitoring Network Maximizing The Economic Value Of Information To Optimize The Detection Of Accidental Pollution,"The reduction of damage due to water pollution requires good knowledge of the quality of surfacewaters. The Water Quality Monitoring Networks (WQMNs) have evolved over time according to the objectives of each one of them: knowledge of long-term quality evolution, search for the origin of pollution, detection of accidental pollution, etc. Information provided by WQMNs could be improved by a spatial approach, optimizing the location or the number of monitoring stations, or by a temporal approach, optimizing the sampling frequency. However, there is a cost for monitoring water quality.\nIn this article, we show, for the first time, how the estimation of the Economic Value of Information (EVOI) can be used to determine the spatio-temporal design of the network. With the example of a network that aims to detect accidental pollution, we show how to calculate the EVOI according to the spatial and temporal network design (number and location of stations, temporal accuracy of measurement) and how to define this design by maximizing the EVOI. This will allow us to answer questions such as: Are the expenses invested in the networks justified? With an additional budget, is it better to add a station or to increase the temporal accuracy of the measurement of existing stations? What is the optimal spatial and temporal design of the network when working with a fixed budget?","Destandau, Francois",destandau_spatiotemporaldesignwater_2020,TRUE,not satellite,soc_ben_repo,spatio temporal design for a water quali,2020

"Supporting Better Decisions Across The Nexus Of Water, Energy And Food Through Earth Observation Data: Case Of The Zambezi Basin","The waterâ€“energyâ€“food (WEF) nexus has been promoted in recent years as an intersectional concept designed to improve planning and regulatory decision-making across the three sectors. The production and consumption of water, energy and food resources are inextricably linked across multiple spatial scales (from the global to the local), but a common feature is competition for land which through different land management practices mediates provisioning ecosystem services. The nexus perspective seeks to understand the interlinkages and use systems-based thinking to frame management options for the present and the future. It aims to highlight advantage and minimise damaging and unsustainable outcomes through informed decisions regarding trade-offs inclusive of economic, ecological and equity considerations. Operationalizing the WEF approach is difficult because of the lack of complete data, knowledge and observability â€“ and the nature of the challenge also depends on the scale of the investigation. Transboundary river basins are particularly challenging because whilst the basin unit defines the hydrological system this is not necessarily coincident with flows of food and energy. There are multiple national jurisdictions and geopolitical relations to consider. Land use changes have a profound influence on hydrological, agricultural, energy provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Future policy decisions in the water, energy and food sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land and water resources, intensifying competition for these resources in the future. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyse the land cover changes in the Zambezi river basin (1.4 million km2) from 1992 to 2015 using the European Space Agency annual global land cover dataset. Early results indicate transformative processes are underway with significant shifts from tree cover to cropland, with a 4.6 % loss in tree cover and a 16 % gain in cropland during the study period. The changes were found to be occurring mainly in the eastern (Malawi and Mozambique) and southern (Zimbabwe and southern Zambia) parts of the basin. The area under urban land uses was found to have more than doubled during the study period gearing urban centres increasingly as the foci for resource consumption. These preliminary findings are the first step in understanding the spatial and temporal interlinkages of water, energy and food by providing reliable and consistent evidence spanning the local, regional, national and whole transboundary basin scale.","Gomo, Fortune",gomo_supportingdecisionsnexuswater_2018,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,supporting better decisions across the n,2018
The Value Of Short-Run Climate Forecasts In Managing The Coastal Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus Kisutch) Fishery In Washington State,"In recent years our understanding of the intricate connections between climate variability, marine and freshwater environmental conditions and the responses of fish stocks has improved considerably. With predictable relationships between the environment and stock abundance, fishery managers should be able to forecast variation in stock survival and recruitment. Such forecasts present an opportunity for increasing the economic value of fisheries and for achieving other management objectives, such as stock conservation and maintenance of population diversity. After describing a 4-step framework for addressing the question â€˜What is a forecast worth?â€™ in a fishery decision-making context, we introduce the management system for Washington's coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fishery. Then we apply the 4-step framework to estimate the value of improved run size forecasts in the annual harvest management of coho salmon in Washington State. Our principal analytical tool is a stochastic simulation model that incorporates the main characteristics of the fishery. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and constraints to the use of climate-based forecasts in fishery management on various spatial and temporal scales, and we consider the challenges associated with forecasting variations in fish stock size caused by shifts in climate and related ocean conditions.","Kaje, Janne",kaje_shortrunclimateforecasts_2008,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,the value of short run climate forecasts,2008
Ten Rules To Increase The Societal Value Of Earth Observations,"Earth Observation (EO) data play an important role in our society today, but there is still tremendous opportunity to improve how these data are used to affect change. In this paper, we provide guidance to help data providers and intermediaries within the EO value chain (from data to applications) increase the societal value ofthe EO data, information, and data products that they work with. We first describe the EO value chain as a conceptual framework for how data are translated and applied for societal benefit. We then introduce three approaches that are often used to assess and improve the EO value chain. Finally, we present ""10 rules"" that can be implemented to increase the societal benefits of Earth science information. The 10 rules emphasize meeting user needs, problem-solving within interdisciplinary teams, and long-term sustainable solutions. Some rules focus on a specific segment of the value chain or phase in the problem-solving process, while others are relevant to the value chain or process as a whole. Each rule includes at least one case study example to illustrate the key points. The rules are loosely organized according to project management principles with the initial rules focusing on defining problems, planning for data use, creating effective teams, and examining a diverse selection ofsolutions. The next set ofrules are best applied throughout a project, and include such concepts as evaluation, interoperability, trust, adoption, and documentation. Finally, the last rule addresses the challenge of determining when to close a project.","Virapongse, Arika",virapongse_tenrulesincreasesocietal_2020,FALSE,"Provides a framework for *increasing* societal benefit, but not specifically for *measuring* societal benefit of EO data",soc_ben_repo,ten rules to increase the societal value,2020

The Ecors System: A Mobility Decision-Making Tool Based On Earth Observation Data,"This study describes the decision-making system ECORS, dedicated to soils and roads characterization for mobility purposes in operational contexts. This project was initiated by the DGA (DÃ©lÃ©gation GÃ©nÃ©rale Ã  lâ€™Armement, France) and left to a consortiumâ€™s care for the technical realization. This consortium integrates different laboratories, research centers and private companies, specialized in such problematic. The objectives of such study are first to analyze and evaluate current operational technologies able to characterize roads, tracks, and cross-country for mobility either in France or in international contexts. The main data sources authorized are those coming from remote sensors, including remote-sensing data, existing databases, i.e., Topobase Defense, Corinne Landcover, NOAA, etc or opensource data. These data are stored into a GIS oriented tool used for calculating the capacities for vehicles to run on a specific operational theatre. This last operation involves different techniques of data fusion or transformation for estimating the vehicles speed. For this purpose, vehicles performances tables, depending on the theatre features, are established for several climatic scenarios. We describe here the ECORS system, including the selected data sources used in the different processing steps, the technical specifications related to the system architecture and the validation protocols where different decision-making maps are compared to validation data observed on the field.","Grandjean, Gilles",grandjean_ecorssystemmobilitydecision_2009,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,the ecors system a mobility decision mak,2009

The Economic Value Of Seasonal Forecasts: Stochastic Economywide Analysis For East Africa,"There is growing interest within the climate change and development community in using seasonal forecast information to reduce the losses to agriculture resulting from climate variability, especially within food-insecure countries. However, forecast systems are expensive to establish and maintain, and therefore, gauging the potential economic return to investments in forecast systems is crucial. Most studies that evaluate seasonal forecasts focus on developed countries and/or overlook agricultureâ€™s economywide linkages. Yet forecasts may be more valuable in developing regions such as East Africa, where climate is variable and agriculture has macroeconomic importance. We use computable general equilibrium and process-based crop models to estimate the potential economywide value of national seasonal forecast systems in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. Stochastic seasonal simulations produce value distributions for forecasts of varying accuracy and varying levels of farm coverage. A timely and accurate forecast adopted by all farmers generates average regional income gains of US$113 million per year. Gains are much higher during extreme climate events and are generally pro-poor. The forecast value falls when forecast skill and farm coverage decline. National economic and trading structures, including the importance of agricultural exports, are found to be major determinants of forecast value. Economywide approaches are therefore needed to complement farm-level analysis when evaluating forecast systems in low-income agrarian economies.","Rodrigues, Joao",rodrigues_economicseasonalforecastsstochastic_2016,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,the economic value of seasonal forecasts,2016

The Global Earth Observation System Of Systems (Geoss): Supporting The Needs Of Decision Making In Societal Benefit Areas,"Earth observations can help reduce the loss of life and property from natural and human induced disasters through increasing our understanding of complex environmental systems. In this context, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is being built through the coordination of efforts within the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO), comprised of 80 Member States, the European Commission and 58 Participating Organizations, established in February 2005. The 10-Year Implementation Plan defines a vision statement for GEOSS, its purpose and scope, expected benefits for nine â€œSocietal Benefit Areasâ€ (SBAs) (disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity), technical and capacity building priorities, and the GEO governance structure. The full value of GEOSS lies in its ability to integrate information across disciplines. Thus, GEOSS is concerned with: interlinking weather forecasting systems with other Earth observation systems; supporting efforts to advance sustainable energy; and devising end-to-end information services and sustained observing systems essential for addressing climate variability and change. The international collaborative framework of GEO allows: water experts to define the data and systems needed for improved water-cycle forecasting; international teams to monitor ecosystems and generate maps and other decision support tools; development of an Agricultural Monitoring System of Systems that will integrate in-situ and space data from multiple fields; and comprehensive monitoring critical to the conservation and sustainable use of the worldâ€™s biological diversity. In particular, in the field of water, unique regional cooperative approaches are now on-going and under planning for making maximum use of, and contributing to, GEOSS. The current GEO Work Plan furnishes the blueprint for activities to implement GEOSS, and provides concrete examples of how decision makers can use the data and services available through GEOSS to address major global opportunities and challenges. This is why GEO strives to develop a GEOSS that would serve the needs of all SBAs through interconnecting existing and future Earth observation systems, interlinking observation systems, and promotion of open data sharing.","Koike, Toshio",koike_globalearthobservationsystem_2010,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,the global earth observation system of s,2010

The Role Of Geoscience Information In Reducing Catastrophic Loss Using A Web-Based Economics Experiment,"What role can geoscience information play in the assessment of risk and the value of insurance, especially for natural hazard type risks? In an earlier, related paper Ganderton and others (2000) provided subjects with relatively simple geoscience information concerning natural hazard-type risks. Their research looked at how subjects purchase insurance when faced with relatively low probability but high loss risks of the kind that characterize natural hazards and now, increasingly, manmade disasters. They found evidence to support the expected utility theory (definitions of economics terms can be found in a glossary at the end of report), yet there remained the implication that subjects with excessive aversion to risk were willing to pay considerably more for insurance than the actuarially fair price plus any reasonable risk premium. Here, we report the results of additional experiments that provide further support for the basic postulates of expected utility theory. However, these new experiments add considerably to the decision environment facing subjects by offering an option to purchase geoscientific information that would assist them when calculating expected losses from hazards more accurately.\n\nUsing an Internet-based mechanism to present information and gather data in an experimental setting, this research provided subjects with considerable textual and graphical information, and time to process it. Over a period of three months, almost 400 subjects participated in on-line experiments that generated approximately 22,000 usable data points for the empirical analysis discussed in this report.\n\nIn the design of the experiment, we modeled the decisions to purchase (1) a detailed map giving subjects more information regarding the distribution of losses from a hazard and (2) insurance to indemnify them from any losses should they occur. On the basis of this design, we find strong evidence in support of the expected utility theory. Many of the findings reinforce those found in the early, similar study (Ganderton and others, 2000). However, this research also finds interactions between the decision to become better informed and the decision to insure. We chose an empirical framework that allows for both explicit and implicit (unobservable) correlations between the two decisions. The results suggest that at the end of the computer game subjects recognize the benefits of greater geoscience information. They take advantage of it, but are sensitive to its cost. When subjects use the more detailed information, they are more likely to purchase insurance when it offers a net benefit.","Bernkopf, Richard",bernkopf_rolegeoscienceinformationreducing_2003,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,the role of geoscience information in re,2003
The Value Of Earth Observation For Managing The Great Barrier Reef,"Effective decision-making requires information, but how much information is enough and how much money should be invested in additional information is often unclear. This paper attempts to assess the economic benefits of informational investments, specifically of investments in Earth Observation (EO) for managing the Great Barrier Reef. We develop an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the expected contribution of informational investments to decision-making. We hypothesize that EO can improve decision-making by allowing for better-targeted emission reduction measures in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. For assessing the benefits (cost savings) of improved targeting we develop a model to optimize emission reductions under different states: emissions from all catchments may affect reef quality, or emissions from certain catchments may affect reef quality more. The states reflect the current uncertainties relating to water quality management in the region. The analysis suggests that the expected benefits of EO information for managing the GBR can be substantial, and depend on the perceived accuracy of EO information and on decision-makers prior beliefs.","Bouma, Jetske A.",bouma_earthobservationmanagingbarrier_2009,TRUE,"VOI/Bayesian decision theory, elicited decision maker perceptions of value - marine conservation, Great barrier Reef",soc_ben_repo,the value of earth observation for manag,2009
The Value Of El Nino Forecasts In The Management Of Salmon: A Stochastic Dynamic Assessment,"The El NiÃ±oâ€Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest source of interannual variability in global climate. Variability in climate has been linked to variability in fisheries, specifically salmon stocks of the Pacific Northwest. The ability to forecast El NiÃ±o events already exists and is likely to improve in coming years. An accurate prediction may have value because it allows for better management decisions. In this article, we develop a bioeconomic model of the coho salmon fishery and derive the value of information from improved El NiÃ±o forecasting ability. We find that a perfect El NiÃ±o forecast results in an annual welfare gain of approximately $1 million, while imperfect forecasts lead to smaller gains. Results also suggest that optimal management in the face of uncertainty involves a â€œconservativeâ€ management strategy, resulting in lower harvest, higher wild fish escapement, and lower hatchery releases than management in the absence of such uncertainty.","Costello, Christopher",costello_elninoforecastsmanagement_2020,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,the value of el nino forecasts in the ma,2020

The Value Of Near Real-Time Earth Observations For Improved Flood Disaster Response,"Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions â€œon the groundâ€ more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASAâ€™s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) fromapplying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.","Oddo, Perry",oddo_realtimeearthobservations_2019,TRUE,VOI/Bayesian decision theory - for emergency response vehicle routing.,soc_ben_repo,the value of near real time earth observ,2019
The Value Of Ocean Surface Wind Information For Maritime Commerce,"Observations, nowcasts, and forecasts of ocean surface wind conditions are of economic value to activities such as maritime transportation, commercial fishing, offshore energy, recreational boating, and search and rescue. In this paper, we estimate the value to the maritime shipping industry of ocean surface wind information and of wind and wave condition forecasts based on this information. Commercial ships transiting the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans are exposed to severe wind and wave conditions associated with extratropical storms. These storms impose costs on maritime commerce by delaying and sometimes damaging vessels or causing loss of cargo. Ocean surface wind information allows ships to limit their exposure to these conditions. We estimate that average expected annual losses to container shipping (lost containers and associated damage to vessels) in the absence of good information about extratropical storm conditions would be on the order of $250 million/year in the North Pacific and $120 million/year in the North Atlantic, and we estimate average expected annual losses to bulk shipping operations from extratropical storm exposure in these regions to be on the order of $150 million/year. A significant fraction of this risk can be avoided with ocean surface vector wind observations and forecasts. Our model results suggest that the QuikSCAT information (available until November 2009) and associated forecasts enabled a reduction in annual exposure for shipping traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific of about 50%, with total annual net savings around $150 million. The estimate of annual benefits to shipping operations from a hypothetical improved satellite instrument is around $200 million.","Kite-Powell, Hauke",kitepowell_oceansurfacewindinformation_2011,TRUE,Hypothetical satellite,soc_ben_repo,the value of ocean surface wind informat,2011

This study presents a stylized model of competitive production with rational expectations and demonstrates that improved weather information harms farmers facing an inelastic demand. Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies, the decline in farmer welfare does not require an expansion in expected supply. Better weather information may signal farmers to produce less on average under an inelastic demand.

The Benefits And Challenges Of Having An Open And Free Basis Satellite Data Sharing Platform In Turkey: Gezgin,"Turkey is a county that experiences rapid socioeconomic development, which, in turn, leads to high urbanization rates due to migration of people from rural to urban areas, many large-scale development projects (e.g. highways, dams, housing and infrastructure), and environmental problems that adversely affect agriculture, such as soil erosion and deforestation. Furthermore, Turkey lies in a region prone to natural disasters, especially earthquakes, landslides, flooding and forest fires. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires continuous monitoring to enable rapid response as well as the development of effective socioeconomic policies. In this regard, space-based earth observation (EO) systems play a critical role in the rapid acquisiton and extraction of crucial information. The first launch of the first Turkish-designed satellite, RASAT, in 2011 led to the wide-spread exploitation of space-based resources by Turkish institutions through the dissemination of EO data on an open and free basis via the GEZGIN internet portal (http://www.gezgin.gov.tr).

The Benefits To Mexican Agriculture Of An El Nino-Southern Oscillation (Enso) Early Warning System,"Weather agencies worldwide are attempting to determine if systematic disturbances in climate, such as the El NiÃ±o-southern oscillation (ENSO), can be detected far enough in advance so that decisions can be altered to better accommodate these disturbances. Mexico is one country where ENSO related climatic disturbances have been observed. If climate forecasters were able to disseminate information on upcoming ENSO-induced weather patterns with sufficient lead time, Mexican farmers could adjust by altering a variety of crop decisions, such as growing less (or more) water consumptive crops, planting drought resistant varieties, or altering planting times. This could have a positive impact on crop production, enhancing food security, farmersâ€™ incomes, and social welfare. The purpose of this paper is to value such forecasts in a Mexican agricultural setting. \n\nTo assess the economic consequences of climate arising from various ENSO phases, estimates of regional crop yield sensitivity for key crops were modeled using a crop biophysical simulator. The value of a forecast is then measured by the expected increase in economic benefits due to changes in cropping patterns, production and consumption arising from the yield changes under each ENSO phase forecast. These economic estimates are derived from an economic model of Mexican agriculture. The value of the ENSO information will depend on its accuracy in terms of predictions of the weather consequences of each phase.\n\nThe economic model is a stochastic, price endogenous, mathematical programming model that represents agronomic and economic conditions in a five-state Mexican region. This model depicts agricultural behavior across the three ENSO phases and provides the basis for calculating the value of information. The benefits of an ENSO early warning system for Mexico is approximately US$ 10 million annually, based on a 51-year time period of ENSO frequencies and when a forecast skill of 70% is assumed. This value translates into an internal rate of return for such an early warning system of approximately 30%. The values for higher skill levels are correspondingly higher. The values estimated here should be viewed as lower bound estimates of the value of an ENSO early warning system because benefits are not estimated for other parts of Mexican agriculture, such as non commercial (subsistence) agricultural areas, areas where there is only a weak ENSO signal that is not very predictable, and the livestock sector. Also, benefits here do not include benefits that could occur with adjustments in energy generation, water management, or any other economic sectors that may be positively affected by the existence of an ENSO early warning system.\n","Adams, Richard",adams_benefitsmexicanagricultureel_2002,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,the benefits to mexican agriculture of a,2002

The Economic Value Of Drought Information For Water Management Under Climate Change: A Case Study In The Ebro Basin,"Drought events in the Mediterranean are likely to increase in frequency, duration and intensity due to climate change, thereby affecting crop production. Information about drought is valuable for river basin authorities and the farmers affected by their decisions. The economic value of this information and the resulting decisions are of interest to these two stakeholder groups and to the information providers. Understanding the dynamics of extreme events, including droughts, in future climate scenarios for the Mediterranean is being improved continuously. This paper analyses the economic value of information on drought events taking into account the risk aversion of water managers. We consider the effects of drought management plans on rice production in the Ebro river basin. This enables us to compute the willingness to compensate the river basin authority for more accurate information allowing for better decision-making. If runoff is reduced, river basin planners can consider the reduction of water allocation for irrigation in order to eliminate the risk of water scarcity. Alternately, river basin planners may decide to maintain water allocation and accept a reduction of water supply reliability, leaving farmers exposed to drought events. These two alternatives offer different risk levels for crop production and farmersâ€™ incomes which determine the value of this information to the river basin authority. The information is relevant for the revision of River Basin Management Plans of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) within the context of climate change.","Quiroga, Sonia",quiroga_economicdroughtinformationwater_2011,TRUE,NA,soc_ben_repo,the economic value of drought informatio,2011
The Economic Value Of Geological Information: Synthesis And Directions For Future Research,"Geological information can play a key role in addressing challenges of sustainable development such as land degradation and groundwater protection, and contribute to improved decision-making processes. In this paper we: (a) provide a review of previous research on the economic value of geological information and other earth observations as well as related products, services and infrastructure; and (b) identify important lessons from this work as well as methodological challenges that require increased attention in future research. The review of prior research shows significant economic benefits attached to the generation of this type of public information. The value of geological information has typically been measured in terms of avoided costs. Still, it is difficult to compare results across studies since they differ in scope and make alternative assumptions concerning which sectors to cover. Furthermore, previous research is not uniform in their treatment of potential (rather than only existing) users, and employ varying conceptions of avoided costs. The paper concludes that future research should devote more attention to the public and experience good characteristics of this type of information, thus highlighting the preconditions for information adoption as well as addressing the role of potential users. A number of specific methodological challenges also deserve further scrutiny in future research, such as the use of discount rates and benefit-transfer approaches.

The Evolution Of Earth Observation Satellites In Europe And Its Impact On The Performance Of Emergency Response Services,"The paper reviews the evolution of Earth Observation systems in Europe and Worldwide and analyses the potential impact of their performance in support of emergency response services. Earth Observation satellites play already a significant role in supporting the action of first responders in case of major disasters. The main principle is the coordinated use of satellites in order to ensure a rapid response and the timely delivery of images and geospatial information of the area affected by the event. The first part of the paper reviews the main instruments and evaluates their current performance.\nThe International Charter â€œSpace and Major Disastersâ€, signed in October 2000, was the first international initiative aimed at establishing a unified system for the acquisition of space data. The charter is a cooperation agreement between space agencies and operators of space systems. At regional level, a similar instrument exists in Asia: Sentinel-Asia. In the frame of the European programme Copernicus, the emergency management service was launched in 2009. Geo-information products derived from space imagery are delivered during all phases of the emergency management cycle, in either rush or non-rush mode, free of charge for the users. In both cases, the capacities were historically drawn from national missions, funded with public money and directly operated by the space agencies or by national operators. \nThe paper focuses on the performance of the space infrastructure (satellites and ground segments). Several trends may have a significant impact on the current performance: \nâ€“ The increasing number of space systems which are privately-owned and managed by commercial operators.\nâ€“ The emergence in Europe of shared-ownership or community-owned systems. Copernicus Sentinel missions (Copernicus) or Eumetsat satellites are two typical examples. â€“ The development of dual-use capacities and the sovereignty dimension of these systems. \nâ€“ The development of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications.\nâ€“ The development of social media and crowd-based initiatives for humanitarian aid and emergency response.\nâ€“ Possible disruptions, such as large LEO constellations or GEO infrastructures enabling persistent observation. \nA common feature is the increased number of information sources and the higher real time dimension.","Denis, Gil",denis_evolutionearthobservationsatellites_2016,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,the evolution of earth observation satel,2016

The Not-So-Marginal Value Of Weather Warning Systems,"Knowing the benefits of creating or expanding programs is important for determining optimal levels of investment. Yet estimates of the benefits of weather warning systems are sparse, perhaps because there is often no clear counterfactual of how individuals would have fared without a particular warning system. This paper enriches the literature and informs policy decisions by using conditional variation in the initial broadcast dates of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR) transmitters to produce both cross-sectional and fixed effects estimates of the causal impact of expanding the NWR transmitter network. Results suggest that from 1970 to 2014, expanding NWR coverage to a previously untreated county was associated with an almost 40% reduction in injuries and as much as a 50% reduction in fatalities. The benefits associated with further expansion of this system have likely declined over time.","Miller, Benjamin",miller_marginalweatherwarningsystems_2018,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,the not so marginal value of weather war,2018
The Potential Value Of Improved Ocean Observation Systems In The Gulf Of Mexico,"A number of coastal and ocean observation systems exist throughout the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), but the network of systems is\nnot currently linked or integrated and at present not fully implemented. The network of local systems are diverse, typically involving\nunique mandates and several different funding sources at various levels of permanence. The purpose of this paper is to describe the\nocean observation systems that currently exist in the GOM, and to identify and quantify the expected economic benefits that may\nresult from the implementation of an integrated regional network. Improved ocean observation systems are expected to reduce the\nuncertainty of ocean/weather forecasting and to enhance the value of ocean/weather information throughout the Gulf region. The\nsource of benefits and the size of activity from which improved ocean observation benefits may be derived are estimated for private\nsector, non-market, and public sector activities categorized according to marine transportation, commercial fishing, recreational\nfishing, search and rescue operations, and pollution management. The benefits of improved ocean observation systems to energy\nexploration, development, and production activities are estimated, and a discussion of potential benefits to lightering activities,\nenvironmental monitoring, royalty payments, and engineering design are highlighted.\nr 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The Public Value Of Improving A Weather Forecasting System In Korea: A Choice Experiment Study,"The Korean government plans to improve the quality of its weather forecasting system in order to increase its public utility. The benefits arising from the implementation of this plan should be measured. To this end, this study applies a choice experiment to four attributes: the update frequency of both short- and medium-range forecasts, and the accuracy of both. A survey of 1000 randomly selected households was undertaken in Korea. In the study results, the marginal willingness-to-pays, respectively, for one more update of the short-range forecast per day, for a 1% increase in the accuracy of the short-range forecast, for changing the update frequency of the medium-range forecast from once a day (reference level) to twice a day, and for a 1% increase in the accuracy of the medium-range forecast as a result of improving the weather forecast service were estimated to be KRW 499.3 (USD 0.45), 108.3 (0.10), 346.5 (0.31), and 80.9 (0.07) per household per month.

The Role Of Stakeholders In Creating Societal Value From Coastal And Ocean Observations,"The importance of stakeholder engagement in ocean observation and in particular the realization of economic and societal benefits is discussed, introducing a number of overarching principles such as the convergence on common goals, effective communication, co-production of information and knowledge and the need for innovation. A series of case studies examine the role of coordinating frameworks such as the United Statesâ€™ Interagency Ocean Observing System (IOOSÂ®), and the European Ocean Observing System (EOOS), publicâ€“private partnerships such as Project Azul and the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) and finally the role of the â€œthirdâ€ or voluntary sector.

The Social Innovation Potential Of Ict-Enabled Citizen Observatories To Increase Eparticipation In Local Flood Risk Management,"We live in the age of Big Data, yet many areas of environmental management are still suffering from a lack of relevant data, information and knowledge that impedes sound decision making in the face of change and increasing challenges. A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves. Moreover, given the institutional structures identified in these cases and the obligation of authorities to be accountable for their decisions, citizen observatories do not automatically imply that citizens will have a higher level of participation in flood risk management, nor that communication between stakeholders improves.","Wehn, Uta",wehn_socialinnovationpotentialict_2015,FALSE,Citizen science â€œcitizen observatoriesâ€ to engagement with flood risk management,soc_ben_repo,the social innovation potential of ict e,2015

Using bibliometric and machine learning techniques, we analyse 1,235 publications in 1998â€“2018 related to Cosmo Skymed, the EO satellites constellation of the Italian Space Agency. Thanks to these satellites, 2,377 authors from 160 institutions and 68 countries worldwide have contributed to various subjects in several scientific fields. By using the marginal social value method in a cost-benefit analysis perspective, we conservatively estimate the value of such publications, including their marginal cost and value of citations.

The Value Of Earth Observation For Marine Water Quality Management,"Global Earth Observation is one of the most important sources of information for environmental resource management. With budgets for Earth Observation (EO) increasingly under pressure, it is important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. This paper attempts to develop and test such a framework by combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, expert-oriented approach. The analysis focuses on the use of EO for marine water quality management, but the methodology is applicable to other topics too. The case studies indicate that the main benefits of EO are increased spatial and temporal coverage of the existing monitoring system and generation of early warning predictions. The results suggest that the expected benefits of EO investments are positive, but that they strongly depend on the (perceived) accuracy of the information system.","Bouma, Jetske",bouma_earthobservationmarinewater_2009,TRUE,"VOI/Bayesian decision theory, elicited beliefs of stakeholders - marine water quality - same as ""Assessing the Value of Information for Water Quality Management in the North Sea"" and ""Assessing the Value of Earth Observation for Managing Coral Reefs: An Example from the Great Barrier Reef""",soc_ben_repo,the value of earth observation for marin,2009
The Value Of Climate Information When Farm Programs Matter,"Predictability of seasonal climate variations associated with ENSO suggests a potential to reduce farm risk by tailoring agricultural management strategies to mitigate the impacts of adverse conditions or to take advantage of favorable conditions. Federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information. A representative peanutâ€“cottonâ€“corn non-irrigated North Florida farm was used to estimate the value of the ENSO-based climate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of climate, prices, and risk aversion levels. Yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, first, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain outcomes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs. Results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when La NiÃ±a or El NiÃ±o ENSO phases are forecast. Highly risk averse farmers could benefit from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (offensive responses). The inclusion of Commodity Loan Programs (CLP) and Crop Insurance Programs (CIP) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels. However, more risk averse farmers could still benefit moderately from El NiÃ±o and marginally from La NiÃ±a forecasts when they participate in CLP and CIP.","Cabrera, Victor",cabrera_climateinformationfarmprograms_2006,TRUE,not satellite specifically,soc_ben_repo,the value of climate information when fa,2006

The Value Of Information: Measuring The Contribution Of Space-Derived Earth Science Data To Resource Management,"Governments around the world, as well as private industry, invest heavily in remote sensing spacecraft to obtain data about natural and environmental resources, climate change, and the relationship of earth science to human health and quality of life. Numerous studies have been undertaken to describe and measure the value of the data from these spacecraft in order to justify further investments. The studies use a wide variety of methods and generally find a large range of benefits, from quite small to very large, in part because of differences in methodologies. This article offers a general framework for measuring the value of information. The framework serves two purposes. One is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science. The second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data.

Uncertainty And Risk In Wildland Fire Management: A Review,"Wildland fire management is subject to manifold sources of uncertainty. Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources. Our findings echo earlier literature identifying wildfire effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildfire risk assessment and wildfire management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them. Leveraging the most appropriate decision support tools can facilitate wildfire risk assessment and ideally improve decision-making.","Thompson, Matthew",thompson_uncertaintyriskwildlandfire_2011,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,uncertainty and risk in wildland fire ma,2011

Use Of The Mchargian Lusa In Agricultural Research And Decisionmaking In The Age Of Non-Stationarity And Big Earth Observation Data,"In the past fifty years, there have been two major changes that are of methodological and consequential importance to the McHargian land-use suitability analysis (LUSA): increasing evidence of nonstationarity of global and regional ecological conditions and increasing availability of high resolution spatial-temporal earth observation data. For fifty years, the McHargian LUSA has been an important analysis tool for designers and planners for both regional conservation planning and development. McHarg's LUSA is a decision support tool that reduces the dimensions of spatial-temporal data. This makes the technique relevant beyond decision support to spatial identification and prediction of areas of socio-ecological opportunity, risk, and priority. In this article, I use a set of recent studies relating to agricultural LUSA to reveal relationships between the traditional McHargian LUSA and related spatialtemporal research methods that are adapting to more data and non-stationary ecological conditions. Using a classification based on descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive research activities, I organize these related methods and illustrate how linkages between research activities can be used to assimilate more kinds of spatial â€œbig data,â€ address non-stationarity in socio-ecological systems, and suggest ways to enhance decision-making and collaboration between planners and other sciences.","Lim, Theodore",lim_mchargianlusaagriculturalresearch_2019,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,use of the mchargian lusa in agricultura,2019

Using Satellite Data To Fill The Gaps In The Us Air Pollution Monitoring Network,"Compliance with the Clean Air Actâ€™s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is determined at the county level using local air pollution monitors. However, the vast majority of counties have zero or one monitor, and air pollution concentrations can vary dramatically over short distances. In addition, recent evidence suggests monitor placement may be skewed to make NAAQS compliance easier. As a result, the network of air pollution monitors may not detect all areas with pollution levels that exceed the NAAQS. This paper explores this possibility using satellite-derived data on fine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) to assess NAAQS compliance for the continental United States at a 1 kilometer (km) resolution. We compare the satellite-based assessments with official attainment designations made by the terrestrial monitor network and calculate the number of people living in â€œmisclassifiedâ€ areasâ€”areas with PM2.5 levels that exceed the NAAQS but are classified as being in attainment based on the ground monitors and the US Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s (EPAâ€™s) official determination. We estimate that about 24.4 million people are living in these misclassified areasâ€” about as many as are living in properly classified nonattainment areasâ€”and that if such areas had sped up their PM2.5 reductions as much as nonattainment areas did, 5,452 premature deaths would have been avoided, a welfare gain to society of $49 billion.","Sullivan, Daniel",sullivan_satellitedatafillgaps_2018,TRUE,"Satellite data vs. official determinations of attainment of PM2.5 standards - difference in difference design, estimates impact of misclassification or premature deaths",soc_ben_repo,using satellite data to fill the gaps in,2018

Valuation Of Calibration For Satellite Constellations,"Earth observation systems, consisting of in-space and air borne platforms and sensors, are providing a growing number of high resolution spatial and temporal services including agricultural crop yield predictions, local weather forecasts, and traffic management. As the complexity of these systems increases with multi-platform elements and sophisticated processing and modeling, there are also increasing avenues for introduction of errors. It is important to characterize and quantify the uncertainties and errors. Here, it shown that a value-chain approach can be used for conceptualizing errors and modeling uncertainties relevant for final decisions. This approach can then be applied for improving system value assessments and obtaining an â€˜error-adjustedâ€™ value of the remote sensing system. The error-adjusted value can be used in optimization or trade-studies for system design.

Value Generation Through Public Procurement Of Innovative Earth Observation Applications: Service-Dominant Logic Perspective,"This article investigates howthe implementation ofa national space strategy in partnership with supranational organizations affects the development of service ecosystems of Earth Observation (EO) applications. The subject is studied through the lens of a servicedominantlogicperspective, ameta-theorythatseeks to explain how economic value is cocreated in business-to-business markets. Qualitative empirical research was conducted in three emerging space countriesâ€”Slovakia, Latvia, and Estoniaâ€”to understand how value-creating resource integration processes involving space downstream companies and their potential end-users are affected by adding the European Space Agency (ESA) to the ecosystem. The studyâ€™s findings showed that the catalytic procurement of prototypes ofnewEOapplications through ESA is connected to multilevel institutional changes in relevant service ecosystems. ESAâ€™s involvement facilitates more intensive interaction between EO companies and their targeted customers in dyadic relationships. Value cocreation processes are influenced by micro-, meso-, and macrolevel institutions. The study highlights the linkages between ESAâ€™s involvement and the purposeful entrepreneurial efforts of EO companies to change prevailing institutional arrangements. This institutional work is aimed at reconfiguring institutional arrangement at the mesolevel to make it more supportive to value-creating resource integration activities between actors in a service ecosystem.","Eerme, Tonis",eerme_generationpublicprocurementinnovative_2021,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,value generation through public procurem,2021
Value And Validity Of Earth Resources Observations From Space,"Observations of the earth from space can provide overall repetitive views in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Data from such surveys can be used as the basis for more detailed observations from aircraft and on the ground to guide resource exploration, development, and conservation activities. The value of earth resource observations from space has been demonstrated by the practical use ofphotographs from the Gemini and Apollo spaceflights and particularly by a series of multispectral photographs taken during the flight of Apollo 9. The analysis of those photographs has shown that the performance of the planned Earth Resources Technology Satellite will meet the needs of the resource and environmental community for small-scale repetitive images of the earth in the visible and solar infrared portions of the spectrum and has provided a limited base of material for earth scientists to work with in order to ready themselves for the ERTS data. The validity of earth resource observations from space can be derived by analogy from the successively closer observations of the moon, culminating in repeated physical sampling of the moon's surface. The method of inductive reasoning and analysis used for the moon is the opposite of the normal deductive analysis used on the earth. Adoption of the inductive methods and reasoning for earth observations will provide a framework of broad observations and conclusions leading to the identification of target areas for more detailed observation and will, in time, reduce the costs and time required for surveys dealing with resource and environmental problems.","Robinove, Charles",robinove_validityearthresourcesobservations_1973,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,value and validity of earth resources ob,1973
Value Of Enso-Forecasted Drought Information For The Management Of Water Resources Of Small To Mid-Size Communities,"There have been great advances in climate forecasting ability in recent years. However, the use of this information in water management decision-making has been lacking. The temporal and spatial scales of forecasts and the difficulty of understanding forecast products have been cited as key reasons for the lack of use of these forecasts. The Community Water Deficit Index (CWDI) was previously developed as a tool to use El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts to forecast droughts in small to mid-sized communities of the southeastern U.S. This study investigated the monetary value and benefits of using CWDI as a seasonal drought forecasting technique. The efforts were focused on determining the usefulness of drought information for municipal water management, the usefulness of water restrictions imposed by municipal water management, and the extent to which advance knowledge of probabilistic drought forecasts mitigates negative impacts. The results indicate that water use restrictions are effective for coping with drought, and the benefits of using forecasts and water management adjustments should involve planning. It was also found that by using drought forecasts, and thus having a drought preparedness plan, communities can save both water and money.","Sharda, Vaishali",sharda_ensoforecasteddroughtinformation_2016,TRUE,NA,soc_ben_repo,value of enso forecasted drought informa,2016
Value Of Improved Long-Range Weather Information,"An important human welfare implication of climate involves effects of interannual variation in temperature and precipitation on agriculture. Year-to-year variations in U.S. climate result from El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a quasi-periodic redistribution of heat and momentum in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The study described here represents a preliminary assessment of the value to the entire U.S. agricultural sector of improved ENSO forecasts in the southeastern United States. This interdisciplinary assessment combines data and models from meteorology, plant sciences, and economics under a value of information framework based on Bayesian decision theory. An economic model of the U.S. agricultural sector uses changes in yields for various ENSO phases to translate physical (yield) effects of ENSO changes into economic effects on producers and on domestic and foreign consumers. The value of perfect information to agriculture is approximately $145 million. The economic value of an imperfect forecast is $96 million. These results suggest that increases in forecast accuracy have substantial economic value to agriculture.","Adams, Richard",adams_improvedrangeweatherinformation_1995,TRUE,NA,soc_ben_repo,value of improved long range weather inf,1995
Value Of Information For Climate Observing Systems,"The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions. The difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems is the VOI of the new observing system relative to the existing system. As illustration, the VOI for the proposed spaceborne CLARREO system relative to current space-borne systems is computed. Depending on details of the decision context, the VOI ranges from 2 to 30 trillion US dollars.","Cooke, Roger",cooke_informationclimateobservingsystems_2014,TRUE,"Modeling link between improved climate observations, decision-making trigger status, and resulting reductions in climate damage",soc_ben_repo,value of information for climate observi,2014
Value Of Perfect Enso Phase Predictions For Agriculture: Evaluating The Impact Of Land Tenure And Decision Objectives,"In many places, predictions of regional climate variability associated with the El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation phenomenon offer the potential to improve farmersâ€™ decision outcomes, by mitigating the negative impacts of adverse conditions or by taking advantage of favorable conditions. While the notion that climate forecasts are potentially valuable has been established, questions of when they may be more or less valuable have proven harder to resolve. Using simulations, we estimate the expected value of seasonal climate information under alternative assumptions about (a) land tenure (ownership vs. short-term leases) and (b) the decision makerâ€™s objective function (expected utility vs. prospect theory value function maximization), employing a full range of plausible parameter values for each objective function. This allows us to show the extent to which the value of information depends on risk preferences, loss aversion, wealth levels and expectations, as well as situational constraints. Our results demonstrate in a non-laboratory decision context that, in some cases, psychologically plausible deviations from expected utility maximization can lead to substantial differences in estimates of the expected value of climate forecasts. Efforts to foster effective use of climate information and forecasts in agriculture must be grounded in a firm understanding of the goals, objectives and constraints of decision makers.","Letson, David",letson_perfectensophasepredictions_2009,TRUE,NA,soc_ben_repo,value of perfect enso phase predictions ,2009
Valuing Geospatial Information: Using The Contingent Valuation Method To Estimate The Economic Benefits Of Landsat Satellite Imagery,"While the U.S. government does not charge for downloading Landsat images, the images have value to users. This paper demonstrates a method that can value Landsat and other imagery to users. A survey of downloaders of Landsat images found: (a) established US users have a mean value of $912 USD per scene; (b) new US users and users returning when imagery became free have a mean value of $367 USD per scene. Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is $1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery. Charging a price of $100 USD a scene would result in an efficiency loss of $37.5 million a year. This economic information should be useful to policymakers who must decide about the future of this and similar remote sensing programs.","Loomis, John",loomis_valuinggeospatialinformationcontingent_2015,TRUE,"Contingent valuation survey of Landsat users - established and new users.

Valuing User Preferences For Geospatial Fire Monitoring In Guatemala,"Like many landscapes across Central America, forests in Guatemalaâ€™s Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) are increasingly susceptible to forest fire, with most forest fires resulting from untended agricultural fires. Fire damage poses significant risk to the MBRâ€™s natural resources and cultural heritage, but budget challenges limit the capacity of national, regional, and local institutions to effectively detect, monitor, and control forest fires. The Geospatial Information System for Fire Management (SIGMA-I) is a United States government-subsidized suite of geospatial fire management tools that are widely disseminated, free of charge, to land managers and other users in Guatemala for on-the-ground fire prevention and response. Provision of SIGMA-I geospatial data and tools such as daily thermal â€œhotspotâ€ maps provide positive benefits for sustainable fire management. However, little research exists supporting the nonmarket monetary value of geospatial fire monitoring tools and their component features. We used a choice experiment to estimate land managersâ€™ willingness to pay for individual attributes of SIGMA-I hotspot mapping in Guatemala. We found quantitative evidence of positive willingness to pay for geospatial data, demonstrating positive nonmarket value of geospatial data for sustainable fire management in developing countries and regions where agricultural fires are common. Our results indicate strong preferences from Guatemalaâ€™s forest fire management community for improving the frequency of hotspot reporting and reducing detection of erroneous hotspots. As the availability of geospatial data increases, use of tools like SIGMA-I has the potential to significantly improve fire management, especially in regions where funding and resources for fire management are scarce. Our results support continued multinational funding for tools like SIGMA-I for forest fire management in Guatemala and other developing countries.","Berenter, Jared",berenter_valuinguserpreferencesgeospatial_2021,TRUE,"Willingness to pay, choice experiment - fire monitoring in Guatemala -",soc_ben_repo,valuing user preferences for geospatial ,2021
Valuing Weather Observation Systems For Forest Fire Management,"Weather information is an integral part of modern fire management systems. In this paper, we investigate, by means of simulation studies, how improvements in the weather observation systems help to reduce burned area by targeting and monitoring places ripe fires are likely to occur. In our model, the air patrolling schedule is determined by the Nesterov index, which is calculated from observed weather data. We use two weather data sets based on ldquoroughrdquo and ldquofinerdquo grids. The reduction of the total burned area, associated with an air patrolling schedule based on the ldquofinerdquo grid, indicates the benefits of using better weather observations. We, also, consider a stochastic model to simulate forest fires and explore the sensitivity of the model with respect to the quality of input data. Finally, we investigate the system of systems effect. We find the largest marginal improvement from the rough grid results when we increase the quality of observations in most critical areas.","Khabarov, Nikolay",khabarov_valuingweatherobservationsystems_2008,TRUE,VOI/Bayesian based on reduction in burned areas based on either coarse or fine resolution weather data.

Visual Evidence From Above: Assessing The Value Of Earth Observation Satellites For Supporting Human Rights,"Public access to data collected by remote sensing Earth Observation Satellites has, until recently, been very limited. Now, citizens and rights advocacy groups are increasingly utilising satellite-collected images to interrogate justice issues; to document, prevent and verify rights abuses; and to imagine and propose social change. Yet while other communication technologies have received substantial critical analysis regarding their value as tools of social justice, activism and resistance, satellites have received comparatively scant attention. This article examines the uses of satellite-collected images in human rights contexts including the opportunities, challenges and risks they pose. We conclude this examination by arguing that if satellites are to be used effectively to collect evidence from above by rights advocates, greater attention to and capacity for ensuring accountability from below is required.","Notley, Tanya",notley_visualevidenceassessingearth_2016,TRUE,"Qualitative research approach - critical analysis, interviews, case studies of satellite images in human rights contexts.

"Weather Impacts On Natural, Social And Economic Systems","The EU project Weather Impacts on Natural, Social and Economic Systems (WISE) has analysed impacts of current climate variability to evaluate the sensitivity of today's society to extreme weather. Unlike studies of anticipated impacts of climate change, WISE did not rely on scenarios and projections, but on existing and newly collected data. The research involved (i) the statistical modelling of meteorological and sectoral time series, aimed at quantifying the impacts of changing weather variables on sector output, (ii) a population survey, aimed at investigating public perception of and behavioural response to unusually hot and dry summers and mild winters, and (iii) a management survey, aimed at obtaining insight into managers' awareness and perception of the importance of extreme weather on their operations. The three activities revealed a wealth of data and information, providing relevant insights into Germany's sensitivity to and perception of extreme weather events. Sectors that were analysed included agriculture, outdoor fire, water supply, human health, electricity and gas consumption and tourism. It appears from the statistical modelling that extreme weather can have impressive impacts on all sectors, especially when expressed in monetary terms. However, weather variability is generally considered a manageable risk, to which sectors in Germany appear reasonably well-adapted. The population and management surveys reveal both positive and negative impacts of extreme weather. People generally respond to these impacts by adjusting their activities. The utilities (electricity, gas and water) indicate that they are robsut to the current level of weather variability and do not consider climate change an important threat to their operations. The tourism sector experiences impacts but typically takes a reactive approach to adaptation, although it is also developing weather-insensitive products.","Flechsig, Michael",flechsig_weatherimpactsnaturalsocial_2000,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,weather impacts on natural social and ec,2000
Weather Satellites And The Economic Value Of Forecasts: Evidence From The Electric Power Industry,"Data from weather satellites have become integral to the weather forecast process in the United States and abroad. Satellite data are used to derive improved forecasts for short-term routine weather, long-term climate change, and for predicting natural disasters. The resulting forecasts have saved lives, reduced weather-related economic losses, and improved the quality of life. Weather information routinely assists in managing resources more e0ciently and reducing industrial operating costs. The electric energy industry in particular makes extensive use of weather information supplied by both government and commercial suppliers. Through direct purchases of weather data and information, and through participating in the increasing market for weather derivatives, this sector provides measurable indicators of the economic importance of weather information. Space weather in the form of magnetic disturbances caused by coronal mass ejections from the sun creates geomagnetically induced currents that disturb the electric power grid, sometimes causing signi4cant economic impacts on electric power distribution. This paper examines the use of space-derived weather information on the U.S. electric power industry. It also explores issues that may impair the most optimum use of the information and reviews the longer-term opportunities for employing weather data acquired from satellites in future commercial and government activity.","Hertzfeld, Henry",hertzfeld_weathersatelliteseconomicforecasts_2004,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,weather satellites and the economic valu,2004
Weather Service Chain Analysis (Wsca) - An Approach For Appraisal Of The Social-Economic Benefits Of Improvements In Weather Services,"The so-called Cost-Loss approach for the assessment of the economic benefits of weather forecasts is less suitable for assessing the benefits for user groups among which uncertainty about the uptake and utilization of the information is significant. Most road users can be counted to these groups. Assessment of the benefits of (improvements in) weather services for road users faces several attribution problems which may entail both over- and underestimation of these benefits. In FMI an approach has been developed which aims to account for these uncertainties by means of decomposition of the information flow ranging from forecast generation to benefit realization, i.e. so-called weather service chain analysis (WCSA). This approach can be used both in a quantitative and in a qualitative fashion. The qualitative version is meant to support information management and to identify improvement options in each section of the weather service chain. In the quantitative version the product sum of ratings per step (compared to the maximum score) is established. The quantitative version helps to identify those segments of the chain for which improvements will have the highest social-economic pay-off. It also helps to identify actions that raise the leverage of investments in weather forecast improvement. The WSCA method can be embedded in the economic modelling of particular sectors, such as (road) transport. WSCA also incites to develop regular surveying of user groups and weather service use. The paper will discuss the principles of the method and its links to economic models, as well as show a few applications for road transport.","Perrels, Adriaan",perrels_weatherservicechainanalysis_2012,FALSE,NA,soc_ben_repo,weather service chain analysis wsca an a,2012
Web-Based Decision Support System Tools: The Soil And Water Assessment Tool Online Visualization And Analyses (Swatonline) And Nasa Earth Observation Data Downloading And Reformatting Tool,"The current influx of climate related information required scientists to communicate their findings to decision makers in governments, disaster preparedness organizations, and the general public. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a powerful modelling tool that allows scientists to simulate many of the physical processes involved in the water cycle. This article presents the design, methods and development efforts to overcome some of the limitations of the previously developed SWAT visualization software programs by creating a set of modular web applications that can be duplicated, customized, and run. Moreover, this article features a web application development tool for climate data retrieval.

What Is The Economic Value Of Satellite Imagery?,"Does remote-sensing information, such as that from Landsat and similar Earth-observing satellites, provide economic benefits to society, and can this value be estimated? Using satellite data for northeastern Iowa, U.S. Geological Survey scientists modeled the relations among land uses, agricultural production, and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers. They demonstrated that information from such modeling can allow more efficient management of agricultural production without sacrificing groundwater quality. Just for northeastern Iowa, the value of such remote-sensing information was shown to be as much as $858 million Â± $197 million per year, which corresponds to a current value of $38.1 billion Â± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits into the foreseeable future.","Raunikar, Ronald",raunikar_economicsatelliteimagery_2013,TRUE,"VOI/Bayesian decision theory - agricultural production and groundwater quality via nitrate loading, with and without high-quality info from satellite imagery",soc_ben_repo,what is the economic value of satellite ,2013
Willingness To Pay For Soil Information Derived By Digital Maps: A Choice Experiment Approach,"Soil surveys and the information they provide are commonly believed to be good investment, with significant benefits accrued to their users. To date, the empirical evidence for this comes from studies that have shown how enhanced soil information can alter agricultural practices to yield higher returns. This study attempts to estimate the economic value of soil information generated by a host of new proximal and in situ geophysical methods for the assessment of the following soil properties: carbon content, water content, clay content, bulk density, and soil depth. The study also adopts a novel approach to the economic valuation of soil information by employing for the first time a choice experiment to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of potential users of the digital maps and their features. The choice experiment took the form of an online survey, administered to about a thousand individuals from the wider soil community.
