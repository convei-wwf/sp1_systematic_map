1,farmers and ranchers in rural areas were connected via wide-bandwidth satellite link to a central distribution center at the university of north dakota.
1,"the farmers participated actively in evaluating the usefulness of inputs derived from remotely sensed data, sometimes even by conducting experiments on fertilizer and fungicide applications and assessing the economic benefits."
1,"resulting applications included management zone delineation, verifying the effectiveness of variable-rate fertilizer applications, verifying the effectiveness of fungicide applications, quantifying the loss due to accidental spray drift damage, selecting acres within sugar beet fields under the payment in kind program, and monitoring physical damage due to insect, inundation, wind and hail."
