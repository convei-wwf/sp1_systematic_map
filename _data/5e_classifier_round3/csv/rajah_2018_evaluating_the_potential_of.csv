2,"in the eastern parts south africa, the american accepted 3 march 2018 bramble (rubus cuneifolius) has been identified as one of the major keywords threats to social and ecological systems."
2,optimal management and support vector machine mitigation of american bramble spread requires reliable and cost (svm); american bramble; effective approaches to determine invaded spatial extents.
2,"in this multi-spectral remote study, we test the value of the recently launched, freely available sensing; sentinel-2; landsat sentinel-2 (s2), as opposed to conventional landsat 8 imagery in 8; rubus cuneifolius mapping the american bramble."
2,"using the support vector machine classification algorithm, we seek to identify the optimal season for mapping the american bramble as well as the most influential bands in the classification process."
2,"results show that sentinel-2 out-performed landsat 8 in all seasons, with summer providing the highest classification accuracy (77% accuracy)."
2,"the study also shows that strategically placed sentinel-2 bands of near infrared, red edge and short wave infrared significantly contribute to an increase in overall bramble mapping accuracy."
2,"this study demonstrates the value of freely available multispectral imagery in mapping american bramble at large spatial extents, hence valuable for cost-effective operational use."
2,"introduction alien plant invasions influence environmental change by adversely impacting ecological and socio-economic environments (davies & johnson, 2011; rocchini et al., 2015)."
2,"invasive alien plant species are detrimental to natural ecosystems by depleting natural capital and ecosys- tem services and often require significant resources for mitigation and restoration (davies & johnson, 2011; richardson & van wilgen, 2004)."
2,"in south africa, approximately ten million hectares have been invaded by alien invasive plants, threatening ecological resources and livelihoods (nel et al., 2004)."
2,"hence, methods that facilitate determination of their spatial extents are critical for mitigation of their spread and rehabilitation of invaded landscapes (malanson & walsh, 2013)."

3,"rajah et al. is valuable for the design and implementation of species-specific management and erad- ication strategies (odindi, mutanga, rouget, & hlanguza, 2016)."
3,"furthermore, reliable mapping of plant invasions can be useful for allocation of resources for management and rehabilitation (masocha & skidmore, 2011)."
3,"the american bramble (rubus cuneifolius), a well-established alien invasive species in south africa, has been identified as a major threat to native flora and fauna."
3,"the american bramble (hereafter referred to as bramble) is a sprawling shrub species of the rosaceae family found in diverse global climatic regions (bromilow, 2010)."
3,"originating from north america, young bramble canes (stems) are erect, but can bend over time with increased height."
3,bramble canes are characterized by downward curving thorns and trifoliate leaves.
3,majority of these leaves are shed during autumn and winter.
3,new leaves and lateral branches grow from canes during spring.
3,"the latter are vegetative and give rise to approximately 2–5 white flowers at the end of short leafy shoots, flowering form september to january annu- ally (henderson, 2011)."
3,"the species is believed to be one of the most devastating invasive plants in south africa, particularly in the cool and moist kwazulu-natal mist-belt region (erasmus, 1984)."
3,"bramble has significant adverse direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity, which include changes in nutrient cycling, increase in soil erosion, reduction in rangeland carrying capacity and viability, natural plant succession, fire patterns and behaviour and hydrological processes (henderson, 2001)."
3,"determination of an invasive species spatial extent is valuable for mitigation and rehabilitation of the invaded landscapes, as invasive alien species often degrade and compromise the natural state of landscapes (bradley, 2014)."
3,"remote sensing technology provides an ideal opportunity to reliably detect, spatially monitor and map bramble from surrounding native vegetation."
3,"whereas the use of hyperspectral remotely sensed data for alien invasive detection and mapping has been relatively successful in recent years (he, rocchini, neteler, & nagendra, 2011; müllerová, pergl, & pyšek, 2013; nagendra et al., 2013 tsai, lin, & yoshino, 2007; underwood, ustin, & dipietro, 2003; ustin, dipietro, olmstead, underwood, & scheer, 2002), adoption of hyperspectral imagery for regional mapping of alien invasive species remains a challenge."
3,"the reduced spatial extent (swath width) that characterizes hyperspectral images require laborious mosaicking of multiple images for large-scale applications, which requires increased image pre-processing time as well as hardware and software capabilities."
3,"furthermore, hyperspectral imagery is often not economically feasible, due to high cost per square kilometre and is characterized by high data dimensionality that require extensive pro- cessing and analytical skills."
3,"similarly, whereas the application of new generation mul- tispectral remotely sensed data (e.g."
3,"world-view, rapid eye, ikonos) for large scale alien invasive mapping has also been relatively successful (gil, lobo, abadi, silva, & calado, 2013; kandwal, jeganathan, tolpekin, & kushwaha, 2009; robinson et al., 2016), their high cost per unit area remains a major constraint."
3,"to overcome the above-mentioned limitations, there has been an emergence of improved and freely available multispectral imagery for landscape mapping."
3,"the recently launched european union’s sentinel-2 (s2) sensor under the copernicus programme for instance, aims to provide freely available imagery for the entire globe as a continuation of the spot and landsat missions’ legacy (frampton, dash, watmough, & milton, 2013; hojas-gascon et al., 2015)."
3,"the s2 carries a wide-swath (290 km), medium to high resolution (10–20 m),"
4,south african geographical journal﻿ 293 multi-spectral imager with 13 bands.
4,"these specifications are unprecedented and present a unique opportunity to gain new perspectives on medium to large-scale vegetation map- ping (immitzer, vuolo, & atzberger, 2016)."
4,"the 13 spectral bands include three within the red-edge region, and two within the short-wave infrared region, strategically positioned for species level vegetation mapping (cho et al., 2012; hedley, roelfsema, koetz, & phinn, 2012)."
4,"however, whereas s2s relatively high spatial resolution, unique spectral configura- tions, wide swath width and five-day temporal resolution offer great potential in vegetation mapping (hojas-gascon et al., 2015; ramoelo, cho, mathieu, & skidmore, 2015), s2s value in alien invasive plant mapping vis-à-vis the freely available landsat 8 series has not been suitably examined."
4,the moderate temporal resolution that characterizes freely available imagery such as s2 and traditional landsat 8 (l8) facilitate multi-season analysis.
4,according to bradley (2014) and haung and asner (2009) the varying invasive species seasonal phenologies provide opportunities for reliable mapping.
4,denny (1990) notes that bramble is characterized by varying phenological characteristics during its 18-month life cycle.
4,"typically, new stems appear in october and grow rapidly until march, after which growth stops, with few leaves remaining until the end of july."
4,"new leaves then appear in august, followed by flowers in september and fruiting development and ripening by january (denny, 1990)."
4,this seasonal variability offers great potential for determination of the optimum season for bramble detection and mapping.
4,"recently, robust machine learning algorithms like the support vector machines (svms) have become popular within the remote sensing community."
4,"svm is a supervised statistical learning technique first developed by vapnik (1979) to deal with binary classifications and aims to find a hyper plane that divides the data-set into a discrete predefined number of classes consistent with training data (mountrakis, im, & ogole, 2011)."
4,"an optimum hyper plane is developed using training data-sets and its generalization capability is corroborated with test data-sets (kavzoglu & colkesen, 2009)."
4,the overall performance of svms differs depending on the choice of kernel function and its parameters.
4,"kernel functions act as an optimiser of the non-linear procedure to map the input data into high dimensional feature space while minimizing over-fitting and other multi-dimensional problems commonly experienced with remote sensing data (ramoelo et al., 2015)."
4,"recent literature has shown that svms is capable of classifying numerous classes using limited support vectors as train- ing samples, without compromising overall accuracies (bruzzone & chi, 2006; foody & mathur, 2004; mantero, moser, & serpico, 2005; shao & lunetta, 2012; zheng, myint, thenkabail, & aggarwal, 2015)."
4,the characteristic thorny and thicket nature of the bramble and prevalence on un-even mountainous terrain makes collection of training and validation data challenging.
4,"hence, the insensitivity of svm to training sample makes it ideal for the location chosen as the study area (figure 1)."
4,"the launch of s2 provides an ideal platform for comparison with existing freely avail- able, medium spatial resolution, wide swath-width imagery such as l8."
4,"we hypothesize that improvements in freely available s2 imagery could improve bramble mapping, due to the collective effects of several strategically placed spectral bands and superior spatial resolution."
4,"hence, this study aims to compare the performance of multi-sea- sonal l8 and s2 in discriminating and mapping the distribution the bramble within a conserved environment."

5,"the udp is considered one of the most significant natural grasslands of south africa (everson & everson, 2016)."
5,"the udp is managed by ezemvelo kwazulu-natal wildlife (ekznw), a provincial conservation authority."
5,"wet and humid conditions are experienced during summer (november to march) (nel, 2009), where rainfall ranges from 990–1130 mm (dollar & goudy, 1999)."
5,"winters are dry and cold (may to august) with regular occurrences of snowfall and frost (mansour, mutanga, everson, & adam, 2012)."
5,"mean annual temperature in the area is approximately 16 °c and annual precipitation ranges between 1000 mm in the foothills to 1800 mm at the escarpment (tyson, preston-whyte, & schulze, 1976)."
5,"the landscape is predominantly natural grassland (wire grass (aristida purpurea), weeping lovegrass (eragrostis curvula) and common thatch grass (hyparrhenia hirta) with patches of natural shrubs (erica spp.) and thicket."
5,"bramble is an emerging alien invasive plant species within the udp and has already invaded a significant portion of the landscape (bromilow, 2010)."
5,udp climate provides adequate conditions for bramble to thrive and spread.

7,"field data collection using a trimble differentially corrected geoxt handheld gps receiver, field data points were collected based on purposive sampling during spring and summer, which coincides with brambles flowering phenological stage (table 1)."
7,purposive sampling is the deliberate choice of a target species unique qualities.
7,the technique is non-random and chosen indi- viduals (ground truth points) are at the researcher’s discretion.
7,"the approach was considered ideal due to the area’s steep and mountainous terrain, hence restricted accessibility."
7,ground control points were collected as close as possible to the centre of bramble patches.
7,patches of bramble ranged from 15 m x 15 m to 50 m x 50 m (figure 2).
7,"ground control point data collected from bramble patches were spatially independent, so as to compensate for the images spatial resolution."
7,spatial independence of ground control data ensured that each bramble patch fell within a single image pixel and was associated with the unique spectral reflectance of that specific pixel.
7,"in addition, aerial photograph imagery collected in 2016, at a 0.5 m spatial resolution was used to supplement and verify selected ground truth points."
7,"svm classification cloud free l8 and s2 images were acquired for each season (summer, spring, autumn and winter)."
7,"landsat 8 imagery was converted from digital number (dn) to surface reflectance using the arcmap 10.4 landsat 8 dn to reflectance toolbox (dilts, 2015)."
7,the landsat 8 toolbox provides several basic pre-processing tools that allow functionality of remote sensing data within an arcmap environment.
7,"one of the basic tools is the dn to reflec- tance tool, which converts raw digital number (dn) values to surface reflectance values."

8,qgis is gis freeware and is the equivalent of esri arcmap commercial gis software.
8,"the system for automated geoscientific analyses (saga) is a plugin that works in conjunction with qgis and has numerous tools that automate analytical and pre-processing spatial algorithms (qgis development team, 2016)."
8,"the correction of topographic effects is one such tool, and was used to mitigate the topographic effects of shadow within the study area."
8,"collected ground truth points (≈1000) were used to extract spectra for the four land cover classes (bare rock, bramble, forest and grassland) considered in this study."
8,spectral reflectance values were extracted from l8 (30 m resolution) and s2 (20 m resolution) imagery using the arcmap extract multi-values to points tool.
8,"in l8 images, spectra from the red, green, blue, near infrared (nir), short wave infrared 1 (swir1) and shortwave infrared 2 (swir2), were extracted while red, green, blue, near infrared (nir), red edge 1 (re1), red edge 2 (re2), red edge 3 (re3), shortwave infrared 1(swir1) and shortwave infrared 2 (swir2) bands were extracted from the s2 images."
8,"an optimal set of spectral bands, also known as band optimization was determined for bramble classification."
8,feature selection which recognized each spectral band as a feature which contributed to the overall accuracy of svm classification accuracy was implemented using python to determine overall accuracy on a band by band basis.
8,overall accuracies for cumulative spectral bands were produced and the highest resulting accuracy was used for classification of the specific data-set.
8,"to optimize the svm classification algorithm, a model tuning process was implemented within python to determine the best hyper-parameters for each season."
8,"the gamma range was 0.01 to 100, c range was 0.001 to 1000 and with four (linear, sigmoid, poly and rbf) kernel options."
8,optimum hyper-parameters derived from the svm tuning process were then applied to the entire image based on results produced by the ground truth training spectra.
8,"python 2.7.13 (van rossum & drake, 2012) was used to implement the svm classification on all imagery and a one against all approach used to implement a multi-class classifier."
8,a one against all approach isolates each class and is designed to separate the target class from the remaining classes.
8,ground control data were split into test (30%) and training data (70%) sets for svm multi-class analysis.
8,"pixels were classified into the areas dominant land-use-land-cover classes, i.e."

13,"the use of optimal summer hyper-parameters on summer imagery produced the highest overall accuracy (77%) for s2 across all seasonal imagery, with minimal over-overfitting (figure 3(b))."
13,landsat 8 autumn results provided the lowest overall classification accuracy (50%) across all seasonal l8 imagery (table 3(c)).
13,low producers accuracies were observed for bramble (48%) and forest (48%) (table 3(c)).
13,"autumn imagery resulted in the most over-fitted l8 spatial distribution map across all seasons, with bramble being the most over-estimated class and grassland being the most under-estimated class (figure 4(a))."
13,sentinel-2 autumn results yielded the third highest overall accuracy across all seasonal imagery (table 4(c)).
13,bramble achieved the lowest users and producers accuracies.
13,"although sentinel-2 autumn imagery provided an overall accuracy of 63%, the classification and spatial distribution of bramble and other surrounding classes were unsatisfactory."
13,winter l8 results did not satisfactorily discriminate between bramble and other land classes (table 3(d)).
13,"bramble achieved the lowest users and producers accuracies, whilst bare rock achieved the highest."
13,application of optimal svm hyper-parameters to winter imagery resulted in overfitting (figure 4(c)) and an over-estimation in the prediction of the spatial distribution of the bramble and forest classes.
13,s2 winter imagery provided unsatis- factory discrimination between bramble and grassland classes (table 4(d)).
13,"application of optimal svm winter hyper-parameters to s2 winter imagery resulted in an over-estimation of bramble and underestimation of grassland (figure 4(d)), despite a 61% overall accuracy for winter svm classification."
13,"discussion generally, spatial distribution maps using l8 imagery resulted in inferior overall classi- fication accuracies for bramble."
13,"this can be attributed to overfitting when optimal svm hyper-parameters were used on seasonal l8 imagery, likely due to l8s lower spatial resolu- tion."
13,"the 30 metre l8 pixel is prone to the mixed pixel problem, as the dominant class has a major influence in the overall reflectance captured by the sensor."
13,"consequently, smaller bramble patches (less than 20 m) were not easily distinguished as reflectance from the surrounding vegetation masked bramble reflectance."
13,"this limitation is prevalent during the dry season, when both the bramble and the surrounding vegetation senesce."
13,the low bramble classification accuracy using l8 could also be attributed to the sensors inability to differentiate the subtle spectral differences between bramble and related land cover types like forest and grassland.
13,"however, despite these limitations, bradley (2014) notes that results generated from medium resolution imagery such as l8 are useful in providing a preliminary understanding of a generalized landscape and regional invasion status and risk."
13,"despite the lower bramble classification accuracies, the l8 summer imagery produced the highest classification accuracies, compared to spring, autumn and winter l8 imagery."
13,"according to bradley (2014), this arises from the high variability in energy absorption or reflectance between target classes."
13,"the higher classification accuracy during spring can also be attributed to bramble’s distinct white inflorescence during the season (denny, 1990), facil- itating spectral discrimination from surrounding species."
13,autumn and winter produced the lowest classification accuracies.
13,"this finding is consistent with shezi and poona (2010), who found poor bramble classification accuracies using spot 5 autumn and winter image data."
14,"south african geographical journal 303 bramble and surrounding vegetation begin to senesce simultaneously during late autumn and winter (henderson, 2011), impeding their reliable delineation."
14,"furthermore, this rela- tive homogeneity compromises svm performance by over-fitting when using autumn and winter imagery."
14,"according to melgani and bruzzone (2004), svm was originally developed for binary classifications, karimi, prasher, patel, and kim (2006) notes that this reduces the complexity of the classification problem."
14,"consequently, a binary classification of bramble from surrounding native vegetation may have achieved better results than those achieved using multi-class svm."
14,the s2 imagery produced improved bramble discrimination results when compared to l8.
14,the best seasons for discriminating bramble from surrounding native vegetation were summer and spring.
14,several studies (e.g.
14,"andrew & ustin, 2008; mirik et al., 2013; somodi, čarni, ribeiro, & podobnikar, 2012) have attributed such increased discrimination capability to invasive plant species inflorescence during summer and spring."
14,"within the study area, bramble is predominantly surrounded by grassland vegetation such as wire grass (aristida purpurea), weeping lovegrass (eragrostis curvula) and common thatch grass (hyparrhenia hirta) and several other native grass species which decreases potential spectral discrimina- tion."
14,"in comparison to l8, s2’s higher spatial resolution (20 metres) reduces the mixed pixel problem."
14,"therefore, the adoption of s2 facilitated the detection and mapping of smaller bramble patches that were otherwise undetectable due to the coarser spatial resolution of l8."
14,the s2’s superior spectral resolution could be used to account for the improved classifica- tion accuracies.
14,"the red edge spectral region is widely recognized with vegetation discrim- ination (cho & skidmore, 2006)."
14,"in consistency with cho et al. (2012) and gilmore et al. (2008), optimum band analysis in this study identified s2 red edge bands to be the most influential bands across all four seasons."
14,"this discriminatory power can be attributed to the regions sensitivity to bramble’s leaf chlorophyll, leaf structure and water content (gilmore et al., 2008; shafri, salleh, & ghiyamat, 2006; sims & gamon, 2002; slaton, hunt, & smith, 2001)."
14,"unlike l8, s2 is characterized by three red edge bands, which could have contrib- uted to the improved classification accuracy."
14,"these findings are consistent with adelabu, mutanga, and adam (2014), who noted a significant reduction in classification accuracy when red edge bands were excluded from classification."
14,"bramble is known to thrive in cool and moist conditions such as riparian zones (erasmus, 1984)."
14,"in addition to the value of the red edge section in vegetation mapping, the short wave infrared (swir) reflectance has been associated with foliar water content (trombetti, riano, rubio, cheng, & ustin, 2008; yilmaz, hunt, & jackson, 2008)."
14,"the increased num- ber of s2 swir bands could explain the improved classification accuracy within the study area, as swir bands were important across all seasons."
14,numerous studies (e.g.
14,"gil et al., 2013; hauglin & ørka, 2016; kimothi & dasari, 2010) have validated the effectiveness of multispectral sensors for discriminating alien invasive species at a small scale."
14,"results from this study indicate that applicable wide swath-width, new age multispectral imagery has the potential to provide an economically viable option for invasive alien detection and mapping at a large scale."
14,"this research targeted and mapped areas that were already heavily infested by bramble, hence results are useful for implementing mitigation strategies as well as growing the knowledge base surrounding temporal and spatial patterns associated with bramble infestations."

15,conclusion the aim of this study was to determine the potential of freely available satellite imagery to discriminate and map the spatial distribution of american bramble (rubus cuneifolius) in udp.
15,"results from this study indicate that s2 imagery, characterized by more strategically positioned bands like the nir, red edge and swir bands, provides a cost effective means of determining bramble’s spatial distribution."
15,sentinel-2 outperformed l8 in discriminating and mapping bramble spatial distribution within the udp.
15,multi-season analysis of satellite imagery indicated that the optimum season for bramble detection and mapping is either spring or summer.
15,the superior performance of s2 over l8 can be attributed to its increased spectral resolution and strategically placed bands as well as its increased spatial resolution.
15,this finding promotes s2 imagery as a viable option to existing freely available wide-swath multispectral imagery for invasive species mapping.
