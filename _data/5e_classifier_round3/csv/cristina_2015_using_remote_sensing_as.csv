1,"however, monitoring an extensive maritime area is a logistical and economic challenge."
1,remote sensing is considered one of the most cost effective methods for providing the spatial and temporal keywords: environmental data that will be necessary for the effective implementation of the msfd.
1,"however, there marine strategy framework directive is still a concern about the uncertainties associated with remote sensed products."
1,this study has tested ocean colour remote sensing how a speciﬁc satellite product can contribute to the monitoring of a msfd descriptor for “good en- north-east atlantic vironmental status” (ges).
1,the results show that the quality of the remote sensing product algal pigment iberian coast indicator index 1 (api 1) from the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (meris) sensor of the european descriptor space agency for ocean colour products can be effectively validated with in situ data from three stations eutrophication off the sw iberian peninsula.
1,"the validation results show good agreement between the meris api 1 and the in situ data for the two more offshore stations, with a higher coefﬁcient of determination (r2) of 0.79, and with lower uncertainties for the average relative percentage difference (rpd) of 24.6% and 27.9% and a root mean square error (rmse) of 0.40 and 0.38 for stations b and c, respectively."
1,"near to the coast, station a has the lowest r2 of 0.63 and the highest uncertainties with an rpd of 112.9% and a rmse of 1.00."
1,it is also the station most affected by adjacency effects from the land: when the improved contrast between ocean and land processor (icol) is applied the r2 increases to 0.77 and there is a 30% reduction in the uncertainties estimated by rpd.
1,"the meris api 1 product decreases from inshore to offshore, with higher values occurring mainly between early spring and the end of the summer, and with lower values during winter."
1,"by using the satellite images for api 1, it is possible to detect and track the development of algal blooms in coastal and marine waters, demonstrating the usefulness of remote sensing for sup- porting the implementation of the msfd with respect to descriptor 5: eutrophication."
1,it is probable that remote sensing will also prove to be useful for monitoring other descriptors of the msfd.
