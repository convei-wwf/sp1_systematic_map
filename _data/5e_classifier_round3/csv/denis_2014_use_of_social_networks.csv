1,"keywords: in this context, the social networks have become essential components of the education communication on internet."

1,"focusing on earth observation and attractive education tools, planète sciences midi- pyrénées created the blog “un autre regard sur la terre” in 2010."
1,cnes included the social networks in its communication strategy since 2008. 4 years of experience allow a first evaluation of the results and the impact.
1,the two complementary approaches show that social media provides a very powerful support for communication and outreach activities during the major space events but can also enable in‐depth and educative activities.
1,the powerful dimension of the image is a very strong factor.
1,"one main challenge is to go beyond the event itself and to disseminate background messages or in-depth information, with the objective to transform the initial interest raised by social media in a long lasting curiosity or in an involvement in other type of activities, including the practice of hands-on activities by teachers in the classroom."
1,additional issues and risks related to the use of social media have been identified. – the fact that a longer experience is needed in order to perform a more comprehensive evaluation. – the issue of the “reaction speed” and the control of the value of the information by professional organisations.

10,planète sciences is thus trying to increase the synergies between the new activities on internet networks and the traditional “hands on” activities.
10,"they can leverage a wider dissemination and interest for space activities and, more gen- erally, stimulate the interest for scientific and technical matters."
10,some tricky issues and risks this section highlights some issues and risks identified by cnes and planète sciences: – the fact that a longer experience is needed in order to perform a more comprehensive evaluation. – the issue of the “reaction speed” and the control of the value of the information by professional organisations. – the issues raised by the use of social networks by employees. – the management of the e-reputation.
10,the best of all worlds?
10,"both for planète sciences and cnes, the issue of long- term impact of the presence on the social networks remains fully open: these initiatives are still very new and comprehensive evaluation actions are in progress."
10,"if social networks are now essential components of the digital communication, they also raise a number of issues."
