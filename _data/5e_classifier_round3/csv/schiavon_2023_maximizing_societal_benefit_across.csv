2,these initiatives focus on the improvement of current technologies and the development of new earth observing (eo) missions.
2,"airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have been developed such as hyperion (eo-1), prisma and its follow-on prisma-sg, enmap, copernicus hyperspectral imaging mission for the environment (chime) and lstm: copernicus land surface temperature."
2,"in addition, nasa has been devel- oping a hyperspectral satellite mission: surface biology and geology (sbg), recommended in the 2018 national academies' decadal survey (nasem, 2018)."
2,"in 2022, sbg officially became a mission after completing its architecture study considering all of the decadal survey science objectives, system concepts from the hyper- spectral infrared imager (hyspiri) precursor study from the 2007 decadal survey, as well as new advanced instrument technologies (nasem, 2018)."
2,"meanwhile, under the investments of the nprr, the italian govern- ment has planned the development of a constellation of small and medium-size satellites named iride (https:// www.asi.it/2022/12/iride-firmati-i-contratti/)."
2,"iride will be made up of a set of sub-constellations of low earth orbit satellites (upstream segment), the operational infrastructure on the ground (downstream segment) and the services intended for the italian public administration (service segment)."
2,"being based on a number of different instruments and detection technologies, the iride constellation will be one of a kind; ranging from microwave imaging (via synthetic aperture radar, sar), to optical imaging at various spatial resolutions (from high to medium resolution) and in different frequency ranges, from panchromatic, to multispectral, to hyperspectral, to infrared bands."
2,data produced by all of these satellites and their potential synergetic use offer great promise of fulfilling the needs and requirements related to the legal commitments of the community of users.
2,the application of this hyper- spectral technology can be maximized by providing a clear guide for its development for user needs.
2,increasing investment in the eo sector calls for a paradigm change.
2,"historically, technological improvement has driven the development of eo missions, leading to subsequent discoveries by the scientific research community, rather than being based upon user needs and market demand."
2,"here, we develop a complementary methodology based on the elicitation of users' operational needs and technical requirements while planning new missions and potential synergies between them."
2,collecting information on user needs provides the background for the development of crucial services for institutional and private users throughout a wide range of applications.
2,"concurrently, these services can be complemented by the development of big data, new analytics, and high-performance computing (hpc) technologies facilitating the processing and integration of huge amounts of data, such as onboard image processing systems for a hyperspectral sensor, coming from heterogeneous platforms to maximize the develop- ment and consolidation of key innovative services."
2,"understanding user requirements is critical to inform policy development toward climate change adaptation and sustainable development (buontempo et al., 2020; herold et al., 2011; national academies of sciences, 2018)."
2,"user-centric design can increase productivity, enhance quality of work, reduce support and training costs and improve user satisfaction (maguire & bevan, 2002)."
2,"to make future satellite missions sustainable and identify a portfolio of new products supporting the regulatory commitments undertaken by the european union (eu), the european commission (ec) has identified the copernicus national user forum (cuf), established in each member state of the eu, as the set of user communities in charge of expressing the needs for the copernicus program [regulation (eu) n.377/2014] (european commission, 2019)."

3,"agency (esa) commissioned italy to study user needs, operational requirements as a first study, and the value proposition of chime, based upon the unique experience of italy in the development of both downstream and upstream services in europe, recognizing the relevance of the cuf in the definition of both national downstream services and upstream eo missions such as the prisma mission, hyperspectral precursor of the applica- tion mission (https://www.asi.it/scienze-della-terra/prisma/) (taramelli et al., 2020)."
3,"this work started with the “hyperspectral imaging mission concepts” tender of 2016 and continued in 2018, 2020, and 2021."
3,"in this paper we follow the process of user requirements generation and validation utilizing the method developed by taramelli et al. (2020), in which the authors employ the copernicus national user forum as the user pool to demonstrate the potential benefit of a future copernicus hyperspectral mission, including missions such as chime."
3,"a separate specific users' needs analysis has been also carried out for the development of an operational coastal services always with the support of the italian copernicus user forum (geraldini et al., 2021)."
3,"that study provides an overview of the coastal user requirements, highlighting the need for integrated information for the management of the coastal areas, and represents the basis for defining a national coastal service (ibid) also based on upstream user requirements."
3,here we provide an analysis of users' needs for different application domains based on surveys of the italian copernicus user forum (cuf) and sbg science and applications communities.
3,our study is limited to these two communities since they are the only ones who provided a thorough and systematic inventory of requirements in terms of operational and technical needs we believe to be the first study of this sort performed prior to mission launch.
3,our aim is to identify and analyze users' needs and technical requirements to provide a baseline for the investment in services development.
3,this framework can be exploited for the planning of new eo missions and potential synergies between existing ones.

4,all sections mentioned in the framework of the data analysis can be found for reference in the results section.
4,"the requirements analyzed in this paper pertain to the use of hyperspectral eo technology and were collected in two different contexts: starting in 2016, the italian cuf elicited users' needs involving different typologies of users across several applications domains."
4,the aim of the elicitation process was to assess the potential utility of a copernicus hyper- spectral mission and later extended to several other missions such as the copernicus high priority missions.
4,an ad hoc interaction matrix was circulated among several user communities to gather preferences about hyperspectral-based products and services.
4,"in 2018, nasa initiated an architecture study for the surface biology and geology (sbg) designated observable, identified in the 2018 national academies' decadal survey entitled, “thriving on our chang- ing planet: a decadal strategy for earth observation from space.”"
4,"(herold et al., 2011)."
4,"the sbg architecture study had three objectives: (a) identify and characterize a diverse set of high value sbg observing architectures; (b) assess the performance and cost effectiveness of architectures against sbg research and applications objec- tives; (c) perform sufficient in-depth design of one or more candidate architectures to enable near-term science return (poulter et al., 2023; stavros et al., 2023)."
4,user elicitation approach cuf hyperspectral user needs were collected following the methodology developed in taramelli et al.
4,(2020).
4,"specifically, the interaction methodology includes three phases."
4,"involvement of users through the italian copernicus user forum, specifically considering the different coper- nicus application domains; 2."
4,"a pre-processing phase in which users' feedbacks on eu policy, thematic areas of interest, requirements, and technical parameters were collected by means of an interaction matrix; 3."
4,"a post-processing phase in which the assessment of results was used to match the spatial resolutions and temporal frequency required by the user communities with hyperspectral-based products and services (hyperspectral-derived algorithms, hereinafter referred to as “hyperspectral products”)."
4,an extensive review of the scientific literature about hyperspectral-derived algorithms was hence conducted to detect suitable layers for the identified user requirements.
4,"moreover, this association highlighted the number of times a particular spectral range was present in those products and services achieving user needs."
4,"users' requirements for the sbg mission were collected using a user-centered design framework to define the primary work streams for the study (culver et al., 2020)."
4,this design framework uses a four-phase methodology.
4,application area selection for detailed investigation was based upon mission science priorities as well as the potential for a broad range of end-users with duties to be fulfilled.
4,"targeted expert interviews were conducted using visual guides to demonstrate future sbg capabilities and capture insights on key user communities, their current use of satellite products, valuation indicators, and future sbg adoption potential."
4,"survey collected feedback from a larger set of users, primarily from the traditional research community, to gather more quantitative data on needs and desired sbg capabilities."
4,"valuation based upon operational requirements where there is low satisfaction with current information and improvement is needed, creating an opportunity for sbg to add value to the user."
4,"the users involved in the study were researchers and practitioners as well as intermediary product developers and service providers, with both specific technical insights and knowledge of their respective application domains."
4,the research was limited to a select set of sbg-relevant primary application areas in order to provide a detailed investigation of these sectors.
4,"focusing on the functional needs of both research and operational communities, the study included representative applications sectors: fire ecology and risk, algal blooms and water quality, agri- culture and water resources, and mineral resources (culver et al., 2020)."
4,the information obtained from the sbg user needs and valuation studies were included in the sbg community assessment report (car).

5,"a key motivation of the assessment and the car is to expand the breadth and types of non-research uses and users beyond traditional, known, or assumed ones."
5,the assessment spans both the technical aspects and organizational characteristics of user communities.
5,the car captures information on application opportunities and is intended to help a flight project team become aware of a mission's potential applications value and key “desirements” (a term for unfunded requirements coined by the late esd director michael freilich) for user communities that need to realize that value.
5,"the car is intended to inform system architecture options, design considerations, trade-off decisions, and the overall mission concept (lee et al., 2022; luvall et al., 2022) details the first instance of a nasa mission's integration from the perspective of science applications into mission design at the architecture study phase."
5,"users from the cuf expressed needs across all the copernicus domains which include the following domains: land cover and land use: agriculture/food security, coast and marine monitoring, emergency services, ground motion, hydro-meteorology climate service, inland and coastal water, security, air quality."
5,"the sbg community focused on six specific applications: terrestrial ecosystems, hydrology/terrestrial, aquatic ecosystems, terres- trial/weather, active surface geology, general applications (culver et al., 2020)."
5,the study targeted a diverse and representative set of user types across the value chain for each of the application areas.
5,"for each application area, requirements included a general assessment of users' most desired eo spectral imaging capabilities, sbg fit with needs, user community adoption maturity, and the areas where future sbg data could provide the most improvement to the sector, that is, its most promising uses (lee et al., 2022)."
5,"challenges of the comparative analysis because the two studies were independent one from another, the data needed to be normalized to make the comparison and analysis possible."
5,"while similar information was reported by both user communities, the two sets of data were divergent in many aspects and therefore homogenization and association between requirements was required before the analysis could be performed."
5,the main issue has been to identify the thematic area to which users' needs belong.
5,"in fact, the two different surveys did not adopt the same semantics."
5,"the sbg user needs and valuation study, hereinafter sbg users' study, are organized as answers to data scientist interview questions, according to focus science topics (i.e., ecosystem traits and biodiversity - terrestrial) that are included in application focus group (i.e., agriculture)."
5,"the feedback by the cuf institutional user communities, have been collected as users' needs based on applica- tion domains (i.e., agriculture/food security) identified by eu environmental legislation and regulation frame- work (taramelli et al., 2020)."
5,"after identifying analogous thematic areas (i.e., agriculture = agriculture/food security), users' needs, expressed by each community were matched, combining the application concept and the decision approach."
5,"to facilitate the association between needs, it was essential to recognize the parameters that the communities want to detected and be measured by the hyperspectral sensor."
5,"each users' need has an identification code, one type for the cuf study and another for the sbg study, as reported in the example in table 2."
5,"descriptive statistics and comparative analysis once cuf and us surveys were matched, requirements were elaborated under a common data set with the same taxonomy featuring information on."
5,application domain: this entry identifies the theme under which each domain is classified.
5,it allows to provide conclusions and elaborating results for a specific sector and selection on users.
5,"the domains included in this study are: agriculture/food security, coast and marine monitoring, emergency services, ground motion, hydro-meteorology climate service, ecosystem structure/composition (biodiversity), air quality, security, water resources: inland/coastal water and environment."
5,"it should be noted that the sbg users study did not strictly classify requirements under the categories of “security” management, intended as national security, border protection and surveillance, maritime surveillance, and “ground motion.”"

6,requirement description: a brief description of the requirement identified by different users.
6,thematic area: within each domain a further specification of the application for each requirement.
6,"for example, the domain of agriculture comprises several different areas of application such as the monitoring of water quality, soil quality or the heterogeneity of the landscape."
6,"parameters/variables: the geophysical parameters, derived to a unit of measure, with which each requirement is monitored."
6,available layer: hyperspectral layer or algorithm available according to the needs of users and their require- ments in terms of the different spectral bands.
6,spectral range: spectral range identified as useful to fulfill the requirements.
6,"national and international legislation: laws, regulations or directives that are fulfilled by the requirement expressed by users."
6,number of users interested in the requirement: sum of all the users that express interest in a particular requirement.
6,"user class/type: classification of users according to their nature, such as academic users, small and medium enterprises (smes), environmental protection agencies, etc."
6,expected spatial resolution and expected revisit time: the technical resolutions (spatial resolution and tempo- ral frequency) desired by users to monitor the requirements that they identified in previous cells.
6,table 2 exemplifies how the user requirements are organized for the elaboration of data in the study and each table entry is an example of the variables described above.
6,"specifically, the example shows that for character- izing crop status and phenology (“requirement description”), which is a requirement of the habitat and birds directive (“national and international regulations”) users need active radiation (fapar) and chlorophyll a + b (cab) indexes extraction (“parameters/variables”) which are currently available through three specific products (“available layer”) using the visible and near-infrared range of the spectrum (“spectral range”)."
6,users for this requirement need a spatial resolution of 1–4 m with an expected revisit time of 1 month.
6,this requirement is needed by five users classified as state and local government authorities.
6,first descriptive statistics were performed across all the domains in order to understand patterns among the data and provide a description of the needs of the two communities.
6,"the statistics performed include the distribution of requirements for both countries, in particular the analysis was divided into three sections concerning users, requirements and technical specifications."
6,users' distribution was calculated according to each domain and by community type on a percentage base.
6,"in addition, users were divided according to their typologies: this taxon- omy included a wide range of users, from private companies to public authorities to academic users and univer- sities."
6,descriptive statistics for the users' requirements also allow to show similarities and differences for the two community of users.
6,"finally, technical resolutions were mapped according to users' preferences in terms of spatial resolution, temporal frequency and spectral resolution."
6,"since the matrix did not provide a predetermined range of choices, each user identified the preferred resolution, and therefore, the data set has a great variability."
6,"variables were thus normal- ized according to qualitative ranges reported in table 3 and derived from the official classification of coperni- cus eo missions; the adopted legend for the geometry resolution is based on the requirements for copernicus contributing mission data, which are classified primarily by sensor type (sar or optical) but also by geome- try resolution, as well as reported in the technical note “copernicus space component data access portfolio: data warehouse 2023” prepared by esa (esa, 2023) and regularly used for dissemination to user communities with less in-depth technical knowledge (tapete & cigna, 2018)."
6,"first preferences about spectral resolution were mapped for each application domain, further we assessed cumulative users' preference for spatial resolution and revisit time in order to understand if the improvement in resolution justifies investment according to users' needs."
6,"further, users' preferences concerning spatial resolution and temporal frequency were combined to assess if any current mission is able to fulfill the required need."
6,"gap analysis: assessment of users' needs versus hyperspectral technical requirements finally, users' requirements were assessed against the existing hyperspectral technology, including all present and planned hyperspectral missions as detailed in table 1 and potential gaps were highlighted."

7,"the follow- ing phase focused on the characterization of users, particularly the identification of similarities and differences between the cuf and sbg communities."
7,"according to the users' self-classification (figures 2 and 3), the sbg community is mainly dominated by users interested in ecosystem structure/composition and emergency services (30% and 32%, respectively) (figure 2)."
7,"we note that users can express interest and suggest requirements for more than one domain, yet few users expressed interest for the air quality monitoring or hydro-meteorology climate services, both of which are priority applications for the atmosphere observing system mission (nasem, 2018)."
7,"conversely, the users for the cuf community are more evenly distributed across domains, with similar percent- ages for all the applications proposed in the study (figure 2); this is partly due to the fact that the italian survey included two additional domains, namely ground motion and security monitoring and because of the fact that schiavon et al. 7 of 19"

8,among this distribution a expected monthly revisit time further analysis has been performed to assess which type of users are interested in the different services.
8,"first, it should be noted that most of the sbg users involved in the study are national authorities (figure 3), specifically, 45%."
8,"among the italian community the largest user group are regional environmental protec- resolution expected tion agencies (70%), arpa (agenzia regionale per la protezione ambientale—regional environmental spatial 1–4 m protection agency), that in italy operate in every region with a specific mandate and relative autonomy."
8,"the data represents users' preferences concerning a specific requirement including information on spectral range, type of variables needed, spatial resolution and revisit time."
8,"while for the sbg community a great variety of users is involved, the cuf community of hyperspectral users is mainly composed of institutional authorities because of the collection process and the environment government user class/type state and local pertaining to the copernicus user forum, further explained in the next section."
8,"relatively small number of regional authorities and, most importantly, the private sector is only represented in the sbg community in very small percentage of the total users while most of the users' typology are private or public organization, an exception is made for so-called “experts” present in both users' pools."
8,"these users are indeed individuals who have a significant scientific expertise in the field of eo hyperspectral technology, downstream and requirement interested number of users upstream services."

8,"from the first elaboration reported in figure 4, it can be also observed that, while requirements collected within the cuf are more evenly distributed across domains, sbg users are more interested in requirements related to water resources, biodiversity monitoring and emergency service."
8,"on the other hand, the data set does not present requirements pertaining to the security and ground motion domain from the sbg side."
8,"this limitation is mainly due to the type of users involved in the study, since in vis-nir spectral the sbg users study these two areas were not covered."
8,"despite this partial bias, important considerations range can be made on the common requirements."
8,"naturally, given the geography of the area, cuf users present vis vis an interest for coastal and marine monitoring and for security issues related in particular to border patrol, where eo data can play a pivotal role."

8,"most of these requirements apply to applications related to land cover land use monitoring, for agriculture and ecosystem assessment."
8,"while also coastal monitoring and emergency active radiation (fapar) a + b (cab) indexes parameters/variable services feature several common needs identified by users, hydro-meteorology climate services and water and chlorophyll extraction resource monitoring services do not have several requirements in common."
8,"technical resolution looking more in detail at the technical requirements expressed by users, it is possible to analyze the pref- erences concerning the spectral ranges per each domain."
8,"in figure 5 for each requirement, each user has identified the spectral range most useful to develop relevant products and services, and results have been monitoring habitat heterogeneity and habitat aggregated by each domain."
8,"thematic area example of the data available in the interaction matrix quality looking at the single application domains from figure 5, it appears that the full spectrum is required particu- larly for the monitoring of emergency services, ground motion, water resources: inland/coastal water and environment and monitoring of land cover and use: agriculture/food security."
8,"nevertheless, most require- ments would be already fulfilled by the full range of the infrared spectrum (vis + nir + swir)."
8,it should characteriztion be pointed out that the security domain is not present in this figure since the community has not provided phenology requirements status and description crop requirements concerning its technical specification: this limitation is caused by the sensitive nature of the information handled by the service and for limitations connected to national security.

9,results concerning spatial resolution show significant preference for high to very high spatial resolutions which involves a trade off with the area of interest the satellite can acquire data on.

9,in this context the syner- getic use of chime and sbg missions would add a significant 9% of additional requirements by potentially improving the revisit time to 1 week.

11,the figure describes the choices of users concerning the spectral ranges preferred for each application domain. derived from spectral imaging to efficiently orient the development of new satellite missions and for the planning of potential synergies between them.
11,"the type of investigation presented here will serve as an input for the devel- opment of new technology and also to develop policy in a direction that satisfies users' needs in the long term (european commission, 2019)."
11,"in italy in the framework of the national recovery and resilience plan (pnrr) funding, the user communities' feedback is the base leading design of the candidate constellation architectural and deployment solutions and the development of the concepts for the marketplace, its components, characteristics, and services."
11,this study has taken into consideration two main user communities: the italian copernicus users forum and poten- tial users of the nasa surface biology and geology (sbg) mission and elicited their needs for hyperspectral eo products.
11,the goal is to create a solid ground for the determination of the synergetic use of hyperspectral missions and to provide input for investment in the definition of key downstream services according to their current maturity.
11,"in this study thus, we indicate which services should be prioritized given both their advancement and potential value to users, and we highlight the potential additional benefits of the synergic use of hyperspectral missions."
11,an important aspect concerns the type of users for each potential service in order to address them as stakehold- ers and target groups for developing and improving specific products and components.
11,"while the community of italian users is mainly composed of institutional users because of the structure and governance of the copernicus national user forum (european commission, 2013), namely environmental protection agencies, national author- ities and scientific experts, the sbg community includes a variety of new users across all domains in addition to national authorities."
11,"understanding the national and local government is crucial for the development of a govern- ance model for the exploitation of hyperspectral eo data, with the possibility to create anchor tenancies pushing further development and investment in the private sector."
11,"most of the results in this first section follow traditional applications for hyperspectral technology, in particular, the sbg community has an important interest in services related to ecosystem structure/composition (biodiver- sity) monitoring and emergency services since 30% and 32% of users respectively operate in this field."
11,"these domains features many users as well as many requirements: therefore, it appears that users' needs are very specific to stakeholders and that only few users are interested in a certain service in other words, one requirement satis- fies a relatively limited number of users."
11,similar considerations can also be made for the domains of emergency services for which several users are featured.
11,"the cuf community instead has expressed interest more evenly across domains, it should be noted that the community of cuf users also expressed interest for the domains of ground motion and security monitoring which was not included in the study of the sbg community: this additional information does not exclude the importance of this domain for one community but provides input for potential service development."
11,"nevertheless, the distribution of requirements does not necessarily provide an indication of the importance of one domain compared to another as some requirements could be more important than others for certain users."

14,"the figure highlights the most frequent technical requirements in terms of spatial resolution, revisit time, and spectral ranges information combined."
14,five most frequent associations between spatial and temporal resolution are analyzed given the distribution of preferences on spectral ranges. because of the ability to provide data also in cloudy conditions.
14,the request for sub-daily frequency updates poses more of a challenge because of limited area coverage and because only geostationary satellites at the moment are able to provide such a frequent revisit time but at much lower spatial resolutions.
14,users nevertheless might benefit from model-based products specifically for coastal emergencies and weather-related events.
14,"concerning the specific requests of users, very high resolutions, under 1 m, cannot be fulfilled given the current specifications of eo products, regardless of the spectral resolution required."
14,"in addition, us government optical satellite sensors are limited to 10 m or greater spatial resolution so as not to compete with private sector satellites, nevertheless not all these products are mature (cheng & han, 2016)."
14,"despite this limitation the current offer of satellite products is already able to satisfy a consistent portion of users' needs, given that most satellites are able to provide a resolution of around 30 m."
14,given these observations it should be noted that the high resolution will probably be covered by a new set of constellations under devel- opment in italy.
14,"several requests could be satisfied by the new constellation of constellations iride which will feature a hyperspectral sensor and that will provide high spatial resolutions for the vis, nir and swir bands of the spectrum."
14,"another consideration should be made on the request for daily revisit time, particularly important for emergency services where this feature will mainly be available for security and emergency related activities targeted for specific institutional users."
14,"to improve this limitation, it is crucial to work on missions' synergies in order to prioritize higher temporal frequencies for the data."
14,"temporal frequency: preferences on temporal frequency show that, although daily revisit time is the preferred option for users, a synergy between chime and sbg could increase revisit time up to 1 week, satisfying10% additional users' requirements compared to the current offer of hyperspectral data (figure 6a)."
14,daily revisit time will in fact be covered only from the private offer of satellites and from missions that operate on a regional rather than global basis.
14,"although the prisma satellite features a weekly time frequency, it is still a demon- strator project, a precursor phase of the future generation hyperspectral missions that is primarily intended for research and development of earth observation applications and does not provide data systematically to the user community."
14,"despite the fact that some gaps remain, the results show that around 40% of users' requirements are currently fulfilled by existing or planned hyperspectral missions (table 4) at least in terms of spatial resolution and revisit time."
14,"these requirements are mainly pertaining to the domains of land cover and land use for agriculture, water resources and coastal and marine management and monitoring, in fact, hyperspectral sensors have a value added in the above-mentioned services."
14,"given this baseline, it appears that there is room for the development of syner- gies between different missions specifically for the improvement of the offer on revisit times and spectral ranges: specifically, considerations should be made on the improvement of capacities for the thermal infrared range of the spectrum in terms of spatial resolution and on the potential improvement of temporal frequencies for the other bands."
14,"given the analysis of users' requirements that was performed, users have a strong interest in higher spatial and temporal resolution across all the spectrum."
14,"limitations however exist in the current offer of hyperspectral eo data, since, fine spatial resolution is not yet available."
14,"in addition, trade-offs exist between single missions' revisit time, spatial coverage, and resolution (ferringer & spencer, 2012)."

16,scientific and operational needs motivate more spatial coverage and more rapid revisit time than any one agency's observing system can provide.
16,"in addition, sbg and chime coordination could provide more global coverage spectroscopic observing systems."
16,"nevertheless, this synergy is influenced by the different technical specifications of the two missions such as number and type of ground stations, orbit definition and most importantly coordination around revisit time."
16,in this context interactions between the sbg and chime scientific communities have been carried out during the 6–10 march 2023 workshop hosted in italy at esa—esrin headquarter.
16,"the two teams discussed together the future steps toward harmonization of data products and practices, open science elements, products calibration and validation to provide extended global scale operational imaging spectroscopy observations."
16,the workshop aim was to develop a roadmap for joint chime-sbg activities to realize instrument agnostic algorithms and data products and to identify together test cases to evaluate level 2 algorithms performances in common application domains.
16,during the workshop the candidate algorithms and priority products were widely discussed considering different application domains and the technical and operational requirements to have synergies in biophysical and geophysical variables readiness.
16,esa chime hyperspectral performances and synergies with the sbg vswir instrument were consolidated also by harmonizing the language for the thematic areas considered a priority for each of the two missions.
16,"the two missions are in fact considering a list of products that are partially overlapping and partially complementary, opening a wider portfolio of products and services related to the missions."
16,it is also expected that users will benefit from blended variables coming from multiple sensors and ancillary data.
16,the interaction of the two groups is creating a vision for the engagement and impact on a greater community of users.
16,coordination on calibration/validation and data quality activities is also crucial when data from different satellites are used by users worldwide in a complementary and synergetic manner.
16,the identification of such large community of users will facilitate the cross-calibration and validation goals and improve interoperability and accuracy of products.
16,"future effort by the two groups will harmonize terminology and protocols for meas- urements, agreeing that calibration and validation measurements should be independent from the bio-geophysical retrieval process to allow independent verification."
16,"by joining together, the two communities, more than 500 individual users and 309 organizations have been surveyed who provided more than 270 requirements spanning nine different application domains."
16,this process will allow for more shared resources and a community around which new products can be evaluated.
16,"given the findings of this work and the future objectives of this research, some key messages are highlighted."
16,new generation of missions may be able to tackle the needs of users especially in terms of high spatial reso- lution and expansion of the tir range of the spectrum.
16,currently gaps can be filled by chime-sbg coordination increasing the value of key services and applica- tions by improving temporal revisit and expanding the spectrum to the thermal infrared range.
16,"shared community and resources can facilitate the improvement of products from these missions and their use across different communities: an opportunity exists to double societal benefit through coordination, but this needs to be realized over time and by collaborating on precursor data sets 4."
16,"although new missions could significantly improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral data and products, tradeoff would limit the geographical coverage of such data."
16,"in this context it should be highlighted the different nature of missions such as chime, sbg, and prisma and the low earth orbit (leo) iride constellation."
16,"while leo satellites require the lowest amount of energy for their placement, they also provide high bandwidth and low communication latency."
16,"unlike geosynchronous satellite, satellites in leo have a small field of view and so can observe and communicate with only a fraction of the earth at a time and therefore a constellation of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage."
16,"missions like iride, because of their leo specification will also suffer from fast orbital decay and require either periodic re-boosting to maintain a stable orbit or launching replacement satellites when old ones re-enter (sebestyen et al., 2018)."
16,these elements naturally influence the cost of the mission and their planning.
16,"thus, it is advocated that these challenges can be met by a multi-mission and multi-agency synergetic approach, rather than by any single observing system (boccia et al., 2021)."
16,"concerning users' need for tir acquisitions, infrared imaging spectroscopy radiometers, operating from the international space station such as ecostress (fisher et al., 2020) will contribute to filling this gap for a wide variety of applications."

17,"in this context precursor missions such as prisma (hyperspectral precursor of the application mission) (sacchetti et al., 2010) will also be critical to build a community of practice in parallel with mission development for users to be ready once mission data become available."
17,conclusions this study has engaged diverse communities of users from different domains and geographic regions with the aim to understand the evolution of specific services through the use of hyperspectral eo technology.
17,the results that have been obtained can be used as a baseline not only for the development and improvement of downstream applications and services but also for the definition of potential synergies in the upstream component between existing and planned hyperspectral missions.
17,"although users' needs vary between geographical regions, it is possible to identify similarities for the develop- ment of coherent observation strategies and for the development of user-based services."
17,"in particular, the ecosys- tem and agriculture services are crucial both in terms of the interest by the sector and the current gaps that users have highlighted."
17,"while this does not mean that these services are more important than others it provides decision makers with the possibility to prioritize investment over time through the eo chain, in its upstream, midstream and downstream components."
17,"while the planned hyperspectral missions featured in this study already promise good coverage for the needs expressed by users, there is indeed an opportunity to improve or adjust the offer of products and services by pushing further technical specifications in the tir range of the spectrum which is particularly useful for the land cover, ground motion and emergency management services."
17,"while this study does not have the main aim to propose technical solutions for the upstream component nor to give suggestions regarding the architectural design of specific eo missions and their synergetic use, it is worth mentioning the opportunities that could arise from such an investigation."
17,"specifically, we see potential in the synergetic use of hyperspectral sensors to improve the temporal resolution of products and extend the potential of the thermal infrared range of the spectrum."
17,"finally, this study features some limitations that should be highlighted."
17,first the fact that the two user needs stud- ies were conducted independently posed some challenges when interpreting the results and identifying a common taxonomy that provided ground for comparison.
17,"in addition, this study is limited by the lack of data provided by other national communities and future studies would benefit from the inclusion of requirements from other nations through the engagement of national user fora and other formal collection methods in non-european states."
17,"while these data are not currently available, this study represents an incentive for their development."
17,"second, the gap analysis between users' requirements and current offer of eo hyperspectral products takes into consideration only some technical specification which are not exhaustive but only provide a first input that should be supported by further studies."
17,"data availability statement the users' derived data used for the elicitation of user requirements and needs in the study are available at zenodo. org through the repository by the title “maximizing societal benefit across multiple hyperspectral earth obser- vation missions: a user needs approach—data and codes” via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8415780 with license cc by 4.0, and open access conditions (schiavon, 2023)."
17,"to preserve the privacy of stakeholders that took part in this study, the responses to the questionnaire are available only in an anonymous format."
17,"data has been processed using the r statistical software (rstudio team, 2022), the script used for processing the data in this study are also available in the above-mentioned repository."
