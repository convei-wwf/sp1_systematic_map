2,the improvements of drone technol- ogy will help to make drone use even more competitive in the future.
2,"introduction with their luxuriant growth in tropical and subtropical latitudes along the land-sea interface, bays, estuaries, lagoons and backwaters [1], mangroves provide important ecosystem services, ranging from coastal protection to fisheries production, ecotourism, phytoremediation, carbon sequestration, and other services [2–4]."
2,"the value of mangroves were estimated to be between 4,185 and 50,349 usd per km2 [5], with a major part of these coming from indirect services [6]."
2,"because of the less-valued direct services like firewood, timber and honey [6], mangrove ecosystems are often unappreciated or underestimated [7,8], resulting in conversion into set- tlements, agriculture, and aquaculture areas in many parts of the world [9–11]."
2,"in light of the decreasing mangrove cover and subsequent consequences [2,12–14], the world’s remaining mangroves need appropriate conservation and management, for which accurate and updated information is necessary [15]."
2,"remote sensing is indispensable for mangrove research due to its time saving and cost- effective nature compensating for the fieldwork, which is difficult to carry out, especially in areas of low accessibility [11,15–18]."
2,"regular monitoring/mapping of the mangroves based on remote sensing can provide authentic information (along with spatial-temporal dynamics) that is needed for better management [19,20]."
2,"in addition, past and present vegetation maps are useful to reconstruct past events and predict future development scenarios [21–23]."
2,"to date, both satellite images and airplane-based aerial photographs have been used for mangrove mapping [17,19,21,23–26]."
2,"various types of satellite images–obtained from very low- to very high-resolution (vhr) sensors, have been used in relation to the scientific targets, including estimation of global mangrove cover [27,28] and regional/local species’ level distribution [29– 31]."
2,while some low- to moderate-resolution satellite data (e.g.
2,"landsat, sentinel) have still been available for free [28], the vhr images are expensive, and researchers using them are often constrained by their budget [11,32]."
2,"in addition, availability of cloud-free satellite images for mangrove mapping is a known difficulty [15,33]."
2,"unlike satellite imagery, aerial photos are not challenged by cloud cover because their acquisition (aircraft flight) time can be adjusted to local weather conditions [34]."
2,"their spatial resolution ranges from submeter to meter to centimeter level, depending on the flight altitude [15,34,35]."
2,"aerial photos have probably been the only source of image documentation prior to satellite technology for identifying the past land-use/cover, and to date still produce imagery with the best spatial resolution for retrospective studies [36–38]."
2,"the significance and useful- ness of archived and recently taken aerial photographs for genus to species level classification of the mangroves is evident from diverse publications [15,21,39]."
2,the main limitation of an aircraft’s aerial photography for vegetation mapping is its high operational cost [15].
2,"however, this situation is changing, with the revolutionary mode of data acquisition through unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) or drones, which are not only reduc- ing the cost of aerial photography, but also the cost of equipment, due to the production of updated models in the market [34]."
2,"besides having higher spatial resolution [40,41], the sequential drone images can provide point-cloud 3d views to estimate tree height and crown diameter [42,43]."

3,"being one of the first attempts in scientific literature to apply a drone for mangrove species’ mapping, our objective was not only to identify the potential of drone technology for mangrove research, but also to compare both drone and satellite imagery in terms of image quality (i.e. spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolution), efficiency (i.e. coverage area, data acquisition/process- ing time and user-cost), and land-use/cover (i.e. object- and pixel-based) classification accuracy."

4,"besides the known spectral range of the cmos sensor (i.e. 350–1100nm) [57], both rgb and ir cameras were tested again in the laboratory of photonics research at the vrije univer- siteit brussel using spectro 320 of the instrument systems and image j software [58]."
4,"as the cmos sensor has no specific spectral range for individual rgb bands, we considered the rgb values of each pixel as its band values."
4,"the ir camera was adjusted to take pictures through a fastest time lapse interval of 5s at 2.5m/s flying speed, while the rgb camera was adjusted for 2s at 4m/s flying speed."

6,"this multispectral image, covering 100km2, was first pan-sharpened in qgis (via ratio component substitution (rcs) algorithm), and then cropped to generate the same mangrove coverage area as that of the drone imagery for comparison of the results."
6,region of interest (roi) creation.
6,the rois for land cover training sites and classifica- tion accuracy assessment were generated based on the ground-truthing data (using semi- automatic classification plugin (scp) in qgis) [63].
6,"three roi groups—one for pleiades, and two for drone image—were considered for the classification."
6,"while two roi groups—one meant for pleiades and another meant for the drone, contained the same number of (domi- nant) land-cover classes, the third roi group of drone images has extra classes representing other visible (non-dominant) features on the ground."
6,"according to mather (2004) [64], the number of pixels per land-use/cover class selected for training sites must be at least 30 times the spectral dimension."
6,"therefore, we selected 360 pixels per class in pleiades."
6,"however, in the case of higher resolution drone data, each corresponding class was represented by 36,000 pix- els."
6,all training sites were then separated into 20 polygons of the same size in both images.
6,"by random selection, 50% of the polygons in each class were selected as training sites."
6,the remaining 50% unselected polygons were used for accuracy assessment.
6,"this random selection was repeated to create at least five paired roi sets (named after 1a-1b to 5a-5b as shown in fig 2), resulting in ten iterations of cross validation."
6,"[65,66]."
6,object-based classification.
6,"both the pleiades and drone images were segmented by large-scale mean-shift classification (lsmc) region growing algorithm [67,68] in qgis (orfeo toolbox)."
6,"the vector segments were classified based on opengis simple features refer- ence implementation (ogr) classifier with a support vector machine (svm) algorithm, as well as a manual rule-set (man) classification."
6,"while ogr is a free automatic (aut) applica- tion to run the classification [67], the man is based on signature details and spectral distances, together with visual interpretation."
6,"the man was applied to assign a class for each object/seg- ment, and produced the classification."
6,"with the aut, both pleiades and drone images were classified ten times by each roi set, but only once using the man (fig 2)."
6,the classified images were exported into raster files for accuracy assessment.
6,pixel-based classification.
6,pixel-based classification was carried out in scp qgis using the roi training sites.

7,"comparison of satellite and drone imagery for mangrove mapping field data were superimposed on the drone imagery, and visually checked for authenticity of the training sites."
7,"after the classification attempts using three algorithms i.e., minimum dis- tance, spectral angle mapping (sam), and maximum likelihood (mli), the results obtained from sam and mli were found to be appropriate for this study [63,69]."
7,"both pleiades and drone images were classified ten times by each roi set under the mli and the sam classifica- tion scenarios (fig 2), and exported for accuracy assessment."
7,accuracy assessment.
7,accuracy analysis in the form of an error matrix was generated by comparing the classified (object- and pixel-based) images against the paired rois as cross vali- dation (using scp qgis).
7,"for instance, the image classified by roi 1a was validated by roi 1b and vice versa (fig 2) [65,66]."
7,"based on this error matrix, overall accuracy (oa) and kappa index were derived for the entire classification of each image; and specific producer accuracy (spa) and specific user accuracy (sua) for each land-cover class [63,69]."
7,"the error matrix was also incorporated into the pontius matrix to estimate ‘quantity’, ‘exchange’ and ‘shift’ parame- ters for identifying the source of classification error [70,71]."
7,"while ‘quantity’ (%) represents the amount of pixels that differed between training sites and classification per class, ‘exchange’ (%) shows the allocated error by the number of pixels that interchanged between two classes, and ‘shift’ (%) denotes the other allocation differences that were not included in the quantity and exchange differences [71]."
7,"results comparison the capability of pleiades-1b and dji-phantom-2 was evaluated through their image quality in terms of spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolution; efficiency in terms of area coverage, data acquisition/processing time and user-cost, and accuracy in terms of object- and pixel-based classification approaches."
7,"results of the accuracy assessment (i.e., oa, kappa, spa, sua and pontius matrix—quantity, exchange and shift) were represented by boxplots using the r-studio [72]."
7,statistical variations among the classification accuracies and approaches were identified through kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney tests using past v.3.14 software [73].

9,visual representation of the spatial coverage of pleiades-1b and dji-phantom-2 drone data sets.
9,"while new tasking/purchasing order of pleiades images requires at least 100km2 coverage, the archived data of each image is available for a minimum of 25 km2."
9,a drone is expected to work efficiently (if it does not crash or have technical problems) for 500 flights.
9,"if an efficient drone flight for 15 min (corresponding to average battery run-time) can cover approximately 0.1 km2, the total drone flights would be able to cover ca. 50 km2."
9,"however, with an improved battery run-time of up to 20 min these days, the same drone can deliver aerial photos of an area covering up to 75 km2 (box dimensions are arbitrary, and the colours are for visualization purposes only). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200288.g004 1.81km2), which is more expensive than the pleiades-1b satellite data (17.5usd per km2)."
9,"the pleiades data is still economical, even after adding the cost of present fieldwork expenses (22.5usd per km2)."
9,"although each of our 15 minutes drone flights, corresponding to the aver- age battery run-time at a given speed/altitude, typically covered 0.12km2, the parallax cropping reduced it to 0.09–0.11km2 (fig 4)."
9,image acquisition and processing time.
9,"under emergency conditions, the pleiades satel- lite data is available to the user within 24 hours."
9,drone aerial photos can also be acquired daily under favourable weather conditions.
9,"the mangrove area of 0.12km2 chosen for the present mapping study was represented by 2,800 and 12mb sizes of drone and pleiades images respec- tively."
9,"due to the large data size of the drone image (ca. 230 times greater than satellite data), its processing time—especially in the case of pixel-based classification, was found to be ten times greater than the satellite image (table 3)."
9,"meanwhile, segmentation process in the object-based classification has greatly reduced the drone imagery size (from 2,800 into 194mb) as well as the processing time."
9,data classification land-cover categories.
9,"based on the visual interpretation and the ground-truthing, it was possible to distinguish six dominant (i.e. water, land, non-mangrove casuarina equisetifolia, and mangrove species a. alba, n. fruticans and r. apiculata) and four non-dominant (b. cylin- drica, l. racemosa, s. alba and dead trees) land-cover classes at setiu."
9,"r. apiculata and a. alba spectral signatures show relatively high homogeneity, while the n. fruticans signature shows the highest heterogeneity."
9,"while the dominant classes are visually clear in both pleiades and drone images, the non-dominant classes are best observed in the drone imagery (fig 5)."

10,"for the object-based classification, the man algorithm provided more accurate results than aut (fig 6), whereas for the pixel-based classification, mli was more competent than sam (fig 7)."
10,the drone image classified through man for six dominant land-cover classes (d6oman) provided a higher oa (94.0±0.5%) in contrast to the pleiades (s6oman: 72.2 ±2.7%) or the drone with ten classes (d10oman: 69.7±1.2%) (table 4 & fig 8).
10,"in addition, in the case of pixel-based classification, the drone image classified through mli for dominant land-cover classes (d6pmli) provided good accuracy (90.0±1.9%) as compared to the pleiades (s6pmli: 82.8±3.5%) or the drone with ten classes (d10pmli: 77.6±1.3%) (table 4 & fig 8)."
10,"both aut (for object-based classification) and sam (for pixel-based classification) algo- rithms provided low (d10psam: 51.8±1.6%) to moderate accuracy maps (d10oaut: 65.8 ±3.4%; s6oaut: 70.8±8.1%; d6psam: 72.0±1.9%; s6psam: 73.3±5.1%), except for the drone imagery that was classified through aut for dominant classes (d6oaut: 78.4±5.3%) (table 4 & fig 8)."

11,"due to the poor demarcation of some features in the pleiades, only 1–6 land-cover classes were considered for its image classification."
11,"(b) locations of the ten (1–10) land-use/cover classes marked on the pleiades-1b (top) and dji-phantom-2 drone (bottom) images. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200288.g005 s6oman, d10oman), the mli showed rather high oa, kappa, spa and sua values (d10pmli, d6pmli, s6pmli) (fig 8)."
11,"among others, the higher threshold values of oa and kappa were confined only to the drone image classified through the man (d6oman) and mli (d6pmli) algorithms."
11,"overall, the statistical variations among these classification accura- cies and approaches were found to be significant (s1 part 1) in terms of the classification errors, identified from the first three highest oa observed land-cover maps (fig 9), the drone image subjected to object-based classification through man for dominant classes (d6oman) showed an overestimation of r. apiculata and a. alba."
11,"in the case of pixel-based classification, both drone and satellite images classified through mli for dominant classes (d6pmli and s6pmli) had their classification errors spreading among the various vegetation classes."
11,discussion image quality the potential of drone imagery over space-borne imagery for mangrove species-level mapping was evident from this study.
11,"however, pleiades (and also other space-borne data) has the advantage of having a better spectral resolution—useful for indicating health and biomass of the vegetation [15,17], which is not available for the drones using a normal rgb camera (table 2)."
11,"since the sj4000 camera used in this study was fixed with auto-exposure, the conver- sion of digital numbers into calibrated radiance values was not feasible [75]."
11,"therefore, some of the image processing techniques like image overlay analysis or batch-wise classification, applicable to satellite data, are not supported."
11,"while having experience with visual interpreta- tion of remotely sensed imagery [36], and despite not having applied this technique in the present paper, we believe that drone imagery offers an entirely new and promising suite of plos one | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200288 july 18, 2018 11 / 22"

12,"this is evidenced by the superior quality of drone imagery (figs 3 and 5) and the possible application in studies that do not aim at mapping, but rather at pinpointing species or individuals of interest, for instance to recognise invasive species [24] or cryptic ecological degradation [22], to identify tree-top or branch die-off [76] or to quantify biomass loss resulting from tree fall or lightning strikes [77]."
12,"according to tucker (1980) [78], there was only a 2–3% (insignificant) improvement of radiometric resolution in between 6, 8 and 9-bit data of the landsat."
12,"though a higher radio- metric resolution (e.g. 12-bit) that comes with the vhr data is useful for mapping the shaded areas (e.g. shaded mountain flanks) [79], it seems less advantageous for mangroves."
12,"despite the daily availability of pleiades images, the cloud cover (including its shade) in tropical coastal areas reduces the image quality and makes the images unsuitable for mangrove research [15,33]."
12,"although there was no such limitation for drone aerial photos, weather conditions without rain and storm risks are mandatory."
12,"despite the fact that some wild and trained birds of prey are known to attack drones [80,81], we did not face such problems."
12,"although some wild birds were flying around during the fieldwork, they tended to avoid the drone."
12,perhaps the development of waterproof drones in the near future can enhance the window time for drone imagery [82].
12,"based on our field experience, the good quality drone aerial pho- tos for mangroves, without sun gleam resulting from water reflection, can be obtained when the sun’s angle is less than 20˚ from the horizon (i.e., 1 hour after sunrise or 1 hour before sun- set)."
12,"in this context, sunny days during times of low tide (without tidal inundation below the canopy) and cloudy days (as the sun’s glare is prevented) are also useful."

15,"comparison of satellite and drone imagery for mangrove mapping data efficiency archived data of the pleiades (available for min. 25km2 purchase) are economical, but cloud- free images for some locations like setiu wetland were scarce."
15,"on the other hand, new tasking for these satellite images is expensive due to the requirement of a minimum 100km2 (23usd per km2) purchasing order (fig 4)."
15,there are low cost drones like the quanum nova (ca.
15,275usd) or homemade do-it-yourself (ca.
15,"100usd), but their image quality is compromised [83]."
15,"theoretically, a drone is expected to work efficiently if the battery–which can last up to 300 recharging cycles (dji, 2014)—is in good condition, or until the instrument crashes or suf- fers technical problems."
15,"if the drone’s life is estimated at 500 flights (using two batteries) and each flight for 15–20min can deliver aerial photos covering an area of 0.1–0.15km2, then the total area covered by a drone could be ca. 50–75km2 (fig 4)."
15,this could even reduce the cost of drone image acquisition to 32-49usd per km2 (2453usd  50–75 km2).
15,"although the setiu mangrove area mapped in this study is rather restricted (0.12km2), it has proven to be good enough for showing the potential of drone data."
15,"earlier, lucieer et al (2010) [45] demonstrated antarctic moss beds drone mapping in a 200m×200m area, and ventura et al (2016) [83] for coastal fish nursery grounds mapping in 60m×80m area on giglio island, italy."
15,"for mangrove research, despite it being a basic version, the dji-phantom-2 drone was found to be efficient and fit for purpose."
15,"however, if the budget is not a constraint, the phan- tom 2 could be replaced with other updated and better performing models equipped with dif- ferent camera sensors (table 5)."
15,"the newer uav models also have an improved battery run- time up to 20–25minutes, and can cover larger areas at the same altitude and speed settings."
15,"for instance, an increase of 5minutes in drone flight time would allow an increase of 4ha cov- erage in each image [82]."
15,"limits in drone coverage at setiu (1.81km2) were due to our need to learn flight operations, as well as there being no facility to setup both rgb and ir cameras on- board on the phantom 2 drone (each flight path was covered twice by changing the cameras)."
15,"with the reduced cost of uavs, the aerial photos acquisition is becoming more economical, although the multispectral data remain expensive (table 5)."
15,"overall, drone equipment is a one-time investment, and the long-term monitoring of any area could lead to the generation of cost-effective data."
15,pleiades has a faster data processing time than the dji-phantom2 (table 3).
15,"however, the segmentation process in object-based classification has reduced the drone data size as well as its processing time (50h for pixel-based, 18h for object-based)."

16,comparison of satellite and drone imagery for mangrove mapping segmentation did not benefit the processing time of pleiades (which took 6h for object- and 5h for pixel-based classifications).
16,perhaps the increased computing power and simplified drone data will speed up the image processing time in the future.
16,"finally, we recognise that some people might question why anyone would go through the trouble of flying a drone for weeks (largely depending on weather conditions and battery time), plus needing much time for the extra-long processing time, if a single satellite image can lead to a similar result."
16,"when answering this question, one should consider that satellite imag- ery is not always available, and where it is not, drone imagery is a much cheaper alternative if the purpose is to collect vhr imagery."
16,"the eventual choice will be dictated by logistics, weather, and field conditions, and technological progress."
16,"with this work, we are offering insights into comparable options that can lead to more informed choices."
16,"image classification and accuracy since the man algorithm in the object-based classification is highly subjective (with a rule to classify the segments based on signature details, spectral distances and visual interpretation), the differentiation of mangrove species like r. apiculata and n. fruticans was difficult for pleia- des imagery (fig 6)."
16,"in fact, visual interpretation of n. fruticans can reveal its rough texture, dark shadow parts between fronds, and high reflectance of fronds (fig 5), but this species often showed a high spectral signature similarity with other species, especially r. apiculata."
16,"as the aut classification approach in qgis is still in the experimental phase [67], its possible improvement in the near future is likely to provide more accurate results [86,87]."
16,"concerning the pixel-based classification (fig 7), the spectral angle of sam represented a close similarity among land-cover types compared to the spectral distance of mli, and hence delivered the maps with poor mangrove species’ discrimination."
16,low accuracy of the sam classified maps was reported previously by shafri et al.
16,"(2007)[88], castillejo-gonzález et al. (2009)[89] and khatami et al."
16,(2016)[90].
16,"higher threshold values of oa and kappa index (fig 8) encountered for d6oman and d6pmli signify the capability of drone imagery over the satellite data, to produce both object- and pixel-based classifications with unprecedented accuracy, and fulfil the consensus criteria of land-cover mapping [91,92]."
16,"although the kappa index was proven to be misleading and ineffective for classification accuracy assessment [70], it showed a consistent pattern with the oa in the present study."
16,"due to there being no marked variations or changes in the vegetation between the drone and pleiades images (except some dead trees), we believe that the time gap (nearly 2 years) between these two data sets had a negligible impact on the image classification."
16,"on the other hand, classification errors in the images were due largely to overlapping vegeta- tion spectral signatures (fig 9)."
16,"the dem, which could represent tree height variations on the ground, especially between n. fruticans (height: 4–7m) and r. apiculata (16–19m), a. alba (10–13m) or c. equisetifolia (14–23 m) benefited the object-based classification (d6oman) more than the pixel-based classification (d6pmli and s6pmli)."
16,"higher classification accu- racy was retained chiefly with the higher spatial resolution data, and this confirms the advan- tage of phantom 2 drone imagery over the pleiades for mangrove mapping at the setiu wetland."
16,"moreover, the cross validation through a combination of different training sites and several iterations ensures no bias in the results produced."
16,this research was performed in a species-rich region (including adjacent non-mangrove sections) if compared to the global mangrove range.
16,"hence, it was demanding in terms of ground truthing and image identification."
16,"despite the rather homogeneous spectral signatures that we obtained in the present study for most of the mangrove species present, we recognise that the higher the image’s spatial resolution becomes, the higher the risk of obtaining very plos one | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200288 july 18, 2018 16 / 22"
17,comparison of satellite and drone imagery for mangrove mapping heterogeneous spectral signatures.
17,"pixels originating from higher, lower, shaded, and sunny sides of the canopy might contribute to an overall heterogeneous spectral signature for one species, particularly if the texture of the crown is complex, as is the case with nypa."
17,our other research shows that a lower spatial resolution does indeed increase the classification accuracy for this species (s1 part 5).
17,"however, for other trees, i.e."
17,"rhizophora and avicennia, a higher spatial resolution results in a higher classification accuracy."
17,"conclusions the present study revealed the potential of dji-phantom-2 drone aerial photos for mangrove mapping, as well as its capability against pleiades-1b satellite data, from observations in the setiu wetland, malaysia."
17,acquisition of drone data on cloudy days is exceptionally beneficial to the mangrove researchers.
17,"although the initial cost of the drone data was found to be high (which also depends on the type of drone and sensors used), it becomes cost-effective upon monitoring areas of around 50km2 in size, or when using it for long-term monitoring of rela- tively small areas of several square kilometers."
17,"the higher spatial resolution, together with dem, of the drone data delivered highly accurate classified maps compared to the pleiades imagery."
17,"among the classification algorithms tested, the efficiency of man for object-based classification, and mli for pixel-based classification approaches was clear."
17,"the overlapped spec- tral signatures, especially for species like r. apiculata, a. alba and c. equisetifolia with similar tree heights, were responsible for the observed classification errors."
17,"overall, the mangrove map- ping based on drone aerial photos provided unprecedented results–especially in terms of image (object- and pixel-based) classification and accuracy, showing that drone technology could be used as an alternative to satellite-based monitoring/management of the mangrove ecosystems."
17,"while the drone’s image quality (spectral and radiometric resolutions) depends on the types of sensors used, the limitations of its data efficiency (coverage area, data acquisition/processing time and user-cost) depend on the model of drone used."
17,"certainly, the development of drone technology towards longer battery run-time (enabling more area coverage), waterproof nature (enabling operation on rainy days), proximity sensors (enabling under-canopy monitoring), simplified data size (decreased processing time), hyperspectral sensor, and active remote sens- ing (e.g., lidar) systems will make them even more useful in the future, especially for species- level discrimination in relatively low-diversity settings such as mangrove forests."
