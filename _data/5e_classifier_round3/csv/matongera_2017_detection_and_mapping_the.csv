1,an understanding of the spatial distribution of bracken fern weeds is therefore received in revised form 8 december 2016 essential for providing appropriate management strategies at both local and regional scales.
1,"the aim of accepted 14 december 2016 this study was to assess the utility of the freely available medium resolution landsat 8 oli sensor in the available online 30 december 2016 detection and mapping of bracken fern at the cathedral peak, south africa."
1,"to achieve this objective, the results obtained from landsat 8 oli were compared with those derived using the costly, high spatial keywords: resolution worldview-2 imagery."
1,"since previous studies have already successfully mapped bracken fern bracken fern classiﬁcation accuracy using high spatial resolution worldview-2 image, the comparison was done to investigate the magnitude invasion of difference in accuracy between the two sensors in relation to their acquisition costs."
1,"to evaluate the remote sensing performance of landsat 8 oli in discriminating bracken fern compared to that of worldview-2, we tested discrimination the utility of (i) spectral bands; (ii) derived vegetation indices as well as (iii) the combination of spectral encroachment bands and vegetation indices based on discriminant analysis classiﬁcation algorithm."
1,"after resampling local and regional scales the training and testing data and reclassifying several times (n = 100) based on the combined data sets, rangeland productivity the overall accuracies for both landsat 8 and worldview-2 were tested for signiﬁcant differences based on mann-whitney u test."
1,the results showed that the integration of the spectral bands and derived vegetation indices yielded the best overall classiﬁcation accuracy (80.08% and 87.80% for landsat 8 oli and worldview-2 respectively).
1,"additionally, the use of derived vegetation indices as a standalone data set produced the weakest overall accuracy results of 62.14% and 82.11% for both the landsat 8 oli and worldview-2 images."
1,"there were signiﬁcant differences {u (100) = 569.5, z = −10.8242, p < 0.01} between the classiﬁcation accuracies derived based on landsat oli 8 and those derived using worldview-2 sensor."
1,"although there were signiﬁcant differences between landsat and worldview-2 accuracies, the magni- tude of variation (9%) between the two sensors was within an acceptable range."
1,"therefore, the ﬁndings of this study demonstrated that the recently launched landsat 8 oli multispectral sensor provides valu- able information that could aid in the long term continuous monitoring and formulation of effective bracken fern management with acceptable accuracies that are comparable to those obtained from the high resolution worldview-2 commercial sensor."
