1,"notably, techniques utilizing eo data of land surface temperature (ts) and vegetation index (vi) have shown promise in this regard."
1,"the present study investigates, for the first time, the accuracy of one such technique, known as the “simplified triangle”, using sentinel-3 eo data, acquired for 44 days in 2018 at three savannah fluxnet sites in spain."
1,the technique was found to be able to predict both ef and ssm with reasonable accuracy when compared to collocated ground measurements.
1,"comparisons performed for all days together showed relatively low root mean square difference (rmsd) for both ef (0.191) and ssm (0.012 cm3 cm−3 ) and good correlation coefficients (r) of 0.721 and 0.577, respectively."
1,both ef and ssm were also largely in agreement with land cover and seasonal variability.
1,"the present study comprises the first detailed assessment of the “simplified triangle”, in this case, using sentinel-3 data and in a mediterranean setting."
1,"findings, albeit preliminary, are of significant value regarding the use of the investigated technique as a tool of environmental management, and towards ongoing, worldwide efforts aiming at developing operationally relevant products based on the ts/vi feature space and eo data based on new satellites such as sentinel-3."

1,introduction earth’s natural processes and the relationships between soil-vegetation and the atmosphere components of the earth system are topics of great importance for numerous disciplines covering a range of practical applications and research [1–4].
1,"the need for accurate information on parameters characterizing the environment of the earth system is even more acute today, in light of increased pressure due to climate change and global challenges linked to global food and water security [5]."
1,"recent climate projections, for example, suggest that the mediterranean will be subject to severe climate change, including increased temperatures and reduced precipitation [6]."
1,"in this context, the accurate monitoring of parameters such as evaporative fraction (i.e., the ratio of instantaneous latent heat remote sens. 2020, 12, 3192; doi:10.3390/rs12193192 www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing"
2,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 3192 2 of 20 flux (le) to net radiation (rn)) and surface soil moisture (ssm) is of high priority."
2,"both are essential environmental parameters which play instrumental roles in numerous physical processes, and thereby affect the climate directly or indirectly [7–9]."
2,"thus, being able to accurately estimate their changes in both the time and spatial domains is undoubtedly of prime interest for many applications in numerous disciplines [10,11]."
2,"earth observation (eo) has experienced rapid growth over recent decades, providing a pathway towards acquiring both ef and ssm at variable geographical scales with temporally consistent coverage."
2,"a wealth of techniques have been proposed exploiting eo data acquired from across the electromagnetic spectrum to retrieve these parameters (e.g., see reviews by [8,12]."
2,"thermal infrared (tir) remote sensing, despite its requirement for clear sky conditions, has been the preferred option for both ef and ssm retrievals to date because of its fine resolution in the spatial and temporal domains [13]."
2,a specific group of tir-based approaches that rely on the physical relationships implied by eo-derived scatterplots in which the surface temperature (ts) is plotted versus the vegetation index (vi) have shown potential in this respect.
2,"assuming conditions of full variability in vegetation cover in eo-based imagery, a scatterplot is generated with a triangular (or trapezoidal) shape."
2,the emergence of this shape results from the reduced sensitivity that ts has on water content over areas covered by vegetation in comparison to bare soil areas.
2,a detailed description of the ts/vi feature space and of the biophysical properties included within it can be found in [14].
2,"several researchers have already demonstrated how ef and ssm can be derived from the ts/vi feature space utilizing a range of eo data (e.g., [15–23]."
2,"the promising potential of ts/vi techniques is evidenced in the fact that variants are being, or have been, considered by different space agencies in the development of operational eo-based products [24–26]."
2,"a group of these techniques has already demonstrated its ability to provide operational service ssm maps over spain at 1 km pixel size based on data from the smos satellite, integrating the smos brightness temperature values within a multiple regression model, together with ts and vi obtained from the modis data [27]."
2,"recently [28] proposed a new technique for estimating both ssm and ef from the ts/vi domain, named “simplified triangle”."
2,"this approach has a major advantage in comparison to other ts/vi techniques, in that it is based on only a few calculations and does not require for its implementation a mathematical model to simulate physical processes or ancillary data; therefore, it can be easily implemented almost anywhere in the world."
2,"as the technique is easy to use and only depends on eo data, it is a prime candidate for operational use."
2,"nevertheless, more research is required to evaluate its performance in different ecosystems and environmental conditions globally, particularly regarding the use of eo data from new satellites such as those from sentinel-3."
2,the authors of [29] demonstrated the use of the “simplified” triangle approach coupled with crop prediction and climatological water balance models to predict soybean yield using modis data.
2,"yet, to our knowledge, this technique using esa’s sentinels-3 has not yet been implemented."
2,"sentinel-3 provides eo data at a range of resolutions in the spatial, temporal and spectral domains."
2,"thus, such satellite observations may serve in many potential applications [30,31]."
2,"on this basis, the present research study aims at exploring the ability of the “simplified triangle”, used synergistically with sentinel-3 data, to predict the spatio-temporal variability of both ef and ssm."
2,"to our knowledge, in that respect, this is the first study of its kind."
2,the technique was assessed in two regions in spain for which validated collocated ground observations from the fluxnet global in situ monitoring network were available.

4,"at present, it consists of two satellites (sentinel-3a and 3b) working in constellation, with two additional satellites planned for launch in the near future."
4,one of the instruments onboard the sentinel-3 platform is a slstr (sea and land surface temperature radiometer).
4,the launch of the satellites in constellation allows slstr to achieve a temporal resolution at the equator of less than a day.
4,"spectrally, the instrument acquires data in a total of nine spectral bands, plus two more which were developed for applications relevant primarily to the monitoring of fires."
4,"the first six bands, located from visible to short-wave infrared (swir), acquire spectral data at 500 m."
4,"subsequent bands, i.e., bands 7 to 9, have a 1-km spatial resolution."
4,"more details on the slstr instrument are available elsewhere, for example [38]."
4,"herein, the sentinel-3 level 2 operational product, named “sl_2_lst”, is used to implement the “simplified triangle” technique."
4,"based on the delivery time, two data product types are available for the slstr sentinel 3 product."
4,"these products are “near real time” (nrt), provided in less than 3 hours after image acquisition, and “non-critical time” (ntc), provided within one month after image acquisition."
4,"the main difference between them is the vis/swir calibration applied to the nrt products, which makes them suitable for our current study."
4,"the spatial resolution the of lst and vi band is 1 km and the temporal resolution is, at the latitudes of our study area, at least two times per day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon; precise time varies according to orbit and is not geosynchronous)."
4,"this product provides land surface temperature (lst, or ts, as defined before) and a series of other parameters to users."
4,"the product is organized into packages composed of one manifest file and several measurements and annotation data files (between 2 and 21 files, depending on the package)."
4,"the sl_2_lst product, in particular, contains ten annotation files, providing the same parameters as sl_2_wct and some additional vegetation parameters."
4,"one of these parameters is the fractional vegetation cover (fr), which is used to satisfy the objectives of the present study."
4,"in sl_2_lst, the vegetation is specified as a fractional vegetation index ranging between ‘1’ (corresponding to 100% vegetation) and ‘0’ (corresponding to 0% vegetation)."
4,the lst algorithm used for sentinel 3 is based on two split-window thermal channels (1100 nm and 1200 nm).
4,"the global estimation of the lst takes into account the effects of the land emissivity, together with those of atmospheric water vapor and satellite viewing angle."
4,"the lst estimation uses a linear regression with coefficients tailored for day and night, land cover types, various atmospheric conditions, and bare and vegetated surfaces."
4,"more details on the fr and lst sentinel-3 products can be found elsewhere including open-access documents (e.g., in [39])."
4,"the sl_2_lst images used herein were first obtained from creodias (https://creodias.eu/) at no cost, covering the entire sentinel-3 image archive initially for the year 2018."
4,"next, specific sentinel-3 images were selected for inclusion in this study."
4,these included only cloud-free images or images with less than 20% cloud presence in their field of view.
4,each image from the archive was intersected to each image footprint covering the entire study area.
4,"for each sl_2_lst image product that was retained for further analysis, first, spatial and spectral subsets were selected."
4,"these covered the studied regions), where the layers retained included only the ts (or lst), fr and the normalised difference vegetation index (ndvi)."
4,"then, each band was masked for clouds and inland water."
4,"subsequently, all the study sites were cross-intersected with the images, using an algorithm based on the closest date and time acquisition for in situ and satellite images."
4,"the final set of sls_2_lst images, for a total of 70 days, provided the input data for the implementation of the “simplified triangle”."
4,an example of these final image products for a selected day is given in figure 2.

14,discussion the present research comprised a robust investigation of the “simplified triangle” method for deriving spatially explicit estimates of evaporative fraction (ef) and surface soil moisture when the latter used recent sentinel-3 eo data.
14,"the study focused on selected experimental sites located in spain, representative of a typical mediterranean savannah ecosystem."
14,"for example, a comparison of all the data (including all dates and sites) showed a low rsme for ef (0.191) and ssm (0.012 cm3 cm−3 ) and good correlation coefficients (r), i.e., 0.721 and 0.577 respectively."
14,similar or better results were obtained in the individual site-specific comparisons.
14,"these findings are encouraging and, as a whole, corroborate the technique’s ability to provide spatial estimates of the parameters it has been developed to predict over the study area."
14,this was verified using data from heterogeneous and arid/semi-arid experimental sites during the study period.
14,"the results reported herein cannot be directly compared with other those of studies, since the proposed technique is new."
14,"yet, the reported rmse and r values are comparable to those in other studies which retrieved ef and ssm using tir-based techniques [6,13,16,23,43,46,47]."
14,deviation between the estimated ef and ssm and the corresponding in situ data could be due to several influencing factors.
14,"one possible such factor might be the accuracy with which fr and ts/tkin retrievals are derived, since these are the only input parameters required for the implementation of the technique."
14,errors introduced in the estimation of those parameters could potentially impact prediction ability [48].
14,"in this regard, validations of the sentinels-3 lst product indicate that the accuracy in ts retrieval is on the order of 1.5–2.5 k [9]."
14,"however, validation studies of the fr product do not yet exist, to our knowledge."
14,"the error contribution of ts is not expected to be significant, since this parameter is scaled [28,40]."
14,"yet, in the present study, fr was obtained directly from the sentinel-3 product and was not computed using the ndvi-based approach, as outlined by [28] in the “simplified triangle” description."
14,"this may influence the retrieval accuracy of the predicted parameters which, to our knowledge, is yet to be investigated."

15,"in addition, the large scale differences in spatial resolution between the carboeurope point in addition, the large scale differences in spatial resolution between the carboeurope point measurements (on the order of 5 × 5 m) and the sentinel-3 pixel (on the order of 1 × 1 km) direct measurements (on the order of 5 × 5 m) and the sentinel-3 pixel (on the order of 1 × 1 km) direct validation of both ef and ssm is subject to some degree of uncertainty."
15,this spatial variation cannot validation of both ef and ssm is subject to some degree of uncertainty.
15,this spatial variation cannot be be precisely conveyed by means of point data validation [51].
15,this issue can potentially create a poor precisely conveyed by means of point data validation [51].
15,"this issue can potentially create a poor horizontal and vertical mismatch between the eo data and the ground measurements, affecting the horizontal and vertical comparisons of ef and mismatch [52]."
15,"for the ssm between eo datasatellite-derived example, and the groundssm measurements, predictions affecting could bethe comparisons of ef and ssm [52]."
15,"for example, satellite-derived ssm predictions responding to the skin soil layer water content."
15,the latter is significantly shallower than the could be responding ground to the skin soil layer water content.
15,the latter is significantly shallower than the ground measurement minimum resolution (which is at a 0–5 cm average surface layer).
15,effective soil depth measurement estimatesresolution minimum for eo-based (which is at a 0–5 predictions of cm ssmaverage surfacecontested are a highly layer).

15,the authors of [55] stated that ssm retrievals using optical eo data are effective at 10-cm soil depth.
15,"recently, [56] compared mo derived from the “simplified triangle” with surface soil water measured at 5-cm and 15-cm depths for a study site in india."
15,"they reported the best agreement on bare soil pixels or pixels with low fr, and also at soil depths of 5 cm."
16,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 3192 16 of 20 satisfactory ssm at the bare soil top surface layer can be obtained from eo sensors (i.e., at depths of 5 cm and 15 cm) or in areas where vegetation cover is low."
16,the authors of [55] stated that ssm retrievals using optical eo data are effective at 10-cm soil depth.
16,recently [56] compared mo derived from the “simplified triangle” with surface soil water measured at 5-cm and 15-cm depths for a study site in india.
16,"they reported the best agreement on bare soil pixels or pixels with low fr, and also at soil depths of 5 cm."
16,another factor that could potentially account for the deviations between predictions and observations for both ef and ssm is the temporal mismatch which exists between these values.
16,"the ground observations which formed our reference dataset were obtained on the same day as the sentinel-3 overpass, but they were not measured at the precise satellite overpass time."
16,"nonetheless, this factor is expected to have a negligible influence on the validation carried out herein, as the ground measurements were linearly interpolated, an approach which has also been adopted elsewhere [48,57], in an attempt to address the issue of the exact time mismatch."
16,a further factor may be related to the accuracy and precision of the instruments.
16,"this might be more prominent in the flux measurements coming from the eddy covariance system, which is used to compute ef from the instantaneous fluxes of le and rn."
16,"various studies have demonstrated that measurement errors in instantaneous le flux under certain circumstances (such as terrain features) can be in the order of as much as 20–30%, whereas for rn measurements, uncertainty of 10% can often be assumed [58]."
16,"furthermore, for ef in particular, the passage of clouds can lead to abrupt changes, since it lowers the levels of shortwave radiation (rg) and the available energy reaching at the earth’s surface, causing ef to increase slightly."
16,"for example, [59] suggested that a 20% decrease in available energy caused by an increase in low-level clouds from 0–50 % coverage might result in a 5% increase in ef."
16,"these are some possible reasons for the systematic overestimations of ef obtained from the satellite data (refer to figure 6, table 4)."
16,other possible reasons may be related to the limitations of the technique itself.
16,"the implementation of the “simplified “triangle” presents certain limitations, namely: (1) it requires an image with a sufficiently large number of pixels, and with values covering the whole spectrum of soil moisture concentration and fr range."
16,"furthermore, surfaces which are relatively “wet”, i.e., which evaporate at a given rate, or “dry”, i.e., where nearly no evapotranspiration is occurring, are necessary; (2) like other ts/vi methods, it depends on optical and tir remote-sensing observations, and as such, its use is restricted to clear-sky conditions; (3) implementation of the technique may be prone to human-induced errors, e.g., due to subjectivity in warm- and cold-edge selection, which often introduces additional uncertainty."
16,"this is an issue that also challenges many other ts/vi methods (e.g., refer to the discussion by [9,16,48])."
16,"nonetheless, the “simplified “triangle” implementation with the sentinel-3 presents several advantages."
16,"first, it is based on globally available satellite data which are available at no cost."
16,"second, the technique is simple and robust in its implementation and it does not require significant computational resources when applied to small scale studies."
16,a further advantage is its reliance on just a few inputs which are generally easily computed from eo sensors.
16,"the method is able to provide reasonably accurate predictions, even in highly fragmented environments and dynamically changing landscapes such as the mediterranean savannah ecosystems included in our experimental setup."
16,"finally, the implementation steps are robust and adaptable to other locations; additionally, the method can be adjusted for integration with other available eo data."
16,these characteristics could potentially make this technique a good candidate for operational development on a global scale.
16,the technique performed well for our study area and investigated time period.
16,"however, further investigation is required to establish its general applicability."
16,"more research is required to assess the extent to which it can be applied to monitoring ef and ssm on a long-term basis, also other ecosystem conditions/regions and with different eo data (e.g., landsat, modis, seviri)."
16,"in addition, a detailed sensitivity analysis of the method will allow us to properly assess the effect of fr and ts errors on the accuracy of the predictions."
16,these two steps will help to extend our understanding of the capabilities
17,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 3192 17 of 20 of the “simplified triangle” technique and further establish its robustness and the accuracy of its predictions [60]."
17,"furthermore, the approach of defining the wet and dry edges, as required to apply the technique, should be further scrutinized, removing any doubt of user subjectivity (e.g., by fully automating the process computationally)."
17,"last but not least, a method is required to allow estimations of ef and ssm to be made under all weather conditions; a promising avenue in this regard could be the synergetic use of microwave data with optical and tir eo data [48]."
17,this issue in other ts/vi approaches also requiring the determination of the cold and warm edges has already been explored in many studies.
17,"yet, some issues remain (e.g., see [50]."
17,all the above are topics of key importance to be taken up in future studies.
17,conclusions this work aimed at evaluating the ability of the “simplified triangle” inversion technique to estimate evaporative fraction and surface soil moisture from esa’s sentinel-3 eo data in a typical savannah ecosystem in the mediterranean region.
17,"for this purpose, the technique was implemented and validated across three selected experimental sites in europe that are part of a global ground measurements network."
17,"the validation period covered 70 calendar days in summer and early autumn, 2018."
17,"to the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first detailed investigation of the accuracy of this technique using sentinel-3 data in a variety of european ecosystems."
17,"the results obtained based on a series of statistical metrics suggested that the technique is, in most cases, able to predict the ef and ssm with satisfactory accuracy."
17,"comparisons using the data from all days and all sites showed for ef an rmsd of 0.191, sd of 0.088 and r of 0.721, whereas for ssm, the results were slightly better, with an rmsd of 0.012, sd of 0.010 and r of 0.577."
17,the prediction accuracy found herein for both ef and ssm is comparable to those reported by other ts//vi methods implemented with dissimilar eo data.
17,"evidently, the “simplified method” has certain key advantages which make it an attractive choice, and even potentially a prime candidate for operational use."
17,"undoubtedly, although its applicability was clearly demonstrated in the present study, further investigation is encouraged in different directions in order to establish its prediction accuracy."
17,further such research will be undertaken by our team in future.
