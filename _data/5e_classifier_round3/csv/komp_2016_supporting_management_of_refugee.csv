4,"because in europe fewer employees will be needed in the agricultural sector, immigrants will have to apply for work in towns and cities and will also seek urban housing space."
4,the environmental development targets to limit additional land consumption require nota bene urban densification.
4,this can be done primarily by filling up existing vacancies and secondly by activating gap sites within the urban perimeters.
4,"furthermore, the fact that a considerable part of refugees could not benefit from school education during war and migration, they not only have to learn a new language, but in many cases also catch up basic alphabetization."
4,"all infrastructures necessary for obtaining language command, school-leaving qualification and professional qualification in the european frame will only be available in towns or cities."

5,figure 7 shows such a case in a subjective value of the protection of private data is sometimes suburban environment where the communal administration may considered in the published opinion to dominate even legal and negotiate with the owner(s) the potential for housing investment security demands of democratic states.
5,the general provisions at that place. and rules for processing personal data have been adopted through the directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
5,"certain procedures and techniques of data mining with respect to the management of refugee demands thus require the application of article 13 (a), (c), (d) of this directive to adopt measures by the member states (european commission 1995)."
5,"to safeguard national security, public security etc., the republic of germany has passed the data exchange improvement law on 14 january 2016 (bundesrepublik deutschland 2016), which allows and requires registration of each migrating person in a way that multiple identities will be excluded in future."
5,both legal provisions constitute the administrative basis for the application of the geo-data evaluations described above (bernsdorf et al.
5,2015).
5,"great parts of central europe can rely on accurate geo-data, housing and infrastructural information and citizen registers, which will more or less allow the widespread application of the described system of a powerful geoit which should not be restricted to the border of member states."
5,"however, in those member states that lack cadastral data, maps and geo-coded household data, other non-governmental sources have to be used, such as car navigation data, web based map data, address data of post and parcel services or vhr satellite data, in short, data that can be geo-coded to allow similar evaluations."
5,the figure 7: inventory of potential construction sites latter are urgently needed by the concerned administrations (kleinwächter 2014). dealing with the management of refugees.
5,"this example also shows how eo methods plus data mining even if the actual wave of refugees will calm down, the from urban data allow a first detection of vacant lots and their observation of food insecurity combined with economic potential for additional housing construction."
5,normally the weakness in sub-saharan africa is clearly indicating the next discovery of such potential densification potential will lead to waves of migrants towards europe.
