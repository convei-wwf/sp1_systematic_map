1,"to ensure that participants can enjoy an event safely and carefree, it must be comprehensively prepared and attentively monitored."
1,"remote sensing can provide valuable information to identify potential risks and take appropriate measures in order to prevent a disaster, or initiate emergency aid measures as quickly as possible in the event of an emergency."
1,"especially, three-dimensional (3d) information that is derived using photogrammetry can be used to analyze the terrain and map existing structures that are set up at short notice."
1,"using aerial imagery acquired during a german music festival in 2016 and the celebration of the german protestant church assembly of 2017, the authors compare two-dimensional (2d) and novel fusion-based 3d change detection methods, and discuss their suitability for supporting large-scale events during the relevant phases of crisis management."
1,this study serves to find out what added value the use of 3d change information can provide for on-site crisis management.
1,"based on the results, an operational, fully automatic processor for crisis management operations and corresponding products for end users can be developed."

1,"introduction remote sensing data has long been used in various areas of crisis management, be it risk or vulnerability analyses, early warning, or damage assessment [1–3]."
1,"with the increasing availability and quality of remote sensing data, the procedures for the derivation of 3d information are becoming faster; at the same time, they can produce more accurate and reliable results."
1,"as a result, more and more fields of application are opening up for operational use, and civil protection actors also discover potential applications for their work [4–6]."
1,"as with remote sensing data in general, applications for derived 3d information can be found in all of the classical phases of disaster and crisis management [7]."
1,"during the preparation phase, surface and building models can be included in analysis and planning processes."
1,"examples would be the modeling of explosions and their impact and consequences, the assessment of flood risks, and correspondingly adapted evacuation or site planning [6,8,9]."
1,"furthermore, the observation and research of slope movements gives insights for possible early warning systems [10–12]."
1,another aspect is the use of 3d worlds for the preparation and training of task forces [13].
1,"after a disaster has struck or the crisis has begun, rapid relief must be provided."
1,"this requires a common operational picture with accurate, reliable, and up-to-date spatial information [7]."
1,"the situation must be assessed promptly, comprehensively, and in detail so that emergency forces and resources can be deployed efficiently."

16,"remote sens. 2018, 10, 2054 16 of 19 in order to guarantee the supply of the participants of a large event, access routes to and within the area must be available."
16,"the planning of these access and escape routes, as well as the identification of alternative routes, can significantly be supported with the help of up-to-date 3d information."
16,"information about the terrain is already helpful in the planning phase, especially if the event takes place in a flood-prone area."
16,"questions such as which routes are safe, which areas are threatened by waterlogging, and whether the paths must be additionally paved, are questions that can be answered."
16,"the derived dsms of the test areas of both events are precise enough to detect even small sinks, and could thus already make valuable contributions in the planning phase."
16,"continuous monitoring, taking into account additional geographic information, such as existing access maps, can be used to identify objects that are on the roads and might be obstacles."
16,"in addition, detailed elevation information may provide crucial indications as to what type of object it is and what action is required to remove it."
16,"however, it must be taken into account that the possible obstacles must have a minimum height in order to be reliably detected by the fusion-based 3d change detection."
16,the dsms that were used in this study were created after the events had taken place.
16,"in the meantime, a procedure has been implemented in the data processing chain of the 4k system with which ad hoc dsms can be derived during the flight and transmitted directly to the ground station."
16,this will speed up the processing time for dsm generation from hours/days to only minutes.
16,the procedure is currently being tested and analyzed.
16,the automatic 3d change detection process will then be integrated into the processes at the ground station so that the results are immediately available for further analysis and for the creation of products for end users.
16,"conclusions this study shows that using 3d information for change detection, and in particular fusing 3d and 2d change information, can deliver valuable indications regarding where changes have taken place in the correspondence of actual objects such as mobile constructions, cars, and tents, which are of interest for event and crisis management."
16,the other advantages of the introduced fusion-based 3d change analysis in comparison to simple 2d change analysis are that illumination-related changes or false detections due to shadows can be excluded.
16,"nevertheless, the quality of the results highly depends on the quality of the input data."
16,"a deficiency in the number of available stereo pairs, low texture, and saturated image areas lead to quality variations in the derived surface models, and thus to inaccuracies that directly affect the 3d change analysis."
16,"as a result, the required minimum height of changed objects to be detected as such can vary over a small area."
16,"the 4k camera system, together with the components for automatic image processing, is capable of providing aerial images and 3d information quickly and reliably."
16,"thus, the results of 3d change analysis are not yet a product for the end user."
16,"they should be combined with other geographical information, e.g., paths or site plans, and included in further analysis steps in order to derive information on land use, the number of people on site, or the condition of rescue lanes."
16,"this information can be particularly useful for the planning and implementation phase of the management of major events, and thus support crisis management."
