1,"in our study of tropical deforestation modelling the main advantages of the remote- sensing-based information system came from: (i) an improvement of decision making as decisions could be made with a higher degree of con""dence, leading to a shorter and less expensive decision cycle, and to earlier implementation of decisions; and (ii) avoidance of bad decisions, as the rate of project failure, and the associated resource wastes, was expected to decrease as a result of the availability of more accurate information."
