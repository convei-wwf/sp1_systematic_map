1,"souza-filho1,2 recebido em 6 dezembro, 2011 / aceito em 16 agosto, 2012 received on december 6, 2011 / accepted on august 16, 2012 abstract."
1,"the environmental sensitivity index (esi) is represented by a scale ranging from 1 to 10, where the intensity of the impact caused by the oil spill is specified and, the higher the value the higher the sensitivity index."
1,oil spills impact the environment and are not exclusive to certain regions of the world.
1,"therefore, the production of maps representing the esi has become important for the implementation of contingency and emergency plans."
1,"curuçá city, located in northeastern pará state, does not have a map of semi-detailed environmental sensitivity, for that reason, this study aimed to generate a tactical map, scale of 1:100,000, with recognition of coastal environments identified by digital processing of landsat images and field surveys."
1,the map will help identify the areas more prone to suffer from a possible oil spill.
1,"thus, eight indices were classified as follows: esi 1b retaining wall, esi 1c cliffs, esi 3a sandy beaches and exposed dunes, esi 7 sandy tidal flat, esi 9 ebb tide delta, esi 10a salt marsh, esi 10b freshwater marsh and esi 10 mangrove."
1,"finally, the esi represented in these maps can support the decision making process to prevent and control accidents that may happen during oil production and transportation."
1,benefits may reflect on lower costs of cleaning and restoration of the impacted areas in case of oil and other potentially harmful load spills.

1,"o derramamento de óleo já não é mais um fato isolado e esporádico no mundo, causando inúmeros impactos ambientais, portanto, a produção de mapas que representam o isa tornou-se importante para a implementação de planos de contingência e de emergência."
1,"o municı́pio de curuçá, região nordeste do estado do pará, não possui um mapa de semi-detalhe, assim, este trabalho teve como objetivo a construção de um mapa tático na escala de 1:100.000 e o reconhecimento dos ambientes costeiros através do processamento de imagens landsat e do levantamento de campo contribuindo para a identificação das áreas que mais sofrerão com um eventual derramamento de óleo."
1,"deste modo foi possı́vel classificar oito ı́ndices: isa 1b muro de arrimo, isa 1c falésias, isa 3a praias de areia fina e dunas expostas, isa 7 planı́cie de maré arenosa, isa 9 delta de maré vazante, isa 10a pântano salino; isa 10b pântano de água doce e isa 10c manguezal."
1,"assim, os isa’s são produtos que representados em mapa podem ajudar na tomada decisões na prevenção e no controle de acidentes durante as atividades de produção e no transporte do óleo usado pelas companhias produtoras, tornando-se uma boa estratégia de prevenção, a qual pode evitar os altos custos das operações de limpeza e recuperação de ambientes impactados no caso de derramamentos de óleo e cargas de risco."
