1,"we found that pxrf spectra with partial least squares regression (plsr) models can predict sand, sentinel-2 management zones total nitrogen (tn), organic carbon (oc), silt contents, and clay with validation r2 of 0.81, 0.74, 0.73, 0.68, and plsr 0.64 at the pedon scale but performed less well for soil ph (r2 = 0.51)."
1,"a combination of emi, sentinel-2, and dem data showed promise in mapping sand, silt contents, and tn at two depths and ap horizon thickness and soil depth across the field."
1,a clustering analysis using combinations of mapped soil properties or proximal and remote sensing data suggested that data fusion improved the characterization of field-scale variability of soil properties.
1,the cost-benefit analysis showed that the most accurate management zones (mzs) for topsoil can be generated only using estimated soil property maps while it was the most costly as compared to other data sources.
1,"for an intermediate-high (for topsoil) and high (subsoil) accuracy and a moderate economic budget, the combination of sensors (proximal + remote sensing + dem) might be a better approach for effective mzs generation than collecting soil samples for laboratory analysis while the latter produced the most accurate maps for topsoil."
1,"it can be concluded that pxrf spectra can be useful for predicting key soil properties (e.g., sand, tn, oc, silt, clay) at different soil depths, and a combination of proximal and remote sensing provides an effective way to delineate soil mzs that are useful for decision-making."
