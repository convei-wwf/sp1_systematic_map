2,"however, the data resolution, cost, and availability can be limiting."
2,"optimal solution depends on the species characteristics, where the spectral and spatial resolution can compensate each other to some extent, and phenology plays an important role."
2,available high spatial resolution satellite data are suﬃcient for recognition of species that are distinct and either large or form uniform patches at size comparable to the data pixel size.
2,"for other spe- cies, higher spatial resolution is needed, and unmanned aircraft (uav) provide data of extremely high spatial resolution (cm) at low cost and high ﬂexibility."

3,"introduction plant invasions impose increasing impacts not only on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but also economy and human health (pimentel, zuniga, and morrison 2005; hulme et al."
3,2009; ehrenfeld 2010; pyšek and richardson 2010).
3,"they can be fast and very dynamic, and this makes the control measures diﬃcult especially at the later stages of invasion (pluess et al."
3,2012).
3,eradication should therefore focus ﬁrst on recently infested sites (müllerová et al.
3,2005; pluess et al.
3,2012).
3,"hence, early and regular detection of the invading species and rapid management response on both local and landscape level is crucial (rejmánek 2000; vilà and ibáñez 2011), and new techniques enabling timely, fast and precise monitoring are urgently needed (european commission 2008, 2014; van kleunen et al."
3,2015).
3,"remote sensing (rs) represents a promising option, potentially reducing the needs for extensive ﬁeld campaigns and connected costs (lawes and wallace 2008; buchanan et al."
3,2015; marvin et al.
3,2016).
3,"it has been successfully applied for some invasive species (for reviews, see c. and asner 2009; bradley 2014; rocchini et al. 2015), mostly for shrubs and trees (hamada et al."
3,2007; hantson et al.
3,2012; somodi et al.
3,2012).
3,the potential for invasive species monitoring has still not been fully exploited and detection algorithms are missing for the majority of invasive species.
3,"our species of interest, black locust (bl, robinia pseudoaccacia), an invasive north american tree widely planted in europe for centuries, is not much exploited although it is very common in europe."
3,"somodi et al. (2012) explored landsat and aerial data (red, green, blue (rgb) and rgb + near-infrared (nir)) potential for the species detection, comparing spring and summer imagery."
3,they determined the spring ﬂowering as an important for the species detection.
3,"wang et al. (2015) used combined spectral, spatial and textural information from ikonos imagery to assess the bl health conditions."
3,"by using spectral characteristics combined with texture measures, they were able to identify the forest health and characterize the spatial structure of stressed forests."
3,"data of very-high spatial resolution, such as from unmanned aerial system (uav), together with semi-automated, computer-assisted processing can enable cost-eﬀective, fast, and frequent monitoring in case of appropriate methodological approach (müllerová et al."
3,2016).
3,"for plant species detection, the proper timing of the rs data acquisition is important since some species might be better detected at certain pheno- logical stages (müllerová, pergl, and pyšek 2013)."
3,"uav can provide ﬂexible data acquisi- tion of very high spatial and temporal resolution data at very low costs, and is also suitable for targeted monitoring (e.g. focus on sites of high natural interest such as natura 2000 sites, areas prone to invasion, or those recently managed to check eradication eﬀectivity)."
3,"amongst the main limits are reduced spectral resolution com- pared to the satellite imagery, and the data degradation by geometrical distortions and other inhomogeneous artefacts (colomina and molina 2014; whitehead and hugenholtz 2014)."
3,the high spatial resolution may also result in ‘salt and pepper’ classiﬁcation in

4,unmanned platforms are being increasingly utilized in diverse scientiﬁc ﬁelds includ- ing ecology (whitehead et al.
4,2014; zweig et al.
4,2015).
4,majority of the used uav systems are based on multicopter aerial platforms (whitehead and hugenholtz 2014).
4,"since such type of platform is able to cover only limited areas due to the inherent energy demands of the rotorcraft concept, ﬁxed wing uavs are much better suited to the monitoring purpose, and their operational radius is restricted primarily by the legislation (most often requiring visual contact between the uav and its operator) rather than the capability of the platform itself."
4,this article aims at describing the cost-eﬀective and eﬃcient meth- odology of invasive plant species monitoring (one example of invasive bl) using purposely designed unmanned aerial system.
4,"compared to the commercial products, such as trimble/gatewing, sensefly ebee, aeromapper, and others, deployment of in- house developed system brings the advantage of reduced cost, operational experience and most importantly it can be easily adapted for the required payload."
4,"in our research, we seek for optimal low-cost solution of invasive species monitoring, applicable in both plant ecology and practical management."
4,"we describe methodology of application of uav for such purpose, assessing to what extent it can be used to analyse plant invasions (figure 1)."
4,methods 2.1.
4,the deployed unmanned system development of dedicated unmanned platform optimized for invasive species monitor- ing forms an important part of presented low-cost invasive monitoring solution.
4,"during the development, several aerial platforms were tested (table 1)."
4,"for the initial trials, a motorized glider concept was selected (vut 720, dvořák et al."
4,"2015, figure 2(a)) to take advantage of the low wing loading."
4,"combined with expanded polypropylene, a durable material featuring excellent impact properties, this concept ensures safe landings even in rugged terrain."

5,"unmanned systems used in the project – vut 720 (a), vut 712 (b), and vut 713 (c). launched with no need for additional equipment."
5,"however, vut 720 is able to carry only one camera (canon powershot s100) at a time."
5,the requirement to produce rgb + nir data for further classiﬁcation and research meant that two consecutive ﬂights had to be performed at each location.
5,"this procedure not only resulted in increased time spent at a single site, but also introduced signiﬁcant problems during image processing, as the lighting conditions often change during consecutive ﬂights making the radiometric corrections of the captured images more complex."
5,"therefore, a plat- form providing actively stabilized mount for two canon s100 cameras was devised – vut 712 (figure 2(b))."
5,data acquired by vut 712 showed higher quality compared to previous datasets in terms of both radiometric consistency and georeferencing accuracy.
5,our operational experience clearly shows that consumer point-and-shoot cameras such as canon s100 are not well suited for the harsh environmental conditions of repeated mapping missions.
5,"retractable zoom lenses of the cameras are inherently prone to (uncommanded) focal length changes, deteriorating the photogrammetric quality of acquired imagery."
5,"dust can easily penetrate the lens during landings, resulting in jammed lens and prolonged down-times of the platform."
5,deployment of dedicated multispectral cameras (such as micasense rededge) or an array of industrial grade cameras with spectral ﬁlters would overcome mentioned problems; however the costs would limit operational use.
5,"as a cost-eﬀective solution, ﬁxed pancake lens (sony e20/2.8) coupled to a lightweight mirrorless camera (sony a5100) has been deployed in a new platform – vut 713 (figure 2(c), table 2)."

7,the nir modiﬁed camera was especially aﬀected by this fact due to the longer wavelength of sensed light.
7,the aps-c (23.5 × 15.6 mm) sized sensor of sony a5100 camera provided nearly 8.8 times larger photosensitive area compared to the s100 camera.

7,triggering the sensors were periodically triggered during the ﬂight to cover the area of interest with suﬃcient image data.
7,signiﬁcant overlap was required for robust mosaicking.
7,"typically, the missions were ﬂown with overlap and sidelap ranging between 80% and 85% of the image height and width, respectively."
7,"to achieve homogenous coverage of the area, the following camera triggering strategies were employed: ● constant time between images (intervalometer)."
7,this strategy has been implemen- ted with the s100 cameras by means of modifying ﬁrmware (chdk 2013).
7,the ﬁrmware ran an in-house developed script based on kap 3.4 (kap 2015).
7,the script triggered the camera in preset intervals (2 s intervals are proven to be the shortest interval the canon s100 camera is able to maintain for prolonged periods).
7,this approach provided homogenous coverage under ideal conditions.
7,wind and atmo- spheric turbulence caused the images to be spaced unevenly in real world applica- tion because of the varying ground speed of unmanned platform.
7,● constant distance between images.
7,triggering was performed based on distance travelled by the uav – a value computed by an autopilot from gps data.
7,this approach ensured homogenous image coverage even with a strong wind during the mapping ﬂight.
7,the cameras needed to be capable to capture the imagery with suﬃcient frequency – sony a5100 cameras achieved 1 s intervals for prolonged periods.
7,2.2.3.
7,georeferencing structure-from-motion approach (sfm; dandois and ellis 2010; westoby et al. 2012) was used to generate the digital surface model (dsm) and resulting orthomosaic using agisoft photoscan software (agisoft 2016).
7,the sfm approach identiﬁes similar features in conjugate
8,"international journal of remote sensing 2183 images, tolerating large variations in scale and image acquisition geometry."
8,"even though photoscan has a simple interface with no possibility to control all the parameters, it is able to generate very dense and accurate three-dimensional point cloud (turner, lucieer, and watson 2012; whitehead and hugenholtz 2014)."
8,using uav data for monitoring of invasive species brings a principal advantage of very high spatial resolution.
8,"on the other hand, this resolution poses signiﬁcant demand for geometrical accuracy to ﬁt other ancillary or reference data such as aerial orthophoto or satellite vhr imagery or to carry out change detection using repeated data."
8,"since low- cost components are primarily preferred in our project, precise georeferencing of the ﬁnal image mosaics may be an issue, leading to unacceptable geometrical distortions and/or positional shifts."
8,several inputs inﬂuence the precision of ﬁnal orthomosaic.
8,"besides quality and type of the gps receiver and the measurement method itself, further limitations such as shutter lag or availability of gps corrections have to be considered."
8,"to overcome such deﬁciencies and for the overall improvement of the ﬁnal geome- trical accuracy, diﬀerent procedures were tested to evaluate the best setup balancing the accuracy and costs."
8,"at the ﬁrst phase, only gps built in the camera was used with original exif-based gps information."
8,accuracy achieved by such low-end camera gps burdened by high error rate up to several metres resulting in expected shifts of the processed orthomosaic.
8,inﬂuence of random misplacement of gps coordinates led to local diﬀerences up to ×10 m.
8,"alternatively, an aircraft/autopilot gps receiver (u-blox lea 6 h) with assumed higher accuracy was considered."
8,all trigger events were recorded by the camera with 10 ms accuracy by means of the in-house chdk script.
8,the resultant data log was synchronized with gps position log from autopilot during post-processing.
8,"in this case, the proper synchronization of exact gps position record and the image acquisition time is ques- tionable, since the time coherence of the two independent devices may diﬀer slightly resulting in a varying amount of misplacement."
8,"as an optimal solution, a gps module capable of raw data output (u-blox m8 t) was added to the autopilot."
8,triggering of the cameras was performed by the autopilot based on the distance travelled between the two consecutive images.
8,subsequently an auto- mated approach of image geotagging was developed: the ﬂight log records are used as a base to derive the correct coordinates.
8,the employed sony a5100 cameras are characterized by a stable 90 ms lag between the trigger event and the instant the shutter is actually released.
8,this lag is accounted for by the post-processing procedure.
8,"besides the time stamp of the camera trigger event, the gps position is continuously recorded during the ﬂight with a 5 hz frequency."
8,"due to the above mentioned shutter lag eﬀect, a linear interpolation between two closest gps log records is introduced to the ﬁnal calculation of each image coordinates."
8,"in addition, the gps coordinates were improved by post-processing using the rtklib – an open-source package (rtklib 2016) and the respective correction data from the local czech reference station network (czepos)."
8,diﬀerent settings were evaluated including the application of ionospheric map.
8,"an overview of positional variability is illustrated by figure 4, comparing original, enhanced and post-processed gps coordinates of the ﬂight path and geo-tagged images."

9,sfm method implemented within agisoft photoscan (agisoft 2016) for generation of rgb + nir orthomosaic enables diﬀerent parametrization to adapt the processing work- ﬂow according to the required purpose.
9,this may lead to balanced procedure reﬂecting the required radiometric and geometric quality at reasonable processing time.
9,"since two separate cameras were used continuously for rgb and nir, separate or co-processed option for computation is an option."
9,separate rgb processing results in appropriate image quality (figure 5(a)) with no visible artefacts in dsm (figure 6(a)).
9,"however, for proper vegetation mapping and monitoring the nir spectrum is crucial and, therefore, nir band needs to be co-registered with the other bands."
9,several tests of co-processed rgb and nir imagery revealed an obvious error in dsm generation causing ‘islands’ of unrealistic elevations and noisy point clouds (figure 6(b)).
9,"such artefacts are directly projected to orthomosaic generation causing blurred and deformed areas within the imagery with inﬂuence on classiﬁcation, reduced reliability (figure 6(e)) and higher spatial error (figure 5(b))."
9,even the fastest processing option using sparse point cloud method from rgb imagery results in better spatial accuracy (figure 5(a)).
9,dense point cloud method applied to rgb data also produces more accurate results (figure 5(b)) and is still faster than rgb and nir co-processing.
9,aggressive depth ﬁltering during the dense point cloud generation can be used to alleviate the aforementioned problems (figure 6(c)).
9,"however, highly detailed dsm based on the dense point is prone to create mosaic artefacts in areas of complex patterns and steep dsm transitions."
9,"to minimize the distortions, the generated dsm can be exported with signiﬁcantly lower spatial resolution (a factor of 100 seems to ensure balanced results) and re-imported for the orthomosaic creation – resulting in a smoother surface"

10,"orthomosaics were generated using sparse point cloud based dsm from vis images (a); dense point cloud based dsm from vis and nir images (b), and from vis images only (c)."
10,"the mean error of orthomosaics for vut 712 was 2.56 m ± 0.38 (a), 4.82 m ± 2.07 (b), and 2.56 m ± 0.35 (c), whereas for vut 713 it was 0.99 m ± 0.26 (a), 2.60 m ± 1.03 (b), and 1.44 m ± 0.40 (c)."
10,x and y shifts are summarized in (d).

10,"alternatively, an external standard image processing software or package can be used for resampling combined with further ﬁltering (extreme or missing values, etc.)."
10,"as a result, most of the artefacts are eliminated and overall image quality is enhanced (figure 6(f)), and the original detailed dsm is preserved as a suitable ancillary data source for classiﬁcation (e.g. vegetation height and heterogeneity)."
10,the vut 713 equipped with sony a5100 camera produced the most spatially precise results independent from the orthomosaic processing settings (figure 5(d)).
10,field data collection field data are crucial for successful training of automatic/semiautomatic algorithms and for validation purposes.

11,this is especially true in forested environment where the estimated precision drops to several decimetres or even metres.
11,the diﬀerential gps would also be costly and time consum- ing option for large scale ﬁeld data collection.
11,"to overcome mentioned problems, we decided to use a ﬁeld computer (a tablet with android os to decrease the costs) with uav imagery or other available orthomosaics as a base for manual delineation of invasive species patches in the ﬁeld with a help of integrated gps."

13,"in ideal conditions, it can grow up to 30 m tall, however, if water limited can take the shrubby dwarf appearance with unshaped crown and deformed trunk of 3–5 m."
13,"it is native to the southeastern usa, listed amongst the 40 most invasive woody angiosperms globally (richardson and rejmánek 2011), categorized as highly invasive in several international databases (daisie, cabi, nobanis, eppo, issg) and mentioned in national black lists in many countries (nehring et al."

13,deliberate planting and transport of soil containing seeds and roots represent the main vectors for its long- distance dispersal (pyšek et al.

13,it is extremely resistant to disturbance; mechanical damage of roots or trunks causes an increase in stem density and rejuvenation (kowarik 1996).
13,"moreover, it colonizes a broad range of xeric to mesic habitats, including steep rocks or toxic man-made substrata (vítková and kolbek 2010; vítková, tonika, and müllerová 2015; cierjacks et al."

13,"as a nitrogen ﬁxing species living in symbiosis with rhizobium bacteria (batzli, graves, and berkum 1992) it increases soil nitrogen (van miegroet and cole 1984; vítková, tonika, and müllerová 2015), supporting expansion of nitrophilous plants (vítková and kolbek 2010)."
13,"if invading grasslands, it can cause scrub encroachment and canopy closure due to its fast growth, inﬂuencing considerably the light and microclimatic conditions of invaded habitats."
13,"this is especially true for dry and semi-dry grasslands, sites of high natural value, where it can cause extinction of many endangered light-demanding plants and invertebrates (kowarik 1996; matus, tóthmérész, and papp 2003; vítková and kolbek 2010)."
13,"other threatened habitat types are open dry forests, scrublands, alluvial habitats, agrarian landscapes, urban and industrial environments, and disturbed sites, such as post-ﬁre sites, forest clearings, and degraded forestry plantations."
13,"removal of the species is costly and time-consuming,"

14,study area and analysed data study area is located in central part of czech republic in typical central european agricultural landscape of ﬂat lowlands surrounding the river elbe.
14,it consists of managed mixed forests surrounded by arable ﬁelds.
14,"forests are composed of native oak forests with variable proportion of elm, scots pine and lime, and plantations of scots pine and bl (both in monocultures and admixture)."
14,two sites named kozlovice (site 1) and podvlčí (site 2) were covered by repeated uav campaigns using vut 712 and vut 713; figure 7).
14,in ﬂat terrain of the study site 1 (37 ha; bl was used for stabilization of aeolian sands and is therefore planted in monocultures altered by monocultures of scots pine or mixed stands with old native oaks.
14,bl plantations are regenerated by coppicing in stripes.
14,the study site 2 (30 ha) is a reclamation dump site from a nearby power station.
14,"bl stands are located on both slope and ﬂat parts of the spoil tip, mostly in mixed stands with admixture of scots pine, poplar, willow and birch."
14,bl stands are unmanaged and younger compared to the site 1.

15,the image was acquired on 30 august 2013 and covered the site 2 (figure 8).
15,rpc (rational polynomial coeﬃcients) metadata provided with the imagery and detailed dsm were used for orthorectiﬁcation.
15,the quality of spatial accuracy of the orthomosaic was visually inspected by comparison to national aerial orthophoto (cuzk 2015).
15,classiﬁcation and validation pixel-based approach was explored for classiﬁcation.
15,supervised maximum likelihood (ml) and support vector machines (svm) algorithms were tested.
15,reason for choosing svm was that this algorithm is supposed to be less susceptible to the noise and unbalanced or limited number/size of training sites (see camps-valls and bruzzone 2009).
15,training classes were selected with the main purpose to distinguish amongst invasive bl and other types of vegetation.
15,"for each site and data, separate class signatures were generated, and subsequently the site 1 class signatures were applied to the uav data from the site 2 acquired at the same day."
15,"to include the texture (surface heterogeneity/roughness) and context of the classiﬁed pixel into the classiﬁcation process, information on surface structure were derived from dsm generated as a by-product of uav processing."
15,"standard deviation and range of surface elevations parameters were tested using moving window of 5 × 5, 10 × 10, 50 × 50, and 100 × 100 pixels with range of 50 × 50 pixel window being the most informative."
15,this information was included in classiﬁcation as an additional layer.
15,due to
16,"international journal of remote sensing 2191 geolocation inaccuracies of dsm and unavailability of detailed digital terrain model (dtm), precise vegetation height could not be calculated."
16,"validation was performed using 200 randomly distributed points at each site outside the training areas, with ca. half within the bl stands."
16,"user’s accuracy (ua; ratio of the correctly classiﬁed and total classiﬁed, evaluating reliability of the results for the user), producer’s accuracy (pa; ratio of the correctly classiﬁed and observed), and kappa analysis (conditional kappa index evaluating the statistical signiﬁcance of the classiﬁca- tions, considers the actual agreement of the class in relation to the chance agreement, congalton and green 1999; foody 2002) of bl detection were calculated from error matrices."
16,"kappa statistics, despite the strong criticism due to the randomness used as a baseline (pontius and millones 2011), is still a widely used mean of the accuracy measure providing an opportunity to compare our results with other studies."
16,"detection results the accuracies achieved for the invasive bl were very high, with uav imagery providing better results (up to 92/81% and 75/92% pa/ua for site 1 and 2, respectively) compared to the satellite imagery (wv-2; up to 61/81% pa/ua)."
16,"ml and svm algorithms reached similarly high accuracies in most cases (figures 8 and 9), still svm seem to be less prone to the distortion artefacts of orthomosaic."
16,"including surface roughness derived from dsm of uav origin helped in discriminating forests from arable ﬁelds, since bl was figure 9."

17,the spectral signatures derived from training classes at site 1 were applied to the classiﬁcation of site 2 with moderate agreement of 73/81% pa/ua and 0.66 conditional kappa (for ml algorithm; svm gave very poor results).
17,due to the diﬀerences in spectral sensitivities of sensors the signatures could not be transferred between uav and satellite data.
17,also the class signatures incorporating the surface roughness did not give satis- factory results if applied from one site to the other.
17,"the uav ﬂight campaign in 2015 was organized to capture bl in ﬂower, however since the trees did not ﬂower simultaneously even at the same site, only several trees were actually ﬂowering on the orthomosaic (visible in white on figure 9, uppermost part)."
17,"nevertheless this fact did not deteriorate the detection results, probably thanks to good separability from other tree species in nir part of the spectrum based on leave and not only ﬂower signatures (figure 10)."
17,discussion an important step in application of uav approach in invasive monitoring seem to be generation of precise combined rgb + nir orthomosaic from uav images acquired during the ﬂight campaign.
17,this is because the nir part of the spectrum is very important for the plant recognition as demonstrated here on case of bl.
17,"for further processing such as classiﬁcation and validation, it is important to achieve high precision in both co-registration of the channels and geolocation of the imagery."
17,the target accuracy should therefore meet the condition of possible inter-comparison with other
18,international journal of remote sensing 2193 eo sources as satellite imagery or repeated acquisition to avoid possible mismatches within the given target resolution for change monitoring.
18,"in our research, we replaced an initial setup of separate rgb and nir acquisition by continuous imaging of both spectra on the newer unmanned platform vut 713."
18,"since the image quality and positional accuracy were still not satisfactory, further adaptations were introduced to improve the overall quality."
18,a diﬀerential global positioning system (dgps) module was added to the autopilot setup to increase positional accuracy of camera stations.
18,"raw gps data stored in the autopilot log served as an input into the automated geotagging workﬂow along with czepos correction data, ionosphere map, and shutter lag correction."
18,this approach belongs to the post-processed kinematics (ppk) class of methods being currently employed by a growing number of commercial and academic bodies (kais et al.
18,2005).
18,"compared to the real-time kinematics approach, it is more robust, not relying on the datalink between rover and base stations."
18,it also features lower cost due to less hardware required.
18,the overall aim of the developed geotagging workﬂow is to eliminate laborious gcp collection and measurements for operational service.
18,"the distribution of reference gcps may be limited by site disposition, for example, continuous tree cover may restraint the selection excluding the central forested part of the site."
18,the tests of diﬀerent settings of dsm generation proved the advantage of our concept of dsm resampling to eliminate various defects caused by highly detailed dsm.
18,such procedure expelled most of the artefacts and thus reduced subsequent classiﬁcation errors.
18,still further evaluation of parametrization during the data proces- sing is needed to comprehensively evaluate the inﬂuence of partial processing steps on ﬁnal imagery used for classiﬁcation.
18,co-processing of both rgb and nir imagery results in lower spatial accuracy than rgb orthomosaic alone and extend the time needed for its processing.
18,"however as demonstrated here, the nir data are indispensable for bl classiﬁcation and proper co-registration with rgb data is more important than the temporal co-registration."
18,"accuracy of invasive bl detection from uav orthomosaics was very high, although values of acceptable classiﬁcation accuracy presented in the literature diﬀer consider- ably, ranging from 70% (pringle et al. 2009) to 85% for pa and ua (foody 2002), and 0.61 for kappa (landis and koch 1977)."
18,"our accuracies felt within this range, signifying good to excellent agreement."
18,lower accuracies for satellite wv-2 imagery were probably due to lower spatial resolution; still diﬀerent timing could also play a role.
18,this must be proved by further tests analysis of uav imagery acquired in diﬀerent periods of the vegetation season.
18,"measures of textural and spatial context can augment results of classiﬁcation in case the spectral information is not suﬃcient (wang et al. 2015), such as mixing arable land and bl stands (somodi et al."
18,2012).
18,"using range of elevation values instead of vegetation height derived by subtraction of dsm to existing dtm can overcame the problem of geolocation impreciseness, since it only deﬁnes relative diﬀerences within the deﬁned neighbourhood."
18,"in case of abrupt change in surface height, such as at the border of forest/non forest, it brought noise into the classiﬁcation, however since in our case non forest areas at the borders with forest were shaded (and classiﬁed as ‘shade’), it did not inﬂuence the quality of the ﬁnal results."
19,2194 j.
19,müllerová et al.
19,"the timing of the data acquisition can be crucial in plant detection, since plants are often best recognized during ﬂowering time (everitt, escobar, and davis 2001; müllerová, pergl, and pyšek 2013)."
19,according to somodi et al.
19,"(2012), bl is the best separable during ﬂowering however this approach has following drawbacks impeding practical application: (a) bl individuals do not ﬂower exactly at the same time even at the same site, and (b) the time window for ﬂowering is very short (1–2 weeks) and diﬃcult to predict (depending very much on may temperatures in particular year)."
19,"in our study we found that if the data provide high spatial detail (uav) and include nir band, the species is separable very well even if not ﬂowering."
19,"importance of nir band for discrimination of vegetation was reported from previous studies (everitt, yang, and deloach 2005; wang et al."
19,2015).
19,in our further research we would like to explore the potential beneﬁts of sequence of orthomosaics with diﬀerent timing in discriminating tree species (such as in hill et al.
19,2010).
19,"for this approach precise georeferencing is indispensable, therefore, we will continue testing the methodology of data pre-processing to make the workﬂow as simple and automatic as possible (reducing the manual input such as gcp collection) and robust at the same time."
19,reduction of geometric distortions on the uav orthomo- saics will enable us to test the object-based approach accounting for the spatial structure and context information (blaschke 2010).
19,"this approach is expected to improve the results by reducing the eﬀects of shadows, within-class spectral variation and miss- registration (laliberte, browning, and rango 2012; tewkesbury et al."
19,2015).
19,conclusions the article presents and discusses application of low cost uav technology in environ- mental monitoring.
19,"our study showed that uav data are well suitable for detection of selected invasive species (bl in our case), still processing of the data (mainly creation of the orthomosaic) can be problematic and must be handled with care."
19,"we provide evidence that good results can be obtained using a low cost solution of unmanned system composed from aﬀordable oﬀ-the-shelf components such as radio controlled (rc) airplanes and consumer cameras modiﬁed for rgb/nir spectrum in case the right methodology is applied to the important steps of image acquisition, pre-processing (mosaicking and georeferencing), ground-truthing and classiﬁcation."
19,"for practical appli- cation of this novel, ﬂexible and cheap tool in plant invasion management as well as other environmental actions, well proven and tested methodology is crucial, and our study brings insights in this area."
