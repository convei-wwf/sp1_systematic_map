3,"macauley been available for three decades, virtually since humans have had the ability to place spacecraft into earth orbit."
3,"viewed more broadly, remote sensing via satellite is an extension of an ability already available through other means of aerial photography (such as aircraft)."
3,"however, new developments are bringing remote sensing satellite technology from the relatively obscure domains of oil companies and military strategists to the attention of us policy makers and others concerned with ¿he social, political, and economic consequences of access to and distribution of information."
3,"one such development is the increasing prominence of information technol- ogy in public policy making generally and in privacy infringement in particular.2 speculation and debate over the funding, capability, pricing, and industrial organization of the ""national information infrastructure"" is but one prominent manifestation of this interest."
3,"the use of telecommunications technology for billing and electronic funds transfer, data gathering and storage, transportation and energy control, entertainment delivery, and message interception and en- cryption are all stimulating concern with the degree to which persons and governments should be permitted access to information about or generated by other persons and governments (trubow, 1990; benjamin, 1991; bing, 1993; lee, 1993; us congress, office of technology assessment, 1993; onsrud et al, 1994)."
3,"the evaluation, design, and implementation of privacy policies in the wake of the increasing capability of electronic information technology are complicated further by the trend away from a world where a single private or public telephone company controls everything, to a realm of disaggregated, pro- prietary, sometimes interconnected and sometimes competing networks."
3,both technological advances and economic restructuring apply to remote sensing satellites.
3,"in the not too distant future the resolution of images from satellite photographs will enable observers to identify objects no larger than a metre in size, and perhaps smaller."
3,"this will allow detailed observation of personal movements, objects stored and used on private land, corporate pro- duction runs and inventories, and public personnel and military deployments."
3,"moreover, within the last decade the ability to generate and sell such images has become the province of international, private markets."
3,"consequently, the techno- logical means of supplying these observations via satellite is no longer restricted to those few governments capable of space exploration."
3,"remote sensing satellite photography has become widely available to private parties and government entities, who can contract for images through a number of unregulated service providers competing in international markets."
3,"while technological advances and economic reorganization are rocketing remote sensing satellites up the policy charts, concurrent developments in us constitutional law are raising the possibility that persons are becoming ever more vulnerable to unauthorized searches, particularly by law enforcement agencies.3 an important instructive example is florida v."
3,"riley* in that case, the state of florida convicted michael riley of possession of marijuana, using photographs taken from a helicopter hovering four hundred feet above a greenhouse (with missing roof panels) on mr riley's property."
3,"mr riley ap- pealed his conviction, arguing that the helicopter overflights, undertaken with- out warrant, violated his fourth amendment rights against unreasonable searches."
3,"the us supreme court upheld his conviction, reversing both the florida court of appeals and the florida supreme court."
3,"it found that riley ""could not reasonably have expected that his greenhouse was protected from"
4,"remote sensing satellites and privacy 235 public or official observation from a helicopter"", and that he had not met his burden of showing that such flights were either sufficiently rare or outside legal airspace to justify such an expectation.5 this decision, following similar decisions limiting constitutional protections against warrantless searches, suggests that using remote sensing satellites to gather ostensibly private information is likely to be unconstrained by law or policy absent new legislation or, at least in the us, significant reversals of recent constitutional interpretations."
4,"our purpose here is to explicate the considerations policy makers should analyse in determining how, if at all, to control the use and availability of information gathered by remote sensing satellites."
4,"section 2 describes the current and forthcoming capabilities of remote sensing technology, including the ease (or lack thereof) with which satellites provide newer or less expensive means for uncovering otherwise private information."
4,section 3 offers a framework for evaluating the need for policy regarding rss data flows.
4,"while we discuss the intrinsic value of privacy, we emphasize the economic and social objectives privacy rights instrumentally promote, such as incentives to generate infor- mation and to promote competition of co-operation."
4,"we propose some general- izations on the effects and desirability of rss-supplied information, based on the relationships between the observer and the observed."
4,"section 4 applies the framework to four categories of problematic situations, depending upon whether the observer or the observed are private parties or governmental entities."
4,section 5 makes some brief concluding remarks regarding policy.
4,remote sensing satellites—capabilities and availability satellite remote sensing operates by way of sensors mounted on spacecraft orbiting several hundred miles above the earth's surface.
4,"the sensors measure reflected solar radiation, or in some cases, emit their own radiation and measure the amount reflected back."
4,recording and transmitting devices collect and send- the data to earth.
4,parameters of the spacecraft's orbit determine how frequently the craft will pass over the same area on the earth; typically it is once every couple of days6.
4,the information content of remote sensing data depends on the spectral and spatial resolution of the sensors.
4,spectral resolution is the distinguishing of an object based on its own radiated energy (e.g. sand vs dedduous forest) or in contrast with the object's background (e.g. a ship on the ocean).
4,spatial resol- ution is the distinguishing of objects based on their size.
4,"sensors operated for national security purposes are reportedly able to distinguish objects of several centimetres (steele, 1991, p. 318), such as numbers on licence plates."
4,"at the present time, sensors operated by or marketed to civilians generate images in ranges from thirty down to five metres (steele, 1991, p."
4,"319)7 all remote sensing satellites functioning today are government-owned and operated; these include dvilian satellites launched by the united states, the former ussr, japan, canada, france, india, and europe."
4,"article ii of the outer space treaty (united nations, 27 jan, 1967) grants the right of satellites to pass over international boundaries with impunity."
4,"property rights to the data reside with the governments owning the spacecraft, although non-binding (and much debated) un prindples on remote sensing address access and distribution of data among sensing and sensed states (united nations, 1987)."
4,states that possess information useful for averting harmful phenomena are required to disclose the

5,"macauley information to concerned states, for instance."
5,"more generally, information avail- able to sensing states is to be made available to sensed states on the same terms governing availability in the sensing states."
5,"historically, in addition to owning and operating the rss spacecraft, govern- ments have also managed data distribution, access, and pricing."
5,"more recently, quasi-public institutions have been given licences by their respective govern- ments (including the us, russia, and france) to sell data commercially."
5,"in the cases of both public and quasi-public management of the data a variety of pricing policies govern data sales, including ""free"" data made available to government agencies and scientific researchers, data sold at the cost of repro- duction to these entities as well as the private sector, and data sold at closer to ""market"" prices."
5,"data pricing policy remains an unsettled public policy issue, however, as governments seek to balance the competing objectives of maximiz- ing data availability by distributing the data freely, and recouping at least some operating and/or investment costs of the satellite systems by charging for the data."
5,"charging no or low prices for data, and the absence of studies of the value of the content of the data, have rendered it quite difficult to measure the net benefits of investment in the systems."
5,"the calculus is further complicated by the public and private goods nature of the information, in that it has both public value (for example, environmental monitoring) and private value (for instance, geologic exploration).8 beginning in 1993, the organization of the remote sensing industry began to change significantly."
5,"for the first time, private firms proposed what most experts see as viable business plans for the launch and operation, beginning in the late 1990s, of remote sensing satellites exclusively for commercial gain."
5,"moreover, the sensors would operate at one- to three-metre spatial resolution—much higher resolution than previously available for non-military purposes."
5,"very detailed data, collected remotely and concerning a host of activities, will now be commercially available and are likely to introduce new issues in the control and use of information."
5,"the types of information able to be collected are likely to be virtually unlimited, including data about use of land and other resources; industrial activities, including some kinds of air and water emissions; and other natural and anthropogenic processes."
5,"justifications for privacy rights to understand how this availability of the capabilities of remote sensing via satellite is worthy of policy concern, we begin with some generalizations about the ethical and economic consequences of the distribution and use of the sort of private information these satellites may be able to gather."
5,"as noted earlier, we emphasize here the benefits and costs of privacy and its loss as instrumental tools for achieving social, political and economic goals."
5,"these effects will depend on the relationships among the observer, the observed, and relevant third parties."
5,"however, no discussion of privacy is complete without assessing values associated with the intrinsic worth of personhood which privacy may also protect."
5,"intrinsic and instrumental foundations for privacy rights: personhood, consent, and efficiency two dimensions of the various definitions of privacy figure prominently in the"
6,"remote sensing satellites and privacy 237 literature (schoeman, 1984)."
6,"the first, typified by the aphorisms ""a man's home is his castle"" and ""the right to be let alone"" (hixson, 1987 pp. 13, 28), is based on the capacity of the individual to assert situations in which he or she can act without actual or potential concern with the actions of others."
6,"this would include being free from unwanted calls or visits, not having to see or (over)hear neighbours, and other means by which one establishes a separate physical and mental sphere of existence for one's self."
6,"along with this spatial dimension of privacy, there is a somewhat related but conceptually separate dimension associated with information control."
6,"along this second dimension, one would define privacy in terms of the information by or about an agent which that agent can effectively conceal from others (posner, 1983; wasserstrom, 1984)."
6,"as such, this informational dimension of privacy may apply to groups, corporations or governments, as well as individuals."
6,privacy in its spatial and informational aspects protects both intrinsic values associated with personhood and instrumental values associated with the ability of agents to exploit information to achieve separate and collective goals.
6,"one category of intrinsic values that privacy protects relates to the content of the space and information protected, insofar as that space and information are themselves morally important constituents of what it means to be a person (reúnan, 1984; griffin, 1990, pp."
6,228-233).
6,a second is that space and infor- mation control are necessary for the preservation of other important constituents of personhood.
6,"these include the ability to maintain social relationships (fried, 1984; rachels, 1984), to generate respect for personhood (benn, 1984), and to preserve the ability to render autonomous consent (gavison, 1984)."
6,"as these arguments follow directly or indirectly from the intrinsic values over personhood, they do not lend a great deal of support for rights of collective organizations—churches, corporations, clubs, and governments—to control in- formation about themselves or to delineate separate space."
6,"more notably, these intrinsic considerations are, of necessity, grounded in moral intuitions regarding intrinsic worth, the evaluation of which is beyond our scope here.9 much of the controversy over privacy in general, and the use of remote sensing technology in particular, can be illuminated by looking at an instrumental approach, in which we treat privacy as one of a host of legal constructions designed to see that information is produced and distributed in such a way as to maximize social benefits at the least cost.10 this conception of privacy follows from coase's characterization of property rights not as a manifestation of secure, intrinsically valuable relations between persons and things, but as a tool for ensuring that mutually agreeable transac- tions result in the allocation of things to those persons who can put them to the most valuable use (coase, i960).11 a tenet of the so-called ""coase theorem"" is that if the costs of these transactions are low and wealth effects are inconsequen- tial, it does not matter who gets the property right, as long as someone does; ex post transactions will ensure that the resource is used efficiently."
6,"if not, courts or legislatures may need to assign rights to particular parties, to promote distribu- tive equity or to increase the chances that the rights will be put to an efficient use (posner, 1992, pp."
6,49-54).
6,"along these lines, privacy rights vis-à-vis remote sensing technology could be considered as just another kind of property right, in this case over the ability to control a delineated personal space or access to specified information."
6,"if the coase theorem holds, privacy rights would not matter."
6,if exclusive control over

7,"macauley the information is more valuable to the observed than access is to the observer, then the observed could, in principle, pay the observer not to observe."
7,"however, there are several reasons to think that rss information may not satisfy the assumptions of the coase theorem, and that it matters who has the right."
7,"considerations warranting granting control rights to the observed are that there is an effectively unlimited number of potential observers who would need to be bought off, thus precluding effective control even if the value of the information to the observer exceeds the value to the observed."
7,"the flip side of the coin is that granting control to observed parties may lead to excessive restrictions on remote observation, where permission from multiple parties would be necessary before an observer could use or market an image."
7,"when there is but one observed party and one interested observer, e.g. two countries in a bilateral trade agreement, the absence of competitive opportunities and inevitable asymmetric information may prevent efficient resolution of whether rss observation should be permit- ted.12 the fact that a party in country a may employ an rss firm in country b, leasing technology provided by country c, to observe someone in country d exacerbates any problems in reaching mutually agreeable and enforceable bar- gains."
7,"in light of these complications, it would be unwise to reach a categorical judgment that rss technology should either be unfettered or proscribed."
7,the task for the policy maker is to identify conditions enabling qualitative predic- tions regarding the effects and desirability of permitting remote sensing.
7,"we begin by examining the consequences of observing private information in general, and then apply our findings to remote satellite sensing."
7,"adversarial and cooperative relationships between the observer and the observed from the standpoint of the economics of information, invasions of privacy in general, and remote satellite sensing in particular, reduce or eliminate the possibility that the observed will know something about herself that the ob- server does not know."
7,one way of viewing the situation is that the observed is less able to maintain exclusive use and control of this information; a second way is that remote sensing reduces asymmetry between the observer and the ob- served.
7,"the complex effects of exclusivity and asymmetry in information have been extensively investigated (reinganum, 1989; tiróle, 1989; hirshleifer & riley, 1992)."
7,"in contexts most likely to pertain to remote sensing, the likely effects of eliminating exclusivity and asymmetry appear to depend upon whether the relationships between the observer and the observed are adversarial or cooperative."
7,"a useful way to present these effects is to distinguish ex post effects on the relationships between the observed and observed, i.e. where the agent to be observed already has the information sought by the observer, from ex ante effects of the prospect of ex post observation on the incentives to generate that infor- mation."
7,consider first some of the ex post effects in situations where the observed and observer are adversaries.
7,"if they are competitors in economic markets, the intensity of that competition will likely be reduced."
7,"for example, the value of plans to cut price, increase production runs, and change product designs can fall when a firm knows that its competitor can leam about those plans and respond more quickly with countering strategies.13 a similar conclusion holds if the competitors are governments engaged in diplomatic conflict."
7,"in general, we"
8,remote sensing satellites and privacy 239 would expect that the inability to keep information private will limit the intensity of competition based on that information.14 that inability to keep information private renders it less valuable ex post for adversarial purposes implies that the prospect of observation will reduce ex ante incentives to generate such information.
8,perhaps the clearest examples arise in intellectual property situations.
8,"persons will be less likely to incur the cost in time, energy, and material in undertaking research or producing artistic works if they cannot retain sufficient control over the information embodied in the fruits of those efforts to recoup their expenses."
8,"patent and copyright law offer some assurance of such control but, as posner (1983, p. 243) observes, ""[s]ecrecy is an important social instrument for encouraging the production of information, especially in settings where the formal rights system in intellectual property is undeveloped."""
8,"in the case of rss, such ""undeveloped"" settings include, in some cases, the actual undertaking of r&d expenses themselves (when these can be viewed from space—say, through changes in physical plant or plant operations), resource exploration, or commercialization plans (again, when manifested in actions viewable from space), none of which is directly protected through property law."
8,different conclusions follow regarding the effects of observation when the relationship between the observer and the observed is characterized by the intent to cooperate.
8,"such relationships typically include those between buyers and sellers, who achieve gains from the ability to trade, and between principals and agents, who can mutually benefit when the latter can successfully work to achieve the former's goals."
8,"in these contexts, eliminating information asym- metries can help make the co-operation work better."
8,"ex post, the ability of an observer to watch an observed party will limit the latter's incentive to take advantage of the former."
8,"for example, if the observer is a rental car company and the observed is a renter, the ability of the former to observe will keep the latter from abusing the rented car."
8,a more general set of examples is that parties are more likely to enter into contracts with each other—a form of cooperation—if breaches of those contracts can be prevented through penalties based on their detection (this ex post exploitation of an on-going relationship is known as moral hazard).
8,"as we discuss below, examples where rss data may improve co-operat- ive arrangements in this context include monitoring environmental degradation or the use of other common property resources."
8,observation can improve the prospects for mutual co-operation when the information exists ex ante.
8,"otherwise, cooperation can be rendered impossible through adverse selection."
8,"the classic example, due to akerlof (1970), involves the market for used cars, under the assumption that buyers cannot observe what sellers know to be true about the quality of the cars sold."
8,inability to verify the quality of a particular car means that buyers would pay a price reflecting the average expected value of a car.
8,sellers who know they have better cars would tend to hold them off the market.
8,"doing so depresses the average price, further encouraging sellers of better cars not to sell, eventually leaving only the lemons."
8,"to the extent that observation eliminates the asymmetry between the buyer and seller, both should find it easier to reach beneficial agreements."
8,"while the discussion to this point emphasizes reductions in information asymmetries, it is crucially important to recognize that, more than many other observation technologies, remote sensing satellites may also create other asym- metries in information."
8,"most important, the observed does not know that"
9,240 t.
9,brennan & m.
9,macauley previously private information is now in the hands of an observer.
9,"with terrestrial observation, the observed party has, at least in principle, the ability to look back at the observer along the same line of sight, and with the same observational equipment."
9,"aerial observation provides a natural warning, through the noise that airplanes and helicopters make."
9,"in contrast, observed persons will typically have no direct way of knowing that they are the subject of high-resolution orbital photography."
9,"the satellites cannot be detected from the ground very easily, and, even if they were, parties on the ground will have no way to determine whether the satellite is photographing them, some other terrestrial feature, or nothing at all."
9,"to some extent, sophisticated parties, knowledgeable of the cost and capabilities of rss technology, might be able to infer the likelihood that their activities are under observation."
9,"if an observed party knows that benefits of a satellite photograph of its activities to an observer exceed the commercial price of these photographs, it would be irrational not to expect that one is being observed."
9,"still, rss policy formulation should take into account the strong possibility that while rss reduces advantages to the observed party from having private information, it may confer strategic benefits to the observer from the secrecy of the observation."
9,these considerations suggest a first generalization: improving the ability of observers to obtain information from the observed will inhibit rivalry and promote cooperation between them.
9,"remote sensing satellites will have these effects to the extent that they inhibit exclusivity and eliminate asymmetry although, as just noted, they may create new asymmetries just as they eliminate old ones."
9,whether inhibiting rivalry or promoting co-operation is good or bad is the subject to which we now turn.
9,substitution and complementarity between the observer and the observed common wisdom typically regards adversarial relationships as bad and co-oper- ative relationships as good.
9,"if reducing exclusivity and asymmetry does gener- ally inhibit rivalry and promote co-operation, it follows that technologies such as rss that permit the invasion of privacy are beneficial, at least on instrumental grounds."
9,"as some of the examples supporting that generalization indicate, however, the common wisdom is not always valid."
9,the most obvious example of the benefits of rivalry and the costs of co-operation is when the rivals are competitors in economic markets.
9,"since adam smith (1953, orig. 1776), self-inter- ested rivalry has been recognized as providing the impetus for sellers to develop and supply the goods and services buyers demand and at the lowest price consistent with recovering costs."
9,"conversely, the premise that co-operation among competitors is generally bad underlies antitrust and competition policy laws imposing civil and criminal penalties for fixing prices, rigging bids, and allocating customers."
9,the common wisdom did not become that by perverse accident.
9,"in numerous contexts, co-operation rather than rivalry promotes the interests of the general public."
9,"the ability to find and purchase a good at a reasonable price inherently involves extensive co-ordination among workers, capitalists, resource suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers."
9,"""firms"" themselves have been regarded as essentially just collections of implicit and explicit contractual obligations designed toward common business objectives (alchian & demsetz, 1972)."
9,other social institutions that provide collective goods for their members—
10,"remote sensing satellites and privacy 241 families, churches, associations, local and national governments—depend on co-operation to achieve those ends."
10,"in the largest context, international agree- ments to secure peace or preserve the environment require co-operation as well."
10,"to the extent the first generalization holds, the ability of parties in these co-operative contexts to observe each others' relevant actions should ameliorate adverse selection, discourage moral hazard, and increase the incentives and effectiveness of this co-operation."
10,"as with the above discussion of the effects of remote sensing on informational asymmetry, there is a noteworthy qualification."
10,"in many cases, the motivation for rivalry is not to profit from the creation of new benefits, e.g. from lower prices, but from the opportunity to capture benefits that have been or would be reaped by others."
10,"examples from the economic literature include inefficient patent races (hirshleifer & riley, 1992, pp. 266-271), excessive entry into non- competitive markets (schwartz, 1989), and ""rent-seeking"", i.e. expenditures to achieve government protection of one's profits from competition (spulber, 1989, pp."
10,82-83).
10,"in these cases, the underlying objectives—innovation, lower prices, freedom to petition the government—are sufficiently compelling that the theor- etical possibility of excessive activity has not warranted policy intervention."
10,we see no reason to treat rivalry differently in assessing remote satellite sensing.
10,"these observations suggest a second generalization: when the observed and observing parties provide goods and services that substitute for one another, i.e. when dealing with one of them reduces the need to deal with the other, then adversarial relationships are good, co-operation bad, and technological threats to exclusivity of information are undesirable."
10,"when the observed and observing parties provide goods and service that complement one another, i.e. where dealing with one encourages dealing with the other, then rivalry is undesirable, co-operation is good, and the ability for parties to observe each other becomes good.15 combining this generalization with the above generalization regarding the effects of remote sensing leads to a third observation: rss technology is likely to be beneficial when parties provide complements; less likely to be beneficial when they provide substitutes—recognizing that secret, unanticipated observation via satellite may mitigate these benefits."
10,applications within and between the public and private sectors these policy generalizations involve broad assessments of the justifications for private control of information and the effects of observations that prevent such control.
10,"to apply these specifically to remote sensing satellites, we identify four contexts depending upon whether the observer is a private party or a govern- ment, and whether the observed is a private party or government."
10,"private parties as both observed and observer we expect that for the reasonably foreseeable future, the expense of rss photographs will imply that the likely private purchasers of such data will be business enterprises rather than individuals."
10,"consequently, the privacy implica- tions created by rss technology in the private sector are likely to involve the potential for various forms of industrial espionage."
10,the distinction between substitutes and complements probably most clearly informs policy in this context.
10,one important industrial use of satellite photography would be to
11,242 l /.
11,brennan & m.
11,macauley monitor collusive agreements among firms selling substitute products in compe- tition with one another.
11,"such photographs could allow firms to tell when their ostensible cartel partners were increasing production runs or delivering prod- ucts into territories reserved for other sellers, in violation of price-fixing or market allocation agreements."
11,"the ability to detect ""cheating"" on pacts not to compete is a prerequisite for their enforcement (carlton & perloff, 1990, p."
11,"in this case, by permitting easier enforcement of collusive arrangements, rss may facilitate the economic harms associated with monopoly."
11,rss will typically have more benign effects when the relationships between the private parties are complementary.
11,"for example, suppose an automobile manufacturer and one of its parts suppliers enter into a contract stipulating that the supplier sell exclusively to that manufacturer."
11,"rationales for such exclusion include a guarantee that the supplier does not disclose the automobile manufac- turer's proprietary information to other car companies, and that the parts supplier exercises appropriate quality control efforts on the manufacturer's behalf (brennan, 1989b)."
11,"rss technology might help prevent breach of this contract, by permitting the automobile manufacturer to observe whether the supplier is shipping parts to other car makers."
11,"a perhaps less benign example of the ability of rss to ensure exclusive dealing might be allowing firms to monitor employees' outside activities, e.g. by checking to see that they were not out for a leisurely drive to the beach on a day when they called in sick."
11,"still, even in this case one would expect that workers would be compensated, both for the potential loss in privacy and because the technology would allow employers to deter shirking, making workers more valuable and raising their wages and salaries."
11,"government as observed; person as observer since the government and its citizens are agents of a different kind, one would expect that their relationship would be characterized by complementarity rather than substitutability."
11,"accordingly, we would expect that rss technology that permits citizen observation of government activities to be beneficial."
11,"as with the private-private context, we would not expect individuals to do much direct observation of their governments."
11,"not only is the cost of such observation likely to be great relative to the income of most persons, but the benefits of such monitoring are likely to be spread over the public at large, too thinly to be worth the observation cost to any single individual."
11,an exception may be observations made by private firms of commercial activity in states where industrial sectors are nationalized.
11,"the un principles referenced earlier that encourage observing states to share information with observed states do not address the situation of whether a private company must inform a state that it has been observed (gabrynowicz, 1995)."
11,"however, there is a private collective institution that is particularly likely to find it affordable and worthwhile to use rss technology to observe the government—a competitive press, responding to the demands of citizens engaged in public affairs."
11,"thus, rss technology could promote the political values supported by freedom of the press, by combatting the consequences of asymmetric information between citizens and their state."
11,some of the benefits such freedoms support is akin to those associated with ensuring exclusive dealing in the above discussion.
11,the primary gain is that press observation enables public officials to commit credibly
12,"remote sensing satellites and privacy 243 to the public that they will work on the its behalf (brennan, 1995)."
12,withholding information from the public may be necessary to allow the government and its officials to aggrandize themselves at the public's expense; freedom of the press to observe the government can prevent that exploitation.
12,"for example, the press might use rss-supplied photographs to verify that public works budgets are being used on the intended land reclamation projects, and not on limousines, swimming pools, and other ""perks"" for the government workers.16 4.3."
12,"person as observed; government as observer the presumption that persons and governments operate at different levels, hence are inherently complementary agents in search of co-operation rather than competitive agents who should be adversarial, would imply that when the person is the observed rather than the observer and vice versa, elimination of informational asymmetry through rss technology is a good thing."
12,this is not a wholly unjustifiable position.
12,"private compliance with government mandate, akin to government compliance with private mandate, should be in the social interest if the laws and regulations themselves procedurally and substantively reflect the consent of the governed."
12,the obvious context for this is the enforce- ment of laws and regulations.
12,rss photography can enable the state to enforce pollution emission controls and detect other forms of criminal conduct.
12,"evidence garnered by such technology can lead to more efficient resolution of disputes (marks, 1989).17 however, legal and political traditions in the us regard government observa- tion of individuals as something to be restricted unless warranted, literally, by a court as necessary to secure an important government purpose."
12,"some of this concern reflects the intrinsic rather than instrumental justifications discussed above, with the important addition that government information may tilt the scales of justice in civil criminal.proceedings inappropriately against potential defendants."
12,instrumental considerations may hold sway here as well.
12,"when government can observe private citizens via satellite, the latter may not be able to detect such observation."
12,"as noted above, this creates an asymmetry, mitigat- ing the ability of rss satellites to encourage cooperation.18 a second asymmetry, that the government can observe the individual but not vice versa, absent indirectly through the press, may be more important in hampering the individ- ual's ability to compete against the state over the ability to control his or her private sphere, and to ensure that the government acts on behalf of the public rather than its self-delineated interests."
12,"to the extent that state power and individual will are substitute determinants of personal behaviour rather than complementary providers of a liberal civil environment, our generalizations suggest that rss's propensity to hamper competition between the state and the individual may be detrimental."
12,"the prevailing legal standard for whether government entities can observe individuals without either their consent or a judicial warrant is whether the search ran counter to the individual's ""reasonable expectation of privacy"".19 steele (1991) offers numerous reasons as to why rss observation may violate this reasonable expectation, primarily the public's lack of access to space and this expensive and unorthodox technology, and its inability to detect whether a satellite is observing them."
12,neither argument may prove legally compelling as

13,brennern & m.
13,"k, macauley entry and competition in rss makes it more commercially available, routine, and inexpensive."
13,"a more significant problem is the conceptual ambiguity of a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" standard."
13,"in such a phrase, ""reasonable"" may have a descriptive or normative meaning, and it matters considerably which meaning is at stake."
13,"under a normative interpretation, ""reasonable"" would mean something like ""in accord with appropriate values""."
13,"such a definition would allow a court to disallow rss evidence gathered by a government, despite the availability of rss technology, if collecting that evidence violated these appropriate privacy values, whatever they might be."
13,"however, the relevance of considerations such as the availability of the technology to the public and the frequency of surveil- lance suggests that current law relies on a descriptive interpretation, based on whether rationally a person would predict vulnerability to such observation."
13,"if a normative approach is flawed because it forces courts into making explicit philosophical judgments, the descriptive approach is flawed because it offers no assurance that any amount of privacy would be protected."
13,"night-time kgb searches in the former soviet union would meet the descriptive interpretation, since no ""reasonable"" resident of the soviet union could expect not to be subject to such searches."
13,"consequently, as long as the ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" standard prevails, it may only be a matter of time before a government can use rss data to investigate and prosecute its citizens.20 4.4."
13,states as both observed and observer the principle that rss-generated information will deter competition and pro- mote co-operation applies in the first instance to international relations as well as to private and private-state relationships.
13,"nations are most prominently providers of substitutes rather than complements when they operate or oversee exports, e.g. oil or coffee."
13,"rss technology can make it easier for countries in an export cartel to detect production or shipments beyond quotas imposed to restrict aggregate supplies, in order to maintain higher prices and generate monopoly profits."
13,rss may also provide a means of collecting information about the production technologies of industries in rival states or their supplies of natural resources.
13,"in these cases, as our generalizations suggest, the use of rss technology to facilitate co-operation among parties that provide substitute goods and services is likely to be socially detrimental."
13,"in other cases, however, we would expect the activities of different nations to be complementary, in that the efforts reinforce rather than replace one another in achieving social goals."
13,an example is the use of rss to enforce military treaties.
13,"with the growth of concern with the environment, the use of rss technology to monitor natural resource use and transboundary air and water pollution may be increasingly important (macauley, 1992, p."
13,in both of these situations rss technology can promote international cooper- ation by making it easier to observe deviations from military treaties and environmental agreements.
13,high resolution satellite photography can allow signatory nations to verify reductions in weapons or environmental emissions.
13,"however, the value in ensuring this cooperation may conflict with values associated with national sovereignty (macauley, 1992, pp."
13,37-39).
13,"in addition, asymmetry in access to the technology or rss information could put lower- income or non-spacefaring observed countries at a disadvantage, although in-"
14,remote sensing satellites and privaqj 245 creases in the commercial availability of satellite imagery may reduce advan- tages more technologically advanced nations have via exclusive control of rss.
14,a related concern is that the use of rss technology to reveal internal practices might result in a loss of prestige leading the observed country to withdraw from otherwise desirable international agreements.
14,"for example, disclosure of dirty industrial processes might lead a country to lose face in negotiations for environmental protection (macauley, 1992, pp."
14,"33, 36)."
14,"evaluating the trade-off between the gains from international co-operation and the risks to national sovereignty will depend on one's philosophical judg- ment regarding the merits and content of rights associated with national self-determination (graff, 1994)—some of which may resemble the intrinsic value arguments supporting privacy rights—against the obligation to contribute to collectively beneficial goods (rawls, 1971, p."
14,111-112).
14,"nations who wish to ""cheat"" on international agreements may assert such rights, potentially eliminat- ing the civil and environmental benefits such agreements may generate."
14,"regard- less of its philosophical merits, however, national sovereignty will demand our attention as a matter of practical politics."
14,"policy lessons remote sensing satellite technology clearly reduces the ability of persons and governments to maintain privacy, in the sense of exercising exclusive control over information regarding their activities."
14,"the potential effects on economic markets, political systems, civil liberties, and international relations are numer- ous."
14,"all of these reasons, along with advancing technology, will stimulate ever increasing policy attention toward rss."
14,the framework we have outlined offers some insights for the public and its officials in developing rss policy.
14,the plethora of possible effects of rss technology can be classified by recognizing that using rss to reduce informa- tional asymmetry and exclusivity is likely to inhibit rivalry and promote cooperation.
14,such effects are more likely to be beneficial when the activities of observed and observing parties are complementary rather than fungible.
14,"conse- quently, rss technology should be neither banned nor unfettered."
14,"the relation- ships between the observed and observer will be crucial, and in many cases determinative, in ascertaining whether rss technology should be encouraged (e.g. enforcing arms control treaties) or discouraged (facilitating cartels)."
14,the analysis will never be perfectly simple.
14,"in some cases, rss technology may establish new informational asymmetries, as parties will be less able to detect observation."
14,national sovereignty may fall victim to the ability and availability of rss.
14,"other rights of privacy, particularly those associated with civil liberty protections against unreasonable searches, may be at risk, particu- larly under prevailing legal standards in the usa."
14,"however, we believe that examining remote sensing using general effects on information distribution and the identification of the kinds of situations in which such effects are more or less likely to be beneficial is a useful first step in the philosophical and policy analysis of this evolving technology."

15,we focus on rss satellites operating at fairly high spatial resolution.
15,"lower spatial resolution rss typically involves the collection of weather data only, not other earth processes or land information."
15,drury (1990) offers an excellent technical survey of satellite remote sensing.
15,macauley and toman (1991) discuss this pricing issue in depth.
15,"deontologicial claims for privacy rights grounded in intrinsic values, like arguments for other rights, tend to be categorical, since they by definition cannot be judged as to whether they maximize some measure of the good."
15,"the leading contemporary method for avoiding categorical didacticism is to derive these rights as the outcome of a philosophically pure bargain (rawls, 1971)."
15,"a second possible tactic follows from the implied ability of categorical rights to override considerations of social utility (dworkin, 1977)."
15,"this implies that rights holders themselves ought not be able to alienate those rights, allowing us to test rights claims against our intuitions regarding inalienability (brennan, 1988, 1989a, 1994)."
15,"in other words, our discussion will emphasize ""welfarist"" justifications for privacy, as differen- tiated from aforementioned justifications to autonomy, following sen & williams (1983)."
15,brennan (1993) distinguishes coase's view of property from traditional philosophical views that attempt to derive property rights from intrinsic values of ownership rather than their ability to facilitate efficient transactions.
15,"for a normative, consent-based defence of the coasian standpoint, see posner (1980); for criticisms, see coleman (1980) and dworkin (1980)."
15,"12 see fudenberg & tirole (1992, pp. 275-279) for a formal analysis of how asymmetric information impedes efficient resolution of bilateral negotiations."
15,"we assume here that the observed and observing firms perceive the information to be accurate— that is, the expected value of the information is assumed equal to its information content, and that content is expected to be accurate."
15,"it may lead to increased activity to conceal the information further, however, but we do not consider this effect here."
15,bulow et al. (1985) use these terms in classifying strategic interactions.
15,"as with all generalities, there are exceptions."
15,"under some very specific and complex conditions, the public may elect to remain ignorant of its military's actions, if such ignorance will leave the military more able to deter potential aggressors with excessive force that the citizens themselves would not credibly support (brennan, 1992)."
15,"davis (1992) suggests that rss technology will make it ""futile"" for governments to keep visual information on military deployments out of the public's view, implying that this strategic rationale for secrecy may lack credibility."
15,"us congress, office of technology assessment (1987) focuses on the potential relationship among a press corps' ""mediasat"" satellite, national security, and the first amendment to the constitution."
15,gabrynowicz (1995) notes that the european community has established a policy of using aerial and satellite remote sensing to police fraud associated with the use of agricultural subsidies.
