3,geomatica page 2 of 23 abstract: fractional green canopy cover (fgcc) is a commonly used diagnostic parameter to describe plant growth and vitality.
3,"remote sensing estimates of crop fgcc have been used to support a wide range of agricultural applications, including assessing management practices designed to promote crop productivity and maintain environmental sustainability."
3,"this study investigated the potential of using affordable thermal and optical remote sensing sensors to map fgcc at the agriculture & agri-food canada experimental farm located in woodslee, ontario, canada."
3,airborne rgb (red- green-blue) colour and thermal images and ground-level red-edge images were collected in august 2019 over crop fields with different treatment plots.
3,"the 20 cm resolution rgb images and 5 cm red-edge images were used to extract reference data for fgcc, which were then linked to thermal data and red-edge vegetation indices."
3,we found that the airborne thermal data explained dr 77% of the variation in fgcc at a range of 0-100%.
3,"however, the airborne thermal image could aft only explain 17% of the variation within the cornfields, which have low fgcc values ranging from 20% to 40%."
3,"in contrast, the simple ratio derived from the ground-level red-edge image could explain 81% of the fgcc variation in the cornfields."
3,"these results suggest that both the thermal and red-edge images are capable of estimating crop fgcc, with the red-edge outperforming the thermal images in estimating low fgcc for single-crop fields."
3,"in conclusion, this study demonstrates an efficient and affordable means to map crop fgcc, and these maps could play an essential role in generating insights relating to crop canopy development, light interception, and evapotranspiration partitioning, which can be used as indicators for soil health and nutrient status."

4,introduction crop canopy is highly dynamic in a growing season.
4,"fractional green canopy cover (fgcc) is defined as the percentage of the ground covered by the above-ground biomass of a living plant (deardorff, 1978)."
4,"the fgcc provides an essential crop parameter as it estimates the surface area of the crop capable of intercepting solar radiation for photosynthesis (li et al., 2019; trout et al., 2008)."
4,"for example, soybean fgcc is strongly related to light interception with a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.94 (shepherd et al., 2018)."
4,"crop fgcc has also been related to evapotranspiration and water and wind erosion (armbrust, 1990)."
4,"detailed information of crop fgcc provides knowledge on crop growth stages and conditions, which can be used to make better management decisions."
4,"crop fgcc is currently estimated through in situ measurements or remote sensing-based dr techniques, and the two approaches complement each other."
4,"the in situ observations are aft considered the most reliable means for direct and accurate measurements of fgcc, which have been commonly used for calibrating and validating remote sensing-based fgcc estimates."
4,"however, the in situ measurements are time- and labour-consuming, providing data only for isolated sample sites, and may be subject to uncertainties due to, for example, lack of consistency in data collected by different field crews."
4,"in contrast, remote sensing techniques can map fgcc with higher spatial and temporal resolutions at a lower cost (zheng & moskal, 2009)."
4,"in recent decades, airborne (unmanned aerial vehicles – uavs or helicopters) and satellite remote sensing images have gained substantial scientific and public attention for their potential in characterizing and monitoring crop fgcc at different temporal and spatial resolutions."
4,"satellite images are useful for large-scale applications, but they are limited by their low revisit cycle and coarse spatial resolution."
4,"with the development of affordable and handy remote sensors and platforms (e.g., 3 © the author(s) or their institution(s)"
5,"geomatica page 4 of 23 uav), airborne images with ultra-high spatial resolutions are becoming more popular for field and plot-level crop mapping and crop parameter estimation for any given field and at any time (chen, 2014)."
5,"there is much evidence to show that crop fgcc can be effectively estimated using optical remote sensing data, primarily because plant canopy strongly reflects near-infrared (nir) energy and absorbs visible energy (johnson & scholasch, 2005)."
5,"reflectance information at nir and red spectral regions has often been used to calculate vegetation indices for fgcc estimation (xue & su, 2017)."
5,"in fact, many studies showed that fgcc could be related to vegetation indices using simple linear equations (carlson & ripley, 1997; pordel et al., 2018; trout et al., 2008)."
5,"besides the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum, other spectral regions, such as thermal infrared, also hold the potential of being used for fgcc estimation because the thermal dr properties (emissivity or temperature) of green plant tissues are different from other canopy aft components."
5,"further, thermal images are relatively easy to understand, given that pixel values depict target temperatures."
5,"many previous studies have used thermal imagery to assess water stress in crops (fitzgerald et al., 2006; gerhards et al., 2019; jones et al., 2009; möller et al., 2007; tilling et al., 2007)."
5,"to the best of our knowledge, however, fewer studies have used thermal remote sensing to estimate crop fgcc, although there are indications that a strong relationship exists between mean canopy temperature and percentage canopy cover during the warmest part of the day (10:00-16:00) (baret et al., 2007; fitzgerald et al., 2006; tilling et al., 2007)."
5,"this project seeks to provide insights into the performance of thermal and red-edge sensors in mapping crop fgcc, with an ultimate goal to extend the utility of remote sensing techniques to general users for improved crop management practices."

7,"the airborne images were first clipped, and then geo-referenced and mosaicked."
7,the 20-cm resolution rgb images were used to estimate fgcc for the 100 sampling sites as ground truth data (figure 1).
7,"thermal pixel values were extracted and linked to 70% of the fgcc truth data to establish a linear relationship, and the performance of the linear relationship was then evaluated with 30% remaining fgcc truth data."
7,a total of 20 red-edge images with 5 cm spatial resolution were captured in the field.
7,they were first registered and then used to derive selected vegetation indices from which the dr fgcc was estimated.

8,the thermal images were taken at an altitude of approximately 457 m above the ground with a spatial resolution of about 60 cm.
8,the ground speed of the helicopter was approximately 21.50 m/s to allow for adequate along- track image overlap.

9,"in specific, there were three flight paths with 11, 13, and 13 images captured, respectively, and images of the same flight path were mosaicked first."
9,the three mosaicked images were then registered with one another to create the final image of the study area (figure 3).
9,"the original thermal images varied slightly in spatial resolution around 60 cm, thus were resampled to 60 cm."
9,"as clearly shown in figure 3, there are gaps in the mosaicked image due to either the delay in the signal recording by the computer or insufficient side overlap between flight paths."
9,"given there were insufficient surface temperature data for training, thermal pixel values were not converted to surface temperature."
9,"this should not impact the results as the focus of this study is on spatial discrimination of green plant tissues from other canopy components; therefore, absolute measurement of temperature is not needed."
9,the 20 cm rgb images were used to create and validate fgcc data following the method dr described in vogeler et al.
9,(2018).
9,this method involves creating grids on high spatial resolution aft images for each of the sampling locations and then visually estimating fgcc by counting the number of grid squares with greater than 50% of green plant tissues.
9,"in specific, 100 sample plots of 1.2 m x 1.2 m each (figure 1) were randomly selected in the study area."
9,"a 10 x 10 grid was then created to overlay with the rgb image for each of these sampling plots, and the fgcc for each sampling plot was then estimated as the percentage of the 100 grids with greater than 50% of green plant tissues (figure 4)."

10,"among the 100 random sampling polygons, 31 are crops, 19 are non-crop dr vegetation including trees and grass, 19 are bare soil or building, and 31 are mixed."
10,"the mean aft thermal data were extracted over these 100 sample locations, and a t-test was performed to determine whether the thermal image can distinguish different land use land cover classes."
10,"a linear regression model was generated between average thermal pixel values within 1.2 by 1.2 m grids, and fgcc derived from over 70 sampling data values correspondent to those grids to test the ability of thermal imagery in estimating green canopy cover, and r2 was used to evaluate the relationship between the independent and dependent variables."
10,the regression model was also evaluated using the remaining 30 sampling plots.
10,r2 (range 0-1) and normalized root mean square error (nrmse in %) were used for model validation.
10,a high r2 and a low nrmse indicate a robust model.

19,discussion and conclusions aft this study tests the ability of the ground-based red-edge images and the airborne thermal images in estimating fgcc.
19,we find that both types of images can be used to estimate fgcc with satisfactory accuracy.
19,"at the ground level, the red-edge derived simple ratio index successfully captures the relatively low fgcc values in more homogeneous corn fields; at the landscape level, the thermal image is able to estimate fgcc with high accuracy."
19,"however, the aerial thermal image fails to estimate fgcc when it has a small dynamic range, which is the same as those observed in the corn fields."
19,"these findings show promising applications of the thermal and red-edge sensors in agriculture, as the technologies (i.e., sensors and platforms) are affordable and simple to use."
19,"even for field data collection, image-based techniques could be more efficient than other ground- based data collection techniques, as the sensors are small to carry and could rapidly take a snapshot of canopies."

20,"similarly, banerjee et al. (2018) also used thermal imagery to estimate the wheat leaf area index, which was highly related to green canopy cover."
20,"we also found that the thermal image is able to distinguish different land cover types, particularly differentiated crops from bare soil/building, which demonstrates that thermal sensors are promising for crop monitoring."
20,"other than canopy cover, thermal imagery also holds great potential to detect vegetation stress (jackson et al., 1977)."
20,"as for ground-based red-edge images, sr can explain 81% of the variations in fgcc of corn fields."
20,"it is worth noting that red-edge derived sr is able to capture the subtle variations of dr fgcc, attributed to different treatments applied to the cornfields."
20,similar results can be found in aft the literature.
20,"for example, barnes et al. (2000) used ground-based multispectral remote sensing to estimate canopy density of cotton crops and achieved high accuracy; ashapure et al. (2019) used multispectral remote sensing to develop a model that estimated canopy cover of cotton crops accurately."
20,"when comparing the performance of airborne thermal and ground-based red-edge images, we found that, while both are able to estimate fgcc accurately, red-edge images could capture low crop canopy covers with a small within-class variation, but the thermal image cannot."
20,"the difference in fgcc estimation power could be due to the different sensitivity of the two sensors to plant biological, physical, and chemical processes."

21,geomatica page 20 of 23 resolution of 5 cm: the combination of optical band reflectance is well-know to enhance green plant signals thus provides a vital capability for fgcc estimation.
21,further research in croplands is required to confirm and advance the findings.
21,"higher spatial resolution thermal imagery may be needed to estimate fgcc, particularly for areas with low fgcc, as thermal data overestimate fgcc in those areas."
21,comparisons between thermal and optical imagery for fgcc estimation could lead to more conclusive results if the images are acquired at similar spatial resolutions.
21,"acquiring red-edge imagery for the entire study area would also be beneficial as it could provide insights into the ability of optical imagery to estimate green crop canopy cover with a large dynamic range, however, it was not possible in this study due to limited belly windows to accommodate thermal and red-edge sensors in the helicopter."
21,dr there is evidence that canopy cover estimation techniques vary in their accuracy depending aft on crop phenological stages.
21,"therefore, we also recommend performing a temporal analysis in the future to determine whether optical and thermal sensors can be used to estimate crop fgcc at different phenological stages."
21,"for instance, ashapure et al. (2019) found that optical data were not able to provide an accurate estimation of canopy cover of cotton crops at the mature stages when the leaves change color."
21,it will also be interesting to find out whether thermal data can provide a better estimation of fgcc than optical data do at maturity stages.
