1,our analysis is focused on a rather short time interval after an earthquake occurrence (order of several hours) when there is a maximum need for urgent help to the earthquake victims.
1,"we use rescue efﬁciency as a performance measure of earthquake response actions; this efﬁciency is described in terms of timely arrival of rescue teams at places, where their help is mostly needed."
1,we quantify the beneﬁt of using spatial damage distribution information in terms of cost reduc- tion/rescue efﬁciency gains.
1,we intentionally conduct our analysis at a methodological level and do not go deeper into case studies to keep general conclusions traceable.
1,the modeling exercise we present in the paper is a ﬁrst step towards a more detailed and integrated approach that could contribute to better systematic understanding of earthquake response actions and ultimately improve their efﬁciency.

7,for the purposes of this analysis we assume the utility the model presented here is intentionally simplistic in that it function to be equal to the expected rescue efﬁciency.
7,an iso-utility does not include several important factors that may have substan- tial impact on rescue efﬁciency.

7,we also assume a constant probability of collapse p and a constant number of victims per collapsed build- 0.8 ing v.
7,in order to improve on these assumptions spatially explicit data on soil properties and engineering properties of the buildings would be needed to inform these parameters.
7,the number of vic- 0.6 tims also depends on the time of an earthquake occurrence and on the social aspect of the building (ofﬁces are full by day and gen- q erally empty by night).
7,"still, from the practical point of view, both, the probability of 0.4 collapse and the resulting number of victims, also have a random component."
7,"the parameters p and v may then themselves be as- signed probability distributions, for example, beta and poisson 0.2 respectively."
7,"in our generalized case, as opposed to potential case studies, this would require too many additional assumptions and would therefore obfuscate rather than clarify the matter."
