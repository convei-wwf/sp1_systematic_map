8,"even so, a strong correlation was et al., 2019)."
8,"in combating peatland ﬁres, high levels of reported between the weekly numbers of hotspots and tweets on acknowledgment and engagement are needed for changes “haze-health” in riau province, 2014, i.e., between the number toward more sustainable behaviors."
8,"in this aspect, newspaper of detected hotspots on a linear scale and the weekly number of media plays an important role in shaping public perceptions of conversations in a logarithmic scale, conﬁrming that people ﬁre causes."
8,the newspaper search terms “land use” and “oil palm have exponentially increased conversations on “haze-health” plantation” appear under various article categories.

8,this section discusses the spatio-relationship between frp and npage in the context of health issues.
8,identiﬁcation of unhealthy conditions of geospatial locations from mass media conclusions would be useful for the prioritization of disaster response and newspaper epidemiology information is not generated with the humanitarian action during haze disasters.
8,"the results described primary purpose of doing epidemiology but a useful source in above suggest that “acute illness” and “acute respiratory illness” the analysis of public health and environmental contexts. are useful search terms, reﬂecting the public health impact of air (salathé, 2018)."
8,this study has revealed the utility of articles pollution and smoke damage from peatland ﬁres.
8,"in the tweeter from a local newspaper, riau pos, for ﬁlling in estimates of content analysis, tweets about wildﬁre and smoke predicted “acute illness (penyakit akut)” and “acute respiratory illness public health impacts (sachdeva and mccaffrey, 2018)."

8,"newspaper assessment of population-level exposure in the united states was analysis can be a potential tool for public health sectors for explored using daily posts from facebook (ford et al., 2017). estimating health impacts from deteriorated air quality due to comparing the pm2.5 levels, the best correlations reported were smoke haze."
8,"to solve the problems caused by ﬁre and particulate for “air quality”, “wildﬁre” and “smoke” since wildﬁre smoke was matter, the local government needs to ﬁnd a way of managing the source of the highest variability in surface pm2.5 concentra- peatlands."
8,that will require strengthening governance and tions.
8,the search terms “haze” and “health” were relevant to accountability.
8,"newspapers play an important role in informing residents across sumatra, becoming popular terms in social media people about the initiatives taken to manage such social issues."
