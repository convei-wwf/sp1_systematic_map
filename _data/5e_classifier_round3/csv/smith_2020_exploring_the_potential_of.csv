2,"exploring the potential of google earth as a communication and engagement tool in collaborative natural flood management planning smith, katherine, berry, robert and clarke, lucy e abstract this paper considers the development and evaluation of a google earth ‘virtual globe’ tour for communicating spatial data and engaging stakeholders in the early stages of a natural flood management (nfm) planning scenario, based on a rural uk river catchment that suffered significant flooding in 2007."
2,"with a range of diverse stakeholder interests to consider, early engagement and the development of trust before decision- making is essential for the long-term success of such catchment-wide projects."
2,"a local catchment group was consulted to identify key information requirements, and from this a ‘virtual globe’ tour was created."
2,"the process involved specialist skills and expert leadership, but the end result was accessible to a range of audiences."
2,user evaluation indicated that the ‘virtual globe’ tour was easy to navigate and can be used to stimulate interest and engage stakeholders.
2,participants trusted the content and valued the interactivity of the tour.
2,"it was helpful for communicating and educating participants about the catchment, the issues it faces and the potential to incorporate nfm, particularly for those with little or no prior knowledge."
2,more abstract information was harder to convey and there were limitations in the availability of suitable data for some variables and the quality of satellite imagery.
2,this exploratory research found that a google earth ‘virtual globe’ tour can be a valuable tool in the initial stages of an nfm
3,"project, but there are also opportunities to use this technique in the more advanced stages of the planning process."
3,the approach could be used as part of a wider toolkit for communication and engagement and has potential as a decision support tool in other environmental management scenarios with requirements for public participation; enabling the views of a range of participants to be captured through online distribution and to generate discussion in workshop settings.
3,"keywords: google earth, ‘virtual globe’ tour, stakeholder engagement, natural flood management, communication, isbourne 1 introduction this paper presents the findings of exploratory research, based on a case study for a catchment in the early stages of a natural flood management (nfm) scheme where the potential has been determined but the specific interventions are yet to be identified."
3,"a google earth-based visualisation was developed to identify methods of effectively communicating the potential benefits of nfm in the catchment, including reducing flood risk and delivering wider ecological benefits (environment agency 2014)."
3,a local community catchment group was consulted during the development.
3,facilitated and non-facilitated settings were then used to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the visualisation and its potential for improving the communication of complex catchment information and encouraging engagement with an nfm project in its early stages.
4,"nfm covers a set of interventions and soft engineering approaches that work to attenuate the flow of water in river catchments, by manipulating runoff pathways and in- channel hydraulic flow regimes (sepa 2015)."
4,"aiming to reduce flood risk with a suite of nature-based techniques, it could be used independently or applied alongside conventional measures (wilkinson et al."
4,2014).
4,"unlike hard engineered flood defences (i.e. levees and walls), which tend to focus on the use of single sites to protect large areas, nfm uses multiple interventions over a wider landscape (i.e. catchment scale), building on natural landscape characteristics to achieve a targeted threshold of change (sepa 2015)."
4,"it also has potential to provide multiple benefits for water quality, biodiversity and society (wentworth 2011)."
4,"considerable interest has been generated by recent schemes in the uk, such as pickering, north yorkshire (forestry commission 2017) and stroud, gloucestershire (stroud district council 2017)."
4,"this provided the catalyst for financial backing for nfm from the uk government, with a £15 million government commitment from the department for the environment, food and rural affairs (kaminski 2016)."
4,recent research using modelling approaches has focussed on the effectiveness of nfm interventions; engineered log jams and woody debris (dixon et al.
4,"2016; thomas & nisbet, 2012), forest restoration (dixon et al. 2016), land management (o’donnell et al. 2011) and mixed catchment approaches (metcalfe et al."
4,2017).
4,"building this evidence- base is required (environment agency 2017; lane 2017), and also needs to consider the wider benefits (iacob, 2014; wilkinson et al. 2014) and to identify suitable methods"
5,"of communication to engender positive stakeholder engagement, including the potential for employing computer-based approaches and visual aids (environment agency 2014)."
5,"achieving early engagement with stakeholders, and maintaining their support, is a critical component of nfm planning (ball 2008; reed 2008; reed et al. 2014), as the implementation of a range of measures across a catchment requires a collaborative partnership approach to be successful (wentworth 2011)."
5,stakeholders include anyone with an interest in or concern with an environmental decision-making process (reed 2008; whitman et al. 2015) and may include people who are not directly associated with a catchment.
5,"it is important to involve a wide range of diverse interest groups (including wildlife and landscape organisations, local authorities, landowners, farmers and the wider community) and to try to incorporate, as far as possible, all stakeholder knowledge and values (ball 2008; evers et al."
5,2016; richards et al.
5,2017; sterling et al.
5,2017).
5,"the communication of river and catchment characteristics, issues of flooding and water quality, and the promotion of nfm as an approach to address these issues is important."
5,"holstead et al. (2017) found that 60% of farmers surveyed about nfm uptake in scotland had never heard of nfm, or had limited knowledge of it, with doubt from those familiar with the term about how their actions could have an impact downstream."
5,"local stakeholder involvement is also central to the policy directives of both the european union water framework (2000/60/ec) directive (wfd) and floods (2007/60/ec) directive, introduced to protect water bodies in europe, which recognise the potential role of the land in retaining water."
6,"raising awareness of flood risk may not be easy, particularly where there is perceived blame or a lack of direct experience (hopkins & warburton 2015), but this can be improved with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders (bracken et al."
6,2016).
6,communication and access to data are recognised as barriers to stakeholder engagement and implementation of nfm (waylen et al.
6,2017).
6,"therefore, widening and improving participation could be linked to development of better, more accessible methods of communicating the rich and varied spatial information associated with both catchments and nfm projects."
6,"disciplines related to nfm are conventionally communicated to stakeholders via formats familiar to expert users (e.g. technical reports, static maps, statistical data) (grainger et al."
6,2016; lovett et al.
6,2015).
6,"there is a need to communicate more effectively to non-experts in an accessible, transparent, and engaging way both to promote engagement in an nfm scheme, and to improve understanding of the issues among stakeholders (and thus the overall quality of the decision-making) (grainger et al."
6,2016).
6,"spatial information, which is key in environmental decision-making, no longer needs to be confined to paper maps but can be viewed and analysed interactively using geographical information systems (gis) software."
6,"access to gis-based technology is no longer restricted to experts, with ubiquitous web-based mapping systems and bespoke public participation/participatory gis projects enabling communities to view and map spatial information, expanding access to data used for research and decision- making (brown & kyttä 2014)."
6,"however, access to information alone is not enough; it must be communicated sufficiently clearly to be understood by non-expert users for it to"
7,be employed effectively in participatory decision-making scenarios (defra 2003; smith et al.
7,2013).
7,"spatial environmental data can be visualised using three-dimensional (3d) computer- based systems, created using gis or specialist landscape visualisation software, or through a ‘virtual globe’ approach where data can be overlaid on a freely-available 3d representation of the earth based on satellite imagery (lovett et al."
7,2015; sheppard & cizek 2009).
7,"by representing data in this way, two-dimensional (2d) spatial data that might previously be considered ‘abstract’ can be made more meaningful and accessible, and these types of visualisation can help features to become more “seeable to the eye” (grainger et al."
7,"2016, 301)."
7,"such visualisations have been recognised to attract stakeholders by connecting them with familiar environments and engaging their sense of place (newell & canessa 2015), providing they are deemed to be credible (i.e. not being misleading and using appropriate levels of realism), salient, and legitimate (lovett et al."
7,2015).
7,"ultimately visualisations will only be as helpful as the information they contain or the scenario in which they are applied, and they must be scrutinised, evaluated and discussed to maintain legitimacy and engagement throughout the decision-making process (lovett et al."
7,2015; schroth et al.
7,2015; todd et al.
7,2014).
7,"this paper describes a study utilising the google earth web-based platform, which offers the ability to view spatial data and objects geo-located onto a satellite image base map via a virtual ‘tour’ through a 3d landscape (harwood et al."
7,2015; schroth et al.
7,2011).
7,"these tours can be shared freely over the internet, and the ubiquity of google"
8,earth offers the potential for interaction with large numbers of people at varying geographical scales (harwood et al.
8,2015; mccall & dunn 2012; pettit et al.
8,2011; schroth et al.
8,2011; sheppard & cizek 2009).
8,google earth ‘virtual globe’ tours have been shown to raise community awareness in both facilitated workshops (pettit et al.
8,2011; schroth et al. 2011) and remote online settings (harwood et al.
8,"2015; pettit et al. 2011), and can be useful for strategic planning (pettit et al. 2011) and environmental education (harwood et al."
8,2015).
8,the approach has the potential to change the traditional relationship between experts and the lay public in decision-making scenarios (lange 2011).
8,the aim of this paper is to explore the potential role of a google earth ‘virtual globe’ tour in the early development stages of a nfm scheme.
8,it considers the extent to which this type of interactive 3d landscape visualisation can enhance the communication of spatial data related to nfm and promote early stakeholder engagement in such projects.
8,2 study area this research used the river isbourne catchment as a case study.
8,"the isbourne flows in a northerly direction for 30km through gloucestershire and worcestershire, uk, with several watercourses joining along its length before converging with the river avon at evesham."
8,a large part of the 88 km2 catchment (figure 1) sits within the cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty (aonb) which is subject to planning and management guidelines (cotswolds aonb 2017).
9,"the catchment contains a range of designated areas including priority habitats, ancient woodlands and a site of special scientific interest (sssi)."
9,the isbourne originates from springs rising on the valley sides below the permeable limestone geology of a steep escarpment approximately 300m above sea level.
9,"the river has many historical industrial and agricultural features, especially associated with water power generation for milling, some of which are still in use (lovatt 2013)."
9,"there is a history of flood events, with significant flooding occurring in july 2007."
9,"the isbourne catchment group (icg), established in response to these floods, has been working alongside the environment agency and the university of gloucestershire to promote the implementation of nfm interventions to reduce flooding."
9,"in 2017, uk government funding was secured to meet this aim (defra 2017)."
9,"figure 1 (a) map showing the location and catchment boundary of the river isbourne, and photographs of (b) the scenery in the upper catchment, (c) the source of the isbourne on cleeve hill, and (d) a section of the river"
10,3 methods a google earth ‘virtual globe’ tour was created to highlight key features of the area and the potential to implement nfm in the catchment.
10,"the technical components and the content of the tour were evaluated through end-user assessment, using an online survey in two facilitated group sessions, where the participants were observed and guided through the process, and in a non-facilitated environment where participants downloaded and explored the tour independently on their own computers."
10,"3.1 google earth ‘virtual globe’ tours ‘virtual globes’, viewed on flat 2d screens, provide users with a digital representation of the earths’ surface in 3d (elvidge & tuttle 2008), which can be viewed from different angles and altitudes."
10,"google earth is a freely-available, online ‘virtual globe’ platform that enables users to view seamless satellite imagery of the entire earth (ballagh et al. 2011) and allows interactive exploration of spatial and temporal changes at different scales and perspectives (ballagh et al."
10,2011; tooth 2015).
10,"it has a place name search function and tools to annotate locations with placemarks, labels, and photographs, and can facilitate the import of external spatial data (including gps files) (google earth outreach 2017)."
10,"animated ‘virtual globe’ tours can be used to create navigated ‘fly- throughs’, where users are taken on a predetermined journey through the landscape, pausing at specified locations to view added information/multimedia."
10,"users can have some degree of control over the tours, including the ability to pause, rewind, and fast- forward (harwood et al."
10,2015).
10,simple features can be created directly on the google earth platform and saved as keyhole markup language (kml) files; this open and readable xml-based scripting
11,"language is designed for spatial data management and visualisation in web-based systems, and is structured using a set of specific components, known as elements."
11,"point, polygon, line, and 3d model elements have geographical locations (coordinates) associated with them."
11,"ground overlays can be draped over the base imagery according to defined latitude and longitude, and screen overlays enable images to be visible at specified locations on the screen (see harwood et al. 2015 for further information on this)."
11,"basic animated tours can be created without advanced programming knowledge or additional specialist software, though more complex tours involving precise navigation and complex multimedia content, and the addition of external gis data, require a greater level of skill to produce (harwood et al."
11,2015).
11,however once these tours have been developed they can be reviewed and updated by non-experts with appropriate guidance.
11,"for this research, the text editor notepad++ (v7.3.2) was used for scripting kml code, enabling the customisation of components and the addition of bespoke styling and animated tour instructions that went beyond the basic functions of the google earth platform (see google developers 2016; wernecke 2009 for further information on kml scripting)."
11,"the kml script, containing the tour animation instructions and associated data, was zipped to create a kmz archive that can be easily distributed online (provided as supporting information 1)."
11,"the manipulation and analysis of gis datasets was undertaken in arcmap v10.4.1; this included conversion of shapefiles to kml, transforming the data from the projected british national grid (epsg: 27700) to the geographic wgs84 (epsg: 4326) coordinate reference system used by google earth."
11,the tour was created using google earth pro (v7.1.7.2606) and can be viewed using desktop versions 6 or 7; at the time of writing the google earth mobile app and desktop v9 for google chrome did not support ’virtual globe’ tours.
12,"3.2 tour design when designing the tour, a collaborative approach was undertaken involving direct consultation with the icg (in a workshop with 7 participants) to identify stakeholderinformation requirements at the outset, to capture local knowledge and opinion, and to enhance the transparency and legitimacy of the process (lovett et al."
12,2015).
12,"after demonstrating a short prototype tour of the isbourne catchment to demonstrate the functionality and components of google earth tours, attendees provided feedback on the content and styling through a short questionnaire and discussion."
12,"the final, longer tour was designed to provide an overview of the physical characteristics of the catchment, the administrative complexity (i.e. crosses two county and 12 parish boundaries) and outline flooding-related issues, as prioritised by a prior scoping report of the catchment (clarke et al."
12,2016).
12,the design and development of the tour took into consideration previous recommendations on producing visualisations for collaborative environmental management (lovett et al.
12,"2015; sheppard & cizek 2009), including avoiding deliberate distortion of the landscape and being transparent about data sources."
12,the data requirements identified by the icg (and included in the final tour) are summarised in table 1.
12,"to ensure accessibility, as the tour will ultimately be freely distributed online, efforts were made to use open licence data."
12,the data sources were disclosed during the tour and links were provided to licence statements.
12,"photographs were incorporated into placemarks along with text, figures and links to relevant websites."
12,"a decision was taken by members of the icg to avoid the use of photographs showing the impact of the 2007 flooding, as these could be emotive for some residents."
13,"table 1: summary of the information requirements and subsequent datasets included in the google earth tour of the isbourne catchment information datasets and other resources requirement administrative ordnance survey boundary-line (administrative boundaries boundaries): counties, district council and parish council boundaries catchment boundary national river flow archive catchment boundary (used with permission of centre for ecology and hydrology) catchment topography google earth imagery and screenshot elevation profiles designated areas natural england: aonb, sssi, priority habitats, ancient woodland geology british geological survey (bgs) 1:650,000 bedrock historical features historic england: parks and gardens, listed buildings historic water features digitised data created by university of gloucestershire land use corine land cover 2012 placemarks and railway manually created on google earth line watercourses ordnance survey openmap local: rivers and surface water water quality ea: water framework directive status (summarised extract within a placemark) 2007 flood extent ea recorded flood outline"
14,the tour functionality was influenced by practical considerations (harwood et al. 2015); animating at suitable speed and building in pauses to allow viewers to digest information at their own pace before manually restarting (figure 2).
14,"opening screen overlays (using jpeg images created with ms publisher) providing clear instructions for navigating the tour (figure 2) were incorporated to improve usability (bresciani & eppler 2015), especially for individuals with no prior experience of google earth."
14,"these included guidance for disabling superfluous and potentially distracting content before viewing (e.g. photos, place names, and roads)."
14,placemarks were designed to pop up at locations throughout the tour to signpost the relevant facts.
14,"inset location maps, to aid orientation, and google earth elevation profiles were created using the screenshot facility and incorporated as screen overlays (figure 2)."
14,the duration of the final tour was 9 minutes.
14,"figure 2 screenshots showing examples of the google earth tour: (a) screen overlays,"
15,"3.3 end-user evaluation forty-five individuals participated in the end-user evaluation, completing an online survey developed and hosted on the bristol online survey website (https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/)."
15,"this was undertaken in two settings; facilitated groups (f) (n=20) including an academic workshop (n=10) and another with members of the icg and local stakeholders (n=10), and a non-facilitated online survey (nf) (n=25) with participants recruited through a blog post, social media and email."
15,the results from the two settings have been analysed separately to evaluate the influence of guidance and support on the user experience.
15,the end-user evaluation questionnaire (berry et al.
15,2011; schroth et al.
15,"2015; tullis & albert 2013) was designed to capture participants’ opinions on usability (the ease of use) to identify issues that may affect the adoption of the visualisation format (bresciani & eppler 2015), effectiveness (how useful they found the individual components of the google earth format) and helpfulness (how well the format and content communicated information about the features and issues influencing the catchment)."
15,the survey was designed to capture the opinions of those both familiar and unfamiliar with the subject and the location.
15,the respondents were provided with instructions on how to access the tour using a link to download and launch the kmz file.
15,"the survey incorporated sections to be completed before (to capture participant characteristics) and after viewing the tour using a combination of closed-ended questions, with 6-point likert scale responses (1 to 6: low to high), and open-ended questions with free-text responses."
15,respondents were also asked about their perceptions of the impact of nfm on the environment and their interest in finding out more about it.
16,"4 results both the f and nf groups were balanced in terms of gender, age and whether participants lived in rural or urban areas (full details provided in the supporting information 2)."
16,a higher proportion of the f group lived in or had visited the isbourne catchment (80%) compared with the nf group (32%).
16,"participants in the f group were academics (25%), students (25%), professionals (30%) or retirees (20%) whereas in the nf group the main occupation category was professional (48%)."
16,"the surveys captured a range of google earth experience with the majority having used it to view places (47% occasionally and 31% frequently) and while some of the nf respondents had higher skill levels, with 32% using it to generate content, the views of less experienced participants were captured in both settings."
16,"4.1 usability figure 3a shows that the usability ratings in both settings were high (mean rating >4) for ease of use, visual clarity and level of trust."
16,"the ratings for presentation speed were lower (mean rating: f=3.4, nf=3.1), indicating that participants found the tour slightly slow; alternatively it could reflect the lack of a neutral rating."
16,the mean ratings for effectiveness of the google earth components were all high (see figure 3b); above 4 for both f and nf.
16,"the lowest ratings were for the close up/perspective views and the visual appearance of the ground and surface features, with the highest ratings for the pop-up information balloons ."
16,the mean ratings for both usability and effectiveness of the components were consistently higher (and the variance lower) for f than nf.
17,"figure 3 survey responses summarising the (a) usability, (b) effectiveness of the tour element, and (c) helpfulness of the tour for the facilitated respondents, f, and the non- facilitated online respondents, nf"
18,comments made in free text questions supported the usability metrics (table 2).
18,"participants (from both f and nf) commented that they liked the pop up placemarks with interactivity provided through links to further information (n=10), the ability to see the area covered by the 2007 flood (n=9) and boundary lines on the landscape imagery, and the ability to pause and rewind (n=6) in addition to the fly through navigation."
18,"table 2: a representative selection of quotes from the end-user surveys (f and nf) positive “it is a clear and easy way to present a lot of information in a visually pleasing format that a layperson can access easily and hopefully understand” “the tour was rich in information and there were different levels which could be accessed according to need” “interesting to see the network being identified, and the issues that faced different areas - the flood risk was very clear” “visualising where the water came from and how the surrounding land would impact this” negative “you need to be able to see the topography more."
18,it took some time to realise what were hills and what was flatter” “too much information for one tour when my personal interest would only have been focused on one area” “on some of the images - cross sections bit - the screen image was not very good” “perhaps there could have been more information / examples about nfm in this catchment”
19,"4.2 communicating catchment features and nfm figure 3c shows that for the helpfulness for communication the mean ratings in both f and nf settings were high ( >4), with the highest mean rating given for demonstrating the catchment features followed by the identification of sources of information, and the lowest for the understanding of nfm techniques."
19,"while sample size limited the analysis of participants’ characteristics, an apparent relationship between participants’ prior knowledge of nfm and their rating of helpfulness for demonstrating nfm techniques was noted; 21% of those with a lot of prior nfm knowledge rated it above 5, whereas 75% of those knowing nothing, and 58% of those knowing a little, rated it above 5."
19,the rating for demonstrating the features and issues of the catchment was also higher among those with some familiarity of the area; a higher proportion of participants who reside or visit occasionally selected a rating of 5 or 6 for demonstrating the features (96%) than those who did not previously know the area (76%).
19,the respondents comments (table 2) also indicated that the tour content was effective in providing context and comprehensive coverage showing a “highly descriptive view of the area” and “the relationship of features”.
19,"some of the content was less well-received, including negative comments on the slope cross-sections (n=3) and 3d topography,with one respondent suggesting that “increased vertical exaggeration of the land surface might improve the perspective views” - this was considered, and rejected, during the design stage to avoid extreme misrepresentation of the landscape (sheppard and cizek 2009)."
19,"others requested more photographs to improve their understanding of the area and the 2007 flooding (n=7), and more specific information on nfm techniques and where they could be used in the catchment (n=4)."
20,"after viewing the tour, participants perceived that nfm (figure 4) would be beneficial for flood management (combined=98%; f=100%, nf= 96%) and improving water quality (combined=89%; f=90%, nf= 88%)."
20,"there was greater uncertainty regarding other environmental impacts, with 20% of participants unsure of the impact it could have on farming, demonstrating the complexity of these issues."
20,"there were no perceived detrimental impacts of nfm highlighted in the f survey, while in the nf survey the impact of nfm was perceived as detrimental to landscape views (9%) and to farming (16%)."
20,"these questions were only asked after viewing the tour, therefore it was not clear how much the tour influenced previously held opinions."
20,"participants were also asked about their level of interest in finding out more about the benefits and opportunities for nfm, and this received a positive response (very interested: f=75% nf=38% and somewhat interested: f=20% nf=58%), highlighting that the tour was successful as an engagement tool."
20,figure 4 perceptions of the impact of nfm for the facilitated (f) and the non-facilitated online (nf) respondents combined.
21,4.3 icg responses feedback from the f session containing icg members and related parties was positive.
21,they rated the tour more highly than those from the nf setting for communicating both the features of the catchment (mean = 5.6) and nfm techniques (mean = 4.8).
21,"in the free text comments participants noted that the tour was “pitched at an appropriate level” providing a “very good introduction to the catchment” and was “a much more effective method of communication than a written report”, as well as providing a “useful way of engaging the community”."
21,"there was keen interest in how the tool could be developed as the nfm project progressed, including adding specific nfm interventions as opportunities are identified and implemented, as well as expanding the spatial coverage."
21,the icg was positive about hosting the tours on their website for the public to access and acknowledged that this would not replace 2d maps and reports but would be a valuable alternative source of information for the group.
21,"5 discussion 5.1 creating ‘virtual globe’ tours a google earth ‘virtual globe’ tour was chosen as the landscape visualisation tool in this research due to its accessibility, interactivity, and capacity to stimulate interest in environmental decision-making scenarios (pettit et al."
21,2011; sheppard & cizek 2009).
21,"the technology for creating these tours is ubiquitous and accessible, but considerable effort and expert-level gis knowledge is required to produce a complex tour like the one in this study."
21,"basic features can be created directly in google earth, but non-expert"
22,"users would be likely to struggle with gis data acquisition, management and processing."
22,"kml scripting would also present a significant challenge to a lay-person, and, although it can be learned by those with no previous programming experience, it does require a significant commitment (harwood et al."
22,2015).
22,"however, once the tour has been created it can be viewed, reviewed and adapted with relative ease by those with some prior knowledge."
22,"the kmz file of the tour was small enough (8.26 mb) to allow easy online distribution, enabling a lay audience to access the data (phadke 2010; sheppard & cizek 2009)."
22,"designed to demonstrate existing catchment features and relevant historic change, flooding and water quality issues, the tour directed viewer attention to a range of relevant information covering the catchment at different scales, and using customized navigation."
22,"it also provided interactivity, enabling the viewer to explore information by following embedded links to relevant websites according to their interests."
22,the use of open data to allow unlimited online distribution of gis-based landscape visualisations can impose restrictions (berry et al.
22,2011).
22,"in this study, for example, the historic land cover data required to demonstrate the impact of land-use change on catchment processes, was not freely available."
22,"eu corine data (showing dominant land cover types) was only available between 2000 and 2012 at the time of creation, and so could not be used to visualise long-term changes."
22,"accessibility of soil and geology data was also restricted, with bgs permeability and soil parent material model not available as open data."
22,data for some aspects may also not exist; gauge data for
23,"river levels1, water quality2 and rainfall3 would have been useful additions but these were not available for the isbourne."
23,to fully realise the potential of technological approaches to improving communication and decision-making in environmental planning there must also be a ‘freeing-up’ of digital spatial data via open licenses.
23,"similarly, image quality and 3d coverage on google earth is improving (schroth et al. 2011), but there was limited recent satellite coverage for the isbourne catchment (in 2018 imagery from 2017 was available for the upper catchment but restricted to 2005- 2007 for the remainder of the catchment)."
23,"the resolution was variable, and a lack of available historic imagery restricted the investigation of historic change."
23,"higher-quality and more up-to-date imagery, including the new 3d models (i.e."
23,"3d buildings and vegetation) available for some places in google earth, may enhance the visual appearance of such tours."
23,"a recognised limitation of the ‘virtual globe’ tour approach (and indeed any landscape visualisation) is developer bias (sheppard & cizek 2009), which can be minimised by incorporating the views of a broad range of stakeholders (grainger et al."
23,2016).
23,"for this reason, a significant effort was made to engage with identified and active stakeholders from the icg early in the design stages to obtain feedback on content and styling."
23,"however, even with high-quality stakeholder input, it was impossible to maintain impartiality throughout the design process (i.e. decisions on styling elements of the tour 1 in the uk river gauge data are freely available from the national river flow archive: https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/ 2 in the uk water quality data are accessed through the ea catchment data explorer: https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/ 3 rainfall data are provided by the meterological office in the uk: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/data/ukcp09/datasets"
24,were taken without consultation and some layers that the authors felt were important were included despite not being prioritised by the icg); setting a goal of complete impartiality is unrealistic.
24,a design aim suggested by harwood et al. (2015) was to make the ‘virtual globe’ tour easy to modify.
24,here several data layers were animated in and out of view on the map during the navigation to reduce the level of on-screen detail.
24,"preparing a range of simplified tours could make future updates easier but might reduce the ability to communicate the complexity of, and relationships between, features; and would be more effort for the viewer to download."
24,"offering pre-recorded tours in video format, via youtube or a similar platform, could be investigated to circumvent the need for google earth access and set-up."
24,"these can be created with little additional effort and could make the tours more accessible to a wider audience, but would limit interactivity."
24,"5.2 usability overall, this study found that the participants enjoyed the tour, finding it easy to use and visually clear."
24,"wider participation may have reduced the variance in ratings; nevertheless, previous research has found that 80% of software usability issues can be identified by as few as five participants (tullis & albert 2013)."
24,"the results were notably different for the two survey settings, with higher ratings in the facilitated group (f) for usability, the effectiveness of tour elements, and helpfulness for communication."
24,incorporating a broad range of backgrounds in evaluation is crucial to reduce the risk of bias (glaas et al.
24,"2017; pettit et al. 2011), and a group environment limits the results to"
25,those participants (wissen et al.
25,2008).
25,"however, the end-user processes applied here highlight the benefits of evaluating the tour in a facilitated workshop setting prior to online dissemination; this enables critical usability issues to be identified before a wider roll-out and ensures that collaboration is still being seen to be done further on in the design process."
25,the group forum can also provide technical support for those participants who are less ‘tech-savvy’.
25,"feedback indicated that although all elements of the tour were effective, individuals did have different preferences (e.g. interactivity levels) for accessing information types within the tour (recognised by schroth et al."
25,2011).
25,"the pop-up information balloons (placemarks) received the highest ratings, demonstrating that participants appreciated the addition of text, photographs and the ability to access links to relevant websites."
25,"these placemarks also allowed full disclosure of data sources, aiding transparency and trust in information, a key requirement to aid the legitimacy of landscape visualisations (lovett et al."
25,2015; sheppard & cizek 2009).
25,"interactivity was rated highly; being ‘free’ to explore different resources is a key aspect, and this is an area where fully-interactive tours may have an advantage over pre-recorded video tours."
25,"of course, as complexity increases, so does the risk of deterring or even excluding some people from the process, so the most effective approach is likely to involve a mix of media format types (berry & higgs 2012)."
25,"what is apparent, from observations and feedback in the facilitated group session, is that a clear set of opening instructions is vital for ensuring that people can engage with"
26,google earth tours without supervision.
26,the lack of support for kmz files on the latest google earth web and app versions may limit accessibility if participants do not wish to download the desktop version or work with a tablet rather than a computer.
26,"there are issues with appearance in google earth that cannot be eliminated (i.e. blurring and pixellation of elements such as boundary lines, particularly in close-ups and fly-throughs) due to the processing power of individual computers, the monitor/screen resolution being used and the performance of the google earth platform itself."
26,"despite this, visual clarity was well rated."
26,"follow-up meetings could enable refinements to address presentation issues, such as animation speed (harwood et al."
26,"2015; sheppard et al. 2011); however, balancing iterative user feedback with project/design practicalities can be problematic (grainger et al."
26,2016).
26,"5.3 communicating catchment features and nfm in comparison to conventional methods of communicating nfm, such as written reports and maps, the google earth tour has some significant advantages in the visually engaging way of learning about catchment processes and the landscape."
26,"the novel and interactive way in which often complex 2d spatial data are ‘brought to life’ using virtual tours clearly has good potential for educating people about, and engaging them with, their river catchments (pettit et al., 2011; sheppard & cizek, 2009)."
26,"survey responses indicated that it was helpful for communicating both the catchment features and issues impacting the isbourne, as well as adding context; with participants able to see the relationship between features and the impact of flooding, and also to understand causal"
27,influences such as topography and land use change.
27,"the tour was also helpful in demonstrating the techniques and potential for nfm, with participants remarking on the complexity and range of interests and agencies involved in the development of the nfm project."
27,some respondents expected more specific information regarding intended locations and techniques; a clear set of project objectives should therefore be included in the introduction to the tour.
27,"this tour was designed to improve understanding of the catchment area and communicate the potential benefits of nfm rather than propose specific nfm interventions (before they had been finalised with the ea and relevant landowners), thus avoiding any emotive or misleading future landscape scenarios (sheppard & cizek 2009)."
27,"one can imagine, for example, that a farmer who is yet to be engaged in the process might take exception to seeing his field covered in 3d tree models as part of a possible future nfm planning scenario."
27,"that said, the next step in this research is to evaluate the use of 3d landscape visualisations as a decision-making aid, where they could be used to display specific proposed interventions and alternative nfm planning scenarios at a more advanced state in the planning process."
27,"this can only be done within a robust ethical framework, and any data or materials that have the potential to mislead or cause a negative reaction should not be included."
27,the tour demonstrated the potential for improving the communication of information and promoting early stakeholder engagement (harwood et al.
27,2015; schroth et al.
27,2011).
27,viewers having less prior knowledge of nfm found the tour more helpful in providing
28,"catchment information, showing its usefulness for education and improving understanding."
28,"after viewing the tour, participants were interested in finding out more about nfm; follow-up discussions and a commitment of resources will be required to both motivate and to maintain engagement (todd et al."
28,2014).
28,"there was a clear perception among all survey respondents that nfm would be beneficial for alleviating flooding and improving water quality, but there was less consensus regarding the potential impact on landscape aesthetics or farming."
28,"these issues were more difficult to represent on the base map without identifying specific target locations or techniques, and although additional information was provided in the pop-ups and screen overlays, these may not have been the most effective forms of communication."
28,"remote participation does limit the opportunity for in-depth discussion and co-production of knowledge (lovett et al. 2015), which can be more achievable in a workshop/focus group (pettit et al."
28,"2011; schroth et al. 2011); thus using the tour in a facilitated setting can provide a useful forum to start conversations about aspects of the nfm process, whilst in a non-facilitated setting further communication or follow-up engagement may be required to build on feedback and ideas and achieve a level of consensus."
28,"6 conclusion this research has explored the potential of a google earth ‘virtual globe’ tour for enhancing communication of spatial data in a nfm planning scenario, using the river isbourne catchment, uk as a case study."
28,survey results indicated that the tour was
29,"helpful for developing an understanding of the catchment, its features and the issues it faces, as well as for demonstrating the potential of different nfm measures, particularly for those participants with no prior knowledge; it helped participants to recognise the complexity of solutions in the catchment and the number of agencies involved."
29,"this supports the finding of previous related research - that google earth is useful for enhancing environmental education, by helping to improve the communication of complex spatial data to lay audiences (harwood et al."
29,2015; schroth et al.
29,2011).
29,"this has the potential to impact on the future of collaborative environmental management, because having a diverse group of well-informed, highly-engaged stakeholders is more likely to lead to better decision-making (grainger et al."
29,2016; reed 2008; wilkinson et al.
29,2014).
29,"although not simple to develop, the tour itself was accessible; it was suitable for online distribution using relevant available open data and, using custom navigation and views, was both useable and clear."
29,"the process of creating the tour ultimately needs to be expert led, with input and guidance from appropriate stakeholders, but the end result can be used to engage a wide range of people, from those who are completely new to a topic to those with more specialist knowledge."
29,"this paper has discussed the potential of using the tour in the initial stages of project planning to educate people about the catchment and nfm as a concept; however, as this project progresses the tour will be used to engage stakeholders actively through incorporation of supplementary spatial data and details of the nfm interventions prior to and after implementation."
29,there is
30,"also potential to embed the tour as part of the decision-making process; to test alternative planning scenarios and interventions, and to gather stakeholder feedback."
30,"feedback indicated that interactivity of the tour was valued by the respondents, but there are other output formats available (such as videos, audio commentary and screenshots) that could appeal to those unable or unwilling to use the desktop version of google earth; once the tour is developed it takes minimal additional effort to create these."
30,future research could investigate the importance of the interactive features by comparing the experience with that of a pre-recorded video version and the effect of adding audio commentary.
30,"ongoing review of support for the google earth desktop platform is required; the mobile device apps and web version (v.9) currently have limited kml support, which may impact on future public interest in accessing ‘virtual globe’ tours."
30,"alternative landscape visualisation tools could be also be investigated to gain further insight into user preferences for the communication of catchment features and nfm, exploring the impact of levels of realism and interactivity (lovett et al., 2015); this could include gis-based story maps, and specialist 3d landscape visualisation software (e.g."
30,"visual nature studio) which can render landscape models with higher levels of realism, particularly ground textures and surface features such as vegetation and trees."
30,"the use of mobile computing and smartphones coupled with augmented reality (ar) technology, enabling a multi-sensory on-site experience, also has potential for engaging people within a facilitated session for those with access to the appropriate technology (gill and lange 2015)."
31,"for the tour created in this paper, the success will ultimately depend on the ability to communicate the potential benefits for incorporating nfm in the isbourne catchment, to generate both interest and long-term involvement from a wide range of stakeholders."
31,the uk government has committed to support more than 50 nfm projects across the country as part of its drive to roll out innovative techniques to reduce flood risk and build resilience (kaminski 2016).
31,the ‘virtual globe’ tour approach could play an important role in the engagement process through the planning stages; improving access and assisting with the understanding of complex spatial information and helping to generate trust.
31,"in a facilitated environment the tour can be used to encourage discussion and gain feedback, whilst the ease of distributing the tour online allows for the capture of views and opinion from a wide variety of respondents; this approach could therefore become part of a wider toolkit of engagement and communication as part of the policy requirements for public participation."
