1,"their availability, however, is limited in space and time because of the signiﬁcant resources required to observe them."
1,"to ﬁll this gap, the new york state mesonet (nysm) proﬁler network has been deployed as a national testbed to facilitate the research, development, and evaluation of ground-based proﬁling technologies and applications."
1,"the testbed comprises 17 proﬁler stations across the state, forming a long-term regional observational network."
1,"each proﬁler station comprises a ground-based doppler lidar, a microwave radiometer (mwr), and an environmental sky imager–radiometer (esir)."
1,"thermodynamic proﬁles (temperature and humidity) from the mwr, wind and aerosol proﬁles from the doppler lidar, and solar radiance and optical depth parameters from the esir are collected, processed, disseminated, and archived every 10 min."
1,"this paper introduces the nysm proﬁler network and reviews the network design and siting, instrumentation, network operations and maintenance, data and products, and some example applications that highlight the beneﬁts of the network."
1,"some sample applications include improved situational awareness and monitoring of the sea–land breeze, long-range wildﬁre smoke transport, air quality (pm2.5 and aerosol optical depth) and boundary layer height."
1,"ground-based proﬁling systems promise a path forward for ﬁlling a critical gap in the u.s. observing system with the potential to improve analysis and predic- tion for many weather-sensitive sectors, such as aviation, ground transportation, health, and wind energy."
1,significance statement: the new york state mesonet (nysm) proﬁler network enables routine measure- ment of aboveground weather data and products to monitor weather and air quality across the state at high resolutions.
1,"the nysm proﬁler network provides real-time vertical proﬁle information to users across the emergency management, avia- tion, utility, and public health sectors, including noaa and nasa, for operations and research, ﬁlling a critical gap in mon- itoring the low-level atmosphere."
1,"these data have been used to improve situational awareness and monitor boundary layer dynamics, sea-land breeze development, precipitation type, and air quality."
1,"most important, the nysm proﬁler network provides a national testbed for the creation and evaluation of new ground-based proﬁling instrumentation and products."
