9,"all correlation coefﬁcients (both land-use change calibration and validation period) were above 0.8, suggesting due to data source limitations, we analyzed the land use in the that both swat and deep learning models captured the study basin from 1990 to 1997."
9,the distribution of the land-use area area’s hydrologic characteristics well and reproduced acceptable ratio of xixian watershed is shown in figure 7.
9,it can be seen that discharge simulations.
9,"however, the swat model has poor there are ﬁve types of land use in the study area, mainly including performance in the initial stage (figure 8d), which is due to cultivated land and forest land, which account for about 90% of the watershed state at the initial time is not really enough."
9,in the basin area.
9,"of these, cultivated land is the main land-use type, addition, there was a signiﬁcant difference between the accounting for about 60% and the second is forest, accounting for calibration and validation period; both deep learning models about 30%."
9,"in order to fully demonstrate the degree of land type and the swat model were well in the calibration period, transfer of xixian watershed from 1990 to 1997, the rates of while the swat model was better in the validation period change in land use were used to conduct the research."
9,the rates of (table 4).
9,this may be linked to the variability of rainfall and change of land used in the study area are shown in table 3.

9,"deep learning models were less effective for time series worth noting that the degree of land-use change in the study area simulation with greater variability, and the swat model was is not obvious, which is very beneﬁcial for our research, and will suitable for long-term prediction."
9,"moreover, the performance was have a litter impact on the hydrological model. very similar for the two deep learning methods (figures 8e,f), which was also consistent with the characteristics of deep learning."

12,"therefore, although deep learning can obtain results of this study are not affected by the land-use change."
12,"from better results, there are certain requirements for the data set."
12,"in the results in sections 3.2–3.4, we can see that deep learning addition, compared with the cnn–lstm model, the size of the models acquire an acceptable predicted value but not as well as training set has a greater impact on the cnn–gru model (the the swat model in some respects."
12,"this is because deep learning red circle in figure 10), indicating that the cnn–gru model is models do not consider the changes of heterogeneity within the more sensitive to the size of training samples, which may be basin, but only mine and extract information features from the related to the internal structure of cnn–gru: gru has a data to ﬁnd its rules for training and prediction, which leads to a simpler structure, a gate less than lstm, fewer parameters, higher level representation of the underlying data sources (saba and simpliﬁes matrix operation, so the performance of gru is et al., 2019)."

13,"we can also see that this study develops the deep learning models, and the the swat model has poor performance in the initial stage distributed hydrological model for hydrological simulation (figure 10d), which may be related to the data or the setting and the results show their applicability."
13,"the proposed of the watershed state at the initial time, which is also the reason architecture builds the foundation for subsequent why the swat model is not as accurate as deep learning models hydrological analysis."
13,this study mainly has the following in the initiation stage.

13,"the results demonstrate that both models certain measurements or remote sensing data (isik et al., 2013). can provide a good performance at basin-scale hydrological moreover, the deep learning models have a certain dependence on simulation."
