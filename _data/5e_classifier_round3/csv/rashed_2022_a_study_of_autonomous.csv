3,"problem definition globally, major concerns exist regarding the major real-time issues faced by the small- satellite constellations during a significant period of their operations."
3,the questions that govern these issues can be framed as below: • how can the relief under the disaster situations be managed with the constellations with fast data rates and optimal travel path?
3,• which optimization technique can significantly reduce the travel path burden for each satellite in a plane or formation in constellation?
3,• how can we achieve autonomy in the newspace constellations to efficiently reduce the human intervention and efforts to maintain the best possible orbit every time it passes through a ground station until its lifecycle?
3,• how can we determine the major role of these constellations (with optimizers) in aligning the artemis and support operations for initial lunar missions and deep- space network?
3,this paper will provide insights on the optimization of the orbit travel period (range) by enhancing its orbital elements significantly by using predominant optimizing solu- tions.
3,"mainly, the inclination and the semi-major axis of each orbit in constellation are of prime importance."
3,the constellations launched globally have their own set of issues and concerns to maintain the quality of the incoming data as well as to maintain their respective orbits without losing them to perturbations or decaying due to leo environmental conditions.
3,a strong control on all the satellites can be balanced out by orbit travel period so that the data can be received by respective strategically placed ground stations timely.
3,"a detailed study on the parameters, situations, orbits, and related work carried out on constellations has been observed extensively."
3,there has been a significant research undergoing in this aspect of the constellations with majority of the constellation developers are making efforts to reduce the cost of the satellite development and operating them for the given lifecycle.
3,optimizing the number of satellites in a constellation is also a major concern among manufacturers.
3,the importance of choosing the best solution for the orbit remains to be higher than any other operating measure in real-time scenarios.
3,the shortest path of travel with a longest reception pass of a satellite is the need of the hour.
3,"the cost, objective, and coverage fracture contribute to the constellation’s best trajectories to be prepared and facilitate the end-users accordingly with the fastest receivable data."
3,the increasing demand in the disaster management applications from the satellites is quite overwhelming.
3,the data being received in a full package is an absolute necessity and managing them without many anomalies is an engineering challenge.
3,"the constellations of small satellites can contribute effectively towards filling up this vacuum with creative methodologies, continuous research, and implementation of unique techniques."
3,"this re- search is dedicated to the purpose of finding efficient solutions to the problem of providing effective, usable, continuous data to the end-user."
3,this can be achieved through the opti- mization and analysis of essential parameters and relating their importance on ground and in orbit through constellation of small-satellites with a unique configuration.
3,"towards this direction, the following terminologies were framed, discussed, and implemented."
3,"there are two terms used here, ‘long pass’ and ‘long period’, as shown in figure 3."
3,"the long pass is the always desirable from any ground station point of view because the longer the pass of a satellite over a ground station, the better the reception window of the data and possibility of a full packet to be received."
3,"if the pass is for a shorter period of time (calling it short pass), it can influence the delivery quality of the data to the ground station and have poor packet reception (possibilities are more)."
3,the long period can be defined as the period of wait for the satellite to reach again to the same ground station without an optimizer used.
3,"if the optimizer is used, the long period is changed to shorter one and the wait time is reduced."
3,"hence, it is important to reduce this time of waiting before each pass as it contributes towards faster data reception and early availability for the disaster relief situations."

6,"there has been certain research carried out to determine a reasonably optimal walker constellation for several real-time applications, but for disaster management the scope still remains open."
6,there can be significant improvisation in maintaining and optimizing trajectories with an autonomous alignment approach to make the data delivery faster as needed.
7,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 6148 7 of 28 hence, detailed research was carried out to study the mathematical models which are most suited for this kind of application using autonomous technology and algorithms."
7,"this is not only to enhance the trajectories, but also to significantly reduce the number of satellites to be operated to achieve a particular coverage objective."
7,"from the literature, it has been observed that a variety of modules have been used for understanding several scenarios of constellation operation through walker patterns."
7,"for this paper, a few of the most significant approaches were followed and implemented as suitable to the major objective (disaster management) for the optimization and maintenance of a global small satellite (using cots) constellation understanding and undertaking all the constraints and situations in real-time conditions, respectively."
7,the main issue of coverage was addressed using the phenomena of nadir-pointing coverage circle area a presented by ref. [4] to be given as follows: 2πr2 h a= (1) r+h where r is the radius of earth and h is the altitude of the satellite.
7,the potential of the walker pattern can be properly utilized with its parameters align- ing as required/suitable by their appropriate mathematical modeling considering the initial real-time conditions.
7,"the important integers mentioned as n (satellites), p (planes), and f (phasing parameter) define the relative movement of the satellites in a plane and autonomous control is also implemented to secure their movement with respect to the satel- lites in other planes."
7,"the specialty of the walker constellation is that the satellites remain uniformly distributed along the plane, giving enough opportunity to plan and implement the autonomous formation among them in a plane they are operating."
7,"additionally, one interesting fact about this is that the only two parameters, which vary and have significant impacts on the constellation, have semi-major axes and inclination of the orbits with respect to the travel trajectory optimization."
7,the right ascension of the ascending nodes (raan) also varies when aligning the orbits in different positions without interfering with one another.
7,"the correlation among the raan and the mean anomaly was also set using ref. [4] as follows: ωij = 2πp ( i − 1) (2) mij = 2π 2π s ( j − 1) + n f ( i − 1) where s = n/p represents the number of satellites per plane, ω is the raan and the m represents the mean anomaly respectively."
7,the reference to the user position is also of importance when the coverage of the satellite is considered for the disaster relief management.
7,"according to ref. [4], there must be at least four satellites in sight at any time for determining a position of a potential user."
7,"the equation for the same is given by ref. [5] as: σ = α.σpref (3) where σ is the user position error, α is the factor depending the relative position of the satellites, and σpref is the pseudo range error factor."
7,"in fact, the reference mentions that the role of α is so large that the larger its value, the lower the quality or coverage of the given constellation with respect to the location of the end-user."
7,"equation (3) and refs. [4,5] are quoted to understand the concept and importance of end user position error."
7,this also determines and implies that the case of a global augmentation constellation with a single objective function is considered as having a global average of four visible satellites at each time of the pass over a ground station or an end-user location.
7,due consideration of this concept was given while formulating the design constraints and the configuration of this paper by first selecting the areas of interests and aligning the ground stations across them.
7,"then, the constellation design was prepared to suit the"
8,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 6148 8 of 28 orientation of the ground stations with a 45-degree inclination of each orbit to cover the areas as mentioned in the following sections."
8,the optimization of these trajectories to find the best travel path is necessary to obtain the shortest path for satellites to travel and deliver the data in the quickest way possible.
8,"however, the end-user position error analysis is not included in this paper as the focus remained on the optimization and factors mentioned in the abstract."
8,"in the near future, a detailed study on the visibility and end-user positioning and error analyses is planned with a similar configuration."
8,there is also a need for establishing the ground stations in sync with satellites deployed to receive the data and track the satellites in operation.
8,"for the same, the repeating ground track (rgt) was selected as continuous revisits are essential for leo-based constellations."
8,"the ref. [6] show a detailed overview of the dynamics involved in ground tracking and following it, the required equations were determined as below: ℵ = [τ, e, i, ω, ω, m] t (4) where τ is the ratio of number of revolutions (np ) and the number of nodal periods (nd )."
8,"a very interesting fact noticed here with regard to the walker constellations is that under certain ground conditions, the common ground tracking (cgt) utilizing the circular repeat ground track (rgt) orbits is expressed as follows: i : n/n/( n − np ) (5) where nd is 1 and follows the same notation as the walker constellation as represented in equation (2), respectively."
8,that means the cgt constellation with rgt orbits is a common scenario used extensively by the constellation operators globally.
8,"moreover, the access profile condition was also determined using ref. [6], which provides the actual relation between the relative position vectors from the ground to the satellite as follows: γ = rs − r g (6) where rs is the satellite position vector from earth’s center and r g is the target point position vector from the earth’s center."
8,the elevation angle for the same is given as follows: !
8,"r g .γ _ _ ε = sin−1 = sin−1 ( r g . γ ) (7) r g kγk on the other side, ref. [7] elaborated the target to satellite angular relations and emphasized maintaining thorough pattern designs using the same."
8,the references suggest that the instance angle will be an addition of the elevation angle and 90 degrees exactly and can be expressed as below: ϑ = 90o + φ (8) where ϑ is the instance angle and φ is the elevation angle.
8,"the inclination is fixed; hence, even for walker constellation, the angles and their orientation play a vital role in aligning the satellites specific to certain boundary conditions."
8,"a special napier’s rule was used for right spherical triangles as below: latitude: sin(ψ) = sin(θ ) sin(i ) (9) similarly, a satellite’s longitude is determined as: tan( ϕ) = tan(θ ) cos(i ) (10)"

[7], and is thoroughly followed for the simulations."
9,"the angles among the planes and satellites are defined as follows: κ, ξ and ζ are the radial spacing plane to plane in celestial sphere, angle between satellites in same plane, and angular offset between satellites from one plane to another."

9,"finally, the raan spacing for each plane was also set as below: θ ϕ e = ϕ0 + κ + (13) q where θ is the true anomaly and q is the number of orbits over a single rotation of earth."

16,"overall, in view of the description given for the scenarios and analysis presented through the figures below, it is observed to keep a continual track of the small satellites."
16,this is for the effective understanding of the operations on orbit and on ground together in a synchronization which will ease the separate and discrete tracking required for the constellation operators for each satellite.
16,"though it is managed autonomously and reported daily, the unknown anomalies and data-less data packet scenarios can be sighted and reported for the researchers to analyze them for avoiding any chances of operation halting at any given instances."

16,the interior point optimizer (ipopt) is an optimization technique used for various purposes in the past and has served optimization needs over years.
16,"however, for this particular constellation scenario, this optimizer is being tested and aligned to the major parameters of the orbital dynamics to precisely know the best objective and coverage function possible for the given set-up in section 3 of this paper."
16,"with regard to the orbit elements, the semi-major axis and inclination (as discussed earlier) remain as major orbital parameters to define the objection function and deliver the best solution for a full coverage scenario through a coverage function defined."

22,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 6148 22 of 28 lunar constellation and communication set-up, it is crucial to perform analyses on how the parameters interact with and make possible impacts on the overall communication and support operations."
22,"hence, a detailed analysis was carried out and the following results were observed as below: the simulations were based on the assumptions of the lunar environment and small satellite mass of about 85 kg and related configuration parameters were set accordingly."
22,the need for these satellites operating in lunar ambience is a pivotal element of the newspace era.
22,figure 22a show the variation of apogee height of all the satellites with the elapsed time of master satellite (caps1) as one of the important parameters to keep tracking health of these satellites and know their farthest point to the moon at all times.
22,it was observed that the satellites remained stable under the given lunar perturbations and local conditions as shown below but this monitoring has to be continuous and be observed until their lifecycles expire.
22,these observations were made for 5 days of propagation.
22,tracking the position of the satellites with due consideration to the elevation angle from the ground station is a major scenario to observe.
22,"as shackleton is located at the south pole, the tracking of the operations and the astronaut positions will be a heavy-duty responsibility of the small satellites."
22,they need to coordinate with ground systems at shackleton to let it know their position and be available at its designed elevation angle and tracking capabilities.
22,"hence, figure 22b provides a detailed outlook of how the tracking and positioning of each satellite being monitored with the shackleton ground station."
22,"when considering a two-body problem with an earth and moon system, the lunar beta angle plays a vital role in knowing the satellite’s operating track and monitoring it in the long run."
22,the beta-earth angle is the angle among the earth–moon vector and the lunar orbit plane in which satellites are installed to operate.
22,figure 22c provides a significant idea about how the lunar beta angles would vary with respect to the elapsed time of the given master satellite (caps1) at the shackleton ground station.
22,"all the satellites showed the same behavior over time and remained consistent with their beta angles, which is a great sign considering a harsh lunar environment and stable tracking."
22,the velocities are essential track in order to know their behavior in the lunar environ- ment irrespective of their other operating parameters.
22,the reason for this is that changes in velocities (delta-v factor) provides crucial information on the health of the satellites in their orbits and define the need for control and maneuvers in a timely manner for continuous operation and ground support.
22,"hence, figure 22d outlines a monitoring scenario of all satellites in constellation over 5 days."
22,"the variation in this scenario remained under 2 km/s for a full orbit movement, ensuring stability in their operating environment."
22,"as mentioned in section 6, the semi-major axis and inclination of the orbits are promi- nent orbital parameters to align an optimal trajectory for each plane in a constellation, as lunar missions supporting artemis also need regular optimizations to keep up quick access of the satellite information to the systems and astronauts on lunar surface."
22,"though this pa- per did not cover the optimizations of the orbits, an observation of both its parameters was given to analyze their behavior under severe lunar conditions as portrayed."
22,"figure 22e,f shows the variation of the semi-major axis and inclination with the elevation angle form the ground station at shackleton of each satellite (caps1~4)."
22,"finally, the alphare angle was used to give additional support to the attitude and control of the satellites and their tracking being analyzed for this scenario."
22,"this is the angle between the satellite’s y-axis and projection of satellite-earth vector on satellite’s y–z plane as shown in figure 22g, respectively."
22,"as shown, the aphare remained under 90 degrees, which provides a good sign of the satellite’s healthy operation within its given orbit."
22,this will be continuously monitored and upgraded over time of its lifecycle.
22,a consistent research on the literature work is carried out to be aware of how others are aligning their thoughts with respect to artemis operations and other lunar missions as well.

24,conclusions this research was directed towards making an impact on the utilization of the cost- effective solutions to build small satellite constellations mainly for disaster management applications globally.
24,"small satellites utilizing cots have great reach in terms of resource and cost effectiveness, along with mems as a primary technology for sub-system level development for real-time execution in a constellation."
24,"however, planning the operations and designing an autonomous constellation is a distinct challenge when involving small satellites under 500 kg with a global coverage and less resources and reachability, which represent the need of the hour."
24,this paper mainly emphasized the coverage analysis and optimization of the orbits in a small satellite constellation to obtain the best feasible solutions in terms of travel time and fastest data transmission to the respective ground stations.
24,this was achieved by altering the orbital elements most suitable to reach a particular location.
24,the interior point (ipopt) optimizer was used with the proposed constellation set-up to analyze the best optimal solutions in low-earth orbits autonomously.
24,"the simulation performed iterations as per the given initial mission design parameters, determined the feasibility of the solution, and then the best solution itself as per the given scenario."
24,this optimizer (ipopt) has been used for several non-linear solutions for various other applications in the past.
24,"however, what is unique here is that on a non-linear large-scale such as a constellation with small satellites having limited resources and higher constraints on-board, the optimization of coverage has to be continuous and impactful in an autonomous and harsh environmental condition. ipopt provides solutions firmly for the continuous optimization problem in a non-linear state, which is suited predominantly for the leo region under the influence of atmospheric and solar radiation-based issues."
24,"though this work is mainly directed towards the disaster management and deep space strategy with artemis, refs. [21–24] gave enough motivation to propel towards a contributing research."
24,"the uniqueness/novelty this paper brings about is to highlight the fact that the cover- age analysis is not merely about having a global satellite reach with a number of satellites in a constellation, but it is about designing the configuration in such a way that even with minimum satellites forming the constellation, we can attain a wider coverage in due consideration of real and local environmental conditions, as is key for future missions."
24,"this initial mission design configuration in this paper is presented with a 45-degree inclination of the orbits in a walker-like pattern, which is usually not the scenario with traditional walker constellations."
24,this has been detailed keeping in view the testing of the operation with a uniquely defined configuration of this proposed constellation for better coverage with minimum satellites.
24,"after the execution of the same, the operation seemed normal at changing altitudes ranging from 400 to 650 kms (6500~7000 km semi-major axis)."
24,"after the optimization for better coverage, the feasibility of iterations and the solution itself never failed and gave the best-case trajectory solution in terms of cost and objective functions along with a well-defined coverage fraction."
24,it is extremely crucial to note here that this particular leo region is of prime significance for disaster management application through a constellation of small satellites as proposed.
24,all the major perturbations and solar ra- diation pressure concentrated in that region and became a matter of research concern in recent times of newspace era.
24,"this aspect has been thoroughly taken into due consid- eration while simulating the proposed configuration, analyzing and optimizing it."
24,"also, refs. [25–28] give a good sense of how critical issues of planning, control and power of satellite constellations can be addressed unique methodologies."
25,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 6148 25 of 28 as this constellation is aimed for the asian region though it has a global coverage, the area of interest was chosen to be south korea by creating a specific region-based procedure to highlight the points on that region in 3d/2d."
25,"the reason for this is whenever satellites pass through this highlighted region, the colors of the points change and indicate the coverage over this area of interest is ensured and covered by the optimizer."
25,there can be many such regions as per the end user locations and ground stations.
25,"in addition to this, perturbation analysis was carried out to re-configure the satellite with atmospheric drag (j2) and solar radiation pressure (srp) with an individual and combined effort insofar as that satellite propagation in the aligned orbit is concerned."
25,this contributes towards the better understanding of how these satellites can be influenced by these disturbances the orbit in long run and helps in preparation of the risk management on-orbit and on the ground.
25,"not only on the orbit scenario of a constellation, but the ground-based operations were detailed with six ground stations located globally and a specific analysis was carried out to determine the impact of varying inclination, position, and altitude of each satellite with aligning elevation angles from the ground."
25,this will give a thorough overview instantly to the operator of the orientation of satellites to ground station with the given constellation propagation scenario and the health of the reception during a pass as given in section 5.
25,"except, few deviations, the overall propagation of the satellites over the ground stations remained under the common proportions, satisfying the designed mission to be effective in operation under the aligned real-time harsh environmental conditions."
25,"after due consideration to all these aspects, the integrated optimizer was scripted along with the given mission configuration of the set-up presented in section 3."
25,it was then run for finding a best possible solution and even checking if the solution is feasible with the given scenario or not.
25,the solution was feasible and was obtained with about 150 iterations and 250 evalua- tion count as given in table 1.
25,"the computation was quick and took about 30 s to give out the final solution, which was competitive with 48 satellites on a traditional desktop with nominal configuration but can be fairly improvised with additional computing abilities provided."
25,"the semi-major axis was improvised by 4.19% and the inclination was optimized by 15.91%, which is a significantly sufficient scenario for this mission configuration."
25,the time and space complexity with or without optimizer were about negligible (1~2 s) and executed instantly without any anomalies with storage consumption of about 50~60 kb on memory.
25,"with the basic assumptions made in the form of set-up shown in the section 3 with real- time disturbances such as j2 perturbations and solar radiation pressure, there were a few limitations with this approach."
25,this optimization technique is specific only with large-scale non-linear systems and environment.
25,it provides limited iteration-based mathematical solutions to the optimization for the coverage analysis for this proposed constellation.
25,"though the accuracy of the optimization was optimal and continuous, the computation and number of the iterations can be further improvised as small satellites have limited computation abilities on-board."
25,"overall, the method of executing this optimization yielded satisfying results as desired and is very well suited for complex constellations."
25,"this research also aimed to support artemis missions with the solutions experimented and obtained for leo, which can indeed facilitate the operations (both crewed and un- crewed) on the lunar surface."
25,"simulations were presented in this paper to highlight a scenario in which a small satellite constellation will be crucial for the communication and data transfer among the satellites and to the ground station based both on the lunar surface and on earth, respectively."
25,the results shown have greater significance in the ground operations to sustain and access the conditions and communicate effectively using these small satellite constellations in low-moon orbits.
25,"the orbits designed were of 3000 kms, which is the lowest altitude of the gateway outpost in the artemis mission."
25,"the position, velocity, orbital elements, and tracking elements presented and detailed will be vital in operating the artemis mission in the given frame of orientation over the moon."

26,"apart from all the work done through this or other research, it is concerning yet to see how much yet remaining is to be done to make all of it come in real-time execution and contribute in saving human lives and resources being destructed due to natural disasters."
26,"according to united nations office for disaster risk reduction (undrr) and ref. [30], until 2021, there has been a loss of approximately 280 billion usd in infra-structure and resources with 103.5 million people affected globally."
26,this is a severe situation and needs to be dealt with before it is too late.
26,the global warming is changing the ecosystem at an unimaginable pace that needs to be defended for a sustainable earth with effective methodologies and innovative technological implementations like cost-effective small satellite constellations and their efficient applications.
