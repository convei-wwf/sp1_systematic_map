1,"†facultad de ciencias, universidad nacional autónoma de méxico, mexico, d.f., 04510, mexico abstract: for conservation decision making, species’ geographic distributions are mapped using various approaches."
1,some such efforts have downscaled versions of coarse-resolution extent-of-occurrence maps to fine resolutions for conservation planning.
1,we examined the quality of the extent-of-occurrence maps as range summaries and the utility of refining those maps into fine-resolution distributional hypotheses.
1,"extent- of-occurrence maps tend to be overly simple, omit many known and well-documented populations, and likely frequently include many areas not holding populations."
1,"refinement steps involve typological assumptions about habitat preferences and elevational ranges of species, which can introduce substantial error in es- timates of species’ true areas of distribution."
1,"however, no model-evaluation steps are taken to assess the predictive ability of these models, so model inaccuracies are not noticed."
1,"whereas range summaries derived by these methods may be useful in coarse-grained, global-extent studies, their continued use in on-the-ground conservation applications at fine spatial resolutions is not advisable in light of reliance on assumptions, lack of real spatial resolution, and lack of testing."
1,"in contrast, data-driven techniques that integrate primary data on biodiversity occurrence with remotely sensed data that summarize environmental dimensions (i.e., ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling) offer data-driven solutions based on a minimum of assumptions that can be evaluated and validated quantitatively to offer a well-founded, widely accepted method for summarizing species’ distributional patterns for conservation applications."

1,examinamos la calidad de los mapas de área de presencia como resúmenes de la distribución y la utilidad de refinar aquellos mapas en hipótesis de distribución de resolución fina.
1,"los mapas de extensión de presencia tienden a ser demasiado simples, a omitir muchas poblaciones conocidas y bien documentadas, y muy probablemente, con frecuencia incluyen muchas áreas que no contienen poblaciones."
1,"los pasos para la refinación involucran suposiciones tipológicas sobre las preferencias de hábitat y el intervalo de elevación de las especies, lo cual puede introducir un error sustancial en el estimado de las verdaderas áreas de distribución de las especies."
1,"sin embargo, no se toma en cuenta ninguno de los pasos de evaluación de modelos para valorar la habilidad predictiva de estos modelos, ası́ que las imprecisiones de los modelos no se notan."
1,"mientras que los resúmenes de extensión derivados de estos métodos pueden ser útiles en estudios de extensión global con resolución gruesa, su uso continuo en las aplicaciones de la conservación en sitios que requieren resoluciones finas no es aconsejable por la dependencia de las suposiciones, la falta de una verdadera resolución espacial y la falta de pruebas."
