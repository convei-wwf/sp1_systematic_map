11,"the solution to this problem is not straightforward, but a possible way forward would be the integration of gpcc and era5 or the use of available integrated products (beck et al., 2017)."
11,the advantage of relying only on a single rainfall source (as to ensure homogeneity) however will be lost in that case.
11,"note that, except for conus where rain gauge infor- mation is ingested into era5 (lopez, 2011), the integrated product is totally independent of the rain gauge."
11,"this allows for independently cross-validating the integrated product in eu, in, au and conus during 2015–2017 against high- quality ground-based rainfall observations (see sect."
11,4.1.1).
11,the latter serves to understand if the entire procedure of inte- gration described in sect.
11,3.3 is correct and provide an over- all idea of the maximum potential performance that can be obtained by the integrated product (being performed in the same period used for calibration).
11,4.1.1 classical validation over key regions using high-quality ground-based observations figure 3 summarizes the products used in pr+sm pixel by pixel for the different key regions.
11,"while for in- dia and australia, sm2rain-ascat, sm2rain-smos and sm2rain-smap are present almost everywhere, over conus and europe there exist areas where sm2rain- smos was not used either because radio frequency inter- ference which was too high was found in the smos prod- uct or because of its relatively low performance (chen et al., 2018)."

12,"in terms of the variability ratio, we did not observe signif- icant conditional biases of the pr+sm product in europe and conus, although the use of rmse as a calibration score of sm2rain (see sect."
