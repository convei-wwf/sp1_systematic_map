6,our case study provides methodological lessons for pes programmes.
6,"despite obtaining aerial photographs at a very high pixel resolution (0.6 m), we did not detect individual tree discussion extractions that were later found during field work."
6,"this was the photointerpretation showed no changes occurred in 23 of not because these extractions were undetectable, since viewing the 29 properties, while field sampling showed little extraction the high resolution images stereoscopically permits the in 10 of 12 of the properties sampled."
6,this suggests that most identification of individual tree loss.
6,"rather, these finer scale property owners were respecting the new mbbr boundaries. changes were not reported because the photointerpretation more significantly, properties that previously had logging method is based on the classification of canopy density, and permits were found to have effectively ceased logging."
6,while the extraction of individual trees was insufficient to alter the a comprehensive evaluation of the mbcf’s impact is beyond canopy classification from one category to another.
6,"searching the scope of this article, at first glance, the mbcf retired for individual tree extractions is technically possible, but 6009 m3 of timber during the 2003 harvest cycle because this impractical for a large study area."
6,"the difficulties in detecting was the volume that would have been extracted legally without finer scale changes, despite having a resolution over 1000 the new protected area and mbcf."
6,"however, it remains times greater than landsat satellite imagery, leads us to possible that logging moved elsewhere in what is referred to as suspect that conservation programmes reliant on landsat are ‘leakage’. underestimating forest loss and overpaying non-compliant while we would like to attribute additional forest protection actors."
6,"if this is the case, then the land-use changes widely to the operation of the mbcf, this is not possible with reported in the literature are also probably underestimates of only two years of data."

7,"it is especially important that property the threshold is too low, the smallest level forest change owners have the power to restrict access to their resources. may disqualify property owners from receiving payment."

7,"pes managers will need payment decisions requires interdisciplinary teams with to decide which undesirable situation is preferable: either expertise in remote sensing, forestry, environmental payment when significant land-use change has occurred, economics and research design."
7,existing remote sensing or withholding payment under conditions of very minor data and methods for monitoring forest cover cannot detect environmental change.
7,"in the case of the mbcf, this changes at finer scales."
7,"this suggests that current pes dilemma emerged during the decision-making process, and pes-like schemes are underestimating the land-use because payment thresholds were not established in the design changes and overpaying non-compliant participants."
7,even phase of the programme.
7,"declaring a decision rule from the in cases where precise data on environmental change are outset may appear to resolve this issue, however, declaring obtained, sound decisions about withholding payment rely on a permissible level of environmental change may encourage understanding of the marginal values of ecosystem services. landowners to engage in strategic behaviour and exploit just in the future, as technology increases the ability to observe below the permissible level."
7,"therefore in order to meet the changes at smaller scales, the question of how to make payment conditionality feature of a pes programme, managers are decisions in pes programmes will attract more attention. forced to create decision rules that inherently will balance competing risks."
