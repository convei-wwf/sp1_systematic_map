1,the aim of the safari project is to accelerate the assimilation of earth-observation data into ﬁsheries research and management by facilitating the application of rapidly evolving satellite technology.
1,this assumes that these data will be available in future.
1,"however, for ocean-colour data, that assumption may not hold because of possible gaps in data continuity."
1,"of the many types of satellite data, ocean colour is the most important to ﬁsheries, because it is the only biological measurement."
1,"however, current ocean-colour sensors are all operating beyond their planned design life, and there are potential problems with future launches."
1,"although the research community is aware of the value of satellite ocean-colour data, advocacy from the operational community, ﬁshery manage- ment in particular, has been lacking."
1,"in the united states, the absence of an easily identiﬁable operational need for ocean-colour data is largely responsible for the likely gap in data continuity."
1,"a range of current and potential operational uses of ocean-colour data, some reasons why these data have been underutilized in ﬁshery management, and what can be done to mitigate them are discussed and outlined."
1,"keywords: chlorophyll, ﬁsheries, research to operations, satellite ocean colour."

1,"in the united states, the two agencies responsible because of the availability of ocean-colour data."
1,"after describing for flying environmental satellites are the national aeronautics the term operational, a range of current and potential “operational” and space administration (nasa) and the national oceanic uses of ocean-colour data is discussed."
1,some reasons why ocean- and atmospheric administration (noaa).
1,"nasa is responsible colour data have been underutilized in fishery management and for research and development of new satellite missions, whereas what can be done to mitigate them are outlined."
1,"the united noaa is responsible for launching and maintaining operational states is not the only country flying ocean-colour satellites: satellites to acquire data on the earth’s atmosphere and oceans europe, japan, and india all have satellite ocean-colour programmes, and providing continuity for these datastreams."
1,"however, little but the focus here is on the r2o process of ocean colour in the of the sensor technology developed by nasa has been utilized united states."
1,"hence, operational usages of ocean-colour data are by noaa (national research council, 2003; us commission discussed from a us perspective, an important caveat, because on ocean policy, 2004)."
1,"the transition process from research to there are international differences in what constitutes operational operations (r2o) has earned the nickname “valley of death”, a usage. metaphor for the barriers separating research results from oper- ational applications (national research council, 2000a)."
1,"this the history of satellite ocean colour “valley of death” has been bridged fairly successfully for weather the first ocean-colour satellite, the coastal zone color scanner forecasting (serafin et al., 2002) and discussion has started about (czcs), was launched in 1978 by nasa, and was operational the r2o process for climate issues (national research council, until late 1986 (figure 1)."

2,seawifs and modis were both launched by ocean-colour temperature scanner (octs) in 1996 and the nasa as research missions.
2,"two modis sensors were launched, global imager (gli) in 2002."
2,neither remained operational for one on the terra satellite in 1999 and one on the aqua satellite more than a year (figure 1). in 2002.
2,"however, because of uncertainties and instabilities in india launched the ocean-colour monitor (ocm) in 1999. the pre-launch and in-orbit characterization of modis-terra, however, data from this sensor have generally not been available these data have been largely unusable (franz et al., 2008). to the international community and there are also serious issues hereafter, the term “modis” refers to the sensor on the aqua sat- with its calibration (lyon, 2009)."

2,"most papers using ocm data have come from the indian community (figure 2), which underscores downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/68/4/677/645604 by guest on 23 november 2024 the inaccessibility of the data on an international level."
2,the numbers in figure 2 actually overestimate the international disse- mination associated with a particular sensor.
2,"for example, of the 65 papers (table 1) citing ocm data, only two have author lists without indian affiliation."
2,"the follow-on to ocm, ocm-2, was launched in september 2009."
2,"a major impetus for ocm-2 was the need for ocean-colour data for forecasting potential fishing zones (pfzs; see nayak et al., 2003)."
2,"it is anticipated that data from ocm-2 will be more accessible to the international commu- nity, but this remains to be seen."
2,europe launched the medium resolution imaging spectro-meter (meris) in 2002.
2,"meris has a narrower swathe width than seawifs and modis and, hence, less frequent coverage."
2,"although meris data accessibility has improved since its launch, there are still issues."
2,"for example, level 1 data, which are needed to apply regional atmos- pheric corrections, are not openly distributed."
2,"the more restricted data availability, relative to us sensors, is reflected in the statistics figure 1."

6,"some examples of this are given below. so greater spatial and temporal resolution is needed to resolve their features, e.g. 30– 300 m, multiple looks per day (ioccg, 2000)."
6,these spatial and temporal scales are unachievable simultaneously better data accessibility with polar-orbiting satellites.
6,"airborne sensors deliver high spatial courses conducted by noaa were designed to help participants resolution, with fewer atmospheric correction issues, but provide work with satellite data using arcgis, software familiar to many only a single snapshot in time (carder et al., 1993; davis et al., fishery scientists."
6,"because importing satellite data into arcgis 2002; filippi et al., 2006)."
6,"geostationary satellites are the best can be cumbersome, particularly for lengthy time-series, a new option for high temporal resolution, which has been demonstrated arcgis extension (environmental data connector, edc) now with sst data (maturi et al., 2008)."

6,"hyperion, a nasa hyperspectral sensor originally designed for the edc is available, at no cost, at http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/ land applications, have been useful in complex coastal regions products/edc/ or http://www.asascience.com/."
6,"(brando and dekker, 2003; lee et al., 2007b)."
6,"noaa courses also identified the need for a simple method of it is crucial that cdrs of ocean-colour data be archived and matching satellite data with moving datapoints, such as tagged maintained to provide a baseline for gauging marine ecosystem animals or ships."

6,"(pinnock et al., 2007)."
6,it is no longer sufficient to simply post large datafiles on the web and expect them to be used.

6,"ocean-colour data are in the definition and assessment of lmes (sherman et al., 2011) often just one of many satellite products of interest, so sites that and the development of an ecosystem approach to fisheries offer one-stop shopping are most useful."
