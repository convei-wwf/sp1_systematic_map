1,"we make use of planetscope imagery, which has recently become available as a freely planet labs available remote sensing data source with a revisit time of less than 24 hours, almost global coverage, and samothrace spectral and spatial resolution on par with other commercially available sensors."
1,"the high temporal resolution of ndvi planetscope data allows for better detection of changes in land cover that are the result of severe weather events, whose eﬀects may be cleared up within several days of occurring or are more pronounced in the immediate aftermath of disturbances."
1,"focusing on two severe storms that struck the island of samothrace, in the northern aegean, on july 17 and september 25/26 2017 respectively and which caused considerable damage to local infrastructure and archaeological sites, we test the utility of these data for detecting the island-wide distribution of the eﬀects of these weather events."
1,we ﬁnd that these data are suﬃciently sensitive to detect and quantify the extent of surface runoﬀ processes and argue that the detection and monitoring capabilities of these data provide a useful tool for outlining policies to mitigate future damages to cultural heritage sites.

5,we employ the boa reﬂectance data for this study.
5,comparison of pre- and post-storm imagery was done based on diﬀerences in normal diﬀerentiated value index (ndvi) values be- tween the two sets of images.
5,"ndvi is a vegetation index with a wide range of applications, which is useful for assessing the relative health of vegetation as well as diﬀerentiating vegetation from other land cover types (vihervaara et al., 2017; xie et al., 2008; xue and su, 2017)."
5,ndvi is calculated as the diﬀerence between spectral reﬂectance measurements in the red and infrared regions divided by the sum of these values.
5,"ndvi values range from −1 to 1, with healthy vegetation falling generally between 0.3 and 0.8."
5,"due to its sensitivity to changes in vegetative health, time series ndvi analysis has been increasingly used for studying changes in agricultural land use, deforestation, and urban growth (bellon et al., 2017; eisavi et al., 2015; liao et al., 2017; lv et al., 2017)."
