1,"introduction in the big data era, earth observation technologies provide powerful capabilities to obtain enormous amounts of diverse geospatial data in an on-demand and continuous fashion [1]."
1,"for example, the nasa earth observing system data and information system (eosdis) collects approximate 22 terabytes of data per day via orbital and airborne sensors [2]."
1,hundreds of earth-observing satellites are currently in orbit and performing various observation tasks.
1,"these satellites, such as landsat, modis, and the gf series, play an important role in monitoring regional water resources by collecting many spatial, spectral, radiation, and time-scale observation products that reflect chlorophyll, suspended solids, and turbidity in the water [3]."
1,the geospatial data abstraction library (gdal) is widely used to access and process raster and vector geospatial data [4].
1,"it is an open-source geospatial library that supports the translation and processing of data in common geospatial formats such as geotiff, arc/info ascii grid, and esri shapefile."

2,"hydrological earth observations can be processed to support the monitoring and analysis of hydrological disasters, such as flood disasters and water pollution."
2,the entire data processing workflow can be accomplished locally or remotely using distributed information infrastructures such as spatial data infrastructures or cyberinfrastructures.
2,"traditionally, desktop gis software (e.g., envi or grass) or tools are usually used to process data step by step [6,7]."
2,"in a remote approach, large volumes of data and powerful computing resources are encapsulated as services with standard interfaces and protocols to enable web-based sharing and automatic access, thus significantly enhancing the ability to use online/near-line data over the web and allowing the widespread automation of data analysis and computation [8]."
2,"the open geospatial consortium (ogc) has developed a number of specifications for standardizing geospatial web services, including the web coverage service (wcs), web map service (wms), web feature service (wfs), and web processing service (wps) standards [9]."
2,"consequently, various sensors, geospatial data, and geoprocessing functions can be wrapped into such services according to these standards to promote the widespread sharing of and on-demand access to these resources in a distributed environment."
2,geospatial web services can be used in various application domains to enable automatic monitoring and analysis [10].
2,the complex geoprocessing associated with existing geospatial data and geoprocessing services can be implemented as service chains to perform complex data analysis and computations [11–13].
2,"hydrological disasters can cause tremendous losses of life and property [14,15]."
2,"these hazards are defined as violent, sudden, and destructive changes occurring on land, at sea, or in the atmosphere and are characterized as emergency events [16]."
2,active hydrological disaster monitoring is important for discovering hazard states and tracking their evolution.
2,formulating strategies for hydrological disaster monitoring includes not only the development of hydrological models and programs but also the integration of web-related technologies and traditional hydrological methods.
2,"for example, the simulation of hydrological extreme events (shee) software has been developed to display, analyse and interpret hydrological processes (e.g., spatial and temporal rainfall distributions, soil moisture states and water routing tendencies) in watersheds based on records of rainfall and flow [17,18]."
2,"traditional distributed hydrological models, such as the topography-based hydrological model (topmodel) [19], the mike she model [20] and grid-based distributed hydrological models (gb models) [21], are continually being improved to enhance their performance and practicality for predicting watershed runoffs, simulating water flows and forecasting floods [22–24]."
2,"with advancements in web-related technologies, web service technologies have begun to be used in hydrological risk management and disaster monitoring to provide an integrated solution for disaster warning, data collection, data processing, and results visualization."
2,"adhering to the web service approach, topmodel has been implemented in the form of web services that can be easily accessed through the ogc wps interface and protocol over the web [25–27]."
2,"a rainfall–runoff model lisflood [28], which is a gis-based distributed model, has been proposed for the simulation of runoff and flooding in hydrological processes [29]."
2,"dp ames et al. have presented the design and implementation of a web service-based software package named hydrodesktop for discovering, downloading, managing, visualizing, and analysing hydrological data [30]."
2,"several researchers are committed to introducing specific data platforms (e.g., the malawi spatial data platform (masdap)) that couple gis technologies with hydrological processes to perform step-by-step analyses [31]."
2,sensor web technologies can provide real-time or near-real-time observations to support disaster management [32].
2,"the ogc sensor web enablement (swe) framework is employed in hydrological hazard monitoring and is used to make multi-source heterogeneous sensor web resources (e.g., sensors, sensor services, observations, and events) available on the web [33]."
2,"to meet the requirements for the monitoring of various hydrological scenarios, these sensor web resources are executed in on-demand combinations to enable users to access hydrological information in a timely fashion."
2,the contribution of this paper is to integrate the swe and wps components to allow hydrological observations to be linked to appropriate geoprocessing services on demand to perform active processing.

3,an application example is provided to demonstrate the benefits of this approach.

3,an evaluation and discussion are presented in section 5.
3,conclusions and guidelines for future work are given in section 6.
3,materials and methods 2.1.
3,"user requirements traditionally, hydrological users download data into desktop computers and use desktop image processing software to process these data."
3,"the process of generating decision support information, such as turbidity maps, is often laborious, inefficient, and time-consuming."
3,"in addition, the process is difficult for hydrological users who have limited gis skills and software experience."
3,it would therefore be beneficial to adapt the traditional desktop mapping method into on-demand mapping service to reduce the resource costs and skill requirements on the end-user side.
3,"information infrastructure technologies (e.g., sensor webs, geospatial web services, and web-based workflows) offer new tools for hydrological mapping."
3,hydrological maps can be delivered on demand by chaining distributed geospatial services.
3,these services are chained into workflows and executed using a workflow engine to enable complex hydrological hazard analyses and timely response to hydrological events.
3,"to meet the needs of users with different levels of background knowledge and computer skills, different types of service chaining should be developed."
3,"the ogc abstract service architecture identifies three types of service chaining: transparent chaining, translucent chaining, and opaque chaining [34]."
3,"transparent chaining, also called user-defined chaining, is often adopted by professionals who are skilled in geospatial analysis and the use of geospatial services."
3,they are able to manage the execution of the chains by themselves.
3,"in translucent chaining, also called workflow-managed chaining, workflow engines control the service chains."
3,"the invocation of services is hidden, and users focus on the formulation of business-level workflows."
3,"in opaque chaining, users are completely separated from the backend workflows and services."
3,"in the context of hydrological disaster analysis, domain experts can design workflows using workflow tools operating in drag-and-drop mode."
3,these workflow tools bind and invoke services to enact workflows.
3,"once a workflow has been archived and can be accessed as a whole as a new service, general users or decision-makers can use that workflow in the opaque chaining approach by invoking the new service."
3,earth observation technologies coordinated with sensor webs can support real-time or near-real-time data provision.
3,distributed geospatial data obtained from earth observations can be accessed through standard geospatial data services.
3,"to perform complex and real-time hydrological monitoring tasks, it is necessary not only to share data and geoprocessing functions over the web but also to coordinate sensor observations and geoprocessing functions in an event-based manner."
3,the automatic geoprocessing of hydrological hazard events is urgently needed by experts to help them react as soon as possible.
3,an event-driven mechanism can help to achieve this goal.

8,"geo-inf. 2016, 5, 171 8 of 22 the hydrological analysis process for remote sensing imagery consists of two steps: the first is pre-processing the raw images."
8,the second step is conducting the specific hydrological analysis model on the pre-processed images.
8,both steps depend on the existing mathematical models or algorithms.
8,these algorithms can be connected and integrated to achieve an advanced hydrological hazard analysis.
8,the algorithms were initially written in c++ and were wrapped using java.
8,take the task of extracting the turbidity in poyang lake as a demonstration to introduce the mathematical algorithms applied when calculating the total suspended sediment concentration (tssc) from gf-1 imagery.
8,"the image pre-processing step often includes processes like orthorectification, radiometric calibration, and atmospheric correction."
8,a common method for orthorectification is the rational polynomial coefficient (rpc) camera model which takes digital elevation model (dem) data as input.
8,"the rpc model resamples (longitude, latitude, and height) object coordinates into the (line, sample) coordinates."
8,"the equation of the model is [43]: ( l, s) = rpc (υ, φ, h ) (1) where l is the line of the input image, s is the sample index, υ is the longitude, φ is the latitude, and h is the orthometric height."
8,"a radiometric calibration method can be applied to process imagery with the aid of the calibration coefficients of the wfv2 sensor on the gf-1 satellite [44,45]."
8,"the following equation (2) is used to convert remotely sensed dn values into at-satellite radiances: lsatλ = gain × dn + bias (2) where lsatλ is the at-satellite spectral radiance in the given spectral band (w·m2 ·sr−1 ·µm−1 ), gain represents the gain for the given spectral band (w·m2 ·sr−1 ·µm−1 ), bias is the offset for the given spectral band (w·m2 ·sr−1 ·µm−1 ), and dn is the calibrated pixel grey value."
8,"the cost model is employed to do atmospheric correction [46,47]."
8,"it not only corrects the effects caused by the sun’s zenith angle, solar radiance and atmospheric scattering but also accounts for atmospheric absorption."
8,"its equation is: rλ = π × d2 × ( lsatλ − lhazeλ ) /esunλ cos2 θ (3) where λ is the wavelength, rλ is the spectral reflectance of the surface, d is the distance between the earth and the sun, lsatλ is the at-satellite spectral radiance in the given spectral band, lhazeλ is the atmospheric path radiance, esunλ is the exo-atmospheric solar irradiance, and θ is the sun’s zenith angle."

8,"ndw i = ( green − n ir) / ( green + n ir) (4) in the formula, green denotes the green band and nir means the near-infrared radiation band."
8,"finally, the value of tssc can be calculated from the results of atmospheric correction for bands 2 and 3 [49]."
8,"the formula is tssc = 0.4023e(46.457x ) x = ( rλ (λb2centre ) + rλ (λb3centre )) rλ (λb3centre ) /rλ (λb2centre ) (5) where λ is the wavelength, rλ is the spectral reflectance of the surface, λb2centre is the central wavelength for band 2 of the gf-1 satellite, λb3centre is the central wavelength for band 3, and x is a factor calculated"

13,one was to compare the processing performance between the traditional manual hydrological processing method and the event-driven service approach.

13,the input observation was obtained from the sensors on the chinese gf-1 satellite.
13,"for the chosen example observation recorded on 21 september 2014, the image volume is 0.98 gb."
13,"the turbidity extraction workflow includes the following processes: orthorectification, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, clipping, ndwi calculation, mask building, and silt inversion."
13,figure 9 illustrates the performance results in the first experiment.
13,"both test 1 and 2 are performed on regular personal computers (pcs), each equipped with a 3.60 ghz intel(r) core(tm) i7 processor and 8.0 gb of memory, running the microsoft windows 10 operating system."
13,"traditionally, hydrological users often use a local approach, in which they manually process data using desktop gis software or tools."
13,"in the manual approach (test 1), ten graduate students with sufficient background knowledge and computer skills were invited to participate in the experiment."
13,they were trained to perform the necessary manual operations using desktop grass software.
13,"the time cost (e.g., 40.27 min) by each student in test 1 was recorded, starting from when the input data is opened in the grass software and ending at the completion of all the operations."
13,"in the workflow approach (test 2), the executable workflow for turbidity extraction was performed ten times using services deployed on distributed pcs on a local network."
13,"the execution time (e.g., 20.73 min) for each execution of the workflow in test 2 was recorded, starting from the invocation of the workflow and ending with the return of the response."
13,"to avoid contingency effects, each execution time for the proposed approach was calculated as the average of the time costs of ten executions of the workflow."
13,figure 9 illustrates the obtained performance results.
13,"compared with the proposed approach, the time curve for the manual approach shows significant fluctuations because of the variations in operation proficiency from person to person."
13,"the performance of the proposed approach is relatively stable because it is conducted automatically by computers, with little human intervention."
13,"based on the results of the experiments, it can clearly be concluded that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance compared with the traditional method in terms of saving time and effort and shortening the wait times for endpoint consumers of hydrological disaster information."

15,"the complexity of the technical details is hidden behind the workflow models, thereby significantly lowering the barrier to entry for users."
15,the standardized service interfaces allow workflow models to be used to assemble hydrological services into workflows for complex tasks in a plug-and-play fashion.
15,"by contrast, traditional manual processing can only be performed by professionals with rich background knowledge and computer programming skills."
15,"(2) from the perspective of hydrological services, the service-oriented hydrological analysis approach does not rely on any specific software or programs installed on users’ personal machines."
15,the analysis can be conducted remotely via web services.
15,the use of standard interfaces allows various hydrological service providers to contribute reusable service modules that can be dynamically integrated into large web-executable workflow models for use by others in the community as part of the implementation of the system as a whole.
15,"(3) from the viewpoint of hydrological workflows, the proposed service approach achieves automated hydrological processing through an event-driven workflow execution process."
15,"by contrast, traditional manual methods require a high level of professional skill from endpoint users and are highly time-consuming and prone to error."
15,"the workflows automate the execution of business logic and can produce on-demand hydrological data products more quickly, with little or no manual intervention and fewer opportunities for error, which is especially beneficial for monitoring on-going hydrological disasters."
15,"(4) from the viewpoint of knowledge management, existing workflow models allow analysts to interactively construct new, more complex workflow models."
15,the knowledge of hydrological modellers is formulated and stored during the construction of workflow models.
15,"through the sharing, reuse and addition of workflow models and service chains, this community-involved and open approach allows the system to grow and become more intelligent, gaining more powerful capabilities, as knowledge is continuously shared and accumulated."
15,"as knowledge about various aspects of a hydrological disaster becomes more certain, the results of the even-driven processing workflow will also become more accurate and reliable."
15,conclusions and future work this paper introduces an approach for developing a web service system to support active hydrological disaster monitoring in a distributed web environment.
15,it presents a comprehensive design and implementation of automated real-time geoprocessing services for the processing of hydrological hazard information.
15,"by means of the integration of sensor web services, geoprocessing web services and workflow technologies, the approach not only provides an interoperable and agile solution for performing hydrologic analyses in a community-involved, distributed web environment but also allows reusable hydrological service modules to be accessed and linked together in an event-driven manner."
