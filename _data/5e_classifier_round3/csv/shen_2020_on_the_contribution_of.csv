1,"although at a generally low temporal resolution, satellite altimetry has been successfully used for water surface elevation (wse) estimation and hydrodynamic modeling."
1,"this study aims to investigate the contribution of wse from both short-repeat and geodetic altimetry to hydrodynamic model calibration, and also explore the contribution of the new sentinel-3 mission."
1,"two types of data sources (i.e., in-situ and satellite altimetry) are investigated together with two roughness cases (i.e., spatially variable and uniform roughness) for calibration of a hydrodynamic model (dhi mike 11) with available bathymetry."
1,a 150 km long reach of han river in china with rich altimetry and in-situ gauging data is selected as a case study.
1,results show that the performances of the model calibrated by satellite altimetry-derived datasets are acceptable in terms of root mean square error (rmse) of simulated wse.
1,sentinel-3a can support hydrodynamic model calibration even though it has a relatively low temporal resolution (27-day repeat cycle).
1,"the cryosat-2 data with a higher spatial resolution (7.5 km at the equator) are proved to be more valuable than the sentinel-3a altimetry data with a low spatial resolution (104 km at the equator) for hydrodynamic model calibration in terms of rmse values of 0.16 and 0.18 m, respectively."
1,"moreover, the spatially variable roughness can also improve the model performance compared to the uniform roughness case, with decreasing rmse values by 2–14%."
1,our finding shows the value of satellite altimetry-derived datasets for hydrodynamic model calibration and therefore supports flood risk assessment and water resources management.

1,"introduction climate change and human activities have altered the river flow regimes and led to more frequent and severe extreme natural disasters, such as floods and droughts [1,2]."
1,"monitoring hydraulic variables and relevant hydrological-hydraulic processes of rivers usually play an essential role in flood risk assessment and water resources management [3,4]."
1,"one of the key hydraulic variables is the water remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087; doi:10.3390/rs12244087 www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing"
2,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087 2 of 18 surface elevation (wse), which refers to the height of surface water above a given datum (i.e., 1985 national height datum of china for in-situ records, and egm2008 datum for satellite wse) [5]."
2,"reliable and timely estimation of wse is important for flood and water resources management tasks [6,7]."
2,"traditionally, wse measurements relied on in-situ gauging stations and often suffered from insufficient spatial coverage and data access constraints [8,9]."
2,"hydraulic infrastructure and engineering projects are often designed in data sparsely or ungauged river reaches, which hampers the stakeholders to make decisions about river system management [10]."
2,"hence, it is difficult for engineers to find an efficient way for wse estimation along the entire river reach."
2,"currently, a practical way to achieve this goal is the comprehensive estimation of wse and other hydraulic variables on a whole river reach by using hydrodynamic models [4,11]."
2,"a hydrodynamic model is an efficient tool for flood forecasting and water resources management, as it can simulate the spatio-temporal dynamics of hydraulic variables given the boundary and initial conditions [12,13]."
2,observed data including wse is often employed to calibrate the parameters of the hydrodynamic model and thus influences the model performance of simulated hydraulic variables [14].
2,"however, observations from in-situ gauging stations are often sparse, and model parameters (e.g., spatially variable roughness parameters) probably cannot be estimated well from in-situ data through a calibration procedure [15]."
2,"the hydrodynamic model application is constrained in flood and water resources management, especially in ungauged or poorly gauged basins [16–18]."
2,"with the rapid advances in remote sensing sciences and technologies, space-borne sensors have provided valuable estimates of hydrological-hydraulic variables such as river extents and wse [19–22]."
2,"wse can be freely obtained from satellite altimetry missions (e.g., envisat and jason-2/-3), while river extents can be derived from optical or sar (synthetic aperture radar) imagery satellite missions (e.g., landsat and sentinel-1/-2) [23,24]."
2,these data from a satellite mission called satellite observations have been taken as a key supplement to in-situ data for hydrodynamic modeling.
2,there have been many studies focusing on integrating satellite observations in facilitating hydrodynamic modeling.
2,"for example, satellite imagery observations have been adopted to calibrate two-dimensional (2-d) hydrodynamic models [25,26], to validate the efficiency of hydrodynamic models [27,28], and even integrated into model structures for data assimilation [29]."
2,"although promising results have been shown by integrating satellite imagery observations in hydrodynamic modeling, there are also a lot of challenges."
2,"for example, optical imagery data are easily affected by cloud conditions while sar imagery data always suffer the low spatial resolution [30], inundation extents are hard to be interpreted due to the noise of the backscatter and are also unavailable during the flood period."
2,wse characterizes the surface water variations [31].
2,"satellite altimetry-derived wse has been widely used to calibrate hydrodynamic models as an alternative to in-situ records, especially in ungauged areas [32,33]."
2,"for example, short-repeat missions such as envisat and ers-2 have been adopted in calibrating a quasi-two-dimensional hydrodynamic model in italy [30]."
2,"recently, cryosat-2 was used to calibrate a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model in the brahmaputra river [34]."
2,"hydrodynamic models can benefit from satellite altimetry data in model calibration, improving the skills of simulating hydraulic variables such as wse and discharge."
2,"however, the contributions of various altimetry-derived wse datasets to hydrodynamic model calibration are different."
2,the data-quality and sampling density are two potential pivotal factors influencing the contribution of satellite wse on hydrodynamic model calibration.
2,"previous works have revealed the importance of altimetry spatial sampling density to hydrodynamic model calibration through providing a high number of virtual river stage gauging stations from satellite altimetry [35,36], exploring the value of cryosat-2 altimetry with dense sampling patterns [34], or applying various altimetry-derived datasets to hydrodynamic model calibration [37]."
2,"however, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the contributions of wse from both short-repeat and geodetic altimetry missions on hydrodynamic model calibration, and also little is known about the contribution of the new sentinel-3 mission [38]."
2,"short-repeat missions such as sentinel-3 have a repeat cycle of 10 to 35 days with a relatively sparse ground track pattern, while geodetic missions such as cryosat-2 have dense point observations"
3,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087 3 of 18 of the river longitudinal profile due to their drifting ground track pattern [39,40]."
3,"as a new generation satellite altimetry mission with a 27-day repeat cycle, sentinel-3 is likely to deliver high-quality wse observation for its new open-loop tracking and sar modes [38]."
3,the cryosat-2 was launched in july 2010 to an orbit with a 369-day full repeat cycle and dense ground tracks [41].
3,sentinel-3 is operating in a constellation of two-satellites (sentinel-3a and sentinel-3b).
3,"the sentinel-3a (s3a) and sentinel-3b (s3b) were launched in february 2016 and april 2018, respectively."
3,detailed information on sentinel-3 and cryosat-2 is available at https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/.
3,this study aims to investigate the contribution of altimetry-derived wse from short-repeat and geodetic missions (sentinel-3a and cryosat-2) to hydrodynamic model calibration.
3,the 150 km long reach of the han river with rich data in china was selected as a case study area.
3,"model calibration and validation are carried out under fourteen scenarios by combining different data sources (i.e., in-situ and satellite altimetry) and two roughness cases (i.e., spatially variable and uniform roughness)."
3,"therefore, the results of our study will help to implement satellite altimetry-derived wse into hydrodynamic model calibration and therefore support flood forecasting and water resources management."
3,materials and methods 2.1.
3,study area the han river offers a large amount of biological and hydropower resources and serves as one of the major water sources for the south-to-north water diversion in china [42].
3,"concerning the availability of in-situ hydrometric and satellite altimetry data, a 150 km long reach of han river in china (figure 1) is selected to explore the contributions of satellite altimetry-derived datasets on hydrodynamic model calibration."
3,the case area belongs to the middle stream of the han river between huangjiagang and yicheng hydrometric stations.

5,wse data processing the altimetry-derived wse are extracted by a water mask from global surface water explorer (https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/).
5,"specifically, the maximum extent is used to pre-select as many observations as possible [45]."
6,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087 6 of 18 the identical satellite ground tracks with a repeat cycle of 27 days allow to derive the wse time series at two virtual stations (vss) from sentinel-3a over the study reach (figure 1)."
6,"firstly, the outliers are discarded by comparing the altimetry-derived wse with aster gdem v.3 (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model) [46] with an absolute bias threshold of 20 m."
6,the dem datasets have been reprojected to the egm2008 geoid at the platform of vdatum software [47].
6,"secondly, a filtering process is performed for each track to discard outliers based on the work by jiang et al. [40] and finally, the median value of all wse observations for a given track is used to derive wse time series."
6,the data processing for cryosat-2 altimetry is slightly different from that of sentinel-3a due to its drifting ground track pattern.
6,a series of virtual stations were selected and all observations were relocated to the nearest virtual stations based on their local slopes [43].
6,"the virtual stations are determined based on the coverages of cryosat-2 observations along the river reach and placed on the model river line (i.e., the centerline of the river from the extracted water mask)."
6,the procedure of relocating cryosat-2 observations onto virtual stations has been proved to be an efficient way of constructing wse time series at vss and strengthening the hydrologic and hydrodynamic applications of cryosat-2 [43].
6,"balancing the maximization of the vs numbers and the minimization of error from projecting observations to virtual stations, 16 vss have been figured out in the study reach (table 2)."
6,"an outlier filtering algorithm is performed to obtain the median values of each track: a measurement is discarded if |h-u|>3δ (h is the point observation, u is the mean value and δ is the standard deviation) [40]."
6,all the median observations are relocated to the nearest virtual stations through local slope correction.
6,it should be noted that there are often systematic biases between satellite altimetry-derived observations and in-situ data due to the unknown local vertical datums and other factors.
6,"if their mean values of every series are removed, both in-situ data and satellite altimetry-derived datasets are transformed to wse anomalies."

6,hydrodynamic model in the study area a one-dimension (1d) hydrodynamic model is used to simulate flow regimes and water levels of the study reach.
6,the model was running at the dhi mike 11 software [48].
6,the software solves the
7,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087 7 of 18 saint–venant equations with an implicit 6-point finite-difference scheme."
7,"the model is directly forced by the observed daily discharge data from the main upstream and three tributaries, while the daily water level of yicheng hydrometric station is served as the downstream boundary condition (shown in figure 1)."
7,"the study reach is sketched by 94 cross-section profiles, and the profiles are derived from the detailed bathymetric map with an interval of around 50 m and thus can capture the variations of riverbed geometry."
7,the operational rules of wangbuzhou and cuijiaying reservoirs are also simulated in the model as it is described in section 2.2.
7,"hydrodynamic model calibration the hydrodynamic model calibration focuses on the estimation of the channel roughness, i.e., the strickler coefficient ks (the reciprocal of the manning coefficient, see in manning’s equation (3))."
7,"2 1 q = ar 3 s 2 ks (3) with given bathymetry data, the cross-section area (a), the hydraulic radius (r), the slope of the hydraulic gradient line (s) at the discharge (q) can be described as a function of water depth relating to wse."
7,only ks is a parameter that varies along the river and is often calibrated through maximizing the degree of goodness of fit between observed and simulated wse.
7,"to figure out the effect of heterogeneity of roughness distribution on model performance, two roughness cases are assumed in the calibration process."
7,one is that only a single ks coefficient is assigned to the whole reach (uniform ks).
7,the other one is that the river reach is partitioned into sub-reaches according to the hydro-morphological characteristics of the river and the distribution of hydrometric stations (variable ks).
7,the variable ks with sub-reaches has also been proved to be a feasible approach to improve the hydrodynamic model performance [34].
7,"specifically, four sub-reaches are used in our case study for the variable ks."
7,the first 29 km long reach is very gentle (0.035 m/km) and the following 44 km long reach is narrow and steep with a complex river morphology.
7,"in the following 38 km long reach, the river channel is steeper with a gradient of 0.125 m/km."
7,the last reach is a little wider and deeper.
7,"to investigate the efficiency and reliability of the various satellite altimetry-derived datasets, three configurations are constructed for the hydrodynamic model calibration."
7,"the first one is from the in-situ data (called configuration a), the second one is from the altimetry-derived data from sentinel-3a and cryosat-2 (called configuration b) and the last one is from the combination of in-situ and satellite altimetry-derived data (called configuration c)."
7,"combining the three configurations and two roughness cases, there are fourteen scenarios for calibrating the hydrodynamic model as shown in table 3."

8,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087 8 of 18 the 1d hydrodynamic model is calibrated by the fourteen scenarios from 01/01/2016 to 12/31/2017 through minimizing the root mean square error (rmse) between simulated and observed wse."
8,the model is also validated by the data from 01/01/2018 to 12/31/2018.
8,"the manual trial-and-error method is adopted for testing the variable ks case and the scenario-based method is used (running models with a range of values of ks at an interval of 0.5/0.1 m1/3 s−1 ) for the uniform ks case [33,49]. v n t 1x rmse = (p̂i − oi )2 (4) n i=1 where oi and p̂i are the observed and simulated wse at the ith point, respectively. n is the total number of wse observations."
8,results 3.1.
8,"calibrated strickler coefficient ks the calibrated uniform ks plays a vital role in hydrodynamic simulation, and the optimal ks value can be easily determined from the clear patterns shown in figure 3a (e.g., 34.6 m1/3 /s as the optimal value for the scheme au1)."
8,the model performance is sensitive to uniform ks value (rmse ranging from 0.105–0.450 m) and the optimal rmse values are assigned near the high bound of the parameter range.
8,the calibrated ks values of four sub-reaches reflect the characteristics of each sub-reach (figure 3b).
8,the ks values of the second and the final sub-reaches range from 27–33 m1/3 /s.
8,the ks is relatively high at the first upstream 29-km reach (approximately 37 m1/3 /s) due to the flat and straight river channel.
8,"on the contrary, the ks value has decreased significantly in the third reach due to the increasing water depth and highly vegetated channel."
8,"roughness is closely related to flow resistance, which is positively influenced by river depth and vegetable conditions."
8,"more specifically, flow resistance increases with a highly vegetated channel and river depth, and leads to higher roughness (smaller ks) [49,50]."
8,it is interesting to find that the rmse values jump near the strickler coefficient close to 30 in figure 3a.
8,"as there are discharge bursts in 2017 that can challenge the calibration of parameters (figure 2a), the rmse value is sensitive to the bias of peak simulation."

13,effects of satellite altimetry-derived wse on hydrodynamic model calibration 4.1.
13,effects of satellite altimetry-derived wse on hydrodynamic model calibration two pivotal factors are influencing the performance of the hydrodynamic model calibrated by satellite two altimetry-derived pivotal factors are wse.
13,"one is the influencing theaccuracy performance of satellite data itself and the of the hydrodynamic modelother one is the calibrated by spatio-temporal resolution ofwse. satellite altimetry-derived satellite onealtimetry missions.ofthe is the accuracy two vss satellite data sentinel-3a of itself and the (i.e., vs1one other andisvs2) the are close to the huangjiagang spatio-temporal resolution of and xiangyang satellite hydrometric altimetry missions. stations the two (eight vss km offrom vs1 to huangjiagang, sentinel-3a (i.e., vs1 and vs2)km four close arefrom vs2totothe huangjiagang xiangyang). and xiangyang the slopes between thehydrometric two vss and theirstations (eight km hydrometric corresponding from vs1 to huangjiagang, stations four are too flat to km impactfromthevs2wse.tothe wse at thethe xiangyang). two slopes vss canbetween replace the thedata twoobserved vss andattheir the correspondingand huangjiagang xiangyangstations hydrometric stations.arethe too flat to rmse impact values arethe 0.28wse. m and the0.16wsem for thevs1 at the twoand vssvs2, can replace the data respectively."

13,the spatio-temporal resolution of satellite altimetry missions directly influences the performance of hydrodynamic model calibration.
13,our findings further revealed that cryosat-2 geodetic altimetry with high spatial resolution shows better performance in hydrodynamic model calibration than sentinel-3a altimetry with a low spatial resolution (table 4 and figures 3–5).
13,it should be noted that cryosat-2 geodetic altimetry has a full cycle of 369 days while sentinel-3a has a 27-day cycle at the specified virtual stations.
13,the values of the new sentinel-3a altimetry to hydrodynamic model calibration are highlighted due to its high data-quality with a new on-board tracking mode and easier work in
14,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087 14 of 18 deriving wse time series at virtual stations."
14,"but it is challenging to process the spatially-distributed cryosat-2 observations and use them for hydrodynamic model calibration [34,39]."
14,"in our case study, the cryosat-2 data are relocated onto a series of virtual stations and then transformed into anomalies for hydrodynamic model calibration [43]."
14,"the systematic bias still remains when processing such few cryosat-2 observations into anomalies, and can be propagated into wse simulation of the model and reduces its accuracy."
14,this could be attributed to the fact that the results are not the best among the schemes of configuration b when pooling the sentinel-3a and cryosat-2 datasets for model calibration (shown in table 4 and figures 3–5).
14,"further works can focus on producing blending products with more densified data from different satellite altimetry missions through the statistical and hydraulic blending approaches and use them for hydrodynamic modeling [52,53]."
14,"comparison of model performance from uniform and variable roughness parameters the effects of the two parameterizations on hydrodynamic model calibration have been reported in the literature [30,34], and are further explored on the use of various altimetry-derived datasets in our case study."
14,the uniform ks is widely used in hydrodynamic model calibration for its simplicity and promising efficiency at the evaluated stations.
14,"however, this common approach fails to characterize the variations of the riverbed and is probably unable to reproduce accurate wse at other locations of the river under high heterogeneity [4,54]."
14,the hydrodynamic model with uniform ks calibrated by sentinel-3a derived-wse shows poor skills with high rmse values at in-situ stations (figure 5).
14,"moreover, the uniform ks can also be attributed to the equifinality issue, i.e., a model with different roughness sets performs equally well at the evaluated gauging stations (shown in figure 3a)."
14,"to find a more efficient approach for more accurate wse estimation along the river under the heterogeneity of the channel, the variable ks is recommended for hydrodynamic model calibration as it takes the spatial variability of flow resistance into account [34]."
14,the model with the variable ks can simulate wse more accurately with lower rmse values compared to that with the uniform ks.
14,two pivotal factors are influencing the hydrodynamic model calibration with the variable ks.
14,one is the availability of data for model calibration and the other is the density of resolved variable roughness parameters.
14,"with satellite altimetry-derived data available, the variable ks could be an efficient approach to facilitate hydrodynamic modeling."
14,the model performance is also closely dependent on the satellite altimetry datasets with different spatio-temporal resolution.
14,the cryosat-2 geodetic mission with dense observations is more helpful than those with a low spatial resolution (sentinel-3a) in hydrodynamic model calibration (table 4 and figures 3–5).
14,"the contributions of the densified roughness parameters on model calibration have been highlighted in the literature [4,34], while the improvements of the densified roughness parameters come at the expense of uncertainties and computation time."
14,the more parameters commonly required more data for calibration [4].
14,schneider et al. [34] used the 10-km variable roughness parameters to facilitate hydrodynamic modeling and found that the performances of the model were not refined well with large uncertainties.
14,"this issue is further revealed in our case study that the accuracies of wse from the variable ks are slightly better than those from the uniform ks during the calibration periods with reducing rmse values by 2–14%, while the results are not as good as those from the uniform ks during the validation periods."
14,"however, the advantages of the variable ks are not only to improve the accuracy of simulated wse at the evaluated gauging stations but also to improve the hydrodynamic simulation on the entire river reach via a physically-based strategy."
14,"with more satellite altimetry-derived wse available, the variable ks could be estimated well and therefore increases the performance of the hydrodynamic model [55]."
14,"as the calibrated ks values are reasonable compared to previous works [34,56], the variable ks is recommended for hydrodynamic model calibration."
14,"conclusions the contributions of current satellite altimetry missions (i.e., short-repeat and geodetic altimetry) on hydrodynamic model calibration are reviewed."
14,the contribution of the new sentinel-3a altimetry
15,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 4087 15 of 18 is also assessed."
15,"hydrodynamic model (dhi mike 11) calibrations with available bathymetry data are carried out by combining seven calibration datasets (i.e., in-situ, satellite altimetry, and both of them) and two roughness cases (i.e., spatially variable roughness and uniform roughness)."
15,"in the case study river reach with a river width of around 400 m, both sentinel-3a and cryosat-2 can deliver useful observations with the averaged rmse values of 0.22 and 0.49 m, respectively."
15,our findings suggest that a good or moderate accuracy of altimetry observations (rmse below 0.6 m) can contribute to the hydrodynamic model calibration.
15,"specifically, calibration against altimetry-derived wse achieves promising results in terms of rmse as 0.100–0.216 m during the calibration periods, which are in line with previous studies [30,34]."
15,"moreover, model performance varies with different altimetry-derived datasets due to their different characteristics such as spatio-temporal sampling patterns."
15,"although the satellite altimetry has a low temporal resolution, both sentinel-3a and cryosat-2 can provide a comparable result as those from the daily in-situ observations."
15,"cryosat-2 with a higher spatial resolution (7.5 km at the equator) brings better performances than short-repeat sentinel-3a altimetry with a low resolution (104 km at the equator) in the hydrodynamic model calibration according to their rmse values of 0.16 and 0.18 m, respectively."
15,"moreover, the variable ks improves the performance of hydrodynamic simulation compared to the uniform ks reducing the rmse values by 2–14%, and is recommended in hydrodynamic model calibration for its physically-based strategy."
15,our study not only enriches the existing knowledge on integrating satellite altimetry-derived datasets into hydrodynamic model calibration but also supports the future hydrology-related satellite altimetry design.
