1,therefore the modis products for albedo and lai were processed to annual time series including the identiﬁcation and replacement of low quality observations by interpolation.
1,the impact using modis data on the spatial distribution of water balance variables occurs mainly on local scale.
1,the hydrological simulations using modis lai and albedo values result in higher annual evapotranspira- tion and lower total discharge sums for 2004.
