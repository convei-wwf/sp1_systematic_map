1,"recently, keywords: the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy flood forecasting has been demonstrated."
1,"however, the considerable beneﬁt derived from this technique is attenuated by the low modis revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting altimetry operations."
1,"for this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the moderate resolution imaging remote sensing spectroradiometer (modis), working in visible/infra-red bands, can support ﬂood forecasting."
1,"discharge in this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using modis and we compared it with the radar niger-benue river altimetry and in-situ data along the niger-benue river in nigeria to develop an operational ﬂood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes."
1,"in the ﬁrst step, four modis products (daily and, 8-day from the terra and aqua satellites) at two gauged sites were used for dis- charge estimation."

1,the results conﬁrmed the capability of the modis data to estimate river discharge with performance indices n 0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefﬁcient of correlation and nash sutcliffe efﬁciency.

1,"for the forecasting exercise, both altim- etry and modis provide satisfactory results with positive coefﬁcient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (n0.34)."
1,"although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (rmse ~350 m3/s), the much higher temporal resolution of modis guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to ad- dress operational activities."
