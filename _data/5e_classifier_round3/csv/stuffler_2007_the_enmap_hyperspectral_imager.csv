1,"enmap fulﬁlls the increasing demand on accurate, quantitative information about the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems."
1,"the payload consists of an imaging hyperspectral instrument covering the visible, near- and short-wave infrared wavelengths."
1,"enmap will provide high quality, standardized, and consistent data on a timely and frequent basis."
1,the mission’s primary focus will be on the considerable improvement of already standardized products and the development of new quantitative and subsequently highly informative data and its derivatives.
1,"the advanced hyperspectral instrument on enmap can resolve and detect biophysical, biochemical, and geochemical variables in distinct detail."
1,"these data can only be derived from an enmap type instrument and will tremendously increase our understanding of coupled biospheric and geospheric processes and thus, enable the management and ensure the sustainability of our vital resources."
1,"the instrument data set allows for a detailed monitoring, characterization and parameter extraction of vegetation targets, rock/soils, and inland and coastal waters on a global scale."

2,"introduction continuous changes in the earth’s environment and the growing anthropogenic impact that arise from fac- tors such as population increase and climatic change, are the core of the justiﬁcation for enmap."
2,the system’s detection capabilities are directly relevant to natural and anthropogenic issues.
2,"the objectives of enmap are to derive relevant surface parameters on a global scale with an accuracy not achievable by currently available spaceborne sensors, to assimilate those parameters in physically based ecosystem models, and ultimately to provide information products reﬂecting the status of var- ious terrestrial ecosystems."
2,"to meet these objectives, a close collaboration between scientists, value adding in- dustry, and users will be pursued in all the development phases of enmap."
2,it is planned that the further develop- ment of hyperspectral and imaging spectrometry tech- nologies and derived products will already start within fig.
