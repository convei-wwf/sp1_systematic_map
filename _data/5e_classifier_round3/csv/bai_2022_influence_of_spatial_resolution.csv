1,"here, based on multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (ma- iac) aod in 2020 over the yangtze river delta (yrd) and three pm2.5 retrieval models, i.e., the mixed effects model (me), the land-use regression model (lur) and the random forest model (rf), we compare these model performances at different spatial resolutions (1, 3, 5 and 10 km)."
1,the pm2.5 estimations are further used to investigate the impact of spatial resolution on health assessment.
1,our cross-validated results show that the model performance is not sensitive to spatial resolution change for the me and lur models.

2,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 2933 2 of 18 also used satellite aod data to retrieve pm2.5 concentrations at a regional scale, such as the yangtze river delta (yrd) [15–20]."
2,the performance of the aod-based pm2.5 retrieval models may be affected by the aod spatial resolution.
2,"however, the conclusions of this issue are not consistent in previous studies [17,21–23]; their work mainly focuses on the traditional statistical regression models, and such analysis is lacking for machine learning models."
2,lee et al. [23] used the linear mixed-effect model to estimate pm2.5 in the southeastern united states.
2,they found that the model using 1 km aod data showed a better performance than that using 10 km aod data.
2,li et al. [21] conducted similar work in northern china but found that the 1 km model performance was slightly lower than the 10 km model.
2,the yrd region also experienced such a difference in performance between 3 and 10 km aod data [17].
2,the inconsistent conclusions may be because the linear model can not effectively capture the nonlinear relationship between aod and pm2.5 involving different spatial scales [24].
2,"previous studies have extensively used satellite-derived pm2.5 data to assess pm2.5-related health effects [9,25–31]."
2,these health assessments were performed at a wide range of spatial resolutions from 1 to 50 km and may suffer from a potential uncertainty due to the impact of satellite data resolution on pm2.5 estimations.
2,"numerous studies have investigated the impact of spatial resolution on pm2.5 attributable mortality, and they found that the coarser resolution typically leads to lower estimated mortality [32–35]."
2,"these studies, however, were based on the air quality model simulations."
2,few studies have evaluated the sensitivity of human health to spatial resolution using satellite-derived pm2.5 data.
2,"furthermore, the findings of previous model studies above were mainly for the united states and european regions."
2,"whether these findings hold for heavily polluted areas, such as the yrd region, remains unclear."
2,"as outlined above, satellite aod spatial resolution may affect the performance of the pm2.5 retrieval model."
2,"previous studies, however, have drawn inconsistent conclusions on this topic [17,21–23], and fewer have investigated the spatial resolution effect using machine learning models."
2,"regarding the sensitivity of the pm2.5 -related health impacts to spatial resolution, existing studies were mostly based on the air quality model simulations and mainly focused on western countries or regions [32–35]."
2,"the application of their findings is questionable for satellite-derived pm2.5 data, especially in heavily polluted areas."
2,the above limitations motivate us to conduct this work with the following contribu- tions.
2,"first, we explore aod spatial resolution effect on pm2.5 retrieval model performance, including machine learning and statistical regression methods."
2,"second, this work uses satellite-derived pm2.5 to investigate the sensitivity of the associated health impacts to spatial resolution in the yrd region, one of the most polluted areas in china."
2,"here, by using satellite aod at spatial resolutions of 1, 3, 5 and 10 km, this study analyzes the impact of spatial resolution on the aod–pm2.5 correlation."
2,"additionally, satellite aod is used to estimate pm2.5 based on three different retrieval models (i.e., the mixed effects model (me), the land-use regression model (lur) and the random forest model (rf)), and we compare these model performances at different aod spatial resolutions."

4,methods gridded data at four spatial resolutions were collocated with daily surface pm2.5 measurements.
4,"these collocated pairs were used to build three satellite-based pm2.5 retrieval models including the mixed effects model (me), the land-use regression model (lur) and the random forest model (rf)."
4,"based on pm2.5 retrievals using the above models, we further estimated the deaths attributable to pm2.5 pollution in yrd in 2020."
4,the detailed introduction of each model is as follows.
4,2.3.1.
4,"the mixed effects model the me model is a linear approach, which takes into consideration both fixed and random effects."
4,"the model is represented by equation [42]: pmij = α + µ j + β + νj × aodij + ε ij µ j νj ∼ n (0, 0), ∑      (1) where pmij is the daily average pm2.5 concentration at monitoring site i on day j; aodij is the aod value for the pixel corresponding to site i on day j; α and µ j are the fixed and day-specific random effects for intercept, respectively; β and νj are the fixed and day-specific random effect for slope, respectively; ε ij is the error term; σ is an unstructured variancecovariance matrix for day-specific random effects."
4,"in the me model, the fixed effect"
5,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 2933 5 of 18 explains the average effect of aod on pm2.5 for the entire study period."
5,the random effect represents the daily variability in the pm2.5 –aod relationship [42].
5,2.3.2.
5,the land-use regression model a stepwise linear regression method is adopted for building the lur model [43].
5,"input predictors for the lur model include land cover, ndvi, population, dem, aod, meteorological parameters, geographical locations and dummy variables (month and day)."
5,"note that predictors for the final lur model with four spatial resolutions are different, especially for land cover variables."
5,"for instance, land cover predictors for the 1 km lur model only include cultivated land, wetland and water body, whereas the land cover predictors additionally contain forest, grass land and artificial land for the 3 km lur model."
5,one possible explanation for this is that distributions of some land cover variables of the lur model samples differ obviously among different resolutions.
5,"for instance, since most air quality monitoring stations in the yrd region are located in urban areas [44], artificial land cover ratios of 1 km lur model samples are primarily equal to 1."
5,"thus, the 1 km lur model could hardly capture the relationship between pm2.5 and the artificial land cover ratio, thus discarding this land cover variable."
5,the artificial land cover ratio increasingly varies between samples as the resolution of lur model samples becomes coarser (not shown).
5,"therefore, the lur model possibly captures the response of pm2.5 to changes in artificial land cover ratio variation and finally includes this variable as an input predictor."
5,note that other input predictors besides land use generally hold for different spatial resolutions.
5,2.3.3.
5,"the random forest model the rf model is based on a set of decision trees [45,46]."
5,it can be used for both classification and regression.
5,the model has only two important hyperparameters to tune: the number of predictors randomly sampled as candidates at each split (max_features) and the number of trees to grow (n_estimators).
5,input predictors for the rf model are the same as the lur model.
5,we carried out a grid search approach to find the optimized hyperparameters [15].
5,"for the rf model at 1, 3, 5 and 10 km resolution, the optimized values of max_features (n_estimators) are 9 (900), 10 (800), 13 (700) and 11 (300), respectively."
5,2.3.4.
5,model evaluation we used 10-fold cross validation (cv) to evaluate the performance of the above satellite- based pm2.5 retrieval models.
5,"all samples were randomly divided into 10 subsets; nine of them were used for training, and the remaining one was used for validation."
5,this process was repeated 10 times until every subset was tested.
5,"based on predicted pm2.5 concentrations from 10-fold cv and surface measurements, this study calculated the determination coefficient (r2 ) and root-mean-square error (rmse) to assess the model performance."
5,2.3.5.
5,"exposure and health impact assessments for each pm2.5 retrieval model and each spatial resolution, the daily pm2.5 retrievals in yrd were averaged to annual values."
5,these annual values were further used to calcu- late annual population-weighted mean (pwm) pm2.5 concentration over the entire yrd area.
5,"additionally, we adopted a method from the gbd 2019 project to estimate deaths attributable to exposure to annual mean pm2.5 , based on the following equation [47]: rr a,d ( pmi ) − 1   m = ∑ popi,a × mbi,a,d × (2) i,a,d rr a,d ( pmi ) where m is attributable death in yrd in 2020; i, a, and d represent grid, age group and cause of death, respectively; pop is population count; mb stands for the baseline mortality rate; rr(pm) is the relative risk associated with exposure at level pmi ."

6,this spatial resolution effectthen increases is partly gradually because as the a coarser aodresolution continues resolution can to be coarser (figure 2a).
6,this spatial resolution effect is partly because better capture the spatial variation of pm2.5 in summer.
6,"to examine this explanation, we a coarser aod re tion can better capture the spatial variation of pm 2.5 in summer."
6,to examine this e plot the box-and-whisker based on the spatial aod–pm2.5 correlation for each day in summer (figure 2b).
6,"as the resolution becomes coarser, the median of spatial aod–pm2.5 correlation in summer dramatically increases from 0.23 to 0.39 (figure 2b)."
6,"however, this feature does not hold for other seasons (not shown)."
6,figure 2b shows a higher spatial correlation at a coarser aod resolution in summer.
6,"one possible explanation is that aod values are overestimated for these retrievals near cloud pixels [50,51]."
6,this situation appears more frequently in summer when the cloud amount is the highest versus other seasons [52].
6,"after aggregating aod products for coarser resolutions, the overestimated aod values tend to be smoothed, thereby improving the aod–pm2.5 correlation."
6,"to examine this point, we choose a case on 15 august 2020 when the number of aod–pm2.5 pairs is the highest in summer and plot the spatial distributions of aod and pm2.5 in this case for different resolutions, as shown in figure 3."

11,"the standard deviation (sd) and interquartile range (iqr) of annual pm2.5 throughout all grids in yrd generally increase as the res- olution becomes coarser, indicating that the rf model at coarser resolution can create a larger spatial variability of annual pm2.5 concentrations."
11,"for the me model, as resolution decreases from 1 to 10 km, the regional annual average of pm2.5 gradually decreases from 37.0 to 35.4 µg/m3 , and sd and iqr both slightly increase (table 2)."

11,"given that the rf model has a better performance compared to the me and lur models, and the prediction accuracy of the 1 km rf model is the best among the four different resolutions, we recommend using the 1 km rf model to estimate pm2.5 in the yrd region."
11,the impact of spatial resolution on health assessment annual population-weighted mean (pwm) pm2.5 estimated at different spatial res- olutions is shown in figure 8a.
11,"as the resolution becomes coarser, pwm pm2.5 clearly increases regardless of which pm2.5 retrieval model is used (figure 8a)."
11,"based on the me model, pwm pm2.5 at 10 km resolution is 7.8% higher than the result at 1 km resolution."
11,"this difference is 22.9% and 9.7% for the lur and rf models, respectively."
11,"additionally, figure 8a shows that the spatial resolution has an essential impact on achievement of the national air quality standard (35 µg/m3 )."
11,"pwm pm2.5 concentrations estimated at 1, 3 and 5 km resolution meet the standard for lur and rf models, whereas estimates at 10 km resolution fails to meet the standard for all models (figure 8a)."
11,"furthermore, mortality attributable to pm2.5 is also sensitive to resolution change, as shown in figure 8b."
11,mortality estimated at 10 km resolution increases by 7.3% compared to that at 1 km resolution for me model.
11,"this increase is 18.3% and 8.4% for the lur and rf models, respectively."
11,pwm pm2.5 and attributable mortality notably increase with decreasing spatial res- olution in yrd (figure 8).
11,"one reason for this sensitivity is that annual pm2.5 increases with coarser spatial resolutions in the northern yrd, especially in areas along the yangtze river; these areas usually correspond to highly polluted and densely populated regions."
11,figure 9 shows the spatial distribution of annual pm2.5 at 1 km from the rf model and its difference from coarser resolutions.
11,"as can be seen, annual pm2.5 at 3 km increases widely in yrd compared to 1 km (figure 9b), and this pattern still holds in the northern yrd when going to coarser resolutions (figure 9c,d)."
11,"the sensitivity of pwm pm2.5 to spatial resolution is further investigated for different sub-regions of yrd, as shown in figure 10."
11,"for annual pwm pm2.5 from the me and rf models, the estimation gradually increases as resolution decreases from 1 to 10 km in northeast yrd (sub-region 1) and northwest yrd (sub-region 2)."

14,"discussion our results show that the aod–pm2.5 correlation generally decreases as the aod spatial resolution becomes coarser, consistent with previous studies [54–56]."
14,"this pattern, however, is the opposite in summer."
14,"one possible explanation for this unexpected result is that aod values collocated to pm2.5 observations are frequently near cloud pixels in summer, and these aod retrievals at finer resolution are likely unreliable due to cloud contamination."
14,"by contrast, chudnovsky et al. [55] indicated that maiac 1 km aod retrievals remain reliable under partly cloudy conditions."
14,"this cloud effect should be further investigated in the future, perhaps in combination with a full-coverage aod dataset."
14,"additionally, after applying vertical and humidity corrections of aod following previous works [57,58], the spatial resolution effect on the aod–pm2.5 correlation still holds (not shown)."
14,note that the spatial resolution range may affect the sensitivity of aod–pm2.5 correlation on resolution.
14,"for instance, wu et al. [57] found that, as degrading spatial resolution, the correlation in shenzhen city in summer rapidly increases until reaching the peak at about 1 km resolution and then slowly decreases when going to coarser resolutions."
14,"this work indicates that aod data at a finer spatial resolution cannot improve the performance of the pm2.5 retrieval models based on the traditional statistical regression (i.e., me and lur models)."
14,the spatial resolution effect on the pm2.5 retrieval model is inconsistent among the previous studies [21–23].
14,"for instance, lee et al. [23] showed a better performance of the me model at a 1 km aod resolution in the southeastern united states (us) compared with 10 km resolution."
14,"conversely, this trend is opposite in northern china [21]."
14,"hence, we speculate that the sensitivity of the pm2.5 retrieval model on aod spatial resolution varies by region."
14,northwest yrd (sub-region 2 in figure 1a) shows a better performance of the me model as the resolution becomes coarser (not shown).
14,"for the other two sub-regions, the me model performance is still insensitive to aod spatial resolution (not shown)."
14,"for the pm2.5 retrieval model based on machine learning (i.e., the rf model), the results presented here show that a finer aod spatial resolution can produce a more accurate pm2.5 prediction."
14,this conclusion still holds for the three sub-regions in yrd (not shown).
14,"therefore, machine learning is likely a good way to solve the spatial resolution effect on pm2.5 prediction."
14,note that pm2.5 prediction accuracy may not keep improving when satellite data spatial resolution continues to be enhanced.
14,"for instance, based on micro-satellite images, zheng et al. [59] used a convolutional neural network and random forest approach to estimate pm2.5 and compared prediction accuracy between different input image sizes (i.e., 670, 500, 200 and 100 m)."
14,"they found that as the image size decreases, the performance improves at first until reaching the peak at 200 m, after which the performance degrades."
14,"we find that health assessment strongly depends on spatial resolution, with larger values estimated from coarser resolution."
14,this sensitivity holds for all three pm2.5 retrieval models.
14,previous studies have drawn inconsistent conclusions regarding the spatial resolu- tion effect on health assessment.
14,"most of them have shown that pwm pm2.5 decreases as spatial resolution becomes coarser [33,34,60,61]."
14,"by contrast, thompson et al. [62] found that pwm pm2.5 and attributable death are not sensitive to resolution."
14,"furthermore, punger and west [32] showed that pwm pm2.5 increases with resolution from 12 to 36 km and then decreases when going to coarser resolutions."
14,a possible reason for the above inconsistent conclusions may be that the spatial resolution range is different among different studies.
14,"for instance, li et al. [35] found that pm2.5 attributable mortality in the us gradually decreases at degrading resolution (0.5◦ × 0.66◦ , 1◦ × 1.25◦ , 2◦ × 2.5◦ , and 4◦ × 5◦ )."
14,punger and west [32] reproduced this result for a similar resolution range but found an opposite change in health assessment when comparing estimations between 12 and 36 km.
14,"to further examine this resolution range effect, we create pwm pm2.5 at resolutions ranging from 1 to 15 km (in 2 km increments) by simply averaging 1 km pm2.5 concentrations."
14,although not
15,"remote sens. 2022, 14, 2933 15 of 18 shown here, we find that, as resolution becomes coarser, pwm pm2.5 gradually increases until reaching a peak at 9 km, after which pwm pm2.5 is relatively flat."
15,our study has some limitations.
15,"first, this work is limited to the yrd region in 2020."
15,the findings presented here may not be applicable for different periods and/or different regions.
15,"given that the impact of satellite data spatial resolution on the pm2.5 retrieval model likely varies by region, it would be highly interesting to examine regional variation in this resolution impact in the future."
15,this further work should include different represen- tative areas and long-term satellite data.
15,"second, we set a limited spatial resolution range (i.e., 1, 3, 5, and 10 km) to investigate the sensitivity of the pm2.5 retrieval model on aod spatial resolution."
15,"it remains unclear whether our sensitivity findings are reproduced for a wider resolution range (e.g., sub-km scale)."
15,higher spatial resolution satellite data are likely beneficial for pm2.5 retrieval.
15,"however, this benefit may be clearly shown when supported by additional refined data, e.g., meteorological fields, given the complex relationship be- tween satellite observation and ground pm2.5 measurements."
15,this speculation is supported by a recent study in which they used ultrahigh-resolution top-of-atmosphere reflectance (toar) to build different pm2.5 retrieval models without including additional factors [63].
15,"they found that the model performance changes little, with the resolution varying from 30 m to 9 km (see their figure 2a)."
15,"they speculated that incorporating urban micro-climate products may improve the pm2.5 prediction accuracy at a high resolution, e.g., 90 m [63]."
15,"in the future, we will further check our findings by using satellite data at higher spatial resolution than maiac data (e.g., 20 m aod product from sentinel-2), in combination with meteorological fields from computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulations."
15,"conclusions based on multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (maiac) aerosol optical depth (aod) and other auxiliary data in 2020 over the yangtze river delta (yrd), this work investigates the effect of aod spatial resolution on the performance of satellite- based pm2.5 retrieval models."
15,"overall, we find that the spatial resolution effect varies by method."
15,"specifically, the pm2.5 retrieval model performance is not sensitive to resolution change (i.e., 1, 3, 5 and 10 km) for the mixed effects model (me) and the land-use regression model (lur)."
15,"by contrast, the pm2.5 retrieval model based on random forest (rf) can perform a more accurate pm2.5 prediction with a finer aod spatial resolution."
15,"r2 increases from 0.85 to 0.88, and rmse decreases from 8.6 to 7.9 µg/m3 when comparing the rf model performance between 1 and 10 km."
15,these findings provide further evidence that machine learning may be an effective way to build the aod–pm2.5 relationship involving different spatial scales.
15,"we also examine the spatial resolution effect on health assessment using the satellite-derived pm2.5 estimation at spatial resolutions of 1, 3, 5 and 10 km."
15,our results show that annual population-weighted mean (pwm) pm2.5 concentration and attributable mortality gradu- ally increase as the resolution becomes coarser.
15,"mortality estimated at 10 km resolution increases by 18.3%, 8.4% and 7.3% compared to that at 1 km resolution for the lur, rf and me models, respectively."
15,"note that pwm pm2.5 at 10 km fails to meet the national air quality standard (35 µg/m3 ), whereas the estimate at finer resolutions generally meets the standard."
15,these findings suggest that caution is needed when interpreting the health assessment at the coarser resolution for the yrd region.
15,"overall, we recommend using satellite-derived pm2.5 based on a machine learning method and finer spatial resolution aod data for regional health assessment."
15,"nevertheless, the resolution effect covering a wider range of finer spatial resolution (e.g., <1 km) should be further investigated in the future."
