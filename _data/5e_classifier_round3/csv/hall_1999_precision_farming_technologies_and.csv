1,"laboratory for pest control application technology, the ohio state university, wooster, oh 44691 precision farming (pf) or site-specific farming (ssf) is a relatively new concept in the management of production agriculture."
1,"rooted in ""management"", pf brings the information age and space-age technology together with the science of producing food and fiber."
1,"in this process, there exists an increased opportunity to reduce environmental risks from pesticide use with improved environmental stewardship and greater economic profitability via more efficient use of scarce resources."
1,"pf thus is an example of combining newer techniques of satellites, remote sensing and computers with the familiar tools of soil testing, scouting and yield analyses."
1,"information can help farmers reduce pesticide use, lower the need for insurance sprays, cut input costs and bring added environmental and economic soundness to the forefront."
1,"in order to exploit the potential for pf in accurately locating spatially variable pest/weed populations, a system of selectively applying cpas' (n, etc) is thus required."
1,"development of ""patch"" sprayers, which are connected to computer-linked mapping, could allow treatment to patches within the field."
1,"requirements for information acquisition, analysis, strategy development, delivery and evaluation of results can be very intensive depending upon the state of knowledge about the soil, ν needs, as well as pest identification and development profiles."
1,there remain serious questions about information ownership and economic benefits to all farmers.
1,"the various levels of information have to be well integrated in order to achieve an understanding about crop health and pest abundance/damage interactions, pest aggressiveness and invasion capacity, needed for a sustainable agriculture."
1,"96 © 1999 american chemical society ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
2,97 the increased world population in the next 25 years will necessitate increased food production approximating a 60% increase over current levels of production.
2,crop production chemicals have played a major role in achieving our current successes.
2,"however, critics of agrochemical strategies (1-3) have maintained that in spite of ca $25 billion for crop protection agents (cpa), which contribute to both human and environmental risks, crop losses continue at an alarming rate."
2,"megatrends, such as capitalization, economics, technology transfer, policy, environmental and legislative issues, global competition, and emerging technologies will all significantly influence the potential for future cpa's as well as the structure of agriculture itself."
2,risk reduction of our current crop protection tools and how well farmers control the use of these chemicals is governed in part by the regulatory structure as well as perception by the public.
2,"in some minds, risk reduction is synonymous with reduced reliance on pesticides (3-5)."
2,"however, one of the prime benefits of cpa's is the reliability of consistent crop protection from year to year and thus reducing the uncertainties at the farm level."
2,us production stability and price performance is dependant upon this functional precept and use of such technologies.
2,this has led to the lowest consumer food prices in the world for the us.
2,precision farming (pf) also called site-specific farming or prescription farming is an emerging technology of managing agricultural resources and production information.
2,"concurrent with the hype brought on by the attractiveness of new ""wow"" technologies is the implication that this new technology will immediately greatly reduce the imprecision currently undertaken by our farmers as. they use and deliver agrochemicals."
2,"this brief review summarizes the technology and the key implications of the technologies, our current state of knowledge about the manageability of the technology and the anticipated effectiveness of economic and environmental gains from stepping into the next millenium with this technology."
2,"risk reduction risk analysis of the hazards of new technologies has been placed into 3 phases including risk identification, risk estimation, and risk assessment."
2,flora (6) suggests that risk assessment criteria may be different for various disciplines.
2,"additionally, costs and benefits of crop protection tactics are also different depending upon farmer risk aversions and his marketing goals, crop quality requirements etc.."
2,"thus who pays and who benefits from crop protection are questions for sociologists, but disciplinary interactions are still lacking."
2,"risk ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
3,98 estimates of pesticide use are among the most controversial as the rules for health risks vs that of environmental risks vary enormously among disciplines.
3,our ability to detect is far greater than our understanding of the risk itself.
3,e p a (7) presents an excellent review of the ecological risk assessment process.
3,ecotoxicology is receiving greater attention recently because of the off-target movement of these more active materials.
3,"while increased selectivity is the norm with these new pesticides, increased environmental safety is also a common benefit."
3,adequate quantification of the environmental effects of complex interactions of chemical combinations on a spatial/temporal scale is a very difficult process (8-9).
3,"key questions on diversity, spatial and temporal sensitivities, recoverability of the systems (frequently ignored), and loss impacts of interacting pests require enormous data gathering and analyses especially when collected as various levels of ""patches""."
3,"thus while the data is increasingly abundant, information and understanding for predictive tactical/strategic action is the weak link."
3,"additionally, marz (10) correctly identifies the significant differences and value of crop protection information from such sources as surveys, market surveys, station trials vs on farm trials, on-farm information, and personal farmer interactions, etc."
3,"if risk reduction is based upon the premise of reduced usage of pesticides (rates, and frequency), then the value of such information in reducing uncertainties associated with reduced dependence upon cpa's is abundantly clear."
3,pf is predicted to aid this more efficient use of pesticide/fertilizer tools of agriculture.
3,"the current focus on input reductions and reduced reliance on single control strategies (directional policies, global economy pressures or regulatory issues) will require elaborate and comprehensive benefits assessments of any new technologies."
3,"perceptions by the public about produce quality and federal/broker grading guidelines and use risk aversion, all impact growers' prices that, in turn, modify rates of technology adoption."
3,"pesticides are relatively cheap insurance tools, fast and convenient technologies (11)."
3,"the risks, particularly in fruit and vegetable crops, are high and pesticides save valuable management resource time (off -farm income requirements)."
3,"pesticide use strategies are influenced by public policies - commodity support programs, quality standards, global marketing, and disincentives for diversification, and finally, respond to price, although current prices do not reflect environmental costs (3,9)."
3,"as summarized recently by hall (12), pesticides are spectacularly effective and easy to use in order to respond to increasing food demands of an expanding population and reduce uncertainties in an already risky venture - agriculture."
3,"under risk reduction policy objectives, one could ask what is the risk, to whom and how do we define it (13)?"
3,"if perception is reality, then the general public considers the use of pesticides as an insurance against crop loss as a serious risk and farmers use the technology too heavily."
3,"solving the delaney problem with the enactment of the food quality protection a c t (fqpa) while addressing ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
4,99 some problem areas has opened the door for many other questions.
4,"these include the serious implications of how to reduce risks from the elimination of organophosphates and carbamates with the few alternatives available to the fruit and vegetable and other minor crops (4,14)."
4,"pesticide reduction scenarios thus take on various roles of — from what to what, and engender the needed questions — how, when, at what costs, to whom, and at what risk(s) to the farmer and food production industry."
4,overuse of cpa's is not considered the problem by farmers faced with million dollar investments already vulnerable to such risks as meteorological variables (the 1997-1998 growing seasons).
4,"thus, reductions in uncertainties, by using documented and proven technologies is not an unreasonable approach to improving food quality and production goals."
4,pf seems to offer some potential to achieve these longer-range goals.
4,"pf as an emerging technology pf is a systems approach as illustrated succinctly by parkin and blackmore (15 ), and may require deeper understanding of processes to achieve a specific goal (figure 1)."
4,"spatial variation of crops, pests, organic matter, yields etc within a field has long been recognized as a feature of farmland variables."
4,"until recently, little has been done to exploit this variability by using improved management with emerging advances in technologies."
4,"treating whole fields is an easy methodology, which is now expanded to tactics which recognize pest explosions within the field and treat as needed."
4,these illustrations show that pf can link improved control of pesticide and ν application with information management to improve delivery of a crop production tactic/chemical to specific sites within a field.
4,"in addition, the goal might not be to maximize yield, but rather to maximize economic advantages within particular environmental/economic constraints."
4,the general elements of pf suggest an economic push and an environmental pull towards input reductions.
4,"several conferences on agricultural pf have thus far been published including an international symposia (16), an agronomic conference (17), and a national science committee report (18) and a summary written by academia and promoted by industry (19)."
4,these represent the state of the art of pf both in the us and europe with many more conferences already organized for 1999-2000.
4,"at this time, the research focuses on the ability to vary inputs of agricultural production such as seed, fertilizer, and pesticides as adjusted for crop yields, tillage, planting regimes, and soil characteristics based on scouting, monitoring, and harvesting."
4,thus pf can be viewed within a cycle of processes for various functions throughout the production phases of crops (fig.
4,global positioning system.
4,pf requires a spatial positioning locator with a technology originally developed within the military and consists of using satellite signals to define positions on earth.
4,an excellent practical review is given by morgan and ess (19) on the practical aspects of gps/gis parameters of pf.
4,"gps can be used in two modes, a standard single receiver mode and a more accurate differential mode (dgps)."
4,"gps is the cheapest and easiest to use but has reduced ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."

6,101 accuracy due to positional errors (20 m vs 0.5 m).
6,the dgps has the second receiver located at a site different from the tractor mounted device.
6,"current uses of the systems in agriculture mainly involve soil testing, field boundary mapping, positioning for soil types and fertilizer treatments, yield mapping and a more precise positioning of vehicles for applying fertilizers and pesticides."
6,geographic information system (gis).
6,"gis integrates 2 types of data (1) spatial, which defines the shape and location of places, and (2) attribute data which describe organisms and things that happen there."
6,spatial data can be developed into vector data separating geographical features and rastor data to divide geographical units into cells and is used to map continuous data (vs discrete).
6,"the various gis software packages now on-stream such as arcview, ps arc/info, etc, are developing rapidly as is the ease of use and the power to seamlessly integrate various levels of information."
6,"still weakly supported is how to use this information in predictive models and particularly for agriculture, the rapid (economic) collection of pest and weed data."
6,new electronic sensors should provide some relief for this problem in the next 10 years.
6,"easy to use decision- making analyses thus remains a key constraint to a more rapid acceptance of pf for agriculture while a gps can identify a location (of pests), it also needs a geographic information system (gis) to tell is what that something is - i.e., patch of weeds, infestation, etc. — if we have correctly identified and measured it."
6,"storage of yield information, fertility levels, recommendation, etc. with gis systems can provide it for every spot in the field."
6,thus a gis is a software application that is designed to provide the tools to manipulate and display spatial data.
6,"gis goes beyond just computerizing maps and can, with some use of overlays and linkages, combine data sets with agronomic models and decision support systems (figure 3)."
6,spot spraying and treat as needed tactics have long been a legitimate i p m strategies.
6,"this customizing of information about field health, productivity, etc, can now be managed to a much higher level."
6,"however, this integration of information is the current weak part of the system envisioned to reduce pesticide, etc. risks by identifying changes in management tactics."
6,"site-specific needs: variable rate technologies (vrt), makes use of computer operated field equipment, which accurately delivers the correct amount of fertilizer/pesticide to a given point in a field."
6,"this increased flexibility in application equipment thus allows an infinite number of options to deliver a cpa on an ""as needed"" prescription-like basis."
6,well-organized integrated information remains the key to optimizing this technology.
6,"coupled with new sensors infrared, optical, etc.), to identify targets within a field, an integrated delivery system with patch capability can selectively deliver appropriate concentrations of cpa's."
6,"this would increase precision of pesticide/fertilizer ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."

8,"103 placement both spatially, temporally, and in harmony with the environment, growth stage requirements and site-specific needs."
8,"evaluation of these new innovations in sensors, vrt sprayers and gis analyses are being summarized in reports of initial studies on pf (16-19)."
8,"given the potential to have a wide range in pest management needs at various sites in a given field, then efficient delivery to that site is dependent upon the following advances in system interface between gps and application (20)."
8,geoposition sensor: usually a dgps system with up to .5 m accuracy such as the earlier loral systems (21) and newer real time knematic systems (22) yield position accuracy's to ca 30 cm.
8,ground speed sensor: usually by doppler radar or wheel sensors allow accuracy's to 1-3% and support temporal resolution better than gps and can take care of speed latency errors (dickey john co.).
8,"field sensors: used by applicators to determine target rates, these include nir organic matter sensors, and electro-magnetic induction sensors (16)."
8,"target rate-field log maps: a number are now available for general gis use and include vector (nets of polygon vertices, while raster formats have quicker data accesses."
8,"management of regional data and transfer of data requires good communication/linkage packages with standards for rapid exchange since map accuracy, precision and legal issues are key concerns (23)."
8,"applicator rate processing: rate commands are sent to the delivery system which include communication links for monitoring and control with appropriate standards ie; eia-485, (20)."
8,"networking: various systems also include accurate distributed controls combined with standard interfaces of 3 pt hitches, and connections needed for any site specific delivery (24)."
8,new advances in fiber optics and wireless communications will add significant advantages to pf delivery systems (25).
8,the limits of cost and field support are extremely relevant to the advancement and acceptance of pf technology throughout us agriculture.
8,neural nets and fiizzy logic control theory will add to this potential over the next few years (26).
8,operator interface: clearly an area which can be enhanced with visual cues at the seat to adjust for changes in the system.
8,"virtual terminal access, etc will upon approval of standards and offer advances beyond the numeric/tonal displays now being offered."
8,"again, costs are significant at this stage of development."
8,"however, the advances being shown to the public via the ""navigator"" and ""on- star"" systems being installed in personal cars at options costs of $1200 or so, offer hope that economical agricultural advances will follow."
8,emerging technologies.
8,emerging spray application technologies (27) center around pesticide risk reduction thrusts as spray drift mitigation.
8,"these developments include air-assist nozzles, shrouds and adjuvants which increase drop sizes to reduce drift, as well as the new air induction nozzles and variable rate nozzles (table 1)."
8,"these advances in pesticide application technology (pat) ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."

10,105 have significant expectations (table 2) in terms of the increases in delivery efficiency (hence reduced on-site and off-site risks) (28).
10,"costs, legislation incentives and or public pressures will dictate whether these systems will advance into the practical realm of usage by the farmers of the next millenium."
10,"improvements beyond the technical equipment parameters involve improved education and training of applicators for standard and new use procedures, cleaning and calibration practices, user protection and general best management practices (bmp)."
10,"typically, the misapplication factors involve poor calibration, equipment malfunctions, and mismatch of chemical mixes with plant needs, etc."
10,"in reality, wrong field applications and spray drift account for 41% of all misapplications (29)."
10,"this suggests that pf technologies coupled with educational thrusts/farmer mentoring, etc, can improve the efficiency of the current cpa delivery process."
10,"although traditional leadership in these areas has been accomplished via government organizations, there is more pressure for the chemical industry to actively participate in these activities."
10,"risk reduction issues (brought on by environmental and human exposure risk issues) focus on the modification of field edge practices, and the proper matching of equipment and plant needs with greater attention to an understanding of the potential technology solutions."
10,"farmers are under serious economic pressure to improve the profit margins, ie., the 1998 grain and pig prices."
10,"some government/insurance programs aimed at increasing farmer knowledge about crop protection options and adoption of risk reduction technologies, such as pf, could improve the rate of adoption where environmental issues are a priority (28)."
10,"advances in variable rate sprayers the capability to define a specific location within a field, which may require additional fertilizer, seed, or pesticide treatment, then requires the application system to deliver upon demand."
10,"poorly calibrated sprayers and variation in travel speed have resulted in numerous advances to control delivery, automation or controls, etc. in order to account for variables of speed, or changes in the rate of application."
10,"anderson and humbug (20) suggest 5 systems comprise an array of pressure-based flow controls, and various chemical injection and direct nozzle combinations."
10,both pressure and control based flows controls regulate the delivery of a chemical-carrier premix through the nozzles but which change the distribution across the boom swath if the nozzles are worn or damaged.
10,"an alternative is thus chemical injection where there is no premix to dispose of and multiple pumps handle the delivery with positive displacement pumps to meter agents into the carrier stream matched to boom width, travel speed, and desired broadcast rate."
10,the principle limitation here is the transport delivery between injection point and nozzle discharge.
10,"alternatively, placement of chemical injection points close to the boom and nozzles significantly reduce transport delays and volume changes (29), but which requires special non-traditional pipe networks and connections."
10,"control systems can be developed to anticipate rate changes/delays and/or make changes early but requires spatial/temporal/logistic ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
11,106 solutions.
11,"direct nozzle injections appears to solve the delay dilemma (30) etc but require numerous additional chemical lines, and metering mechanisms, and a solution as to how to deal with the left-over material in these lines in disposal and clean-up etc (31)."
11,controlling both carrier and chemical has advantages in that response times are essentially the same as the response time of the flow control system.
11,"currently, nozzles represent a limitation to this approach since both drop size and flow rate are functions of the pressure drop across the nozzle orifice."
11,this creates a limited range of rates since pressures must be increased by 4 to achieve a doubling of the chemical application rate.
11,"since spray drift with increasingly powerful actives is becoming a disturbing problem with urban growth, people and sensitive sites, (water, etc,), but this pressure range is unacceptable."
11,"new nozzle advances have shown the potential to overcome these serious problems in 2 separate ways; (1) adequate performance of nozzle over extended pressure ranges , as with the new designs - air induction low volume nozzles and /or, (2) an alternative solution shown by the synchro system (33) which under constant pressure/volume can produce significant changes in the spray cloud characteristics, thus adding considerable flexibility (and toxin use efficiency) to crop/pest needs."
11,the recent series of mergers of large equipment companies yield an uncertainty about the evolution of gps/equipment technologies made available to certain commodity producers.
11,"information requirements weeds represent a major target for patch spraying since weeds can occur in the absence of crop, in known patches, between crop rows and interspersed with the crop."
11,"scattered about the field which can be followed with the use of weed infestation maps (labor intensive), or in the case of planted fields, improved sensors can identify any green thing as a weed, or newer sensors capable of differentiating weed structure is also possible."
11,"such systems have shown remarkable reductions in pesticide use rates (90%), with even dual boom systems using 2 rate concentrations."
11,more difficult than the between row sensing is the weed interspersed with the crop.
11,methodologies using reflectance and morphology have been successfully utilized but commercial systems are some years away (33).
11,"perhaps even more intriguing is the discussion brought forth by cardina et al (34) who ask for deeper research on ""what i f advancing weed patches are broken up?"
11,does this weaken competitiveness or strengthen weed advancement profiles?
11,thus short term and long term implications need to be considered on a total farm management basis (fig.
11,"clearly, the information complexities brought forth by gps/gis capabilities will escalate enormously as the technology infrastructure strengthens."
11,"clearly information intensive, the acquisition and integration of the layers of widely different kinds of information (fig. 3) into a practical usable model will be ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
12,107 the acid test.
12,"some critics of the technology still insist that this high-tech approach to crop protection is not the route to a sustainable, economically viable, and ecological sound agriculture."
12,"many organizations and agencies i.e., us geological survey, usda-ars, and nrcs, us epa, the university systems, and the crop protection and equipment industries with their dealer systems are waiting for the appropriate time to deliver this technology in the new millennium."
12,"while it is not necessarily prudent to be the first on the block, clearly there are signals about agriculture, information content and structure."
12,"farmers, organizations, suppliers, etc, need to be both cognizant of and more importantly, prepared to initiate a step up in strategy assessments."
12,"historical trends, data, assessments, i.e., knowing where you are, where are the weakness on the farm (field/crop wise), and the what-if s of changing practices are all vital tools for impact assessments for new strategies."
12,"farmers need to be aware of data needs, the clarity of information, and establish clear ""goal agendas"" if they are to make effective use of these emerging technologies."
12,"biological data from gps/gis data acquisition can provide valuable clues about ecosystem viability and functionality, and the movement in space and time of pests/weeds."
12,"with the newer geostatistical tools, pf can help us integrate what is happening with proposed changes in crop protection strategies (34,43)."
12,"a recent summary of gis utilization case studies for managing natural resource landscapes (44) shows how local, state, national agencies as well as private industry are developing the framework for measuring and analyzing resource utilization."
12,"complete with demonstration copies of arcview gis samples, sources of national resource web sites add to the power of well-organized and time forecasting."
12,"the current weakness in landscape spatial issues, is the point-data analyses which begin the more difficult tasks associated with theory, ie., identifying the scale and understanding the nature of the spatial structure."
12,pesticide resistance management and good stewardship demand a tracking of refuge and genetic engineered planting spatial relationships.
12,herein lies the additional worth of this technology as the influence of biotechnology on agriculture escalates with large-scale plantings of genetically-modified plants.
12,"remaining questions about pf technologies the fragility of global financial markets in 1998 has shown remarkable direct influences on the buying strategies and hence, us grain prices."
12,the weather (el nino/la nina) influences continue to demonstrate enormous power to disrupt vast us grain/food production potentials.
12,will technology be able to rescue the farmers from these and other factors influencing their profit margins in coming years?
12,"alternatively, for some farmers, input reductions may be the only recourse of action."
12,"it remains an interesting ""tug of tactics"" between using technology adoption to provide solutions vs input reductions via alternative agriculture ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
13,108 tactics.
13,meanwhile there is continued pressure to grow more food for a burgeoning world population.
13,what are the remaining key issues to be resolved?
13,"they include. (1) identification of the economic benefits of spatially variable crop protection measures for the average farmer, (2) development of intelligent data-based models and simplicity of the analytical/prediction gis assessments, (3) questions about yield mapping benefits for the majority of farms, (4) yield interpretation models, (5) the need for simplicity in managing spatially variable inputs to improve the measure of uncertainty values in data sets, and (6), the questions of farm size on technology adoption (35-37)."
13,"the effort to organize farm records, with spatial functions to create a gis is a useful exercise even if records stay in the shoe box and spatial data remains penciled in on aerial maps."
13,"it does stimulate thinking about farm goals, and deeper issues of why certain field areas contributed less than optimum to farm income."
13,"how well the gis is organized, in the layering to accomplish this increased learning capacity for the managers, remains the weak point and the focus of many future symposia about pf."
13,"data is abundant, but information remains obscure in that we require alternative statistical analyses even beyond geostatistical programs (35-36)."
13,"can we fine-tune farm inputs recognizing that economic analyses are incomplete so that beyond pesticides, genetic engineering, crop rotations, and diversity will achieve optimal yields without over-dependence upon ""insurance"" methodologies of pesticides?"
13,"since the bulk of pf development is still coming from the private sector, data privacy is a serious hurdle."
13,"this is especially relevant when it becomes obvious that the data, which has value beyond the farm gate, is out of control by the individual farmer."
13,"the transferability of this information could have significant value to potential users such as other farmers, agribusiness, processing firms for new market trends, as well as extension education and regulatory oversight and could be a sensitive area."
13,"this is similar to events now occurring at the neighborhood grocery store which issues ""advantage"" cards for purposes of obtaining added discounts."
13,"the card also records user purchases, timing, and an array of information about food purchase decision-making."
13,"finally, with biotechnology companies increasing their control of seed companies, this integration of us agriculture is likely to have a significant impact and change on traditional farmer crop production decisions."
13,"as farm supports change (fair) and increase crop diversity, advisors become more valuable assets for planning farm tactics."
13,"farmer goal setting processes thus have a unique opportunity to be reassessed by industries attempting to influence how, what and when they undertake a management practice."
13,critics of technology say it is much too narrow and we should be doing more studies of farmer behavior and goal setting components (38) especially under risk taking tactics.
13,there still remains a misperception by the public of why pesticides are used in crop protection.
13,"this only exacerbates the on-farm dilemma of how far to ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
14,109 take on new expenditures for risky production tactics under the current commodity prices.
14,adoption rates of new technologies will impact on future developments of this technology.
14,"as illustrated by lowenberg-deboer (39) in a historical perspective of adoption of corn hybrids, the adoption rate of pf is likely to have similar delays and problems unless we understand what influences technology adoption (figs 4 and 5)."
14,"hewitt and smith (35) summarize the concerns of many about pf trends, which on the surface represent a new way of managing ag resources and production information for the potential good of the environment and production goals."
14,pf has certain characteristics which make it unique from other agricultural innovations.
14,"to date, pf has been primarily a private sector endeavor, and certain elements of the technology may never be controlled/owned by the producers."
14,"effective on-farm use of the pf data continues to be extremely information- intensive (requiring a sophisticated manager, trained dealer) and this information has value beyond the farm (35)."
14,"can pf be made more scale neutral, aid input reductions (hence reduce environmental intrusions), and do more than just increase efficiency?"
14,"since information has power, can producers control their own destiny and management goals with the use of pf?"
14,will pf exacerbate environmental and social costs associated with input-intensive agriculture (36)?
14,"this array of interesting questions about goal-setting, visionary farmers and the precision level of the average farmer, and potential for problem solving (35-37) may all be hidden in the reality of the global economic crisis, hence effects on us grain prices."
14,"these, among many questions, are typical of those being addressed in forums of international meetings (16-19), various reports, and news articles (40)."
14,"they represent difficult, but practical questions which need to be addressed."
14,"as cries for increased effort from the public sector are raised (40), efforts by the deere group and others (19), e p a (for ν impacts), nrcs (soil conservation/erosion), and the u s d a (production), are moving to support pf research needs, (37-39, 40)."
14,"however, the jury is still out on whether, in fact, we can detect economic benefits from the array of pf management changes taking place within a field."
14,the national research council (18) and others suggest we need to focus on several goals.
14,"these multidisciplinary approaches to pf include: (1) create data gathering and analysis tools for agriculture, (2) clarify intellectual property and privacy rights with public organizations involved here, (3) link rural connections in the internet, (4) provide unbiased assessments of economic and environmental impacts of such sustainable management, and (5) educate and train professionals."
14,"nevertheless, the technology is advancing rapidly to increase the precision of farmers and their interactions with mentors."
14,"these tactics are all aimed at ""an improved use of information"", both existing and layered."
14,"how well we organize that data, and prepare for active discussion on long-range assessments of technology, will insure pf a significant position in future us agricultural practices."

16,ill dissemination of pf technologies will be aided by electronic information sites on the web.
16,selected resources include the mega links such as the esri web site at esri.com/arde which serves as a universal spatial server for arc/info.
16,"a r c news (esri) offers clear updated information on related sites, gis news and insight into future offerings and developments about databases, new models, gps interactions, etc."
16,other pf sites include: http:www.agriculture.com and http://nespal.cpes.peachnet.edu/pf7 .
16,"pf equipment systems resources, such as john deere, case, new holland, acchem, etc.,with the gps dgps sites of rockwell, trimble, starlink, etc., and the gis mapping dealers, maplnfo, farm works, esri, gis world, etc. are the major players attempting to exploit pf for agriculture."
16,"vrt technologies offered by agchem, tyler, etc, and an excellent glossary provided in an easy to read guide on pf for farmers (19) all provide valuable resources."
16,there also continues to be an escalation of world conferences hosted by the major scientific societies.
16,"beyond pesticides/fertilizer placement precision the automatic sensing of pests and weeds among crops is a next logical development and require a ""fast response"" characteristic linked into delivery systems."
16,"even greater benefits could come from positioning sprays within canopies in a form of ""micro-targeting'."
16,these systems could really lead to very low dose applications and a truly target -oriented approach to pesticide delivery (15) and significantly reduce αι/acre.
16,"the use of gis technologies, however, offer potentials to go far beyond the development of more precise pesticide delivery systems for agriculture."
16,these interesting uses range from the very practical to ecologically based hypothesis testing.
16,"first, there are the aquatic risk assessments for e p a , which conventionally utilize conservative worst case assumptions using the following parameter examples: 1. 10 ha watershed is 100% cropped with cotton, 2."
16,cropping areas occur up to the water edge 3.
16,maximum #applications at maximum rates applied by air 4.
16,winds blow towards the water and there is no marginal vegetation.
16,"under the auspices of the pyrethroid working group and the exposure modeling group efforts, zeneca and others in a team work environment (41-42) have attempted to use gis to examine the landscape via satellite imaging to show: 1. size classification of individual fields, 2. margin relationship to water and crop 3. spatial distributions around ponds with directional components 4. buffer composition these initial spatial and temporal risk assessment analyses show that (1) epa's default landscape assumptions overestimate exposure, (2) many fields are never ragsdale and seiber; pesticides: managing risks and optimizing benefits acs symposium series; american chemical society: washington, dc, 1999."
17,"112 affected by the insecticide, and (3) physical buffers do exist and can mitigate drift and run-off."
17,"thus, gis tools have interesting value in (1) determining how potential environmental exposures occur, (2) can characterize the agricultural landscape, (3) can provide verifiable data for refining model assumptions and (4) lend clues for the development of practical farm management action plans using buffers, b m p and drift mitigation tactics."
17,"a higher level of analysis, however, will require increased integration of spatial crop information, crop production practices and environmentally realistic exposure predictions."
17,"the second example of potential gis usage involves the tracking of transgenic fields, wherein the spatial relationship of these plantings can be tracked relative to spatial orientations of non-transgenic field plantings (for resistance management, etc)."
17,"given the state of the number of acres now being planted to genetically modified seed, this would seem to be a logical research focus for the next 5 years."
17,"third, ecological systems are spatially heterogeneous, with complexity and variability in time and space."
17,a comprehensive review of maps and spatial point data analyses and interpretations strongly suggests there are opportunities to improve compatibility's of point-data analyses with ecological theory (43) including geostatistic alternatives to patch-based approaches when system properties vary with space and time.
17,using heterogeneity indices to advance the linkage between patterns and processes (scale of patchiness with geostatistic/fractal techniques) can add to advancing ecological theory.
17,cardina et al (34) also suggest the need for a greater understanding of the more intensive landscape management potentials of gis technologies wherein patches of weeds are broken up thus creating a myriad of weed aggressiveness.
17,monitoring and managing decisions for long term views to minimize land use risks thus become much more information intensive and require increased research team communications beyond our current levels (figure 6).
17,summary the ability to vary inputs in a field defined by a site-specific need is critical for any development of site-specific management.
17,the technology to utilize variable rates is available.
17,"soil maps showing soil types, integrated with ν requirements, plus/minus historical crop responses, is a laudable goal in optimizing ν utilization."
17,"adding risk management tactics can be as easy as changing spraying tactics in high risk farm border areas to advancing weed patch tactics with as needed herbicides, to better understanding ecological dynamics of various pest, weed infestation movements."
17,"with vrt and economic/ecological/environmental impact assessments, there is an enormous jump in requirements of logistics, equipment, labor and management resources especially decision-making."
17,"this will require government support if projected advances in it, pat, gps/gis are to increase more rapidly than projected."

19,this problem will need to be addressed if such strategic goals are to be achieved.
19,"clearly, economic benefits have thus far been a serious weakness and as global economies and weather affect farm prices (as in 1998), then acceptance of these advances will continue to lag behind development."
19,"education, training, and the sensitive issues of data ownership and data privacy have to be addressed by public organizations."
19,"it via the web, new partnerships between agricultural cooperatives, or value-added resellers will add significant pressure to acquire this technology."
19,"can we project that the grower, faced with increasing cost pressures, stay in business, organize a good future for his farm with reduced inputs or will it take extremely far sighted mangers to see the value of complexity made simple via it with elegant gis maps/projections."
19,can we also utilize pf to enhance i p m stage ii strategies wherein field borders (invasion points) can be identified and treated differently than the inner sections (reduced pest infestations)?
19,"clearly, the use of gis for fundamental ecological/pest movement dynamics and risk reduction (chemical exposure scenarios) will enhance probabilities of acceptance."
