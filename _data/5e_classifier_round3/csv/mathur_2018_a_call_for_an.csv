1,"by applying our classical understanding of air pollution dynamics to analyze variations in widespread surface-level ozone measurements, in conjunction with process-based interpretation from a comprehensive air pollution modeling system and detailed backward-sensitivity calculations that quantitatively link sur- face-level and aloft pollution, we show that accurate quantiﬁcation of the amount of ozone in the air entrained from aloft every morning as the atmospheric boundary layer grows is the key missing component for characterizing background pollution at a location, and we propose a cost-eﬀective continuous aloft ozone measurement strategy to address critical scientiﬁc gaps in current air quality management."
