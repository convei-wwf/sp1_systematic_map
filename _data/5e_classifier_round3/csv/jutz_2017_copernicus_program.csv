4,"the fast provision of accurate data is central to this innovative global monitoring initiative, which offers key information services for a wide range of practical applications to improve and secure everyday life and to help mitigate the effects of climate change."
4,"the information gathered and relayed by copernicus helps to improve the management of natural resources, monitor the quality of water supplies, monitor and forecast air pollution, support town planning and prevent urban sprawl, ease the ﬂow of transportation, optimize agricultural activities, and promote the development of renewable energy sources, among others."
4,"furthermore, copernicus will lead to the enhancement of the safety of nations and citizens in numerous ways, for example by providing early warning of natural disasters and supporting the management of humanitarian or regional crises, forest ﬁres and ﬂoods, thereby helping to prevent loss of life and property."
4,it will also provide a basis for enhanced modeling and forecasting activities to help improve our understanding of the drivers of climate change and mitigate its consequences.
4,"in copernicus, similar to meteorology, satellite data are combined with data from airborne and ground sensors to provide comprehensive information about the state of the land, sea, and air."
4,"all these data are then fed into a range of information services designed to beneﬁt the environment and to support global, national, regional, and local decision making."
4,"the services cover six thematic domains today: atmosphere, ocean, and land monitoring, as well as emergency response, climate change, and security."
4,"even if it has been built to primarily serve operational services and national member states from european union (eu) and european space agency (esa), there is a large beneﬁt for science users as well."
4,"in addition, science will be crucial to advance services and provide critical input to the deﬁnition of new observation systems."
4,"the program is led overall by the european commission (ec), acting on behalf of the eu."
4,the ec is in charge also of the users’ requirements and of the implementation of the services component.
4,"the copernicus services are operated by organizations from the public and private sectors, selected by the ec."
4,"the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts (ecmwf), the european environment agency (eea), or the eu joint research centre (jrc) are some of them."
4,"eu’s main partner in this endeavor is esa, which coordinates the space component."
4,"this component is made of satellites devel- oped speciﬁcally to meet copernicus needs, so-called sentinel families, and of missions from other space agencies, not designed originally for copernicus, but contributing to the program."
4,"a distributed gs composed of a network of receiving stations and pro- cessing centers complements this component, making these data available to users."
4,"esa’s main partner in the operation of the space component is the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites (eumetsat), which develops part of the gs and operates some dedicated sentinel missions."
4,"the in situ component, under the coordination of the eea, is composed of data collected from nonspace sources, such as from ground stations and sensors installed on buoys or ﬂoats, aboard research vessels, and on research balloons or aircraft, and is based on established networks and programs at european and international levels."
5,154 copernicus program fig.1 the copernicus program: components and actors involved.
5,the challenge is to compile and harmonize all this space and in situ data in order to assemble them into useable and compatible information services.
5,"copernicus does not replace existing european capacities, but rather complements them with a view to ful- ﬁlling user needs and guaranteeing sustainability and european autonomy in the long term."
5,fig. 1 illustrates the interactions among the different actors of the program.
5,"besides, copernicus, once fully operational, will become the european contribution to an international global earth observa- tion system of systems (geoss), which is required to address the magnitude of challenges individual nations cannot address alone."
5,"the successful uptake of the operational phase of the copernicus space component (csc), and the full economic beneﬁts of the copernicus program, will materialize when the wealth of data from the whole series of sentinel satellites will be delivered to users in an accurately and timely manner."
5,copernicus will also help create new jobs and business opportunities.
5,"already today, space activities foster the development of a market for satellite-enabled products and services."
5,"a range of new business models are beginning to ﬂourish around the services and data provided by copernicus, paving the way for innovative entrepreneurs to create new applications and services."
5,"moreover, the open dissemination regime for copernicus data and service information will help citizens, businesses, researchers, and policy makers to integrate an environmental dimension into all their activities and decision-making procedures."
5,"this article intends to give a complete overview of the program since the very beginning, with a focus on the space component and future perspectives."
5,"1.06.2 the space component the objective of the csc is to fulﬁl the space-based observation requirements in response to european policy priorities and coper- nicus user needs concerning the environment and security (http://www.esa.int/our_activities/observing_the_earth/copernicus and https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/home, esa copernicus websites)."
6,"copernicus program 155 the requirements consist of: l continuity of operational observations beyond 2020 (ideally at least 15–20 years from today): this drives the nature of the observations and the type of missions. l frequency of observations, which drives the number of simultaneous spacecraft in orbit for each type of observations. l evolution of the space component based on user needs, which accounts for the demand for new services and products, and the demand for new observations and technology improvements."
6,"esa, the agency responsible for the technical coordination of the csc, has, among other tasks, to deﬁne the overall system archi- tecture of the csc and its evolution on the basis of user requirements coordinated by the ec."
6,"the csc comprises two types of satellite missions: the dedicated sentinel missions, developed by esa speciﬁcally to meet the earth observation needs of copernicus users, and the contributing missions (ccms), a number of existing and planned earth observation satellites from other space agencies or organizations which provide some data to the program."
6,"both, sentinels and contributing missions, will ensure the long-term availability of critical observations for operational and scientiﬁc applications."
6,"the sentinel families carry a range of technologies, such as radar and multispectral imaging instruments for land, ocean, and atmospheric monitoring to cover all environmental domains: l sentinel-1: comprises a c-band synthetic aperture radar (sar) sensor to provide a high revisit time all-weather day-and-night supply of imagery and ensures continuity of ers-2/envisat sar data."
6,"it supports services related to the monitoring of arctic sea- ice extent, routine sea-ice mapping, surveillance of the marine environment (including oil-spill monitoring and ship detection for maritime security), monitoring of land surface for motion risks, and mapping to support humanitarian aid and crisis relief actions. l sentinel-2: comprises a medium-resolution optical sensor, to provide continuity of spot- and landsat-type data for services related to, for example, land management by european and national institutes, the agricultural industry and forestry, as well as disaster control and humanitarian relief operations. l sentinel-3: comprises a suite of instruments to measure sea-surface topography, sea- and land-surface temperature, and ocean- and land-surface color with high-end accuracy and reliability in support of ocean forecasting systems, and for environmental and climate monitoring. l sentinel-4/-5: are spectrometer instruments at high temporal and spatial resolution to be embarked on eumetsat satellites (meteosat third generation and metop second generation, respectively), which will beneﬁt services to monitor air quality, stratospheric ozone, solar radiation, and climate monitoring."
6,"moreover, taking the planned launch date for metop-sg (2021) into account, a sentinel-5 precursor mission is being developed for launch in 2017, in order to ﬁll the gaps between envisat and sentinel 5 for atmospheric monitoring. l sentinel-6/jason-cs: comprises a high-precision sar altimeter with supporting microwave radiometer and precise orbit deter- mination (pod) instruments to provide measurements of global sea-surface height, wind, and wave heights in support of marine and climate change applications."
6,"while the sentinel satellites are currently being developed speciﬁcally for the needs of the program, the contributing missions are developed for other purposes but still provide valuable data for copernicus."
6,"the latter are operated by national agencies or commer- cial entities within esa or eu member states, eumetsat, or other third parties, and the conditions under which their data are made accessible to copernicus (e.g., ordering mechanisms, processing level, delivery timeliness, data licensing, and data policy) are contractually stipulated with the mission owners."
6,"an integrated gs operates and provides access to sentinel data, and interfaces with contributing missions in order to obtain a coordinated data stream to satisfy copernicus needs."
6,"1.06.2.1 the dedicated missions in order to fulﬁl the copernicus service needs, esa member states have, in 2005, decided to invest in the buildup of the necessary dedicated space infrastructure as a capacity complementary to that available in its member states."
6,a set of satellite constellations (called sentinels) is being developed for this purpose.
6,1.06.2.1.1 sentinel-1 sentinel-1 is an advanced imaging radar mission.
6,"the advantage of radar as a remote sensing tool is its capability to image earth’s surface through rain and cloud, in any weather as well as during day or night."
6,"this is particularly useful for monitoring areas prone to long periods of darkness, such as the arctic, or providing imagery for emergency response during extreme weather conditions."
6,"the sentinel-1 constellation, composed of two polar-orbiting satellites, the ﬁrst one launched aboard a europeanized russian soyuz rocket on 3rd apr. 2014 and the second one launched on 25th apr. 2016, provides high reliability, improved revisit time, geographical coverage, and rapid data dissemination to support operational applications in the priority areas of marine monitoring, land monitoring, and emergency services."
7,"156 copernicus program each satellite, weighing 2300 kg (including 130 kg fuel), has been designed for a minimum lifetime of 7 years in orbit, with one spacecraft orbiting earth 180 degrees apart from the other and at an altitude of 693 km."
7,the orbit is inclined 98.18 degrees relative to the equator and with a mean local solar time of 18:00 h at ascending node.
7,"the two-satellite conﬁguration optimizes coverage, offering a global revisit time of just 6 days."
7,"at the equator, however, the repeat frequency is 3 days and less than 1 day over the arctic."
7,"europe, canada, and main shipping routes are covered in less than 3 days."
7,sentinel-1 carries a single c-band sar instrument operating at a center frequency of 5.405 ghz.
7,"it includes a right-looking active phased array antenna providing fast scanning in elevation and azimuth, and data storage capacity of 1410 gb and 520 mbit/s x- band downlink capacity."
7,"as well as the 12-m-long radar, the satellites each carry two 10-m-long solar wings."
7,"during launch, the solar wings and radar are folded up for protection and to ﬁt into the soyuz rocket fairing."
7,"after the satellite is released into space, the solar wings and radar deploy together, but in a speciﬁc sequence that takes around 10 h to complete."
7,"the sequence is unique, choreographed to ensure that both deploy in the safest possible way."
7,the sequence also allows power from the wings to be available as soon as possible so that the satellite is independent.
7,"sentinel-1 images all global landmasses, coastal zones, and shipping routes in european waters in high resolution and covers the global oceans at regular intervals."
7,having a primary operational mode over land and another over open ocean allows for a preprog- rammed conﬂict-free operation.
7,"the c-sar instrument supports operation in dual (horizontal and vertical) polarization (hh þ hv, vv þ vh) implemented through one transmit chain (switchable to h or v) and two parallel receive chains for h and v polarization."
7,dual-polarization data is useful for land cover classiﬁcation and sea-ice applications.
7,sentinel-1 operates in four exclusive acquisition modes: l stripmap (sm): this imaging mode is provided for continuity with ers and envisat missions.
7,stripmap provides coverage with a 5 m-by-5 m resolution over a narrow swath width of 80 km.
7,one of the six imaging swaths can be selected by changing the beam incidence angle and the elevation beam width. l interferometric wide swath (iw): this mode allows combining a large swath width (250 km) with a moderate geometric reso- lution (5 m by 20 m).
7,the iw mode images three subswaths using terrain observation with progressive scans sar (topsar).
7,"with the topsar technique, in addition to steering the beam in range as in scansar, the beam is also electronically steered from backward to forward in the azimuth direction for each burst, avoiding scalloping and resulting in a higher quality image."
7,interferometry is ensured by sufﬁcient overlap of the doppler spectrum (in the azimuth domain) and the wave number spectrum (in the elevation domain).
7,the topsar technique ensures homogeneous image quality throughout the swath.
7,"the iw mode is the default acquisition mode over land. l extra-wide swath (ew): this imaging mode is intended for maritime, ice, and polar zone operational services, where wide coverage and short revisit times are demanded."
7,"the ew mode works similarly to the iw mode employing a topsar technique using ﬁve subswaths instead of three, resulting in a lower resolution (20 m by 40 m)."
7,"the ew mode can also be used for interferometry as with the iw mode. l wave mode (wv): this mode, in conjunction with global ocean wave models, can help determine the direction, wavelength, and heights of waves on the open oceans."
7,"wave mode acquisitions are composed of stripmap imagettes of 20 km by 20 km, acquired alternately on two different incidence angles."
7,"wave imagettes are acquired every 100 km, with imagettes on the same incidence angle separated by 200 km."
7,"the ﬁrst three modes can be operated in four different schemes of polarization (two in single and two in double): hh, vv, hh þ hv, or vv þ vh."
7,"the wave mode can operate only in single polarization, either in hh or in vv."
7,"overall, this represents 34 possible submodes of operations."
7,"a transition time, currently estimated in the order of 2.4 s (corresponding to roughly 17 km), is necessary to switch from a sar measurement mode to another measurement mode, or to perform a change of polarization."
7,no data are acquired during this time interval.
7,"the sentinel-1 sar is capable of operating up to a total of 25 min per orbit (within a moving window of a 100 min orbit period duration) in any combination of the iw, ew, or sm modes, and up to the rest of the orbit in wave mode."
7,"in additional to the routine transmission of data to a number of ground stations for rapid dissemination, the optical commu- nications payload on-board sentinel-1 transmits data via laser to satellites in geostationary orbit carrying the european data relay system (edrs) and improves the amount and speed of data delivery to the users."
7,"the sentinel-1 mission observation scenario during full operation capacity is based on the following principles for each satellite: l wave mode continuously operated over ocean, with lower priority w.r.t. the other modes. l iw or ew modes operated (for a total duration of up to 25 min per orbit) over predeﬁned geographical areas:  over land: the baseline mode is iw."
7," over oceans, seas, and polar areas: the baseline mode is either iw or ew."
7,the ew mode (featuring a 400 km swath) is the preferred mode for services providing monitoring activities over large areas with frequent revisiting requirements and not having speciﬁc needs for high-resolution products (such as the sea-ice monitoring operations performed by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service).
8,"copernicus program 157  if possible, use of single polarization is adopted in order to give priority to the coverage extent and, if relevant, to facilitate the data acquisition strategy."
8,"1.06.2.1.1.1 sentinel-1 applications the sentinel-1 mission will beneﬁt numerous services, mainly relating to: l monitoring of arctic sea-ice extent l routine sea-ice mapping l surveillance of the marine environment, including oil-spill monitoring l ship detection for maritime security l monitoring land surface for motion risks l mapping for forest, water and soil management l mapping to support humanitarian aid and crisis situations sentinel-1 will be the primary source of data for information on the oceans and the arctic."
8,"the mission’s ability to provide obser- vation in all weather, and in day- or nighttime conditions, makes it ideal for maritime and arctic monitoring."
8,"sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric products will beneﬁt users interested in agriculture, forestry, and land cover classiﬁcation."
8,"the enhanced interferometric capabilities will beneﬁt users involved in activities like geo-hazard monitoring, mining, geology, and city planning through subsidence risk assessment."
8,an example of interferogram produced by sentinel-1 is shown in fig.
8,"sentinel-1 security users will be able to monitor major shipping routes to detect illegal activities, gather prosecution evidence in case of illegal discharges, detect unexpected building in remote areas, monitor deforestation, and support search-and-rescue activities."
8,"the rapid data dissemination and short revisit cycles of sentinel-1 together with its interferometric capabilities will also beneﬁt emergency response users, such as the united nations international charter on space and major disasters, in emergency situations such as ﬂoods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides."
8,"the design of sentinel-1 with its focus on reliability, operational stability, global coverage, and quick data delivery is expected to enable the development of new applications and meet the evolving needs of copernicus."
8,"designed and built by a consortium of around 60 companies led by thales alenia space, italy, for the satellite, and airbus defence and space, germany, for the sar instrument, the sentinel-1 satellites are an outstanding example of europe’s technological excellence."
8,it is operated by esa.
8,"1.06.2.1.2 sentinel-2 the sentinel-2 optical mission offers an unprecedented combination of systematic global coverage of land surfaces, a high revisit frequency, high spatial resolution, and a wide ﬁeld of view."
8,all these requirements are fulﬁlled with two identical sentinel-2 satellites.
8,"the ﬁrst one (a unit) has already been launched on a vega launcher on 23rd jun. 2015, while the identical sentinel-2b has been launched on 6th mar."
8,the latter one was placed in fig.
8,"2 sentinel-1a interferogram obtained combining radar scans from 24 aug. and 17 sep. 2015 after the earthquake, which struck the coast of central chile on 16 sep."
8,the rainbow-colored patterns in the image show how the surface has shifted as a result of the quake.
8,“interfero- grams” such as these allow scientists to quantify ground movement.
8,"by counting the “fringes,” it is estimated that the earthquake caused a displace- ment of 1.4 m along the viewing direction of the radar observation."
8,"in addition, a 0.5 m horizontal movement is estimated along the ﬂight direction of the satellite (credits: contains modiﬁed copernicus sentinel data (2015)/esa seom insarap study ppo.labs/norut)."
9,158 copernicus program the same orbit but 180 degrees separated from sentinel-2a (opposite side of the orbit) to reduce time between revisits of a given geographic area.
9,"as a constellation, the same spot over the equator is revisited every 5 days, and this is even faster at higher latitudes."
9,"each satellite, weighing 1140 kg (including fuel), has been designed for a minimum lifetime of at least 7.25 years in a planned 786-km sun-synchronous orbit inclined at 98.5 degrees relative to the equator and with a 10:30 a.m. descending node."
9,"it has enough fuel that, assuming routine operations, it can continue to function for at least 12 years and retain enough propellant to assure that it is removed from orbit upon retirement."
9,the local time was selected as the best compromise between minimizing cloud cover and ensuring suitable sun illumination.
9,"it is close to the landsat local time and matches spot’s, allowing the combination of sentinel-2 data with historical images from these other missions to build long-term time series."
9,"the sentinel-2 satellites systemat- ically acquire observations over land and coastal areas between latitudes 56 degrees south and 83 degrees north, all coastal waters up to 20 km from the shore, all islands greater than 100 km2, all eu islands, the mediterranean sea, and all closed seas (e.g., caspian sea)."
9,"the sentinel-2 mission has been designed and built by a consortium of around 60 companies led by airbus defence and space, germany, for the satellite, and airbus defence and space, france, for the multispectral instrument."
9,"the development of the mission has also been supported by the french space agency, cnes, which provided expertise in image processing and calibration, and by the german aerospace center, dlr, which provided the optical communication payload, developed by tesat spacecom gmbh."
9,it is operated by esa.
9,"as for sentinel-1, in addition to the routine transmission of data to a number of ground stations for rapid dissemination, the optical communication payload transmits data via laser to satellites in geostationary orbit carrying the edrs and improves the amount and speed of data delivery to the users."
9,the multi spectral instrument (msi) onboard sentinel-2 is based on well-established heritage from france’s spot missions and the us landsat satellites.
9,"it is a push-broom sensor, which works by collecting rows of image data across the orbital swath and utilizes the forward motion of the spacecraft along the path of the orbit to provide new rows for acquisition."
9,its design has been driven by the large 290 km swath requirements together with the high geometrical and spectral performance required of the measurements.
9,"it integrates two large visible near-infrared and shortwave infrared focal planes, each equipped with 12 detectors and integrating 450,000 pixels."
9,"the average period of observation over land and coastal areas is approximately 17 min, and the maximum period of observation is 32 min."
9,"light reﬂected up to the msi instrument from the earth and its atmosphere is collected by a three-mirror telescope and focused, via a beam splitter, onto two focal plane assemblies (fpas): one for the ten vnir wavelengths, and the other for the three swir wavelengths."
9,"to achieve the required 290 km swath width, both the vnir and swir fpas are composed of 12 detectors, stag- gered in 2 horizontal rows."
9,pixels that may fail in the course of the mission can be replaced by redundant pixels.
9,two kinds of detectors integrate high- quality ﬁlters to isolate the spectral bands perfectly.
9,"the instrument’s opto-mechanical stability must be extremely high, which has meant the use of silicon carbide ceramic for its three mirrors and focal plane, and for the telescope structure itself."
9,the geometric performance requires strong uniformity across the focal planes to avoid image distortion.
9,"the radiometric perfor- mance excluded any compromise regarding stray light, dictating a tight geometry and arrangement of all the optical and mechanical elements."
9,the instrument is equipped with a calibration and shutter mechanism that integrates a large spectralon diffuser.
9,the 13 spectral bands span from the visible (vis) and the near infrared (nir) to the shortwave infrared (swir) at different spatial resolutions at the ground ranging from 10 to 60 m.
9,the four bands at 10 m resolution ensure compatibility with spot-4 and -5 and meet the user requirements for land cover classiﬁcation.
9,the 20 m resolution for six bands has been a requirement for other level 2 parameters.
9,"the three bands at 60 m are mainly dedicated for atmospheric corrections and cloud screening (443 nm for aerosol retrieval, 940 nm for water vapor, and 1375 nm for cirrus detection)."
9,the 60 m resolution is considered to be adequate to capture the spatial variability of the atmospheric geophysical parameters.
9,"the multispectral imager is also the ﬁrst optical earth observation mission of its kind to include three bands in the “red edge” part of the spectrum (at 20 m spatial resolu- tion), which provide key information on vegetation state."
9,"each satellite has a high level of autonomy, so that they can operate without any intervention from the ground for periods of up to 15 days."
9,"the “carpet mapping” imaging plan requires acquisition, storage, and transmission of 1.6 tb compressed raw image data per day from the constellation."
9,this corresponds to an average continuously sustained raw-data supply rate of 160 mbps.
9,msi data are systematically acquired during daylight portions of the orbit where the target surface has a sun zenith angle below a certain threshold (currently being speciﬁed at 82 degrees).
9,"different illumination conditions will hence derive seasonal patterns and lead to varying acquisition scenarios according to summer solstice, winter solstice, and autumn/spring equinoxes."
9,"1.06.2.1.2.1 sentinel-2 applications concerning applications, sentinel-2 will monitor variability in land surface conditions, and its wide swath width, high resolution, and high revisit time (i.e., 10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with two satellites under cloud-free conditions, which results in 2–3 days at midlatitudes) will support applications in the land, climate change, emergency response, and security domains."
9,an image acquired by sentinel-2 is shown in fig.
9,"prior to sentinel-2, there were insufﬁcient cloud-free satellite data in high resolution with all the necessary spectral bands to cover europe fast enough to monitor vegetation when it is growing rapidly in the summer."

10,copernicus program 159 fig.
10,3 sentinel-2 true-color image (acquired on 28 jun. 2015) featuring the red sea coral reefs off the coast of saudi arabia.
10,the lighter blue water depicted in the image means that the water is shallower than the surrounding darker blue water.
10,"furthermore, water clarity is exceptional in the red sea because of the lack of river discharge and low rainfall."
10,"therefore, ﬁne sediment that typically plagues other tropical oceans, particularly after large storms, does not affect the red sea reefs (credits: copernicus sentinel data (2015)/esa). designed to provide images that can be used to distinguish between different crop types and data on numerous plant indices, such as leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll content, and leaf water contentdall of which are essential to accurately monitor plant growth."
10,"this kind of information will help informed decisions to be made, whether they are about deciding how much water or fertilizer is needed for a maximum harvest or for forming strategies to address climate change."
10,"while this has obvious economic beneﬁts, this kind of information is also important for developing countries where food security is an issue."
10,"in the land domain, sentinel-2 will also provide seasonal to annual european-wide coverage of physical properties describing bio-geophysical information parameters, such as land cover and land cover change, and an extensive range of other parameters to characterize the continental vegetation (including forests and crops), as well as land carbon, natural resources, energy budget, and water cycle."
10,"as cities continue to expand, sentinel-2 can also be used to track urban expansion and assist urban planners."
10,the sentinel-2 mission’s frequent revisits over the same area and high spatial resolution allow changes in inland water bodies and the coastal environment to be closely monitored.
10,"with its 13 spectral channels, the mission’s novel imager can capture water quality parameters such as the surface concentration of chlorophyll, detect harmful algal blooms, and measure turbidity (or water clarity) – giving a clear indication of the health and pollution levels."
10,the demand for water is growing inexorably.
10,"access to water is vitaldnot only for drinking, but also for agriculture, energy, and sanitation."
10,"in certain regions of the world, water scarcity is caused by population growth, climate conditions and increasing climate variability, economic development, or urbanization."
10,"by providing measurements of water quality and detecting changes, sentinel-2 can support the sustainable management of water resources."
10,"water quality information is not only useful in water consumption applications, but can also indicate areas that are safe, or unsafe, to swim."
10,"regarding emergency management, sentinel-2 will contribute to monitor all types of disasters and crises, including natural disas- ters (ﬂoods, ﬁres, landslides, storms, earthquakes, etc.), technological accidents, humanitarian crises (for instance after a severe drought period), and civilian-military crises."
10,wide swath sentinel-2 data can support the buildup and frequent update of globally consistent background reference maps to be used for impact assessments.
10,"the mission’s fast data dissemination also plays a key role, delivering imagery within a few hours of acquisition."
10,"during humanitarian crises, sentinel-2’s imagery can help identify suitable locations for large refugee camps, and be used to monitor these camps and assist humanitarian operations."
10,"combining information on vegetation, the location of water bodies, and other variables, the mission can also assist in tracking conditions associated with the spread of diseases such as malaria, and to help implement early warnings and mitigation strategies."
10,"in the security domain, sentinel-2 will give support to maritime surveillance, infrastructure surveillance, peacekeeping, intelli- gence and early warning, and crisis management operations."
10,"1.06.2.1.3 sentinel-3 the main objectives of the sentinel-3 mission are to provide a sustained operational capability to measure surface temperature, surface topography, and ocean- and land-surface color/reﬂectance and provide products with excellent accuracy and reliability in support of copernicus ocean, land, atmospheric, emergency, and security services."
10,the sentinel-3 constellation is composed of
11,"160 copernicus program two polar-orbiting satellites, the ﬁrst one launched on 16th feb. 2016 while the second one will be launched at the end of 2017."
11,the sentinel-3b will be placed in the same orbit but 140 degrees separated from sentinel-3a.
11,one of the ﬁrst images acquired by one of the instruments onboard sentinel-3 is shown in fig.
11,esa and eumetsat will share the responsibility for the smooth running of the mission.
11,"after the successful completion of the commissioning phase, encompassing the ﬁrst 5 months in orbit testing the functionality of the satellite, esa will hand over the operations of the satellite to eumetsat."
11,"esa will then continue to monitor the health of the satellite, including platform and instruments."
11,esa is responsible for the operations of the sentinel-3 gs for land products as well as the continuous improvement of the data products through research and development activities.
11,eumetsat is responsible for providing the marine products and operating the satellite.
11,"carrying four instruments that work in synergy, sentinel-3 is arguably the most complex of all the sentinel missions."
11,the sea and land surface temperature radiometer (slstr) instrument will measure global sea- and land-surface temperatures every day to an accuracy of better than 0.3 k.
11,"continuing the legacy of envisat’s advanced along track scanning radiometer, it maintains a dual-view along-track-scanning approach and delivers measurements at a spatial resolution of 500 m for visible/ near-infrared and short-wavelength infrared channels and at 1 km for the thermal infrared channels, and a revisit time of 1 day."
11,"furthermore, slstr includes two dedicated thermal infrared channels that are optimized for active ﬁre detection and ﬁre radiative power measurement."
11,"the ocean and land colour instrument (olci) is based on heritage from envisat’s medium resolution imaging spectrometer and features 21 distinct bands in the 0.4–1.02 mm spectral region (or 400–1020 nm) tuned to speciﬁc ocean color, vegetation, and atmospheric correction measurement requirements."
11,"it has a spatial resolution of 300 m for all measurements and a swath width of 1270 km, overlapping the slstr swath, with a camera tilting to mitigate sun glint leading to an improved ocean color coverage of less than 2 days."
11,"moreover, a coregistered olci and slstr instrument will allow global land coverage in 1–2 days and the generation of products equivalent to the vegetation instrument on spot-4 and -5."
11,"the sentinel-3 topography package is composed of: l a dual-frequency (ku and c band) sar altimeter (sral) instrument, based on heritage from the cryosat and jason missions l a dual-channel passive microwave radiometer (mwr) instrument l a global positioning system (gps) receiver l a doris instrument l a laser retro-reﬂector for pod fig."
11,4 this is one of the ﬁrst images from sentinel-3a’s sea and land surface temperature radiometer (slstr).
11,"acquired with the instrument’s visible channels on 3 mar. 2016 at 11:23 gmt, this false-color image features the spanish canary islands, the portuguese island of madeira, and the northwest coast of africa."
11,"the vegetated islands appear red in contrast to western sahara, which has little vegetation."
11,the snow-capped peak of mount teide on the island of tenerife is clearly visible.
11,"both slstr and sentinel-3’s ocean and land colour instrument, olci, will be used to monitor plant health."
11,"as the slstr scans earth’s surface, it senses visible light and infrared light (heat) in a number of different spectral channels."
11,the thermal infrared channels will soon be working when the instrument has ﬁnished outgassing water vapor.
11,this is necessary because the infrared channels must be cooled to operate properly.
11,the slstr will measure global sea- and land-surface temperatures every day to an accuracy of better than 0.3 c (credits: copernicus sentinel data (2016)/esa).
12,"copernicus program 161 this package will bring a step change in satellite altimetry, measuring the height of the sea surface, waves, and surface wind speed over the oceans."
12,"it will also provide accurate topography measurements over sea ice, ice sheets, rivers, and lakes with a full repeat cycle of 27 days and a subcycle of 4 days."
12,the altimeter provides measurements at a resolution of approximately 300 m in the along-track direction after sar processing and will be the ﬁrst satellite altimeter to provide 100% coverage over all of earth’s surfaces in sar mode.
12,the sral instrument is supported by the mwr that is used to derive atmospheric correction and atmospheric column water vapor measurements necessary to reach the demanding performance requirements for sentinel-3.
12,"sentinel-3 continues the legacy with envisat, but its innovative instrument package provides signiﬁcant improvements with respect to the latter esa mission: l an increased number of spectral bands, allowing retrieval of a higher number of physical parameters: slstr increased from 7 to 9 bands, plus 2 fire channels and olci from 15 to 21 programmable bands l maintaining an accuracy equivalent to or better than that of the envisat mission: – slstr like aatsr, but with a goal to try and improve the accuracy in the thermal infrared bands and with an increased spatial sampling in the vis and swir bands – olci full resolution 300 m acquired systematically for land and ocean, without onboard data scaling/aggregation – sral working in high-resolution sar mode on all surfaces, implementing an open-loop tracking mode specially designed to optimize coverage of rough surfaces l an increased lifetime (7 years’ operational life min, with consumables up to 12) to ensure longer availability of products to users (at least 15–20 years with four satellites) olci operates during daylight, therefore, during the descending part of the orbits, with a sun zenith angle of the subsatellite point of less than 80 degrees (and taking into account the seasonal variations), representing 44% of the time."
12,the slstr visible channels acquire data out of eclipse only (all infrared and swir channel acquire data permanently).
12,the sral instrument acquires data over the whole orbit in the sral sar mode.
12,the mwr instrument operates over the whole orbit.
12,"the sentinel-3 constellation is composed of two satellites, both orbiting earth at an altitude of 814.5 km over the geoid to opti- mize coverage and global revisit."
12,the orbit has an inclination of 98.65 degrees and a mean local solar time of 10:00 a.m. at descend- ing node.
12,"the two sentinel-3 satellites have been designed and built by a consortium of around 100 companies under the leadership of thales alenia space, france, for the satellite, and for the ocli and sral instruments, of selex es, italy, for the slstr instrument and of eads-casa for the mwr instrument."
12,"1.06.2.1.3.1 sentinel-3 applications (a bigger picture for copernicus - the sentinel-3 mission, 2016) the main applications of sentinel-3 data range from ocean and land monitoring to atmospheric monitoring, emergency manage- ment, climate change, and security in an operational context."
12,the social beneﬁts are manifold.
12,"in the marine domain, sentinel-3 data provide wind and ocean wave products which are of interest in marine forecasting (e.g., wave models), off-shore oil and gas platform design and operations, monitoring of changes in sea level, marine pollution and bio- logical productivity, and ship routing."
12,"these data will also support the monitoring of natural (e.g., harmful algal blooms) and anthropogenic (e.g., oil spill) pollution events and their evolutions, among others."
12,"in fact, sentinel-3 is the core operational mission for the copernicus marine environment monitoring service (cmems), making a contribution to roughly 70% of all cmems user products for operational oceanography."
12,"for land applications, sentinel-3 data help determining the rate of growth of vegetation and the start and termination of seasonal growth, and mapping and monitoring of active ﬁres and burned areas."
12,"in the atmospheric domain, products derived from sentinel-3 optical instruments have the widest range of impacts affecting the forcing of climate, air quality, atmospheric visibility, and cloud/precipitation processes."
12,"security and emergency applications require guaranteed access to parameters like crop management, crop yield estimation for food security, river and lake levels for surface water resource monitoring, and deforestation and land degradation for land cover mapping and change detection, which can also be provided by sentinel-3."
12,this broad scope of data will help monitor and understand large-scale global dynamics and provide critical information for ocean and weather forecasting.
12,"as well as delivering data for these types of service, the mission will also open up exciting opportunities for scientiﬁc research to better understand how our integrated earth system works; the science of today becomes the operational applications of tomorrow."
12,"for example, the gigantic buildup of warm surface waters in the eastern tropical paciﬁc ocean characteristic of the el niño phenomenon brings signiﬁcant changes in rainfall patterns and regional weather around the world."
12,"both el niño and its opposite phase, la niña, have widespread impact on the economics of crop production and food security."
12,sentinel-3’s measurements of sea- surface temperature and sea-surface height will be used to monitor the onset and evolution of future el niño events.
12,"the health and vulnerability of our oceans can put vital ﬁsh stocks at risk, a food source on which many rely in coastal megacities and worldwide."
12,"sentinel-3’s ocean and land colour instrument (olci) will provide data for a variety of marine biogeochemical products including algal pigment concentration, total suspended matter, colored dissolved organic matter, and chlorophyll-a, among others."
13,"162 copernicus program information such as this will, for example, help to improve the prediction of harmful algal blooms."
13,"in turn, this will help oceanic food sources to be managed more efﬁciently."
13,the input of waste products into ocean and coastal waters can also be monitored so that the possibility of accidents and risks of major pollution incidents can be reduced.
13,"we should not forget that the oceans regulate the redistribution of heat across our planet, exerting a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on our daily, seasonal, and multidecadal weather."
13,"the surface temperature of the oceans also affects the intensity of hurricanes and tropical cyclones, which cause damage costing hundreds of millions of euros."
13,"sentinel-3’s sea and land surface temperature radiometer (slstr) and its synthetic aperture radar altimeter (sral) will be a vital tool for closely monitoring changes in surface ocean waters, sea state, and sea-ice thickness, and estimating the heat content of the upper ocean."
13,"worldwide trade, 90% of which goes by sea, is expected to double over the next decade."
13,this means that improved now- casting and forecasting services are needed not only to ensure safe navigation but also for cost-effective and environmentally sensitive operations.
13,"as the oil and gas industry operates in more challenging waters, it demands improved marine nowcasts and forecasts in remote areas such as the arctic ocean."
13,"during disasters such as the deep water horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in 2010, these industries also need accurate and reliable forecasts of the ocean state for planning efﬁcient rescue efforts, predicting the ﬂow of a pollutant, containment, shoreline protection, and cleanup operations."
13,"sentinel-3’s multi-instrument package will provide measurements of sea state, sea-surface temperature, sea ice, water clarity, biogeochemical parameters, and surface wind speeddall of which are necessary for the day-to-day operations of the maritime service and maintenance industries."
13,"as well as providing information about the open ocean, sentinel-3 data will provide complementary measurements that are synoptic, regular, and consistent for coastal zone applications."
13,"demands for information on the state of coastal waters are also growing as coastal megacities continue to emerge with consequent increased runoff from waste products and fertilizers from land, and in response to coastal seas being used more for recreational activities, ﬁshing, and aquaculture."
13,"in addition to weather and ocean nowcasting and forecasting, this sets a requirement for environmental monitoring and habitat assessment to support the impact of policies to maintain water quality standards."
13,"agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, water resources, public health, food production, and security are all subtly tied to the dynamics of our vast global ocean."
13,"as citizens, and as policy makers, we need to know, with conﬁdence, how our ocean is evolving to manage our society and our economic and environmental security over the land."
13,"as well as measuring biological activity in the upper ocean, sentinel-3’s olci will also provide unique information, delivered in a timely manner, about changing land cover and vegetation state by measuring variables such as leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation in the plant canopy, and terrestrial chlorophyll index."
13,"also, sentinel-3’s slstr includes dedicated channels for measuring ﬁres."
13,this will help to map carbon emissions from burnt biomass and to assess damage and estimate recovery of burned areas.
13,information to help manage forest ﬁres will be available using sentinel-3 measurements combined with meteorological forecasting data.
13,"in addition, forests can be monitored systematically to assess risk and develop efﬁcient plans to prevent forest ﬁres."
13,"1.06.2.1.4 sentinel-4, sentinel-5p, and sentinel-5 the sentinel-4, sentinel-5 precursor, and sentinel-5 missions are dedicated to monitoring the composition of the atmosphere for copernicus atmosphere services."
13,sentinel-4 and sentinel-5 missions are instruments which will be carried on meteorological satel- lites operated by eumetsat.
13,"sentinel-5 precursor, to be launched and operated by esa, is being developed to reduce data gaps between envisat and the launch of sentinel-5, scheduled in 2021."
13,the sentinel-4 mission is an operational mission whose main objective is the continuous and accurate measurement of the earth atmosphere composition over europe and northern africa.
13,"on an hourly basis from a geostationary orbit (geo), sentinel-4 will observe the diurnal cycle of the tropospheric composition and provide key data of critical trace gaseous constituents of the troposphere such as o3 (ozone), no2 (nitrogen dioxide), so2 (sulfur dioxide), hcho (formaldehyde), chocho (glyoxal), as well as aerosol and cloud properties."
13,this continuous scientiﬁc data stream will be used in support to the applications of copernicus atmosphere monitoring services (cams) for air quality monitoring and forecast and for other fundamental chemistry and climate applications.
13,"the space segment of the sentinel-4 mission consists of a high-resolution ultraviolet–visible-near-infrared (uvn) light imaging spectrometer instrument, covering in fact the ultraviolet (305–400 nm), visible (400–500 nm), and near-infrared (750–775 nm) bands, embarked on the meteosat third generation sounder (mtg-s) satellite while the main elements of the gs, part of the eumetsat mtg gs, consist of the level-1b and the level-2 processors."
13,"it also uses data from eumetsat’s thermal infrared sounder (irs), embarked on the mtg-sounder (mtg-s) satellite."
13,"more- over, after the mtg-s satellite is in orbit, the sentinel-4 mission will include data from eumetsat’s flexible combined imager embarked on the mtg-imager (mtg-i) satellite."
13,the spatial sampling of the uvn spectrometer is 8 km at 45 degrees north (0 degree longitude) and a spectral resolution between 0.12 and 0.5 nm depending on the spectral band.
13,the sentinel-4-uvn instrument is a push-broom imaging spectrometer that scans europe in the east-west direction with a repeat cycle of 60 min and with ﬁeld of regard of  6.8 degrees in the east-west direction and  3.6 degrees in the north-south direction.
14,"copernicus program 163 the sentinel-4 mission, with the ﬁrst unit foreseen to be launched in 2020 and the second one around 2027, will build upon the heritage of a series of spectrometer instruments which since 1995 have been or are currently measuring atmospheric properties, namely: l the global ozone monitoring experiment (gome) on esa’s ers-2 satellite which operated between 1995 and 2011. l the gome-2 instrument onboard eumetsat’s metop-a satellite, launched in 2006, still in service."
14,"a second gome-2 is operating since 2012 on metop-b satellite. l the scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric cartography (sciamachy) instrument onboard esa’s envisat mission which operated between 2002 and 2012. l the ozone monitoring instrument (omi) onboard nasa’s aura spacecraft, operating since 2004 and still in service. l the tropospheric ozone monitoring instrument (tropomi) onboard esa’s sentinel-5p spacecraft expected to be launched in 2017."
14,"among these ﬁve heritage instruments, the one which has the best global performances related to spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and spectral coverage is tropomi, since it reunites several of the best characteristics of its predecessors, even going beyond them like an unprecedented on-ground spatial resolution of 7 x 7 km."
14,"all sentinel-4 heritage missions are passive backscatter spectrometers operating in low earth orbits (leo), which allow per- forming earth global coverage measurements."
14,"the geo orbit of sentinel-4, although will limit the earth observation to only europe and north africa, will on the other hand allow an extremely frequent revisit time of about 1 h: 20–100 times better than any previous leo mission."
14,sentinel-4 will provide equivalent performances to those delivered by the tropomi instrument in terms of spatial sampling.
14,"instead, to be carried on the polar-orbiting metop second generation satellite, the sentinel-5 mission comprises a high- resolution spectrometer covering the following wavelength bands: ultraviolet (270–370 nm), visible (370–500 nm), near- infrared (685–773 nm), and shortwave infrared (1590–1675 and 2301–2385 m)."
14,"the instrument consists of ﬁve spectrometers, in a push-broom conﬁguration with a 108 degrees instantaneous ﬁeld of view."
14,"the uv, visible, and near-infrared channels will be acquired using a set of three charge-coupled devices (ccd), while the shortwave infrared channels will be acquired with two mercury-cadmium-telluride active pixel sensor arrays."
14,"the spatial resolution is about 7 km at nadir, and the spectral resolution ranges between 0.25 nm for the longest wavelengths and 1.0 nm at the shortest wavelengths."
14,"it will include also data from eumetsat’s irs, the visible infrared imager (vii), and the multiviewing multichannel multipo- larization imager (3mi)."
14,"the ﬁrst unit of sentinel-5 is expected to be launched around 2021, with two other units in the pipeline to be launched before the end of lifetime of the predecessors."
14,sentinel-4 and -5 will be operated by eumetsat.
14,"in the meantime, an additional sentinel-5, as precursor mission, is being developed to reduce data gaps between envisat, in particular the sciamachy instrument, and the launch of sentinel-5."
14,an artist’s view of sentinel-5 precursor is shown in fig.
14,5 sentinel-5 precursor artist’s view.
14,sentinel-5p is the forerunner of sentinel-5 to provide timely data on a multitude of trace gases and aero- sols affecting air quality and climate (credits: esa/atg medialab).
15,"164 copernicus program as a joint initiative between esa and the netherlands, the mission will comprise a satellite and a uvns instrument called tro- pomi, a successor of omi on nasa’s eos-aura platform."
15,"with respect to omi, tropomi will provide not only near-infrared but also shortwave infrared coverage."
15,"in addition, the higher spatial resolution will be instrumental for ﬁnding more cloud-free samples."
15,sentinel-5 precursor radiance measurements will be taken on the whole day-side part of each orbit plus some few additional minutes at both ends of the day-side part to cover the terminator crossing.
15,background measurements will be taken on the eclipse part of each orbit.
15,calibration measurements will be taken outside the south atlantic anomaly before spacecraft midnight.
15,"the sentinel-4, -5p, and -5 missions will allow the retrieval of a huge amount of data related to all the key atmospheric constit- uents in support of the air quality applications of the copernicus atmosphere monitoring services, which will include the moni- toring of air quality, stratospheric ozone and solar radiation, and climate monitoring."
15,"1.06.2.1.5 sentinel-6/jason-cs (sentinel-6 end-user requirements document, 2015) the sentinel-6/jason-cs mission will ensure the continuity of service of the high-precision ocean altimetry, which comprises now a unique data record of more than 20 years, following the topex/poseidon, jason-1, jason-2, and jason-3 missions."
15,it will be oper- ated such that it complements ocean information from sentinel-3.
15,an artist’s view of sentinel-6/jason-cs is shown in fig.
15,"to satisfy the needs of global ocean monitoring, two types of altimetry measurements were required."
15,"these are high inclination measurements made from a high-inclination (sun-synchronous) orbit with repeat periods of order of 1 month, as well as measure- ments from a medium inclination orbit with a  10-day repeat cycle selected to avoid tidal aliasing."
15,"a higher altitude is preferred to reduce the effects of air drag, and is the one that has been chosen for sentinel-6."
15,"the application domains cover marine meteorology, operational oceanography, and sea-level and climate monitoring."
15,marine meteorology is generally concerned with processes in the atmosphere and their interaction with the ocean and uses mainly altimeter wind speed and signiﬁcant wave height measurements available in near real time (nrt).
15,"operational oceanography can be deﬁned as the activity of systematic and long-term routine measurements of the seas and oceans, and their rapid interpretation and dissemination."
15,"important outputs of operational oceanography are nowcasts providing the most accurate description of the present state of the ocean, including marine resources, forecasts of the future state, hindcasts assembling datasets to describe past states, and long time series for the analysis of trends and variability."
15,"climate change monitoring services are under development under the global framework for climate services, in particular in the framework of the copernicus climate monitoring services."
15,mean sea level is a pertinent indicator of global climatic change.
15,the ocean is also an important element of the climate system.
15,wind speed and signiﬁcant wave height are also essential parameters for climate monitoring.
15,"also, the sentinel-6/jason-cs mission will take the role of the reference mission in the committee on earth observation satel- lites (ceos) coordinated virtual constellation of ocean surface topography missions (e.g., the marine part of the sentinel-3 mission, saral/altika, hy-2)."
15,this constellation is a coordinated set of space and/or gs capabilities from different partners that focuses on observing the surface topography of global oceans from the basin scale to the mesoscale ( 100 km).
15,"observation of this parameter is necessary for understanding the dynamics of the oceans, assessing their role in climate, and developing an operational forecast capability."
15,"in addition to the primary altimetry mission, sentinel-6 will offer an excellent ﬂight opportunity for a secondary, radio occul- tation (ro) mission."
15,this relatively recent operational technique for generating atmospheric vertical proﬁles has already shown its contribution to the improvement of the numerical weather prediction methods.
15,"the ro data are very useful in the assimilation, since it requires no bias correction, provides high vertical resolution proﬁles, is independent of weather/clouds, and is geographically well distributed."
15,"thus, ro observations “anchor” the assimilation model by providing bias corrections for the assimilation of other microwave and infrared sounding instrument data."
15,6 sentinel-6 artist’s view.
15,s-6 will provide high-precision and timely observations of the topography of the global ocean (credits: esa/airbus defence and space).
16,"copernicus program 165 the bias-free nature of these data also makes ro a very attractive observation technique for climate, as data from different ro instruments can be directly combined for extracting variability and long-term trends."
16,"continuous data coverage has been available since 2001, and ﬁrst trend estimates on, for example, temperature and tropopause height have been performed."
16,"the proposed sentinel-6/jason-cs payload is composed of the following instruments: l a radar altimeter, developed by esa, based on the sentinel-3 sral instrument, but with a design adopted to allow the interleaved mode combining the sar and the low-resolution modes l amr-c microwave radiometer, provided by noaa l global navigation satellite system (gnss) pod receiver, developed by esa and derived from the gnss receiver on sentinel-3 l the same doris receiver as on jason-3 and sentinel-3 l the same laser reﬂector array as on jason-3, provided by noaa l radio-occultation instrument based on a trig gnss receiver, provided by noaa the beneﬁts of this mission are based on some important geophysical parameters retrieved by sentinel-6/jason-cs."
16,"measurements of ocean topography, being the equivalent of surface pressure in the atmosphere, are enabling numerical predic- tion of the three-dimensional ocean, which is a prerequisite to the development of operational oceanography in synergy with marine meteorology."
16,"the development of operational oceanography is, in turn, necessary to improve forecasts of the weather conditions likely to prevail for a few weeks or months, as a result of the sustained inﬂuence of the ocean on the atmosphere."
16,"moreover, variations of sea level (some mm per year) in our changing climate can only be monitored on global scale by high- precision ocean altimetry observations, and ocean surface topography measurements are essential to understand how the ocean stores and redistributes heat, water, and carbon in the climate system."
16,"the ﬁrst sentinel-6/jason-cs spacecraft will be launched in 2020, while the second one is expected to be launched in 2026."
16,they will be operated by eumetsat.
16,"1.06.2.2 the contributing missions prior to data being available from the sentinel satellites, the missions contributing to copernicus, even if developed primarily to serve their respective operators, played and continue to play a crucial role in ensuring that adequate and valuable datasets are provided for the copernicus services."
16,"even when the sentinels are operational, the contributing missions will continue to be essential, delivering complementary data to ensure that a whole range of observational requirements is satisﬁed."
16,"there are over 35 existing or planned contributing missions from esa or their member states, eumetsat, and other third-party (european and international) commercial mission operators."
16,"currently, data from these missions are obtained based on competitive bulk procurement contracts that esa has concluded or is concluding with the respective mission owners or operators on behalf of the ec."
16,the data policies of the suppliers are respected.
16,copernicus covers the cost to obtain these data to then give for free to agreed copernicus services today.
16,"the following categories of contributing missions are considered (earth observation program board - long-term scenario of the copernicus space component, 2015) as shown in fig. 7: l sar sensors, for all weather day/night observations of land, ocean, and ice surfaces l medium–low-resolution optical sensors for information on land cover, for example, agriculture indicators, ocean monitoring, coastal dynamics, and ecosystems l high-resolution and medium-resolution optical sensorsdpanchromatic and multispectraldfor regional and national land monitoring activities l very-high-resolution (vhr) optical sensors for targeting speciﬁc sites, especially in urban areas as for security applications l high-accuracy radar altimeter systems for sea-level measurements and climate applications l radiometers to monitor land and ocean temperature l spectrometer measurements for air quality and atmospheric composition monitoring the list of contributing missions is not ﬁxed and will evolve in time in order to keep up with new user requirements."
16,"the level of integration of their data into the copernicus data portfolio will be driven by requirements stemming from coper- nicus services and reﬂected in the current version of the commission data warehouse requirements (dwr) document, as well as parameters linked to the contributing mission data and data delivery scenarios."
16,"the dwr document, issued by the ec, includes items such as quality and accuracy of data, programming and delivery times, observation frequency, and data and pricing policies."
16,"the dwr document (copernicus space component data access portfolio: data warehouse 2014–2020, 2015), which is regu- larly updated, deﬁnes two types of data: l a ﬁxed part called “core datasets,” which are typically well-deﬁned large datasets covering the needs of copernicus services l a ﬂexible part called “additional datasets,” which typically are of an on-demand or ad hoc nature."

17,"they are operated by national agencies or commercial entities, are already providing a wealth of data for copernicus services, and will continue to deliver complementary data after the sentinels are in orbit (credits: esa)."
17,"the selection criteria for the relevant data procurement aim at satisfying the dwr, respecting the data policies of the mission owners."
17,"a trade-off analysis is performed between the services requirements (speciﬁed in the data warehouse document), the capabil- ities of the portfolio of over 35 contributing missions, and the available funding, the result of which is the actual satellite data offer for a certain period (the so-called data access portfolio (dap) document issued by esa)."
17,"this document evolves in time in response to, for example, new services, or new or updated requirements, or because new contributing missions become available."
17,"1.06.2.2.1 sar contributing missions unlike optical systems that rely on reﬂected solar radiation or thermal radiation emitted by earth, imaging radar instruments work independently of light and heat."
17,radar is an active system that transmits a beam of radiation in the microwave region of the elec- tromagnetic spectrum.
17,sar can provide day-and-night imagery of earth.
17,"in addition, clouds, fog, and precipitation do not have any signiﬁcant effect on microwaves, so images can also be acquired independent of weather conditions."
17,"the copernicus contributing missions carrying sar sensors complement the sentinel-1 mission, and include the italian cosmo- skymed mission, the canadian radarsat-2 mission, the german terrasar-x and tandem-x missions, the future spanish paz mission, and others."
17,1.06.2.2.2 optical contributing missions optical imagers are among the most common instruments used for earth observation.
17,they are generally nadir-viewing instruments with a horizontal spatial resolution ranging from 1 to 300 m and swath widths in the order of tens to hundreds of km.
17,optical imagers and multispectral radiometers provide images of earth’s surface and atmosphere.
17,copernicus contributing missions carrying optical imagers complement the multispectral imagery from sentinel-2 and images from the olci and slstr carried on sentinel-3.
17,"they include the spanish deimos-2 and ingenio missions, the french spot and pléiades missions, the belgian proba-v mission, the now canadian rapideye mission, the american worldview missions, and many others."
17,1.06.2.2.3 altimetry contributing missions radar altimeters are active sensors that use the ranging capability of radar to measure the surface topography proﬁle along the satel- lite track.
17,they provide precise measurements of a satellite’s height above the ocean by measuring the time interval between the transmission and reception of very short electromagnetic pulses.
18,"copernicus program 167 the following copernicus contributing missions carry altimeters which complement the altimetry instrument that carried on esa’s sentinel-3 mission: esa’s cryosat mission; the joint us, french, and eumetsat jason-2 and jason-3 missions; and the cnes-indian saral/altika mission."
18,1.06.2.2.4 atmospheric contributing missions one of the most mature uses of earth observation data is in weather prediction.
18,"for several decades now, near-real-time meteoro- logical satellite images have been at the heart of our daily weather bulletins."
18,numerous atmospheric chemistry instruments and various techniques are also used to measure the composition of earth’s atmosphere.
18,"copernicus contributing missions carrying atmospheric instruments complement the sentinel-4, sentinel-5 precursor, and sentinel-5 missions and include the following: the joint us-french calipso mission, the german-french merlin mission, the eumetsat geostationary meteorological second and third generation (msg and mtg), and the polar-orbiting meteorological operational satellite programs."
18,"1.06.2.3 the ground segment (the gmes space component, 2013a,b) as well as the challenging task of building and launching satellites, the success of the copernicus earth observation program relies on being able to operate the satellites from the ground and ensure that the data gathered are of good quality and made readily avail- able to users."
18,"the csc gs, through which the data are streamed and made available to copernicus services and other users, provides the primary access to sentinel missions and coordinates access to complementary earth observation data from contributing missions."
18,it relies on the reuse of existing facilities and their sharing with the operations of other earth observation missions.
18,"the copernicus ground segment is divided into core and collaborative, being only the ﬁrst ﬁnanced within the esa/eu coper- nicus agreement."
18,"most of the csc core ground segment elements are decentralized and distributed in facilities such as receiving stations, pro- cessing and archiving centers, and mission performance centers."
18,these are linked through network and data ﬂow services.
18,"the main sentinel facilities are: l sentinel flight operations segment (fos) l sentinel payload data ground segments (pdgss) containing, among others: – sentinel core ground stations: data acquisition and nrt product generation – sentinel processing and archiving centres (pacs) – sentinel missions performance centres (mpcs) – sentinel payload data management centres (pdmcs) – sentinel pod service in addition, the sentinel pdgs operations rely on across-sentinel support services, namely: l wide area network (wan) services l data access the sentinel fos, located at darmstadt, is responsible for: l sentinel satellites commanding and control l sentinel tt&c uplink and downlink (s-band link) l speciﬁc actions on sentinel satellites based on postlaunch support (e.g., onboard software maintenance) the sentinel core ground stations, located in svalbard, matera, and maspalomas and complemented by an additional fourth polar station at inuvik, in canada (see their location in fig. 8), are responsible for: l sentinel satellites x-band (and ka-band via edrs for sentinel-1 and sentinel-2) payload data reception, including systematic level-0 product generation and nrt level-1/2 product generation l sentinel satellites x-band hktm data reception, including hktm level-0 generation and delivery to fos l provision of online access to sentinel nrt products the use of the edrs service for data downlink for the sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 missions represents an important complementary capacity with respect to the x-band station network."
18,"the use of the edrs system for the sentinel-1 and -2 missions observations will be managed according to the following obser- vation strategy: l inclusion of acquisition and downlink capacity in support of copernicus operational services outside europe (within edrs coverage) making use of sentinel-1 data in nrt (and quasi-real time). l considering the fact that some operational services require the x-band channels in europe for data transmission in quasi-real- time (pass-through mode), the edrs service will be used to download to europe the recorded data (sensed elsewhere in the world) outside x-band core station visibilities."
19,168 copernicus program fig.
19,8 copernicus core ground stations network.
19,"in these stations, the sentinel data are downlinked, and products are generated in near real time."
19,"the network is complemented by the european data relay satellite (edrs) for the additional downlink of sentinel data to edrs ground stations (credits: esa). l increase of the overall sentinel-1 and -2 downlink capacity and provision of ﬂexibility and redundancy for the mission data download scenarios, being complementary to the x-band core station network. l enhancement of the sentinel-1 data availability timeliness outside europe (within edrs coverage), in case of emergency or crisis situation, to support the copernicus emergency management or security services. l data will be downlink encrypted from the edrs geo satellite to the ka-band receiving station for subsequent decryption."
19,"the sentinel pacs, located at infoterra-uk, dlr, indra, cls, acri, and eumetsat, are responsible for data processing, archiving, and dissemination."
19,"the main functional tasks are: l sentinel satellite data archiving l sentinel systematic nontime-critical data processing and on-the-ﬂy data processing l provision of online access to sentinel products l sentinel data circulation, through the pac’s interfaces to the wan infrastructure the sentinel mpcs are responsible for: l calibration: to update onboard and on-ground conﬁguration data in order to meet product quality requirements l validation: to assess, by independent means, the quality of the data products derived from the system outputs."
19,validation functions provide input for algorithm evolution and processor upgrades l quality control (qc): to monitor the status of the spacecraft (payload) and check if the derived products meet the quality requirements along mission lifetime l data processors and operational qc tools’ corrective and perfective maintenance: to manage the updates of the processors and auxiliary ﬁles in order to ensure the overall quality requirements l end-to-end system performance assessment: to detect anomalies at product and system level and provide high-level performance ﬁgures on the overall mission performance the mpcs rely on the provision of complementary quality services from the expert support laboratories and from dedicated cal/ val groups to maintain the required mission quality performances.
19,"the sentinel pdmcs are responsible for: l sentinel mission and systematic production planning, according to the data access and mission requirements l the interfaces with the fos for the satellite tasking and downlink planning l the pdgs conﬁguration including production organization, circulation, and dissemination setup"
20,copernicus program 169 fig.
20,9 copernicus core ground segment circulation and dissemination network (credits: esa).
20,the sentinel pod service is intended to provide precise orbit data to support the pdgs non-nrt processing.
20,"the pod center is common to the sentinel-1, -2, and -3 missions."
20,"it receives gps level 0 data from core ground stations and generates precise orbit data to the data assembly, processing, and archiving centers for off-line processing purposes."
20,"the different pdgs centers are interconnected through a network infrastructure as shown in fig. 9, which provides also access to the external users: the core ground segment functions include also the coordinated data access system (cds) for sentinels and ccms, which is the coordination center of the csc operational system and provides the interface for data access from copernicus service projects."
20,the cds is responsible for the coordination of the data collection within the boundaries of the agreed dap.
20,"the csc ground segment interfaces with the sentinel national collaborative ground segment, which is intended to allow complementary access to sentinel data and/or to speciﬁc data products or distribution channels."
20,"it is composed of elements funded by national member states (i.e., from outside the funding of the esa/eu copernicus program) and provides the framework for international cooperation."
20,the collaborative elements are expected to bring specialized solutions to further enhance the sentinel missions’ exploitation in various areas: l data acquisition and (quasi-) real-time production: this is when local ground stations are conﬁgured to receive sentinel data directly during the satellite overpass (and supported as long as this does not conﬂict with the systematic operations of the copernicus ground segment). l complementary products and algorithm deﬁnitions: these “collaborative data products” may include speciﬁc tailoring for regional coverage or speciﬁc applications.
20,"these types of products might extend the sentinel core product chains. l data dissemination and access, supporting redistribution of sentinel core products by establishing additional pickup points (e.g., mirror sites). l development of innovative tools and applications. l complementary support to calibration/validation activities."
20,special agreements are being set to regulate interfaces and cooperation schemes between the core and the different national collab- orative ground segments.
20,1.06.2.3.1 sentinel data access the csc ground segment data access implements an open and free data policy ensuring that all sentinel products are accessible to all users online.
20,"sentinel data will be made available for copernicus and national use and, in line with the sentinel data policy and within avail- able operational budget, for other use (e.g., scientiﬁc, international)."
20,"access to sentinel latest products is made available via dedicated data hubs (see a scheme depicting the different data hubs in fig. 10), in order to answer the needs of the different use typologies: l user can self-register to the data hubs. l intended for up to 12 months of data via rolling archives. l data download via terrestrial network (connectivity to the internet at 10 gbps)."
20,"in addition, access to full sentinel long-term archive is being made available to all users online."
21,170 copernicus program fig.
21,10 the sentinel data access infrastructure has been tailored to answer the needs of the different use typologies through dedicated data hubs (credits: esa).
21,the distributed implementation of the product dissemination during fully operational capability involves several core centers and allows decentralizing the dissemination function.
21,"enhanced data dissemination, including for example, centralised data pick up points, mirror sites, and additional distribution nodes as part of the collaborative ground segment, will further ease the access to data by end users."
21,"currently, the csc open data access under esa responsibility is based on the operation of a pickup point that offers search and retrieval capabilities on the sentinel mission core products to all self-registered users."
21,"at any point in time, the access to the core products from all the different sentinel missions operated by esa is always ensured."
21,the corresponding esa-deployed access infrastructure is currently centralized and based on dedicated rolling archives for fast access to “fresh” data and on a network of processing and archiving centers (pacs) for the long-term data access.
21,"the limited size of the rolling archive infra- structure is well adapted to the deﬁnition, prototyping, and operations of a diversity of access methods (e.g., product transfor- mation can be implemented on the ﬂy to better serve user requests)."
21,the transient data made available via rolling archives are always preserved within the long-term data archive centers with the consequence that architectural and operational constraints related to the safeguarding of the data are not relevant to the rolling archives.
21,the opening of the long-term data access from the archive is taking place typically about 1 year following the satellite in-orbit commissioning and the opening of the data access to all users.
21,"a quota policy is in place to limit the number of concurrent downloads, thus preventing a user to block the access to other users."
21,"in parallel to the development of the csc data access framework, initiatives from esa member states are fostering the develop- ment of complementary national services for earth observation mission exploitation."
21,"among other national objectives, these services are addressing the redistribution of sentinel products (focusing on core products retrieval from national users) as well as the creation of additional datasets including complementary information or complementary products (e.g., higher level products, regional processing)."
21,"in many cases, processing on demand is considered."
21,"in order to support these national initiatives in accessing copernicus sentinel core products, esa is deploying a dedicated infra- structure, separated from the eu-funded csc data access framework."
21,"this infrastructure consists in a dedicated pickup point (i.e., the collaborative data hub) connected to the general-use internet."
21,"to complement this, additional data relays are also being deployed to better serve the dissemination of timely data to national centers and overcome the potential limitation inherited from relying on a unique internet point of access."
21,the collaborative data hub (collhub) allows a complete decoupling of the national activities with respect to the csc (core) ground segment (gs) operations.
21,"the overall load introduced on the csc gs by the collhub, agreed with the ec, is equivalent to a single user downloading the complete mission production."
21,the data relays and the current collaborative pickup points do not serve the ﬁnal end users.
21,"in fact, access is provided via preregistration to the national point of contact, which acts as interface for the relevant member state own service needs."
21,"it is also worth noticing that the data system is designed to ensure access on an equal basis to all stakeholders (e.g., no distinction between those operating and not operating payload data ground segment centers, e.g., pacs for long-term archive service provision, acquisition station for satellite data acquisition, or mission performance center for mission quality monitoring)."
22,"copernicus program 171 1.06.3 in situ component the copernicus in situ component, coordinated by the eea, focuses on data acquired by a multitude of airborne and ground-based monitoring networks supporting copernicus services and validation (see fig."
22,"the measurement networks are owned and oper- ated at regional, national, and international levels inside and outside the eu."
22,"the eea has documented the required in situ data, identiﬁed gaps, and developed a suitable framework for open access to the sources of these data."
22,"eea is also exploring how the future management (governance, architecture) of the in situ component during an operational phase might best be achieved."
22,"the main role of the eea is therefore to propose sustainable mechanisms for in situ data delivery/access and a sustainable inter- face between in situ data providers and the copernicus services, based on existing information capacities (e.g., national systems, european networks)."
22,this is carried out making use of the principles of the shared european environmental information system (seis) and the infrastructure for spatial information in the european community (inspire).
22,"1.06.4 the services component (http://www.copernicus.eu/main/services, “copernicus services eu web site”) the copernicus services, based on global observations from space and in situ data, and developed in close collaboration with users, provide essential information in six main domains: land, ocean, and atmosphere monitoring; emergency response; security; and climate change."
22,"these services, most of them already operational, provide standardized multipurpose information common to a broad range of eu policy-relevant application areas, many of which are implemented at national or regional level aiming at sustainability."
22,"11 the in situ component is composed of atmospheric, marine, and earth-based monitoring systems, and based on established networks and programs at european and international levels (credits: copernicus/eea)."
23,"172 copernicus program the evolution of these services, from research to being operational, is continuing steadily."
23,"in each of the service areas, the range of products designed to meet the needs of identiﬁable groups of users is growing."
23,"development of products and services downstream of these copernicus services is expected to serve speciﬁc national (or trans- national), regional, or local information needs, as well as the needs of niche european and global markets."
23,"1.06.4.1 land monitoring service the eu has established a series of environmental directives and policies such as the water framework directive, urban thematic strategy, and biodiversity strategy to protect the natural environment and manage natural resources sustainably."
23,these policies are inﬂuenced by and have impacts on different countries and regions in the rest of the world.
23,climatic changes and an increasing global population put continued pressure on biodiversity.
23,"effective management strategies are in need of up-to- date and reliable information about the state of the environment and how it is changing, not only in europe but also around the world."
23,"the objective of the copernicus land monitoring service is to provide geographical information on land cover and on variables related, for instance, to the vegetation state or the water cycle to users."
23,"it supports applications in a variety of domains such as spatial planning, forest management, water management, agriculture, and food security."
23,"the service builds on a series of projects developed within the framework programs 6 and 7 (fp6/fp7), funded by the ec, such as the geoland-1 and  2 projects, on esa’s gse projects such as gse land, gse forest monitoring and the global monitoring for food security (gmfs) projects, and on activities carried out at the ec directorate general (dg) joint research centre (jrc)."
23,the land monitoring service started its activities in mid-2011 as part of the gmes initial operations (gio) and became oper- ational in 2012.
23,"the current service (gio-land) is articulated in three components: l a global component: produces land information in near real time and on 10-day frequency across a wide range of biophysical variables at a global scale (i.e., worldwide), which describe the state of vegetation (e.g., leaf area index, fraction of green vege- tation cover, vegetation condition index), energy budget (e.g., albedo, land surface temperature, top of canopy reﬂectance) and water cycle (e.g., soil water index, water bodies)."
23,the global component is coordinated by the ec dg jrc. l a pan-european component: producing land-cover and land-change maps (an example of which is shown in fig. 12) at continental scale as well as geophysical and vegetation parameters for seasonal and annual change monitoring.
23,initial activities include the provision of a pan-eu land-cover map for 2012 (which is an extension of the corine land cover achieved in 2006) and of the corresponding change product between 2006 and 2012.
23,"in addition, ﬁve high-resolution layers on land-cover fig."
23,"12 condition of agro ecosystems map based on a pan-european high nature value farmland map using as mask the agricultural categories of corine land cover map of 2006 (credits: european environment agency, eea)."
24,"copernicus program 173 characteristics will be produced for artiﬁcial surfaces (imperviousness layer), forest areas, agricultural areas (grasslands), wetlands, and small water bodies."
24,"the pan-european component is coordinated by the eea. l a local component: aiming at providing detailed information, complementary to the products of the pan-european component, for speciﬁc areas of interest (e.g., urban atlas, biodiversity hot spots, riparian areas)."
24,the local component is coordinated by the eea and aims to provide speciﬁc and more detailed information that is complementary to the information obtained through the pan-european component.
24,it focuses on “hotspots” which are prone to speciﬁc environmental challenges.
24,"furthermore, the use of in situ data is particularly important to ensure the establishment of high-quality land monitoring products and services."
24,"currently, all copernicus services and projects base most of their activities on the provision of satellite imagery from contrib- uting missions, made available through the csc data access system operated by esa since 2008."
24,the sentinel satellites already in orbit and operational are starting to provide substantial beneﬁts for the land monitoring applications.
24,"in particular, sentinel-2 is suitable for instance for pan-european high-resolution products."
24,"with its wide swath of 290 km and two satellites in orbit, the mission signiﬁcantly reduces the number of images needed to cover the continent and results in a very frequent revisit time (5 days at the equator)."
24,"the production of the next corine land-cover update will be facilitated by frequent revisit time, making the acquisition of mul- tidate images possible."
24,this will allow changes to be detected more frequently.
24,"such frequency would also increase the possibility of getting cloud-free images, particularly in regions prone to cloud cover such as the north and tropical regions."
24,sentinel-2’s high revisit cycle also opens possibilities for producing higher resolution bio-geophysical variables.
24,"sentinel-3, with its medium-resolution optical and thermal infrared sensors, will be of particular relevance for the global land monitoring."
24,sentinel- 3’s innovative altimeter will also allow further advancements for monitoring water levels of rivers and lakes worldwide.
24,1.06.4.2 marine environment monitoring service the copernicus marine environment monitoring service provides regular and systematic reference information on the state of the physical oceans and regional seas to help protect and manage the marine environment and resources more effectively.
24,"the service builds on a series of projects (i.e., myocean and myocean-2, managed by mercator océan) developed within the framework programs 6 and 7 (fp6/fp7), funded by the ec, and on esa’s gse projects such as polarview and marcoast."
24,"the current service, implemented and operated by mercator océan, is delivered in an operational mode since 1st may 2015."
24,"it supports four main domains: l marine safety: with services such as hydrodynamic forecasts and remote sensing blended products on currents, winds, and sea ice help to improve ship routing services, oil spill combat, offshore operations, or search-and-rescue operations. l marine resources: with services such as long time series of in situ and remote sensing products, as well as analysis, reanalysis, and forecasts of hydrodynamic and ecosystem modelsdcontributing to the protection and the sustainable management of living marine resources in particular for aquaculture, ﬁshery research, or regional ﬁshery organizations. l marine and coastal environment: with services as the abovedsupporting environmental applications useful for water quality monitoring and pollution control."
24,"also sea-level rise helps to assess coastal erosion. l seasonal and weather forecasting: with services such as long time series of in situ and remote sensing products (e.g., sea-surface temperature, as shown in fig. 13, salinity, sea level, currents, wind, and sea ice), as well as reanalysis of physical parameters at various temporal resolutions (monthly, seasonal, yearly) and at global and regional scaledplaying a crucial role in the domain of weather, climate, and seasonal forecasting."
24,"currently, copernicus services and projects base almost all their activities on the provision of satellite imagery from contributing missions."
24,"the sentinel satellites are starting to contribute to copernicus, providing substantial beneﬁts for the marine monitoring appli- cations."
24,"in particular, sentinel-3 and sentinel-1 are the two most relevant missions for the marine service."
24,"sentinel-1 provides all-weather day-and-night measurements of sea ice, and sentinel-3 provides global and regular records of sea-surface temperature, currents, sea level, and ocean color."
24,"1.06.4.3 atmosphere monitoring service monitoring, assessing, and forecasting air quality at continental, regional, and local scales are important for the health and well- being of europe’s citizens."
24,"long-term, high-quality global observations of the composition of the atmosphere are also essential for climate monitoring, an example of which is shown in fig. 14, and form the basis for monitoring the long-range transport of pollutants."
24,atmospheric infor- mation is also required to quantify and predict resources of renewable energy that could play a key role in adapting europe’s energy production system for a sustainable future.
24,the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service (cams) aims to provide continuous data and information on atmospheric composition.
24,"the service describes the current state of the atmosphere, forecasts for several days ahead, and analyzes consistently"

25,13 sea-surface temperatures for the atlantic iberian biscay irish ocean region acquired on 28 jun. 2010 (credits: copernicus service information/myocean). data records for past periods.
25,"it supports many applications in a variety of domains, including health, environmental monitoring, renewable energies, meteorology, and climatology."
25,"the service builds on a series of projects developed within the framework programs 6 and 7 (fp6/fp7), funded by the ec, and on esa’s gse project “protocol monitoring for the gmes service element on atmospheric composition” (promote)."
25,it is implemented by the ecmwf and became operational in jul.
25,"it provides daily information on the global atmospheric composition by monitoring and forecasting constituents such as green- house gases (carbon dioxide and methane), reactive gases (e.g., carbon monoxide, oxidized nitrogen compounds, sulfur dioxide), ozone, and aerosols."
25,inventories of the emissions of these gases serve as input to the atmospheric chemistry-transport models and estimate net ﬂuxes of co2 and ch4 at the earth’s surface.
25,knowing emissions and surface ﬂuxes are prerequisite for understanding the composition of the atmosphere and for describing climate forcing.
25,"the service also provides near-real-time analysis and 4-day forecasts, as well as reanalysis, of the european air quality, thus enabling a permanent assessment of the air we breathe."
25,"thanks to daily analysis and forecasts of uv and stratospheric ozone, the service supports public health policies (e.g., skin cancer prevention)."
25,"solar radiation is playing a key role in domains like health, agriculture, and renewable energies."
25,the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service provides public and private organizations involved in solar energy usage with suitable and accurate information on the solar radiation resources at the earth’s surface.
25,"lastly, together with earlier european and non-european missions, sentinel data will help to build up and continuously extend long-term datasets of essential climate variables for climate monitoring, trend analysis, and improved process understanding."
25,"in particular, sentinel-3 will extend and improve envisat and ers-2’s heritage of aerosol particulate matter and ﬁre monitoring."
25,"sentinel-4, sentinel-5, and its precursor sentinel-5p will build on the ers-2, envisat, and metop series of ozone and other trace gas observations and signiﬁcantly improve their observational performances."
25,"for example, sentinel-4, from its geostationary orbit, will have improved temporal resolution."
25,"1.06.4.4 emergency management service earthquakes, tsunamis, wildﬁres, ﬂoods, storms, and industrial accidents can claim human lives and cause serious damage to prop- erty all over the world."
25,"the copernicus emergency management service (ems) aims to reinforce europe’s capacity to respond to emergency situations, be they caused by extreme weather (see fig. 15 for an example of emergency service application map), geophysical hazards such as earthquakes, manmade disasters such as oil spills, and humanitarian crises."
25,it provides all involved actors with geo-spatial

28,"copernicus program 177 information delivered to users in an accurate and timely manner, derived from satellite remote sensing and completed by available in situ or open data sources."
28,ems has been operational since apr. 2012 and is implemented by the ec dg jrc.
28,"it supports all phases of the emergency management cycle: preparedness, prevention, disaster risk reduction, emergency response, and recovery."
28,the service is provided free of charge and can be activated by authorized users such as national civil protection authorities.
28,the service can be provided in: l “rush” mode: for emergency management activities that require immediate response.
28,"this is available on a 24/7 basis, and products are provided as soon as possible (from a few hours to a few days after the user request)."
28,"three types of products are available: – reference maps, which provide a quick updated knowledge on the territory and assets where the emergency situation has occurred."
28,"a reference map is normally based on a preevent image captured as close as possible prior to the event. – delineation maps, which provide an assessment of the event extent (e.g., burnt area map, ﬂooded area map, earthquake impact area map) and of its evolution if requested. – grading maps, which provide an assessment of the damages caused by the disaster (e.g., damaged buildings) and of their evolution if requested."
28,"grading maps include the extent, type, and damage grades speciﬁc to the disaster."
28,"they may also provide relevant and up-to-date information that is speciﬁc to affected population and assets (e.g., settlements, transport networks, industry, and utilities). l “non-rush” mode: to support activities that do not require immediate response, that is, for prevention, preparedness, disaster risk reduction, and recovery phases."
28,"three types of products are available: – reference maps, which provide a comprehensive and updated knowledge of the territory and relevant assets in a disaster risk reduction context. – predisaster situation maps, which provide relevant and up-to-date thematic information (e.g., hazard exposure, vulnerability or resilience, risk status, evacuation plans) that can help planning for contingencies on areas vulnerable to hazards, and minimizing loss of life and damage. – postdisaster situation maps, which provide relevant and up-to-date thematic information for the needs of reconstruction planning and progress monitoring (e.g., postdisaster needs assessment, recovery plans, reconstruction/rehabilitation moni- toring, internally displaced person monitoring, refugee camp monitoring)."
28,these maps may need to be updated frequently.
28,"the service builds on a series of projects developed within the ec framework programs 6 and 7 (fp6/fp7) and on esa’s gse projects such as risk-eos, respond, and terraﬁrma."
28,"the ems service is partly based on the outcomes of the fp7 “services and appli- cations for emergency response” (safer) project and the gmes preparatory action linker, which have been instrumental in devel- oping the interfaces and procedures."
28,"terraﬁrma, in particular, produced terrain deformation services to a very large base of geoscience centers including geological surveys, risk management organizations, and local users for different locations all over europe."
28,the services are based on the use of advanced space-borne sar interferometry techniques along with optical imagery and geological information.
28,the emergency service and projects are based on the provision of satellite imagery from contributing missions that are made available through the space component data access system operated by esa since 2008.
28,"in the future, the service will also be supported by the sentinels."
28,"sentinel-1 sar imagery provides a major contribution for precise terrain deformation monitoring over landslide, seismic, or subsidence areas by providing regular and frequent interfero- metric observations (every 6 days with two spacecraft)."
28,"it can also support impact assessment analyses for many types of hazard including hydrometeorological and geological events by, for instance, providing rapid and wide-extent observations of plain ﬂooding."
28,"also, wide swath sentinel-2 data can support the buildup and frequent update of globally consistent background reference maps to be used for impact assessments."
28,"it will also contribute monitoring land-use change that triggers erosion, forest and wildﬁres, and slow-onset ﬂoods."
28,"sentinel-3, despite its relatively low resolution, can complement activities where systematic monitoring is at stake (e.g., worldwide wildﬁre detection)."
28,"the products generated by the service can be used as supplied (e.g., as digital or printed map outputs)."
28,"they may also be combined with other data sources (e.g., as digital feature sets in a geographic information system) to support geospatial analysis and decision-making processes of emergency managers."
28,the ems mapping service also collaborates with the international charter space and major disasters for major crises outside the eu area.
28,an agreement has been set up to exploit the advanced crisis mapping capability of the ems to support charter requests pertinent to european policy sectors.
28,"1.06.4.5 security service the objective of the copernicus services for security applications is to support the related eu policies in the following priority areas: l border surveillance: with the main aim of contributing to the implementation of eurosur, the european border surveillance system."
28,"in particular, the main objectives are to reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering the eu undetected, to reduce"
29,"178 copernicus program the death toll of illegal immigrants by rescuing more lives at sea, and to increase internal security of the eu as a whole by contributing to the prevention of cross-border crime. l support to eu external action: as a global actor, europe has a responsibility in promoting stable conditions for human and economic development, human rights, democracy, and fundamental freedoms."
29,"in this context, a main objective of the eu is to assist third countries in a situation of crisis or emerging crisis and to prevent global and trans-regional threats having a desta- bilizing effect. l maritime surveillance: with the eu’s overall objective of ensuring the safe use of the sea and to secure europe’s maritime borders."
29,"the corresponding challenges mainly relate to safety of navigation, marine pollution, law enforcement, and overall security."
29,"in the area of maritime surveillance, work is being pursued mainly through research and demonstrator activities."
29,"the service builds on a series of projects developed within the framework programs 6 and 7 (fp6/fp7), funded by the ec, and on esa’s gse projects such as the maritime security service (mariss)."
29,"in the ﬁeld of maritime security, an integrated maritime data environment framework is being developed by the european maritime safety agency (emsa)."
29,the copernicus services for security applications are currently still in a development phase.
29,"at present, the three priority areas are addressed by a series of eu-funded projects."
29,the eu-funded g-mosaic project in 2009–2011 was responsible for the development of the preoperational gmes security service.
29,"it provided the eu with intelligence data that were applied to early warning and crisis prevention, crisis management, and rapid intervention in hot spots around the world for issues such as weapon proliferation, ﬁght for natural resources, and illegal activities."
29,"the mariss service (see fig. 16 for an example of an application of this service) has been taken over by different projects within the eu fp7 that intend to contribute to the transition of security applications from preoperational to copernicus operational mode: l sagres (service activations for growing eurosur success), intended to implement and test the “high time-critical,” intelligence- driven maritime surveillance component of eurosur, along the concept of operation for copernicus support to eurosur. l lobos (low time-critical border surveillance), intended to bridge the gap between the research in earth observation and the operational setup envisaged for copernicus support to eurosur."
29,"the project will develop ﬁve “low time-critical” preopera- tional services in the areas of port monitoring, coastal monitoring, reference mapping and updates, and ambient-change detection. l g-next (gmes preoperational security services for supporting eu external actions) will supply information and intelligence data in support of the european external action service (eeas), including mapping and geo-information products ready for deployment in emergency and crisis situations, and will provide a set of services suitable to be integrated in the users’ working environment in an effective and reliable way. l g-sextant (service provision of geospatial intelligence in eu external actions support) aims at bringing to an operational level an additional portfolio of earth observation products and services to support the geo-spatial information needs of eu external action users and stakeholders."
29,"both radar and optical imaging, from high to vhr contributing missions, are used to support security applications."
29,the sentinels are starting to contribute to copernicus.
29,"in particular, sentinel-1, with its day-and-night and all-weather radar capabilities will be one of fig."

30,"copernicus program 179 the main data sources for maritime surveillance services, while sentinel-2 will support the generation of frequently updated back- ground reference maps."
30,"regarding support to eu external action, discussions have taken place through ad hoc working groups including the eeas: commission services (development and cooperation, european community humanitarian ofﬁce, joint research centre), the european union satellite centre (eusc) now renamed satcen, the esa, and the european defence agency."
30,lessons learned through g-mosaic and the discussions with stakeholders in the working group steered the requirements for preoperational services and additional research activities.
30,1.06.4.6 climate change service the copernicus climate change service aims to respond to environmental and societal challenges associated with climate vari- ability and anthropogenic climate change.
30,"the service will give access to information for monitoring, predicting, and attributing climate change and will help improve adaptation and mitigation policies."
30,"the service will beneﬁt from a network of observations, both from in situ and satellite sensors and modeling capabilities, and reanalysis of the earth climate and modeling scenarios, based on a variety of climate projections."
30,"moreover, the service will provide access to several climate change indicators such as global temperatures, sea level, and ice cover, along with climate impact indices such as those based on records of temperature, precipitation, and droughts."
30,"the service will capitalize on a series of projects developed within the framework programs 6 and 7 (fp6/fp7), funded by the ec, and on esa’s gse projects as well as the esa’s climate change initiative (cci)."
30,"these projects address the following issues: l global 20th-century reanalysis and coupling methods l ensemble system of regional reanalyses l traceable quality assurance system for multidecadal essential climate variables l provision of access to simulated and observed climate datasets and climate indicator toolbox l attribution products in the near future, the service will also be supported by data and products from the sentinel satellites."
30,"all missions will contribute to building comprehensive, long-term datasets of some of the essential climate variables."
30,"an example of climate change application, that is, long time series of mean sea-level data, is shown in fig."

31,"180 copernicus program in particular, sentinel-1 will provide all-weather, day-and-night estimates of soil moisture, wind speed and direction, sea ice, continental ice sheets, and glaciers."
31,"sentinel-2 will contribute with large swath, frequently updated measurements of land cover, snow cover, rivers and lakes, glaciers, and ice caps."
31,"sentinel-3 will provide global, continuous observations of sea- and land-surface temperature, sea level, cloud top heights, and cloud cover."
31,"sentinel-4, -5, and -5p will measure methane, ozone, and other long-lived greenhouse gases as well as aerosols."
31,"sentinel-6 will measure variations of sea level and ocean-surface topography, as well as high-resolution vertical proﬁles of temperature."
31,policy makers will gain a wealth of reliable information to help them better quantify the risks and opportunities linked to climate change and thereby better plan future climate policies supporting improved quality of life for european citizens.
31,the copernicus climate change service is in a development phase and is implemented by the ecmwf.
31,"the ﬁrst stage of implementation is dedicated to the so-called proof of concept, meaning capacity building and testing of the overall architecture."
31,"the operational capacity will be reached during the third year of operations (around 2017), and it will be preceded by a preop- erational stage."
31,the evolution of the copernicus climate change service will be supported at best by the outcomes of a series of projects launched under the 2013 fp7 space call related to climate modeling and observation analyses.
31,"furthermore, a speciﬁc expert group had been set up to assess the need and opportunity for an independent european space-borne co2 observation capacity."
31,"1.06.5 the european space policy and copernicus (http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/space/index_en.htm, “ec dg growth web site”) space was not among the eu’s competences until the lisbon treaty (2007)."
31,"article 189 of the treaty introduced an explicit reference to it, creating a legal framework for the action of the eu in this ﬁeld: “to promote scientiﬁc and technical progress, industrial competi- tiveness and the implementation of its policies, the union shall draw up a european space policy."
31,"to this end, it may promote joint initiatives, support research and technological development and coordinate the efforts needed for the exploration and exploitation of space [.]"
31,the union shall establish any appropriate relations with the european space agency.”
31,"as effective operations in space require cutting-edge technologies, large-scale funding, and multiyear support, the eu has been working with its member states, esa, and its international partners to create a coherent eu space policy and a systematic program for its implementation."
31,"according to this, the relationship between esa and eu was redeﬁned and roles of actors involved in space policy underwent some modiﬁcations."
31,"the main aim of the new eu’s space policy is to use space-related technology to tackle some of the most pressing challenges today, such as ﬁghting climate change, helping to stimulate technological innovation, and providing socioeconomic beneﬁts to citizens."
31,"in detail, the key objectives of the eu’s space strategy are to: l promote technological and scientiﬁc progress l foster innovation and industrial competitiveness l ensure that european citizens fully beneﬁt from european space applications l strengthen europe’s role in space at an international level and the space programs developed to fulﬁl them are the following: l satellite navigation: the galileo and european geostationary navigation overlay service programs which provide positioning, navigation, and timing information worldwide. l earth observation: the copernicus program which provides earth observation data and information. l space research: part of the horizon 2020 program focuses speciﬁcally on space technologies, applications (e.g., gnss and earth observation), weather, sciences, exploration, and other space-related topics."
31,one indication of the important role of space assets from an eu perspective has been the sustained investment in developing copernicus.
31,"the program started with the “baveno manifesto,” in 1998, which was the foundation of the copernicus program (at that time still called gmes), between the ec, on behalf of the eu, esa, and national space agencies."
31,"the esa ministerial council in edinburgh in 2001 provided some ﬁrst funds for services, which were supplemented with other funds from the ec 6th framework program."
31,"the same year, at the gothenburg eu summit in sweden, heads of state and govern- ment requested that “the community contribute to establishing by 2008 a european capacity for global monitoring for environment and security.”"
31,"in 2004, the commission issued a communication (communication from the commission to the european parliament and the council, 2004) called “gmes: establishing a gmes capacity by 2008d(action plan (2004–2008)),” which introduced an action plan to address the gothenburg challenge."
32,copernicus program 181 fig.
32,"18 on 28 oct. 2014, the european commission and esa signed an agreement to manage and implement the copernicus “space component” between 2014 and 2020."
32,"the signature also marked the transfer of ownership of sentinel-1a to the eu, just weeks after the satellite became opera- tional following intense data quality testing and calibration during its commissioning phase."
32,"from left to right: daniel calleja crespo, former director general of the ec’s directorate general enterprise and industry and simon jutz, head of esa’s copernicus space ofﬁce (credits: esa)."
32,"the same year, a framework agreement between the ec and esa was signed providing the basis for cooperation on gmes."
32,"the year after, the ﬁrst signiﬁcant funds for the buildup of the program’s space component were provided at the esa ministerial council in berlin."
32,"in 2005, a commission communication (communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament, 2005) called “gmes: from concept to reality” established gmes, along with galileo, as the european ﬂagship projects."
32,"in 2008, another communication (communication from the commission to the european parliament, the council, the euro- pean economic and social committee and the committee of the regions, 2008) entitled “gmes: we care for a safer planet” estab- lished the basis for ﬁnancing, operational infrastructure, and management of gmes."
32,"the same year, at the esa ministerial council in the hague, the netherlands, major funding for the gmes space component was obtained."
32,"two years later, a proposal for a regulation (regulation (eu) no 911/2010 of the european parliament and of the council, 2010) was issued by the commission on the european earth observation program (gmes), and its initial operations (2011– 2013) aimed to set the legal basis and allocate ec funding for the program."
32,it was submitted to the european parliament and the eu council for decision and approved.
32,"in 2013, a delegated regulation on gmes data access (commission delegated regulation (eu) no 1159/2013, 2013) was issued by the ec."
32,it established “registration and licensing conditions for gmes users and deﬁning criteria for restricting access to gmes dedicated data and gmes service information.”
32,"finally, in 2014, a regulation on copernicus (regulation (eu) no 377/2014 of the european parliament and of the council, 2014) was issued laying down the legal and ﬁnancial basis for the implementation of the operational phase of the copernicus program during the period 2014–2020."
32,"based on this, an agreement on copernicus between the eu and esa was signed at the end of 2014 (see fig. 18) deﬁning the modalities for the cooperation between esa and the eu for the period 2014–2020 and regulating the budget implementation tasks entrusted to esa by the eu for the accomplishment of the space segment and the program operation phase."
32,"in coordinating the evolution of the csc, esa prepared a long-term plan for the content and associated funding needs, covering the operation of the sentinels up to 2020, and the procurement of recurrent sentinel satellites and instruments and access to data available from contributing missions up to 2028."
32,"esa and eu are already closely working on the shaping of the future csc, which will be legally covered possibly by another agreement in the frame of the next (2021–2027) multiannual financial framework of the eu."
32,"1.06.6 the copernicus data and information policy earth observation data are of relevance to economic, security, environmental, and strategic issues."
32,the value assigned to it is driven by the objectives of each mission or program.
32,"a number of international organizations have agreed on policy statements or principles to promote public availability and open exchange of eo data, but even if signiﬁcant, they are not binding."
32,"they include, among others, the data sharing principles for the global earth observation system of systems (geoss) and the united nations principles relating to remote sensing of the earth from space."
32,environmental data are usually provided at low cost or for free to support and foster the implementation of environmental poli- cies.
32,an example is the exchange of free basic meteorological data.
32,"other reasons for free of charge data are linked to industrial policy, for example to develop a thriving value adding services industry which creates business and new cost-effective"
33,"182 copernicus program applications/services using a basic infrastructure, namely satellites and their data, which are provided for free."
33,access restrictions are found in a few national legislations due to security reasons.
33,"the exact conditions and/or the technical characteristics of the data being restricted are triggered ﬁrst by the spatial resolution of the data, then by the geographical area sensed, and lastly by the type of sensor and quality of the data received."
33,"the key element of the data and information policy (copernicus data and information policy) is the free, full, and open access to users of environmental data from the copernicus program, including data from the sentinel satellites."
33,"the objectives of it being to: l promote the use and sharing of copernicus data and information l strengthen earth observation markets in europe, in particular the downstream sector, with a view to enabling growth and job creation l support the european research, technology, and innovation communities in particular, there is no restriction on use or on users, and reproduction and redistribution of the data, with or without adaptation, are allowed."
33,this can be done for commercial or noncommercial use.
33,"furthermore, a free-of-charge version of any dataset is always available worldwide without limitation in time."
33,this will enable that earth observation-based information enters completely new domains of daily life.
33,"as more data are made available, better decisions can be made, more business will be created, and science and research can be achieved through the upcoming ﬂow of sentinel data."
33,this policy applies to: 1.
33,data (and information) generated inside copernicus (sentinel mission data and service information) but it does not apply to: 2.
33,"data (and information) generated outside copernicus (contributing mission data, in situ and reference data and information) in fact, regarding the contributing missions, the data policy of the mission owners will be respected for the purpose of providing data to copernicus service users."
33,"where the copernicus open dissemination affects the security of the member states of the eu, a decision will be taken by the eu in which a balance between the protection of security interests and the social beneﬁts of the open dissemination will be done."
33,"1.06.7 governance of the program copernicus, and previously gmes, has been and is being funded primarily by the eu and by esa member states."
33,the governance of copernicus has largely been aligned according to the main funding streams that are channeled via the ec and esa.
33,"the copernicus program is managed by the ec directorate general growth, which includes internal market, industry, entre- preneurship, and smes."
33,"in addition, the ec leads the services component and the user requirements which are tightly linked to the policy drivers."
33,a simple scheme of the different responsibilities inside copernicus is shown in fig.
33,"the ec has also signed, or is about to sign, agreements with several european operators for implementing the copernicus services: l with jrc for the emergency management service and for the global component of the land monitoring service l with eea for the continental and local components of the land monitoring service l with ecmwf for the atmosphere and climate change services l with mercator océan for the marine monitoring service l with some organizations like the european agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the member states of the eu (frontex), emsa, and satcen for the security services."
33,"within the above ec directorate general, two units deal with the copernicus program: the “copernicus” unit (i2), managing the copernicus space and services components, and the “space data for societal challenges and growth” unit (i3), dealing with the overall uptake and distribution of copernicus data, “big data,” and strategic issues."
33,"the ec copernicus units oversee the implementation of copernicus including the setting of priorities, user involvement, cost, schedule, performance, and procurement."
33,"they also manage relationships with third countries and international organizations, ensuring the coordination of copernicus with activities at national, union, and international levels."
33,"the counterpart at esa is represented by the copernicus space ofﬁce, within the directorate of earth observation programs and located at the esa research institute (esrin) near rome."
33,"it is esa’s focal point for all the copernicus interactions with the commis- sion (i.e., i3 and i2 units and other services) and with the copernicus committee, user forum, and procurement board."
33,"it is also responsible for coordinating esa’s copernicus activities and for liaising with national bodies, industry, and esa delegations."
33,"here follows the description (copernicus space component program management plan, n.d.), role, and responsibilities of the above entities: l copernicus committee: it assists the commission in ensuring the coordination of contributions to copernicus by the different partners (union, member states, and intergovernmental organizations) as well as in coordinating with the private sector, making"

34,"19 copernicus components and competences (credits: esa). the best use of existing capacities, and identifying gaps to be addressed at union level."
34,it also assists the commission in monitoring the coherent implementation of copernicus.
34,the copernicus committee shall meet in speciﬁc conﬁgurations in particular with regard to security aspects (“security board”).
34,"the copernicus committee meets regularly, on a quarterly basis."
34,the commission provides a report on copernicus progress at each meeting.
34,"those reports give a general overview of copernicus status and developments, in particular in terms of risk management, costs, schedule, performance, procurement, and relevant advice provided to the commission."
34,"esa, as an entity entrusted with budget implementation tasks, is entitled to take part as observer (i.e., not taking part in the voting procedure) in the work of the copernicus committee. l copernicus user forum: this working group, with continuous and effective input from users, is set up to assist the copernicus committee with the identiﬁcation of user requirements, veriﬁcation of service compliance, and coordination of public-sector users. l procurement board: it is established to verify that the procurement plans, procurement proposals, contract proposals, and contract change notices submitted by esa conform to the procurement principles derived from the copernicus regulation."
34,"it also is in charge of examining and, where appropriate, approving the procurement proposals, and the authorization of the award of contracts and of modiﬁcations to contracts."
34,"esa is responsible for the programmatic, technical, budgetary, and ﬁnancial content of documents submitted to the procurement board."
34,the esa procurement board contact point is a member of esa’s copernicus space ofﬁce who is responsible for the collection and qc of documents prepared by esa and to be submitted to the procurement board.
34,the day-to-day interaction between the ec copernicus units and the esa copernicus space ofﬁce ensures a proper coordination of all implementation issues and prepares the major decisions within the organizations at director and director general levels as well as with the respective decision bodies of the two organizations.
34,"esa’s main partner in the implementation of the space component is eumetsat, which is in charge of operating sentinel-3 (marine part), sentinel-4, sentinel-5, and sentinel-6 missions and of developing their ground segment."
34,"eumetsat also contributes ﬁnancially, even if at a small extent, to the development of sentinel-6 spacecraft."
34,"in this sense, in order to outline esa and eumetsat roles and responsibilities, as well as the organizational framework to conduct joint activities with regard to csc operations, a joint operations management plan has been mutually agreed by both organizations."
34,the eea was tasked to coordinate the in situ component funded by the eu.
34,"accordingly, copernicus is governed mainly by the policy and decision bodies of the eu and esa, some of which are bodies involving both organizations while others are speciﬁc to each organization’s decision mechanism: 1.06.7.1 eu/esa space council the highest joint eu-esa governance body is the space council which unites the esa council and the eu competitiveness council with representatives at ministerial level from both organizations’ member states."

35,"this was a major political milestone for europe in space, offering ministers representing the 27 european union (eu) and/or european space agency (esa) member states the ﬁrst opportunity to jointly discuss the development of a coherent overall european space program."
35,from left to right: former esa director general jean-jacques dordain and former eu commissioner for enterprise and industry mr günter verheugen.
35,"to mark this ﬁrst esa/eu space council, esa presented the european union with this ﬂag, which was ﬂown aboard the international space station during the delta soyuz mission in apr. 2004 (credits: esa). states, including cooperating states, to gather together to discuss the development of a coherent overall european space program, leading to the issuing of joint orientations and resolutions regarding space."
35,the ﬁrst one was held in 2004 (see fig.
35,"several recommendations have been formulated at this level concerning gmes/copernicus, which are expressed, for example, in the resolution (7th space council resolution, 2010) adopted at the 7th space council (“global challenges: taking full beneﬁt of european space systems”), held in nov. 2010, where ministers emphasized the need and the urgency to start the deployment of the, at that time, gmes space infrastructure and services, and to ensure that they were available to users in a timely manner."
35,"1.06.7.2 the eu–esa agreements on the gmes/csc esa, the second major funding source, has been requested to lead the space component, where the majority of gmes/copernicus funds are allocated today."
35,the gmes/csc program is an esa optional program subscribed by its member states and complemented by a signiﬁcant ﬁnan- cial contribution of the ec.
35,"historically the development phase of the space component program activities has been carried out in two different segments (called segment-1 and segment-2), spanning the periods 2006–2013 and 2009–2017, respectively."
35,"segment-1, in turn, was set out in two phases, phase-1 (2006–2009) and phase-2 (2007–2013)."
35,"the ec contribution for this development phase was governed through a gmes delegation agreement, under which the ec contribution was spent according to esa rules and procedures with speciﬁc provisions to take account of the eu 7th framework program (fp7) budget rules."
35,"in simpliﬁed terms, the procurement of space infrastructure was managed by esa, but for those items that were funded via ec budgets, all fp7 participants were invited to submit bids."
35,no geo-return targets were applicable in these cases.
35,the gmes delegation agreement was signed in feb. 2008 and amended in jan. 2009 to regulate the contributions to the early phases of the space component development.
35,"ec contributed to segment 1, under the gmes agreement and the data access grant, with a 35% of the total costs, the remain- ing 65% being funded by esa member states."
35,"at esa’s ministerial conference in 2008, both segment-1 and segment-2 were merged."
35,"in this merged framework, funds were allocated for the development and launch of sentinel-1a, sentinel-2a, and sentinel-3a missions, for the ground segment developments, for the development of sentinel-1b, sentinel-2b, and sentinel-3b (up to the factory acceptance review), for the development of sentinel-4 (both a and b units), for the implementation of the sentinel-5 precursor mission (up to the in-orbit validation), for some preparatory work on sentinel-5, for study activities on sentinel-6/ jason-cs, and for some space component evolution studies."
35,"to complement these activities, esa proposed the segment-3 of the space component (csc-3) as an esa optional program (i.e., funded by esa only)."
35,"the content of csc-3, going from 2013 to 2020 and partly overlapping in time with the merged segments-1 and -2, entails the full development of sentinel-6/jason-cs a and sentinel-5a."
35,"furthermore, it includes activities to adapt access to (and distribution"
36,"copernicus program 185 of) sentinel-1, -2, -3, and 5-precursor data, to support access to sentinel data for national use, and to provide program coordination and study activities for the period 2014–2020."
36,"the transitional period from the former development to the operational phase of the space component was ensured in ﬁnancial terms with funds from the ec gio delegated regulation (2011–2013) and from the space theme of the eu’s seventh framework program for research actions, covering the initial operation of the a series of sentinel satellites and part of the costs for the launch of the b series."
36,"finally, in oct. 2014, the eu–esa copernicus agreement was signed, establishing the tasks entrusted by the eu to esa relating to the copernicus program and the rules applicable to their implementation during the operational phase spanning the time period from 2014 to 2020."
36,"in this phase, and with eu-only funding the follow-on satellites and instruments are being procured, including the launch and operations of the sentinels (1–5) and the operations of the sentinel-6/jason-css missions."
36,"in particular, annex i of this agreement speciﬁes the tasks relating to the implementation of the elements of the csc under esa’s development and operational responsibility."
36,1.06.7.3 esa council and subordinate bodies the council is esa’s governing body and provides the basic policy guidelines within which esa develops the european space program.
36,each member state is represented on the council and has one vote.
36,esa is headed by a director general who is elected by the council every 4 years.
36,"in particular, decisions related to the implementation of the csc program are made through other esa decision bodies, most notably the program board for earth observation (pb-eo) and through the esa council only for higher level decisions."
36,"other hori- zontal bodies are involved, in particular the industrial policy committee for procurement issues and the administrative and finance committee."
36,the latest esa space council at ministerial level (see fig. 21) was held in switzerland in 2016.
36,"ministers in charge for space matters from esa’s 22 member states plus slovenia and canada allocated v10.3 billion for space activities and programs, from which v1.37 billion were devoted to earth observation."
36,the high level of subscriptions demonstrated that esa’s member states consider space as a strategic and attractive investment with a particularly high socioeconomic value.
36,the next council is to be called in late 2019 and will be held in spain.
36,1.06.7.4 eu fp7 program committee the ec contribution to the esa gmes space component program was ﬁrst provided through the “space” budget line within the eu framework program (fp7).
36,a corresponding fp7 space program committee was responsible for budgetary decisions including the approval of the ec-esa gmes agreement and its amendments as well as the release of annual installments according to the agree- ment.
36,it also assessed the regular reports provided by esa in order to support decisions related to the release of the annual budgets.
36,"at a lesser extent, the eumetsat council is also involved concerning the sentinel-6 budget approval and implementation as this is the only sentinel satellite partially funded by this international organization."
36,"21 esa council at ministerial level, in lucerne, switzerland on 1–2 dec."

37,these activities will also serve to provide dynamic interactions with the upstream (research and development) and downstream user communities.
37,"the copernicus market uptake aims at developing a downstream sector of space technology markets (i.e., new applications and services) related to the use of copernicus data."
37,"1.06.8.1 copernicus users’ uptake to reach the above goals, an integrated strategy to reinforce copernicus data awareness and knowledge among public authorities, stakeholders, and civil society is being designed."
37,"this strategy is based on three pillars (copernicus user & market uptake, n.d.): data dissemination/midstream, downstream sector/intermediate users, and end users (public and private)."
37,1.06.8.1.1 data dissemination data dissemination has the objective of ensuring easy access and use of copernicus data and services.
37,copernicus will be affected by a growing volume of data and information.
37,"there is no deﬁnitive answer to the many challenges the deluge of available data will pose, but there are gradual solutions for copernicus in view of the progressive expansion of the space infrastructure and the thematic services."
37,the ec and esa are jointly working on these solutions.
37,"the ﬁrst ﬁve satellites (sentinel-1 a, sentinel-1 b, sentinel-2 a, sentinel-2 b, and sentinel-3 a) have already been launched."
37,a few more sentinel satellites and some additional sentinel instruments onboard european meteorological satellites will be launched in the following years.
37,"this will produce at least 8 tb of data per day, an amount of data that exceeds considerably the data that can be processed, stored, and analyzed using traditional relational databases."
37,"to cope with this, a robust data dissemination infrastructure needs to be developed, including in particular the development of the big data paradigm in the copernicus data dissemination architecture."
37,"this means that an underlying framework is required to support growing requirements (e.g., new products in the copernicus services, platform interoperability, hosted processing, cloud computing)."
37,"copernicus data must ﬁrst be captured, and then organized and integrated."
37,"there are myriads of individual technol- ogies and libraries which provide an overall analytics framework (e.g., hadoop, mapreduce, parallel processing, distributed ﬁle systems) needed to process the required massive amounts of data in an efﬁcient, cost-effective, and timely fashion."
37,the physical data dissemination infrastructure has to be based on a distributed computing model.
37,"this means that data may be physically stored in many different locations and can be linked together through networks, use of a distributed ﬁle system, and various big data analytic tools and applications."
37,"the ec, jointly with esa, is working on a step-by-step evolution of the current copernicus ground segment and data dissemi- nation system in order to incorporate some of the above data management technologies."
37,1.06.8.1.2 downstream sector/intermediate users the objective of this second pillar is to foster innovative business models in the earth observation downstream sector.
37,"to reach this goal, new applications and start-ups will be supported at all stages of their development."
37,"as an example, the coper- nicus master competitions, partnered by esa and the ec among others, have been organized since 2011 to encourage european researchers and entrepreneurs to develop market-focused applications from data gathered through the copernicus initiative."
37,prizes are awarded to the best innovative solutions presented.
37,"also, the space app camps organized by esa since 2013 have contributed to the development of computer applications using earth observation data and leading to societal beneﬁts."
37,"lastly, the business incubators are designed to bridge the gap between an idea and an actual business concerning copernicus by helping a technology transfer project get off the ground and assisting its development into a viable business."
37,1.06.8.1.3 end users (public and private) the goal of this third pillar of the users’ uptake strategy is to increase awareness and facilitate use of copernicus-based products by public and private and users.
37,"to do this, several actions are envisaged: l increase uptake from eu institutions l develop technical assistance and awareness activities with the copernicus-entrusted entities (e.g., services operators) l create the copernicus relays to help european regions provide technical assistance and increase awareness l support member states in their user uptake initiatives l develop (by the commission and its contractors) background material and awareness to improve the interface between the services and ﬁnal user systems and applications l develop the cross-sectoral dimension with initiatives for speciﬁc sectors (e.g., oil and gas, agriculture, raw materials)"
38,"copernicus program 187 1.06.8.2 copernicus market uptake (space market uptake in europe, 2016) the downstream segment of the space economy value chain is made of companies that provide commercial services, products, and applications to ﬁnal consumers."
38,"these companies are generally not connected to the traditional space industry, but their business depends on the provision of satellite data for the generation of “geospatial services” (see fig."
38,"these services can be divided into ﬁve main areas: l natural resource management: environmental monitoring (e.g., climate change impact assessments in productivity and yields, crop health), agriculture (e.g., crop yield foresee, crop classiﬁcation, crop health), forestry (e.g., deforestation/degradation maps, illicit logging), energy (e.g., gravity ﬁeld map for oil and gas exploration, surface monitoring), water (e.g., algal blooms, water quality management) l defense and security: homeland security (e.g., sea border monitoring, high-risk area precision mapping), humanitarian (e.g., humanitarian movement and camp monitoring), disaster management (e.g., large wave forecast, volcanic activity monitoring) l land monitoring: land use/land cover (e.g., assessment, monitoring and reporting of the distribution of the major land cover classes, land suitability evaluation, land accounting), cartography (e.g., geological mapping), consumer services l oceanography: transport (e.g., ice-free passages for shipping monitoring), coastal zones (e.g., water depth mapping, ocean-level and surface monitoring) l meteorology: weather forecast the level of maturity of the different segments under these areas varies greatly, from public service meteorological applications (the highest) to consumer services (the lowest)."
38,"it is a fact that governments remain the most important customers of the civilian remote sensing satellite industry, but commer- cial uses are forecasted to increase."
38,"in the commercial market, the following ﬁve sectors are supposed to be the ones with the highest market development potential: agriculture, nonlife insurance, oil and gas, water transport, and electricity generation from renewable energy."
38,"concerning copernicus, the availability of new data from copernicus satellites is expected to bring a reshape of the future market for eo services."
38,"the downstream service is also changing quickly thanks to the availability of new technologies for rapid data pro- cessing, analysis, and dissemination."
38,"copernicus climate change and atmosphere monitoring services are perceived to be dominated by the public sector, while land monitoring is the service that raises more interest among private european businesses."
38,"as an example, the european obsairve project (http://www.obsairve.eu/content/about, obsairve project web site) provides near-real-time information on air pollution in europe using data from copernicus."
38,the main outcome of this project is the development of a sustainable air quality mobile service application.
38,"further, in order to ensure long-term success of the project, the consortium analyzes alternative ways to integrate the service into third-party applications like weather data or health systems."
38,"in conclusion, the space economy is a source of considerable growth potential."
38,"in europe, huge investments and effort were made over the last 10 years to build a common space infrastructure."
38,a return on the investment for the eu space programs is fig.
38,22 copernicus provides geo-information services to eu policy makers and provides a strong opportunity as market driver for eo-based services.
38,it can only be realized through full involvement of the private sector (credits: esa).
39,188 copernicus program possible only if substantial socioeconomic beneﬁts are achieved through the development of businesses in the downstream sector.
39,"so far, the performance of the european space downstream sector has fallen short of expectations, as compared to other space-faring nations."
39,the reasons for this are manifold: l late start of the european space policy (with respect to its main competitors): the copernicus program will be fully operational with all sentinels in orbit around 2020. l not sufﬁcient concern for users downstream of the space value chain and for investments on the distribution of data for nonscientiﬁc users: the european approach has long been biased towards the upstream sector (the deployment of satellites) to serve the interest of the scientiﬁc community. l slow european reaction time to new business models based on the rapid and massive release of already processed space data to inexperienced users. l fragmentation of the european market with the persistence of a business environment that does not always lead to the development of start-ups (lower venture capital ready to be invested in risky projects) as compared to the united states. l less widespread use of industry–science partnerships. l weak demand from public and private users: european companies in the downstream space market are generally small and domestically oriented. l lack of an integrated and coherent space industrial policy addressing all industries along the space value chain.
39,"also, the public sector, which is the main customer of space data and satellite-based services, will play a crucial role in spreading the use of satellite data in europe, but it is not sufﬁcient to drive a demand for commercial applications and services."
39,"as long as citizens’ awareness about the potential use of space data remains low, demand for mass market applications will remain limited."
39,"for all these reasons, ensuring the market uptake of space data is today a political priority."
39,"on the supply side, the priority is to make data easily accessible to users through a comprehensive and coherent data access policy and an efﬁcient distribution system."
39,the evolution of the esa copernicus sentinels ground segment and the roadmap of the copernicus integrated ground segment task force created by the ec go in this direction.
39,it is equally important to stimulate the supply of innovative applications.
39,"for this, the combined role of research and devel- opment and support to business development programs (e.g., incubation measures, promotion of venture capital) are decisive."
39,"establishing a connection between the wealth of research generated through horizon 2020, and the companies that could use these researches to develop commercial products, should be encouraged as much as possible."
39,"in this respect, an appropriate dissemina- tion strategy for the space-related research outcomes of horizon 2020 could be envisaged to reach out to the business community."
39,"in general, supporting closer collaboration between universities and private companies for developing applications and services is recommended."
39,"on the demand side, it is necessary to stimulate or strengthen both the demand by public administrations, which currently dominate the market, and that of the private sector."
39,"strong demand drivers for public services are expected to be the recent desta- bilization of the neighboring mediterranean area, and the increased occurrence of natural disasters due to climate change."
39,"in this respect, the use of satellite data and services should be encouraged within public administrations to ensure a more effective response to citizens’ security, safety, and defense concerns."
39,"1.06.9 an operational program for the future (copernicus space component evolution plan, n.d.)"
39,copernicus is a user-driven program.
39,"the ec ensures that service speciﬁcations match user needs throughout appropriate mecha- nisms, as well as coordination with public sector users in member states, third countries, and international organizations."
39,"the csc, which delivers most of the data needed for the operational services, is based on the following objectives: l continuity of operational observations beyond 2020 (ideally at least 15–20 years from today), which drives the nature of the observations and the type of missions l frequency of observations, which drives the number of simultaneous spacecraft in orbit for each class of observations l evolution of the space component based on user needs, which accounts for the demand for new services and products the dedicated copernicus satellites (the sentinel families) have been designed to fulﬁll the above needs."
39,"in fact, the requirement on satellite revisit frequency are fulﬁlled with two units (a and b) of the same spacecraft in orbit simultaneously."
39,this applies to all six sentinel families.
39,"the requirement on data continuity is ensured with additional c and d units of the same satellites (ready to be launched in the period 2021–2024), which will replace the a and b ones after the end of lifetime of the latter, ensuring both enhanced data conti- nuity and fulﬁllment of emerging services until at least 2030."
39,this is illustrated in fig.
39,"data continuity will remain an objective for copernicus, but it will not justify per se a follow-on program."
39,"in fact, preserving the same data streams for speciﬁc applications will not lead to major changes of mission requirements, as it would leave limited room for research and development in space technology."
40,copernicus program 189 fig.
40,23 deployment of sentinel constellation (credits: esa).
41,"190 copernicus program the foreseen evolution of copernicus is more ambitious and oriented to a larger set of activities, e.g., enhancing the sustain- ability of eo in europe and widening the spectrum of observations also in the light of technology advances."
41,"in particular, the policy context for the eu has been undergoing signiﬁcant changes and has introduced new priorities and chal- lenges for the eu policies since the initial deﬁnition of the copernicus program."
41,"among those are climate change and pressure on natural resources, as well as the migration issue and a better management of the eu external borders, energy resources, and global security issues that an interconnected world demands."
41,copernicus has to respond to the evolution of eu policy priorities by adapt- ing and possibly expanding the copernicus observation infrastructure while guaranteeing the necessary continuity of observations and services.
41,"as explained above, the need to develop the next generation replacing the ﬁrst six sentinel families will likely arise not before 2030, as there is a good chance that the a and b units of the current sentinels and their follow-on c and d units can each operate longer than their nominal lifetime of 7 years."
41,"therefore, they will provide ﬂexibility for shifting resources originally foreseen for the next generation towards the deﬁnition of new missions (sentinel evolution), addressing important gaps in the current copernicus range of observations caused by emerging european policy priorities."
41,"the commission and esa are currently working on deﬁning a roadmap for this evolution process, which will implement the required transition from research and development to operations of these new missions."
41,"1.06.10 conclusions and perspectives: a revolution for earth observation copernicus, the ec’s ﬂagship earth observation program, is now well and truly powering ahead as its comprehensive integrated system of sentinel satellites grows."
41,"five sentinel satellites are already in orbit to monitor the health of our planet: the two spacecraft of the sentinel-1 all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services, the two spacecraft of the sentinel-2 multispectral high-resolution imaging mission for land monitoring, and the ﬁrst spacecraft of the sentinel-3 multi-instrument mission to measure sea-surface topography, sea- and land-surface temperature, and ocean/land color."
41,"the remaining families, and their recurrent units, will join in the following years and will cover all environmental domains: sentinel-4, sentinel-5 precursor, and sentinel-5 will be aimed at monitoring the air quality, stratospheric ozone, and solar radiation at high temporal and spatial resolution, while sentinel-6 will provide high-precision ocean altimetry measurements."
41,the silhouettes of the different sentinel families are depicted in fig.
41,"they will be complemented by tens of contributing missions, owned by other space agencies or organizations but still making some data available to the program."
41,"all this deluge of data is a revolution in earth observation, offering a range of operational and sustained environmental services to beneﬁt european policy makers and citizens alike."
41,"it provides governments and industry with tools and information that can help them make better, evidence-based decisions."
41,copernicus data make accessible all those products and information for free and open to all users.
41,this will stimulate demand for data.
41,"and as more data are made available, more downstream business will be created to address the expanding market."

42,"copernicus program 191 with the current generation of the space component, the provision of environmental information on the state of our planet will be guaranteed until at least 2035."
42,"in the meantime, new priorities have been introduced in the eu policies arising from recent events in europe and new societal needs (e.g., migration issue, better management of eu external borders, natural resource handling, and climate change among others)."
42,and additional user needs have arisen concerning the copernicus data management.
42,"this is leading to a gradual evolution of the program, in particular on the space and ground segments of the space component."
42,"on the space segment, it entails the implementation of new dedicated satellite missions to cover new priorities on some environmental or civil security areas."
42,"on ground, new applications and technologies to cope with the huge amount of data are to be downloaded, pro- cessed, and analyzed."
42,"this consists of the implementation of a distributed pickup point infrastructure, instead of a centralized one, but also a capacity for hosted processing, the use of big data analytic tools, etc. in order to satisfy growing user demands."
42,"all this will mark the start of a new era and will put copernicus, and in particular the sentinel missions, at the forefront in the earth observation landscape worldwide."
