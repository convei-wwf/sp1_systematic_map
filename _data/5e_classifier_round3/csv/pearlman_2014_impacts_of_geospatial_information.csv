1,pearlman geospatial information contributes to decisions by both societal decision-makers and individuals.
1,"investments in geospatial data have become a part of the political and policy debates that are focused on reducing government spending, as well as increasing societal wellbeing."
1,"although many examples in our everyday life come to mind, good benchmarks of the value of geospatial information are missing."
1,"quantifying this value involves comparisons of the decisions that would have been made with and without the information, and what the consequences of those deci- sions would have been."
1,the value of information (voi) is linked to the outcome of choice in uncertain situations.
1,"individuals may be willing to pay for improved infor- mation depending on how uncertain they are, what is at stake, and the degree to which the benefit exceeds the cost of the information (macauley 2006)."
1,"problems with data access, content interpretation (due to obscure file formats, for example) or use of the data all reduce the information value."
1,systematic analysis of the benefits of geospatial information in decisions focuses on the quantitative demonstration of why and how scientific data such as earth observations have economic value.
1,case studies apply the science and technology of geospatial data to inform decisions concerning the costs and benefits of economic and resource development.
1,two cases studies are provided which show net economic value but different approaches f.

2,"further steps in refining communication skills, providing a broad acceptance of approaches and a pool of experts to support community needs is envisioned in addressing paths forward."
2,"the idea that information has socioeconomic value in both a statistical and a pragmatic sense dates back at least to the 1950s (personal communication, macauley 2012)."
2,"in recent years, interest in the socioeconomic value of information has taken center stage."
2,"investments in geospatial data have become a part of the political and policy debates that are focused on reducing government spending, as well as increas- ing societal wellbeing."
2,a recent example is that of the east coast storm sandy.
2,the information regarding sandy’s landfall (spinrad 2012) (fig.
2,"10.1), and associated decision to close the new york subways, may have minimized damage to new york’s infrastructure as well as saving many lives (personal communication, spinrad 2012)."
2,"although many examples in our everyday life come to mind, good bench- marks of the value of geospatial information are missing (macauley and shih 2010)."
2,thus there is a need and call for more case studies.
2,"these studies should cover a wide range of topics, methods of analysis, and places where they are undertaken."
2,the case studies should be replicable and a compendium of them be assembled for distribution as guidelines and references for implementation in support of geospa- tial information initiatives (pearlman and bernknopf 2012).
3,10 impacts of geospatial information for decision making 139 the objective of analysis is to reduce the uncertainty in economic decisions and to attribute an economic value of the reduction in uncertainty due to the use of ­geospatial data in applications.
3,geospatial data and information is valuable when it allows individuals and firms to improve their decision-making.
3,"by making such adjustments, efficiency of resource use is improved, profits are increased, and con- sumer wellbeing is enhanced (nelson et al."
3,2006).
3,the approach is to follow accepted analytical principles of benefit – cost analysis (bca).
3,the first step is to establish the decision framework.
3,it represents the marketplace for those who invest in information collection (supply) to better understand the needs of those who use the information (demand).
3,"decision makers face the burden of justifying investment in geospatial data that, in many cases, requires the analysis of the economic benefits of that data."
3,"because socioeconomic benefit information is not normally traded in markets, quantifying its value involves comparisons of the decisions that would have been made with and without the information, and what the consequences of those deci- sions would have been."
3,quantifying the gross value of improved information means subtracting the expected value of actions without the benefit of the information from the value of actions with the information (nelson et al.
3,2006).
3,"quantifying the net value of new information entails subtracting the costs of providing the information from the gross value.1 in this paper, after discussing the technical approaches, two case studies summarize applications of geospatial data that evaluated specific ­societal issues and problems that are based on bca."
3,"10.1  ocioeconomic benefits of earth s observation – a short history as indicated above, quantifying the socioeconomic impacts from improved envi- ronmental information has been under consideration for a number of years."
3,"environment is used here as a term that broadly encompasses areas such as food, water, and energy security, or disaster relief (group on earth observation n.d.) when addressing societal benefits."
3,"impacts need to be addressed at multiple scales (i.e., local, regional, and global levels)."
3,"information includes that captured via remote and in-situ sensing, geographic information, and related systems (gis), and spatial data infrastructures."
3,"the need for understanding environmental dynamics has become more urgent given the recognized issues of climate change, sustainable food sources, and increased need for energy (borzachiello and craglia 2011)."
3,scientists are often being called upon to provide scientific information to support decision-makers.
3,"as recently as january 26, 2013, bill gates wrote about the ­importance of measurements in achieving the millennium development goals (http://mdgs.un.org), and providing examples in public health (gates 2013)."
3,"1 this approach to valuing information has broad theoretical underpinnings in the literature on bayesian decision making (bradford and kelejian 1977, 1978)."

4,"in order to make environmental information as useful as possible, it must be pro- vided in a way that is societally relevant, targeted to the needs of the user, and understandable by the broadest constituency."
4,"drawing in social scientists, economists and the public health community, for example, to work with scientists and engineers is necessary for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to the grand challenges of humanity."
4,"the international council for science (icsu), in a recent study, identifies these grand challenges for the global scientific community in moving toward sustainable solutions (icsu 2010): • developing the observation systems needed to manage global and regional envi- ronmental change; • improving the usefulness of forecasts of future environmental conditions and their consequences for people; • recognizing key thresholds or non-linear changes to improve our ability to anticipate, recognize, avoid and adapt to abrupt global environmental change; • determining what institutional, economic, and behavioral responses can enable effective steps toward global sustainability; and • encouraging innovation (coupled with sound mechanisms for evaluation) in devel- oping technological, policy, and social responses to achieve global sustainability."
4,"in addition, there is greater attention to performance of government programs and the societal benefits and impacts of public investments."
4,"pure science is no lon- ger an adequate justification for large, expensive observing systems, such as earth observing satellites."
4,"similarly, gis requires significant resources to be built and maintained."
4,"there are needs for applications and tangible, identifiable near-term uses to help justify the observing and information systems across sectors and stake- holders."
4,"there is a need to discover and demonstrate innovative and practical uses that support policy, business, and management decisions of public and private orga- nizations."
4,"while there have been successful examples of applications, efforts to sub- stantiate the benefits of the examples could be strengthened, particularly for quantitative determination of value and impacts."
4,"10.2 value of information as indicated at the beginning of this chapter, voi studies have a long history, in north america, europe, and other countries such as australia, where government agencies have active groups looking at the impacts and benefits of their primary missions."
4,a number of examples are given below.
4,understanding how to improve decision-making and how to increase the impacts of earth observations has been a continuing theme at nasa.
4,"for example, nasa earth science applications, supported by the applied sciences program of the nasa earth science division (http://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/), focus on agricul- ture, air quality, climate, disasters, ecological forecasting, public health, water resources, and weather and has implemented initial steps for evaluating the benefits and impacts of their projects."
5,"10 impacts of geospatial information for decision making 141 the us geological survey (usgs) provides geophysical, geological, hydrological and biological sciences, geography, and remote sensing geospatial and archival data."
5,"these data are interpreted as high resolution, comprehensive maps and other forms of data and information that can be used to address land use, contamination and other local and regional needs (bristol et al."
5,2012).
5,usgs delivers all of the data and scientific information as public goods that are supplied to all customers for the cost of reproduction such as the national map (halsing et al.
5,2004).
5,several other north american government and private organizations have spon- sored and participated in studies of the voi and associated socioeconomic impacts.
5,"the geospatial information and technology association (gita), the american water works association research foundation, the us federal geographic data committee (fgdc), and geoconnections canada began collaborative work in 2004 to develop return on investment (roi) methodology for financial analysis of geospatial projects (ancel et al."
5,2006).
5,"the methodology was further refined to include multi-agency financial analysis (ancel et al. 2007) and to develop case study examples (stewart 2008, 2010a, b, 2011a, b, c)."
5,these activities are further detailed in the case studies section of this chapter.
5,"in europe a major impetus towards the assessment of spatial data infrastructures (sdi) has come with the development and adoption of the infrastructure for spatial information in the european community (inspire) directive in 2007, a european legal framework requiring all 27 member states of the european union to establish and maintain sdis for their jurisdictions, and make them interoperable through the detailed technical specifications developed under the guidance of inspire and its working groups."
5,a study on the expected economic impact of inspire was carried out in 2003–2004 prior to the adoption of the directive (craglia et al.
5,2003).
5,"a cost-­ benefit analysis was also performed on the global monitoring for the environment and security (gmes), a european system with a space component (the sentinel satellites), and a ground application component (sawyer and de vries 2012)."
5,"the european commission has more recently funded multiple projects to assess impacts and benefits including the “global earth observation – benefit estimation: now, next and emerging” (geobene 2006–2009; http://www.geo-ene.eu) and the eurogeoss (2009–2012)."
5,10.3 multidisciplinary workshops the above activities recognize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to impacts analyses and decision support.
5,"drawing in social scientists, and economists to work with scientists and engineers is necessary for comprehensive and sustain- able solutions."
5,"cross-disciplinary exchanges have been facilitated through a series of workshops since 2010, providing a foundation for an emerging community of practice."

6,"washington, dc, june 28–29, 2010."
6,this nasa sponsored workshop focused on “the value of information – methodological frontiers and new applications for realizing social benefit.”
6,"in respect to defining value, the participants agreed that value denotes a quantita- tive measure, preferably expressed in monetary terms, although not universally required."
6,"the advantage of having a quantitative measure is to provide a reference system to facilitate comparison, and therefore the choice, of alternative projects for decision makers."
6,"when it is not feasible to express a value in monetary terms, this can be given in the form of other measures, like number of lives saved, or improve- ment in the quality of the environment."
6,"the event was an opportunity to advance a common vocabulary across social and earth science, forming the basis for a new community of practice."
6,"the recommenda- tions of the workshop emphasized, “as immediate next steps, enhanced opportunities for convening economists and other social scientists, physical scientists, and pro- gram mangers from the nation’s science agencies would better enable the design and evaluation of value-of-information studies.”"

6,"the “geovalue” workshop was held at hafencity university in hamburg on 30th september–2nd october 2010, and was organised with the support of hafencity university, the association for geographic information laboratories in europe, the ec-jrc, and the university of laval, canada."
6,"the workshop focused on the value of geo-information, the assessment of spatial data infrastructures, the socio-economic aspects of geo-information, and quantitative methods and models for impact assessment (workshop held in hamburg, germany 2010, presentations and proceedings are available at http://digimap. hcu-hamburg.de/geovalue/)."
6,the workshop addressed a variety of users and contexts of earth information.
6,"outcomes called for more in-depth research on the role of information and related products in real life situations, a much more transparent articulation of the assump- tions made so that they can be verified over time, and a greater sharing of experi- ences in different settings among different communities."
6,"ispra, italy – 2011."
6,"a workshop on the socio-economic benefits of geo/geoss was hosted on july 11–13 at the ec-jrc in ispra, italy."
6,"the workshop was spon- sored by ec-jrc, ieee, the international institute for applied systems analysis (iiasa) and nasa."
6,the purpose of the workshop was to identify a program of activities to undertake during 2011–2014 to support the geo 10-year implementa- tion plan (www.earthobservations.org/documents) and the assessment of the bene- fits that can and will be achieved.
6,"such program of activities could include the consolidation of dispersed bodies of literature relevant to the assessment of impacts and benefits of geographic information/earth observation, the evaluation of different methodologies appropriate to undertake such assessments, the gathering of evidence of impacts/benefits in different user communities and societal benefits areas, and outreach activities to develop shared understanding across disciplinary boundaries on value and methods of assessment."
6,this workshop developed and recommended a 4-year plan for quantifying socio- economic benefits of environmental observations.
6,this encompassed both near term

7,"in the near term, the objectives are to bring together information and processes from the active, but fragmented, international efforts for assessing the value of information (borzachiello and craglia 2011; socioeconomic benefits from the use of earth-observation workshop – summary proceedings 2011)."
7,the workshop called this “building a foundation.”
7,in the longer term – over the next few years – the greatest needs are the creation of consistent and accepted meth- odologies for quantifying benefits.
7,there must also be case studies to test and vali- date the methodologies.
7,these must cover broad domains so that the formulation is not application specific.
7,"boulder, co, usa – 2012."
7,"the 3-day workshop titled “socioeconomic benefits of geospatial information/geoss 2012” was held in boulder, colorado, june 12–14, 2012."
7,it provided a forum for advances on the evolution of methodologies and ­presentations of relevant case studies.
7,"the workshop was sponsored by ieee in col- laboration with nasa, national center for atmospheric research (ncar), ec-jrc, geoconnection and the group on earth observation (geo)."
7,"tutorials for non-experts were given on the approaches for assessing the value of information, the terminology of benefits assessments and examples of successful analyses."
7,these examples included both cost effectiveness and benefit–cost analysis.
7,"the workshop included presentations and discussions of benefit assessments in north america, and provided a forum focusing on international developments."
7,"experts in a wide range of natural science, social sciences, and communications, as well as decision-­ makers supported the meeting; over 80 participants attended (see fig."

8,"as indicated in the summary proceedings (pearlman and bernknopf 2012), an outcome of the workshop is to pursue the development of a community of practice (cop) or society that encompasses a wide range of scientific, social, management, and communication disciplines."
8,"the cop would emphasize tasks, which foster collaboration across specialties and help build trust across social and science ­ aspects."
8,other activities identified include an annual conference or workshop for sharing information and networking.
8,10.4 technical approaches systematic analysis of the benefits of geospatial information in decisions focuses on the quantitative demonstration of why and how scientific data such as earth observa- tions has economic value.
8,bca of geospatial information in practical applications has its theoretical foundation in welfare economics.
8,a bca can be accomplished by implementing the process suggested below (boardman et al.
8,"1996): • decide whose benefits b and costs c count and select alternative geospatial information structures ω(i), i = 1, …, i."
8,• catalogue potential impacts and select measurement indicators.
8,"• predict quantitative impacts over the lifetime t, t = 1, …, t of the project."
8,• monetize all impacts at a discount rate r for time period t to estimate the net present value of the benefits of the project npvbω(i).
8,• sum the benefits and costs and perform sensitivity analysis.
8,• recommend the alternative with the largest net benefits.
8,following this approach the relationship in eq.
8,10.1 is used to estimate the net present value of geospatial information: t bω (i )t - cit npvbω (i ) = ∑ (10.1) (1+ r ) t t=0 quantification of the net value of improved information means subtracting the expected value of actions without the benefit of the information from the value of actions with the information.
8,the net value of the new information structure voiω(1) is the difference between the socioeconomic benefits with and without the geospa- tial information.
8,voiω (1) = npvbω (1) − npvbω ( 0 ) (10.2) case studies apply the science and technology of geospatial data to inform d­ ecisions concerning the costs and benefits of economic and resource development.
8,bca are used to evaluate the value of geospatial information in a variety of ways.
8,examples of the economic impact of geospatial information have been expressed in
9,"10 impacts of geospatial information for decision making 145 terms of dollar savings (cost effectiveness; stewart 2008, 2009, 2010a, b, 2011a, b, c, 2012); economic welfare improvements that reduce decision uncertainty via ­technological change (benefit estimation and industry studies; bernknopf et al. 1997, 2007), and macroeconomic scenarios (halsing et al."
9,2004; craglia et al.
9,2003; macauley and shih 2010).
9,"10.5 case study examples 10.5.1 case study 1, benefits of monitoring land use moderate-resolution land imagery (mrli) is crucial to an assessment of the cumu- lative, regional effect of agricultural land use and land cover on environmental (water) quality."
9,mrli is the primary source of information for this case study.
9,economic benefits accrue to the geospatial information if there is an improvement in the assessment of land use with the mrli.
9,the geospatial information yields a net social benefit that reflects the additional value of information mrli contributes to solving the problem.
9,the case study is to estimate the societal benefits of moni- toring agricultural land use (bernknopf et al. 2012) over multiple years in a regional scale model of optimal land use allocation (forney et al.
9,2012).
9,"in the retrospective case study, watersheds were examined that have capability for higher intensities of crop production and higher probabilities of groundwater survivability (i.e., remain- ing below a regulatory threshold for nitrate pollution)."
9,the case study addresses nonpoint source groundwater pollution hazards in 35 counties in iowa.
9,voi derives from increasing the production of corn while not increasing the risk to human health of contaminated groundwater.
9,"crop production is allocated based on the relative price of corn and soy (between 2001 and 2010 corn had a higher market price), federal and state environmental regulations, and watershed land characteristics."
9,the mrli in combination with groundwater vulnerability models were used to forecast the likelihood of meeting the us epa water quality standard for nitrates in groundwater.
9,the study was conducted for the period of 2001–2010.
9,the optimal land use allocation is based on the economic principle of ­maximizing farmer profit subject to a set of environmental constraints in 603 watersheds in northeastern iowa.
9,"water quality was based on 32,000 wells rang- ing from just below the surface to 1,220 m for period of analysis."
9,"satellite obser- vations, a spatiotemporal data input to the usda cropland data layer maps were linked to a groundwater vulnerability model to estimate the probability of the survivability (i.e., not exceed the drinking water quality of 10 mg/l) of a well over the next 20 years."
9,figure 10.3 shows the well capture zones in the region that are based on the agricultural land and nitrogen fertilizer use.
9,land remains as or is converted to corn if corn price is higher than soy in any given year and if the probability of exceeding the nitrate regulatory standard over the next 20 years starting in 2010 is minimal.

13,"10.6 communicating socioeconomic benefits to decision makers during the 2012 socioeconomic benefits workshop: defining, measuring and communicating the socioeconomic benefits of geospatial information, two ­communication experts presented approaches to improving the communication of the benefits of scientific research."
13,"jay guilledge, senior scientist and director of the science and impact program at the center for climate and energy solutions, raised an important question in “communicating the benefits of environmental information: whose job is it?”"
13,(gulledge 2012).
13,currently there is a gap between the geospatial data producers (scientists) and the consumers (decision makers).
13,this marketplace needs a mechanism for consumers and producers to exchange data and satisfy the demand for information.
13,gulledge pointed out six aspects to consider in formulating communications – material – what information is being offered?
13,who is the market?
13,what does the market value?
13,what are the benefits of the information to the market?
13,how does the information differentiate itself from other offerings?
13,how will the value proposition be substantiated?
13,"matt hirschland, director of communications for university corporation for atmospheric research in boulder, co, followed with a presentation entitled “global forces and the impact research communications imperative.”"
13,tactics and strategy must be combined for effective communications.
13,strategic communi- cations is a process directed at securing rigor and preeminence.
13,hirschland sug- gested the framework for a successful communication strategy comprises five aspects: (1) articulating key priorities and imperatives; (2) defining and under- standing key audiences; (3) selecting and building distinctive messages; (4) deliv- ering messages through the right channels and at the right time; and (5) assessing impact.
13,"to communicate science impacts within that framework, hirschland stressed detailing the importance of our work in “stark terms measured in dollars and lives saved/enhanced.”"
13,"during a subsequent breakout session of the same workshop (boulder, usa – 2012), the participants emphasized the need for storytelling skills, and the ability to develop “elevator speeches” within the context of the above communication"
14,150 f.
14,pearlman et al. imperatives and framework.
14,"good stories, with technical jargon removed, communicate well with all target audiences."
14,the key is to present a story that shows that geospa- tial information distinctly improves the decision maker’s situation relative to exist- ing processes or information.
14,the focus should be on optimizing essential activities as opposed to generic science gains.
14,with optimization comes the highly prized killer application.
14,"10.7 path forward to address the viability of voi analyses, a credible community of experts must provide consistent value to decision makers."
14,there must be access to experts that can support application needs and deliver easily understood results.
14,"moving in these directions requires a number of steps including identification of a body of experts, reference case studies that use accepted methods and, more generally, a community of practice to innovate and validate new applications."
14,"during the last year, such a community has formed."
14,"a linkedin group, socioeconomic benefits community, provides a communication tool for exchange of information."
14,several case studies such as those in this paper have been identified as models for quantitative assessment.
14,"in addition, a compendium of references and a web site resource are under development."
14,these steps are part of the initiative to build a sustainable community and pool of expertise for value of information analyses.
14,ultimately the scientific advances must be accompanied by improved communication and understanding of these developments.
14,publication of new approaches is being encouraged in both peer review journals and popular trade magazines along with presentations at major international conferences.
