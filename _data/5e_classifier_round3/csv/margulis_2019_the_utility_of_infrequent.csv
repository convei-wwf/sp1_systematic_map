1,"introduction and background the importance of snow is inarguable: snowmelt is a vital component of the global water budget that dom- inates runoff in over half of the terrestrial northern hemisphere where one sixth of the world's population resides (barnett et al., 2005; mankin et al., 2015)."
1,"seasonal snowpack is a natural reservoir for areas with winter‐dominated precipitation; the lag between the snow accumulation and ablation is critical to bridge the temporal mismatch between the peak precipitation in winter and the maximum water demand in sum- mer and fall (dettinger & cayan, 1995; vano et al., 2015)."

2,"they note that while efforts to develop estimates of swe using passive microwave sensors go back almost four decades, large‐scale applications of those methods are hampered by extreme complica- tions in forested and topographically complex environments with deep snow (cai et al., 2017), or for snow- packs containing substantial liquid water (li, durand, & margulis, 2017)."
2,"the need for snow estimates is echoed in the recently published national academies decadal review of earth science and applications from space (i.e., “decadal survey”; national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine, 2018), which classiﬁed among its “most important” level of objectives to “quantify rates of snow accumulation, snowmelt, ice melt, and sublimation from snow and ice worldwide at scales driven by topographic variability.”"
2,"while swe estimates have remained elusive, the accurate retrieval of snow depth (sd) at high spatial resolution from remote sensing measurements is possible using a variety of methods, including lidar (e.g., deems et al., 2013, harpold et al., 2014, painter et al., 2016, raleigh & small, 2017), photogramme- try (e.g., bühler et al., 2015, 2016; nolan et al., 2015; vander jagt et al., 2015; wigmore & mark, 2018), and altimetry (kurtz & farrell, 2011; kwok & cunningham, 2008; papa et al., 2002)."
2,"further, these meth- ods have the potential to map sd below forest canopies (e.g., harpold et al., 2014) and in wet snow con- ditions, where active and passive microwave retrieval methods tend to signiﬁcantly degrade."
2,satellite platforms capable of using these or other methods to generate operational sd estimates are an area in need of further development.
2,these approaches provide a potential future pathway forward for global snow characterization using high spatial resolution and high‐accuracy sd observations.
2,"the primary challenges are as follows: (1) trans- forming sd images to spatially distributed swe estimates and (2) when only available infrequently, mining the information in the image/images to interpolate/extrapolate to provide swe estimates when sd measurements are not available."
2,"with respect to the former, raleigh et al. (2017) found that the pri- mary source of uncertainty in swe estimated from lidar‐derived sd was snow density uncertainties."
2,"with respect to the latter, most airborne survey methods are inherently regional in scale and, due to cost, are typically available infrequently (often once per season near peak swe)."
2,existing (or future) spaceborne platforms provide (or are likely to provide) infrequent measurements due to orbital constraints.
2,hedrick et al. (2018) provide a recent example using a deterministic direct insertion approach to success- fully incorporate such sd measurements into a spatially distributed model for estimating swe.
2,"given the challenges listed above combined with the fact that global applications will generally have limited to non- existent in situ data, we postulate that bayesian data assimilation techniques (e.g., margulis et al., 2015) are an ideal framework for generating continuous space‐time swe estimates."
2,"such approaches simulta- neously account for uncertainty involved in the a priori modeling of sd, density, and swe, while opti- mally extracting information from infrequent sd measurements, without the need for stand‐alone density estimates from in situ measurements (e.g., elder et al., 1991; jonas et al., 2009) or deterministic off‐line modeling (e.g., hedrick et al., 2018; painter et al., 2016) for transforming sd to swe."
2,"the demon- stration provided herein differs from previous work where assimilated sd has been either from in situ measurements (e.g., charrois et al., 2016, magnusson et al., 2017; stigter et al., 2017) or from sd estimates derived from microwave sensors (e.g., andreadis & lettenmaier, 2006), which are typically at coarse spa- tial resolution and prone to signiﬁcant biases."
2,"in this paper we utilize multitemporal ﬂights by nasa's airborne snow observatory (aso; painter et al., 2016) over the tuolumne river watershed in the sierra nevada to address the following important science question: to what extent can continuous (space/time) estimates of swe be derived from highly infrequent sd image/images during the snow season?"
2,the application is performed over a regional watershed scale due to the rich aso data set but is posed in a way that is meant to answer this question for global applications where in situ data is limited or nonexistent.
2,the corresponding hypothesis is that even single measurements of sd near the time of peak swe can be used to generate accurate estimates of swe and other snow variables (via a data assimilation approach).
2,"such a demonstration could play a strategic role in motivating decisions about future spaceborne sd measurements (i.e., from photogram- metry, altimetry, lidar, or others) in combination with data assimilation techniques, to the extent that they might provide a pathway forward in support of the decadal survey goal of estimating swe and snowmelt at global scales."

3,"methods herein we describe a data assimilation framework that, by construct, transforms intermittent sd images into space‐time continuous estimates of swe (and other snow state and ﬂux variables)."
3,"the speciﬁc method we use is the particle batch smoother (pbs) that was developed and applied previously in the context of using fractional snow‐covered area images for the purpose of swe estimation (margulis et al., 2015; margulis, cortés, girotto, & durand, 2016)."
3,"a smoother‐based estimation approach is useful for extracting the maxi- mum information from a measurement for the purposes of providing estimates both before and after the measurement time; however, a ﬁltering‐based approach would be a straightforward adaptation of the approach used herein."
3,the pbs is described in more detail in the supporting information (text s1; figures s1 and s2) with only the key points presented herein.
3,"in the assimilation framework an n‐replicate ensemble of prior inputs is used with the forward model to yield a prior estimate, where it is assumed that each prior realization is given the same weight."
3,the forward model used herein consists of a land surface model coupled to a snow depletion curve model to obtain pixel‐ average snow estimates (text s1).
3,"the ssib3‐sast land surface model is used (sun & xue, 2001; xue et al., 2003), which consists of a three‐layer snowpack representation and models the evolution of swe, sd, and snow density along with other snow states and ﬂuxes."
3,"the snow depletion curve, which represents subgrid heterogeneity, is modeled after the formulation provided by liston (2004)."
3,"uncertainty in model inputs is incorporated via postulated multiplicative/additive perturbations to meteorological forcing variables (margulis, cortés, girotto, & durand, 2016; text s1)."
3,"the measured sd is used to generate posterior esti- mates of swe and other state/ﬂux variables by updating the individual ensemble weights using an appropri- ate likelihood function rooted in bayes’ theorem (margulis et al., 2015)."
3,"note that sd and other snow variables (including snow density and thus swe) are connected based on the physical processes in the for- ward model; thus, these snow variables will be simultaneously updated, and the assimilation of accurate sd measurements should help increase the estimation accuracy of these variables at the same time."
3,the update more heavily weights those replicates that have a higher likelihood and reduces the weights for those that are less likely.
3,"the posterior weights provide a discrete estimate of the posterior probability density function, which can be used to compute posterior ensemble statistics of swe or other snow states/ﬂuxes (text s1; figure s2)."
3,"moreover, the posterior estimates of the precipitation (text s1) allow for the improvements in precipitation (snowfall) characterization to propagate to nonobservation times (both before and after the assimilated measurement)."
3,the data assimilation framework described above can be thought of as a bayesian generalization of forward modeling and retrieval algorithms.
3,"the primary beneﬁt of the approach is that it addresses two key aspects of the problem: (1) in real‐world applications both model inputs and measurements contain uncertainty that are typically not explicitly accounted for in modeling or retrieval approaches, and (2) there is a strong desire for swe (and snowmelt) estimates at times when measurements are not available."
3,"the data assimilation approach naturally addresses these via the bayesian construct, thereby generating a time series of swe that is probabilistically conditioned on the uncertain sd measurements."
3,"data, application site, and experimental design we focus on the tuolumne river basin in the sierra nevada of california (figure s3)."
3,"the watershed (drai- nage area ~1,100 km2) is characterized by complex topography and is representative of other basins in the sierra nevada that provide a signiﬁcant source of water supply for downstream use from snowmelt‐driven runoff."
3,"elevations in the basin range from ~1,600 m to nearly 4,000 m, with aspect values mostly distributed between directions facing nw and se."
3,"slopes range between near 0° and greater than 50°, and the basin has forest cover ranging up to 50% (primarily at lower elevations)."
3,"the choice of tuolumne was made primarily to take advantage of the unique aso sd data set (painter et al., 2016), which provides multitemporal lidar‐derived sd images per year over this watershed, compared to most lidar data sets that only provide one sd estimate per year."
3,the snow modeling and assimilation frame- work we use is designed for applications at resolutions that are an integer multiple of the original 30‐m dem used for generating topographic inputs; we chose to apply the snow model at a resolution of 60 m to closely match the 50‐m aso sd product.
3,"prior to assimilation, the aso sd maps were regridded to the modeling resolution."
3,data assimilation methods generally make an assumption that the measurement is unbiased margulis et al.

4,"estimates of lidar sd errors are in the range of centimeter to tens‐of‐centimeter scale (grünewald et al., 2010; painter et al., 2016; raleigh et al., 2017), depending on a number of factors (deems et al., 2013; e.g., the aggregated resolution of the raw data, sensor positioning error, and vegetation)."
4,"herein we speciﬁed a sd measurement error standard deviation of 5 cm, which is in the correct range based on the literature and the modeling resolution of this study."
4,sensitivity tests using values from 2 to 5 cm showed limited differences.
4,the abundance of aso data allows for assimilating one sd image per year (as might be available from the retrieval methods discussed above) and using other sd images as a means of veriﬁcation of the predicted sd at nonassimilation times.
4,"we use data from three water years (wys): 2015 (historically dry), 2016 (near average), and 2017 (historically wet)."
4,the number and dates of aso images from these three years are shown in table s1.
4,"tuolumne also contains four snow pillow sites and seven snow course sites (figure s3), which provide independent swe estimates that are used for additional comparison and assessment of the methods, and a usgs streamﬂow gage near its outlet above the hetch hetchy reservoir (figure s3)."
4,"the baseline case, which provides the bulk of the analysis presented herein, assimilates a single sd image from aso that was taken on the day of water year (dowy) closest to 1 april in each wy (dowys 185 in 2015, 184 in 2016, and 183 in 2017)."
4,"due to the interannual variability across the three case study years, the near 1 april measurement has a different proximity to the estimated watershed‐average peak swe tim- ing in each year (figure s4)."
4,"note that we do not use the separate aso swe product herein, as it is a model‐ based estimate; instead, we focus solely on measured quantities for comparison throughout."
4,a sensitivity test was also performed to assess how results change with respect to the number of assimilated measurements.
4,results and discussion sample estimates from wy 2016 are presented in figure 1 to qualitatively illustrate both the method and the results.
4,the prior ensemble simulations provide daily swe and sd estimates.
4,"the single assimilated aso sd measurement is on dowy 184, which is used to probabilistically condition the prior ensemble in order to generate the posterior estimate via the pbs update."
4,"the seasonal evolution of prior and posterior sd and swe is shown, including on a subset of days with independent (i.e., nonassimilated) aso data (dowys 178, 240, and 264)."
4,the posterior sd at the assimilation time (by construct) should closely match the mea- sured sd ﬁeld.
4,"this is clearly seen on dowy 184, where the posterior sd and aso sd ﬁelds are in good agreement, while different than the prior sd ﬁeld."
4,"importantly, the method essentially provides a retrieved (posterior) estimate of swe via the relationship between modeled swe and sd in the prior."
4,"the bayesian smoother also implicitly uses sd information from the measurement time to generate the posterior estimates before and after the measurement day (i.e., all daily estimates of sd and swe are updated)."
4,"as a result of the multitemporal aso measurements, independent comparisons can be made between the posterior estimates and aso data on days that were not used in the assimilation, assuming there is no autocorrelation in aso errors from independent measurement times."
4,it is evident that posterior sd ﬁelds on these days are also in better agreement with measurements than the prior (figure 1).
4,the performance of the data assimilation method was ﬁrst quantiﬁed by comparing prior and posterior sd ﬁelds to all nonassimilated aso sd ﬁelds across the three years.
4,"at each aso measurement time, the per- formance was assessed using three metrics (figure 2): the spatial (pattern) correlation, bias (mean error), and unbiased root mean square error (ubrmse), where the latter is designed to better quantify the random qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ errors (over the traditional root mean square error) when bias is present (ubrmse ¼ ðrmseþ2 −ðbiasþ2 ; entekhabi et al., 2010)."
4,it should be noted that this level of veriﬁcation of a snow data assimilation frame- work is atypical since having multiple measured state variable spatial ﬁelds independent of those that are assimilated is exceedingly rare.
4,"within a given wy, the posterior statistical metrics are expected to be optimal on the sd assimilation day."
4,"this is clearly seen in terms of the correlation, which is above 0.95 on the assimilation day for all three years (figure 2, top row)."
4,"the prior range (mean) of spatial correlation coefﬁcients was 0.37‐0.60 (0.56), 0.34‐0.60 (0.48), and 0.42‐0.62 (0.54) in wys 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively."
4,"in comparison, the posterior range (mean) of spatial correlation coefﬁcients was 0.81‐0.98 (0.91), 0.58‐0.99 (0.83), and 0.89‐0.98 (0.94)."
4,"as expected, the correlation degrades away from the maximum values on the day of assimilation."

6,"solid lines and shaded areas represent the ensemble median and interquartile range, respectively."
6,"note: stations tum and wlw in water year 2015 had no prior snow on the assimilation day of water year (dowy) so that the prior and posterior are indistinguishable. and ubrmse results mostly show sizeable improvements relative to the prior, with a few exceptions."
6,"the relative improvement is least in wy 2015 as a result of a few distinct factors: (i) less overall room for improvement due to the historically dry year (figure s4), (ii) the peak swe occurring more than 50 days before the assimilated aso measurement (compared to closer to peak swe in wy 2016 and 2017), and (iii) several relatively signiﬁcant storms that occurred after the day of aso measurement assimilation (figure 2, top left panel)."
6,"additionally, in wy 2016, while improvements are large near peak swe, the prior and posterior sd bias and ubrmse values are comparable to each other beyond about 75 days after the assimilated measurement."
6,"additionally, we compared the prior and posterior results to in situ swe estimates from snow pillow and snow course locations using the same methods outlined in margulis, cortés, girotto, and durand (2016); sample results are shown in figure 3 at four stations across all three years."
6,these results illustrate the frame- work at the point scale and provide an additional independent set of measurements with which to compare.
6,"it should be noted that any comparison between grid‐averaged states and snow pillow and course measure- ments (typically representative of averages over ~10 m2 and a ~100‐m transect in relatively ﬂat forest clearings) in complex terrain may have signiﬁcant representativeness issues, even at the relatively high 60‐m resolution used herein."
6,the difference between prior and posterior estimates depends on the quality of the prior and/or how it compares to the assimilated aso measurement.
6,"in general, the posterior sd closely matches the aso measurement on the assimilation day and generally improves the sd ﬁt on nonas- similation days (figure 3, ﬁrst column for each wy)."

7,"in contrast, the tum and wlw stations in wy 2015 show essentially no update between the prior and posterior snow states (i.e., prior and posterior overlap in figure 3)."
7,"this is because in wy 2015 there are no prior realizations with snow at those locations on the day of the assimilated aso measurement (due to low‐peak swe and early‐ peak swe timing); therefore, there is no information with which to update the snow states."
7,"in wys 2016 and 2017, the same stations have substantially more snow accumulation, such that the differences between prior and posterior estimates are generally larger (in the ensemble median and/or uncertainty)."
7,"the posterior swe estimates are generally more consistent with the in situ data in most cases (i.e., the posterior swe differences are less than the prior differences for 8 out of 12 snow courses and for 4 out of 6 snow pillows shown in figure 3)."
7,"that said, these comparisons are meant to be mostly qualitative due to the representativeness issues described above."
7,a key beneﬁt of the data assimilation framework proposed herein is that nonobserved posterior states and ﬂuxes at nonobservation times are provided.
7,"in fact, sd in and of itself is of less interest to hydrologists and water planners than other variables like peak‐accumulated swe and snowmelt ﬂuxes, which are more tightly linked to runoff and streamﬂow."

8,"to illustrate this, the posterior estimates of swe ﬁelds at the time of peak basin‐averaged swe and the time series of snowmelt across the wy are shown in figure 4."
8,"the peak swe in wys 2015 and 2016 occurs 52 and 17 days, respectively, before the day of sd assimilation, while in wy 2017 the peak swe occurs 18 days after the day of assimilation."
8,"based on this juxtaposition, the fraction of cumulative annual (posterior) snowmelt across each of the three wys at the time of sd assimilation is 46%, 17%, and 11%, respectively."
8,"the posterior esti- mates of snowmelt are also compared to the streamﬂow near the tuolumne outlet (figure 4, second col- umn)."
8,"the correlation coefﬁcients between the daily basin‐average snowmelt time series and the daily streamﬂow at the usgs stream gage are, respectively, 0.63, 0.90, and 0.91 for wys 2015, 2016, and 2017."
8,"the measured streamﬂow is the combined result of rainfall‐runoff, snowmelt‐driven runoff, and baseﬂow and thus is not expected to be fully explained by the snowmelt time series alone, but the general agreement provides additional, albeit indirect, veriﬁcation of the posterior snow estimates."
8,"the fact that wy 2015 snowmelt is the least correlated with streamﬂow is not surprising due to the extremely early peak swe rela- tive to the day of sd assimilation and the fact that it was not only an extremely dry but also warm year (margulis, cortés, girotto, huning, et al., 2016), where snow was stored only at much higher elevations relative to other years (figure 4, left column), with a larger fraction of precipitation falling as rain and thus resulting in more rainfall‐driven runoff."
8,"in the near‐average year (2016) and wet year (2017), where snow is expected to dominate the runoff signal, there is a strong correlation between the posterior estimates and the measured streamﬂow."
8,the performance results presented herein are for the relatively strict test of assimilating a single sd measure- ment that is nominally near peak swe (in the cases above within ~2‐6 weeks of peak swe).
8,"the data assim- ilation framework however is designed to allow for any number of assimilated measurements, and therefore, results should be expected to improve with the addition of more measurements."
8,"a full accounting of the per- formance as a function of the number and timing of assimilated measurements is beyond the scope of this study; however, we performed a sensitivity test for the near‐average wy 2016 whereby results from a case with three assimilated measurements (on dowy 184, 240, and 282) were compared to the baseline posterior results derived from the single measurement case (figure s5)."
8,"the overall performance increased, as expected, in terms of correlation, bias, and ubrmse metrics."
8,"in particular, in the latter part of the wy, where posterior results from the single measurement assimilation case were comparable to the prior results, there are signiﬁcant improvements with the additional assimilated measurements."
8,these results point to the ﬂex- ibility and the beneﬁt of the approach for assimilating as many sd measurements as are available.
8,conclusions we examined the potential of leveraging single midseason sd measurements for generating continuous space‐time estimates of key snow states and ﬂuxes including swe and snowmelt.
8,"the results presented herein clearly demonstrate that a data assimilation construct provides a useful framework for leveraging infrequent remotely sensed sd images to derive accurate estimates of nonobserved variables (e.g., swe acknowledgments we thank one anonymous reviewer, and snowmelt) at nonobserved times, as concluded through comparison with independent measurements jeff dozier, tom painter, and ned bair of remotely sensed sd, in situ swe, and watershed outlet streamﬂow."
8,while the hydrologic and snow com- for their thoughtful comments and munities have been pursuing global spatially distributed estimates of swe for decades (and stymied to a suggestions.
8,the work was partially supported by a u.s.
8,"‐china clean large extent for reasons described above; lettenmaier et al., 2015), this work provides an argument that energy research center for water‐ developing new methods using existing data or pursuing a dedicated mission aimed speciﬁcally at high‐reso- energy technologies/california energy lution/high‐accuracy, but infrequent, sd measurements (i.e., as few as one to three measurements per snow commission grant 300‐15‐006, nasa grant nnx16aq63g, and a nasa jet season) combined with a data assimilation framework could make signiﬁcant inroads toward that propulsion lab director's research and ultimate goal."
