1,its production is the essential pillar in world’s food security.
1,limited water resources are the major constraint in an agricultural production system.
1,better application of irrigation water will result in increased water and land productivity for the planted crops.
1,precision irrigation is one of the promising keys to solve this dilemma.
1,it allows applying the exact needed amount of water in its optimal place at the right time.
1,"yet, this requires a huge information database to be accurately able to apply precision irrigation."

2,"geo-informatics implication in combination with suitable decision support systems plays a relevant role in water management in agricultural sector, especially when applying precision irrigation and farming techniques."
2,this chapter aims to provide an overview about the implication of geo-informatics (with a special focus on geographic information systems and remote sensing) in irrigation water management on both local level (egypt) and international level.
2,"although geo-informatics applications for agricultural management have been used since the early 1980s, still there is a place for further research to maximize the benefits of its use."
2,public involvement is critically needed to ensure sustainability of applied water management programs using geo-informatics.
2,"keywords geo-informatics, gis, irrigation management, precision irrigation, remote sensing 1 introduction in september 2015, the united nations issued the 17 sustainable development goals to make the world better by ending the poverty and offering food and peace for everyone."
2,"at least eight of those goals are directly or indirectly related to agricul- ture, namely, no poverty, zero hunger, responsible consumption and production, life blow water, life in the land, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and climate action."
2,"the agricultural sector and agribusiness is the main income source for about one-third of the world’s population, globally."
2,"in egypt, about half to two-thirds of the egyptians live or are employed in the rural areas and depend directly on the agricultural sector for their livelihood [1]."
2,figure 1 shows the percentage of egyptian population who are working in the ruler area over the last 55 years based on the world bank data inventory.
2,there is a reduction in the number of population percentage by around 4% from 1960 to 1975.
2,after that period the percentage is almost constant between 56 and 58%.
2,agriculture is the highest freshwater consumer compared with other economic activities.
2,agricultural activity consumes around 70% of the world’s freshwater resources [2].
2,"agriculture consumption of water in egypt varies from 80% [3] to 85% [4], respectively."
2,"thus, to achieve sustainable agricultural development, maximizing crop and water productivity is essentially required."
2,"water productivity1 has been increased in some crops, i.e., rice and wheat by at least 100% between 1961 and 2001 [5]."
2,this growth was mainly due to noticeable improvements in crop varieties and better management practices that resulted in crop yield increase.
2,"however, it is anticipated that the world population will be increased by two billion in 2030 [5]."
2,this anticipated challenge upsurges the call for further development 1 water productivity is a term that refers to more output per unit of applied water.

3,1 the percentage of egyptian population who are working in the rural areas from the total population of egypt (created by author) actions to increase water productivity [6].
3,"also, the majority of developing coun- tries suffer from water shortage and/or lack of crop-water productivity mainly because of the observed maladministration of natural resources on both on-farm and irrigation district levels [7]."
3,"egypt, for example, is characterized by its limited natural water resources that are presented mainly on river nile with its constant annual share of 55.5 billion m3."
3,the evident increase of the egyptian population from 76.5 million in 2006 to 90.1 million in 2016 [8] resulted in a visible decrease in the annual available freshwater per capita.
3,"according to the egyptian ministry of agriculture and land reclama- tion [9], the annual per capita share of water decreased from 850 m3 in 2006 to 700 m3 in 2011, and it is expected to drop down to 500 m3 by 2030."
3,"all of those amounts of water are already below the water poverty line of 1,000 m3 per capita per year."
3,"besides the exponential increase in egypt population [10], a serious decreasing of water resources in egypt is expected in the future."
3,"this is mainly because of (1) climate change and greenhouse effect [2], (2) lack of any improvement of water availability, and (3) other international political issues, i.e., the ethiopian dam [11]."
3,"accordingly, there are two aspects that should be considered to meet the demand and water deficit in egypt; one is to search for another source for irrigation such as treated wastewater which can offer about 2.4 billion m3/year [12] and replaced the conventional irrigation by modern irrigation technology."
3,"therefore, maximizing water and land productivities are considered the foremost challenges the world faces nowadays for more sustainable food security especially, in arid and semiarid countries, i.e., egypt."
3,"on the other hand, several researches have been"

4,elbana et al. conducted to study improving water and land productivities as important tools for food security [13–18].
4,"surface irrigation, as a traditional irrigation method, is responsible for losing a significant amount of water that may reach up to 60% or more if it is not managed properly."
4,reducing the losses of applied irrigation water shall lead to an increase in water productivity.
4,"this improvement in water productivity can be achieved by several ways such as, replacing plant varieties and improved high yielding ones, optimizing production inputs such as fertigation, introducing best agronomic and cultural practices, and implementing improved irrigation method to deficit irriga- tion, among others [15]."
4,"in addition, irrigation system modernization accompanied by better coordination between mangers, users, and/or stakeholders should be considered as well to improve water productivity [19]."
4,"despite the noticeable implication of geo-informatics in agricultural system production worldwide, relatively fewer reports and studies focused on its applica- tion in on-farm water management."
4,the presented chapter reviews literature by local (in egypt) and international researchers on agricultural irrigation management applying geo-informatics (with a special focus on gis and rs technologies) as an effective tool to improve water and land productivity.
4,"2 history of geo-informatics’ involvement in agricultural irrigation management on the international level, geo-information techniques have been applied since the early 1980s."
4,the california department of water resources worked since 1982 until now in cooperation with the office of water use efficiency (owue) to build up the california irrigation management information system (cimis) [20].
4,"this system aims at producing a geospatial map for reference evapotranspiration (eto) and a set of software programs for irrigation scheduling, disease risk management, soil moisture, water quality, etc."
4,"the fao [21] as well set an agroecological zoning methodology and supporting software aezwin in cooperation with the international institute for applied systems analysis (iiasa) for application at global, regional, national, and sub- national levels."
4,"the system is considered as a useful tool for land resources assessment [21, 22]."
4,"however, the obtained results by fao and iiasa are based on very coarse resolution maps (scale 1:5,000,000)."
4,the resulted smaller scale maps cannot reveal the actual status of land degradation.
4,this provokes certain concerns regarding using such models and maps on agriculture.
4,"in 2007, soil and terrain database program (soter), based on soil parameters, had been updated filling the gaps in its soil profile data."
4,soil parameter estimates for central africa (scale 1:1 million) and the democratic republic of the congo (scale 1:2 million) have been developed [23].
5,implication of geo-informatics (gis/rs) on agricultural irrigation. . .
5,"299 moreover, the international water management institute (iwmi) developed the world water and climate atlas."
5,the atlas was mainly based on data assembled from different weather stations distributed worldwide for the period 1961–1990.
5,the produced atlas aimed mainly at determining the most proper regions for rainfed and irrigated agriculture.
5,it also provides inputs for river basins hydro- logical and crop modeling [24].
5,"nevertheless, the provided atlas outputs do not include recommendations or predictions for agricultural practices, i.e., irrigation scheduling or disease risk management."
5,"later on, maps resolution has been improved radically."
5,the european space agency (esa) adopted an initiative to produce a 300 m global land cover map called globcover based on the geo-informatics.
5,the success of this initiative resulted in further improvement and more updated database producing globecorine 2005 and 2009.
5,the produced database and maps are available for free download through the esa portal [25].
5,"also, many other researches on applying geo-informatics in agriculture and irriga- tion management have been conducted."
5,bastiaanssen et al. [26] used geo-informatics for scaling up water productivity in irrigated agriculture for the indus basin.
5,the study revealed that water productivity tends to a constant value at a spatial scale of 6 million ha and higher.
5,this was mainly because of the equity between water diversion and water depletion at this scale.
5,"as a result, this indicated the ability of the groundwater systems to regulate losses and reuse of water resources."
5,they also demonstrated how images such as noaa-avhrr could provide a quick scan of parameters necessary for water productivity assessment.
5,hellegers et al. [27] applied a combination of spatial land surface data with socioeconomic analysis to provide suitable indicators to support the decision- making in integrated water and environmental management in the inkomati basin in the eastern part of south africa.
5,"elbana et al. [28], as well, used the geographic information system (gis) technology to set up a digital database for the actual status of treated wastewater reuse in agricultural irrigation in the province of girona, catalonia (spain)."
5,the study revealed the ability to save 20% of conven- tional water consumed by agricultural sector to be directed for satisfying the urban sector.
5,"their study was based on water quality specifications according to the spanish royal decree 1620/2007, which regulates reclaimed effluent reuse in spain."
5,"edlinger et al. [29] recreated the expansion and densification of the irrigated cropland in the kashkadarya province, uzbekistan, central asia using landsat mss and tm data from 1972/1973, 1977, 1987, 1998, and 2000."
5,they interpreted the multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) data and crop phonological knowledge for tree classification.
5,"they concluded that the utilization of landsat archives in the kashkadarya province, uzbekistan, was the first appli- cation of mapping cropland development in central asia over the past 40 years."
5,they also proved that knowledge-based decision trees based on landsat scale that are suitable for mapping cropland of agricultural landscape within desert and steppe zones.

6,the biennial bearing effect on coffee yield using modis remote sensing imagery has been studied in brazil by bernardes et al.
6,they aimed to assess potential associations between coffee yield and modis-derived vegetation indices.
6,the study revealed that the best correlation was found between the variation on yield and variation on vegetation indices.
6,this was not enough to estimate coffee yield exclusively from vegetation indices.
6,vancustem et al. [31] combined the existing land cover/land use datasets for cropland area monitoring at the african continental scale.
6,their study aimed to optimally integrate the best available cropland datasets in a consolidated product.
6,they produced a map at 250 m resolution covering the whole africa and another partially covering niger and nigeria both based on the expert visual interpretation of high-resolution images using geowiki tool.
6,"moreover, udelhoven et al. [32] used the near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) and hyperspectral remote sensing to retrieve the biomethane potential."
6,they proved that the remote sensing method only works reliably close to the time of harvest when the dry matter content is at its maximum and becomes less variable.
6,"in a case study of regional durum wheat yield estimation in tunisia using 13 years of low-resolution spot-vegetation observations, meroni et al. [33] have investigated the interactions among four different remote sensing biomass proxies."
6,"they were mainly characterized by increasing physiological meaning, and six different statistical models are relying on different hypotheses and using a varying number of degrees of freedom."
6,the study assessed the progress of the adoption of more complicated biomass proxies and the trade-off between model sophistication and data accessibility.
6,the study indicated that the best performance was achieved using the most physiologically sound remote sensing indicator (the phonologically tuned cumulative value of the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) in conjunction with statistical specifications allowing for parsimonious spatial adjustment of the parameters.
6,"moreover, lyle et al. [34] estimated the historical yield data for wheat at farm level by testing the temporal capability of landsat imagery and precision agriculture technology."
6,the results verified the potential benefit of using two high- resolution datasets to create robust wheat yield prediction models over different growing seasons.
6,these results could be of great use to the agricultural decision- makers.
6,"on the other hand, constraints do face the researchers who intend to use geo-informatics in agricultural management."
6,one of the major constraints is the limited availability of actual and accurate dataset.
6,the limited access to developers and scientists to the ground-truth information restricts the evaluation process of the produced technologies and models under different environmental settings and conditions [35].
6,"thus, there is an urgent need to set up an easy access networks to facilitate produced models’ calibration and evaluation under different conditions."
6,there is a need as well to allow geo-informatics’ users to at least visualize information products in a simple way such as google earth [35].
6,"at the national level, egypt is valuing the role of geotechnology in agricultural management and innovation."
6,el kady and mack [36] emphasized the requirement
7,implication of geo-informatics (gis/rs) on agricultural irrigation. . . 301 to set up a more sustainable cost-effective mean for data acquisition for the agricultural sector management in egypt.
7,"they also pointed out remote sensing as a role player in the aforementioned data collection especially in the measurement of electromagnetic radiation reflected by vegetation, soil, water, and other features of the earth’s surface."
7,processing of satellite imagery for agricultural purposes in egypt was started as early as 1983 when the remote sensing center of the academy of scientific research conducted the first estimation of irrigated agricultural areas in egypt using digital processing of landsat multispectral scanner data [37].
7,"in 1988, the national oceanographic institute (ion) in france produced a thematic map of el-fayoum governorate, egypt in cooperation with the egyptian survey authority using spot imagery to obtain an accurate assessment of the cultivated area of el-fayoum governorate [38]."
7,"according to wolters et al. [39], the egyptian survey authority in cooperation with the consultants of water and environment, rotterdam, the netherlands, determined the total cultivated land area and the waterlogged, saline, and urban areas of el-fayoum governorate using landsat tm images."
7,"yet, they concluded the difficulty of making a detailed crop map of this area because of the small field size and fragmented land use."
7,"the international institute for land reclamation and improvement (iwaco), rotterdam, the netherlands in 1989 classified landsat tm images of the eastern nile delta and valley between beni suef and el minya for the ministry of public works and water resources (mpwwr) [36]."
7,"later, the soil and water research institute (swri) of the agriculture research center (arc), ministry of agriculture and land reclamation (malr), egypt, used the landsat tm image to estimate the cultivated area in both lower and upper egypt [40]."
7,bakr et al. [41] evaluated land capability in newly reclaimed areas in egypt using geospatial model (cervatana model).
7,they indicated that using gis has significantly improved spatial data handling and analysis and has enabled spatial modeling for terrain attributes.
7,"they also concluded that the coupling between modeling and gis serves to improve land use planning and consequently enhance the decision-making process, especially in newly reclaimed areas."
7,"bakr et al. [42] monitored land cover changes in the bustan 3 area (el-nubaria, egypt) using multitemporal landsat images captured in 1084, 1990, 1999, 2004, and 2008."
7,they used the hybrid classification approach and normalized difference vegetation index (nvdi) in their study.
7,"the results revealed that from 1984 to 2008, the bustan 3 area of egypt transformed the 100% of its barren land to 79% agricultural land which reflects the successful land reclamation efforts."
7,"egypt geographically can be classified into five main regions: nile valley, nile delta, western desert, eastern desert, and sinai peninsula (fig."
7,"additionally, there are several who attempted to classify egypt territory to different agroclimatic zones."
7,"first, it was divided into three main agroclimatic zones (lower egypt, middle egypt, and upper egypt) by eid et al."
7,"in 2007, it was divided into nine zones: coastal zone, central delta, east and west delta, giza, menia, asyout and souhag, north quena, south quena, and aswan [44]."

8,"at the same period, el-nahrawy [47] also classified egypt to five agro- ecological zones: baltim, gemmeiza, tahrir-ismailia (those three in nile delta region), beni suef, giza, and mario-aswan (this one involved nile valley and desert oases) zone besides the stoney and mountainous desert."
8,additional attempt to classify egypt territory to various agroclimatic zones was achieved by khalil et al. [48] as they classified egypt to eight different agroclimatic zones.
8,noreldin et al. [49] classified egypt into seven agroclimatic zones based on the potential evapo- transpiration values those zones are matched with khalil et al. [48] eight zones.
8,the updated map for the locations of those zones is presented in fig.

8,"the atlas has been developed in cooperation with multiple international institution including (1) world food program (wfp), (2) regional center for disaster risk reduction (rcdrr), and (3) the united nations international strategy for disaster risk reduction (unisdr)."
8,"the developed atlas covers egypt, jordan, lebanon, the occupied palestinian territories, and syria with 344 climate maps at 30 arc-second spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2)."

9,"bakr et al. [52] identified the most environmentally sensitive area to desertifi- cation in the bustan 3 area (el-nubaria, egypt)."
9,they used the standard and adjusted mediterranean desertification and land use (medalus) approach for years 1984 and 2008 in their study.
9,they adjusted the medalus factors for 2008 to obtain more reliable data at the local level under egyptian conditions.
9,the research study showed that about 78% of the study area is sensitive to desertifica- tion due to the impact of plant cover.
9,"after adjusting the medalus model to fit the egyptian conditions, it was found that the vulnerable area to desertification due to land cover parameter was increased to reach 89% of the study area."
9,"thus, they recommended more attention to the most sensitive areas to desertification to achieve the most possible sustainable management for el-bustan area, egypt."
9,elbana et al. [53] studied and mapped the spatial accumulation and distribution of heavy metals in elgabal elasfar farm (egypt) using gis facilities as a conse- quence of long-term irrigation with domestic wastewater.
9,"they reported that the concentration of studied heavy metals (pb, cd, cu, and ni) in water samples were less than the permissible level for irrigation set by many organizations."

10,they also pointed out that cd concentration was critical in the surface layer.
10,"meanwhile, they indicated that the concentration of heavy metals versus soil depth revealed that the pb accumulation was mainly in the topsoil where extensive mobility and potential hazard for soil contamination were observed for cu < ni < cd."
10,a remote sensing study in the northwestern nile delta about the irrigation improvement project (iip) for monitoring winter crops under changing irrigation practices was held between 1997/1998 and 2002/2003 [54].
10,"the study was performed under an assignment of the egyptian mwri and financed by the kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau (kfw), frankfurt am main, germany."
10,the study was held for three command areas.
10,"first area was el-mahmoudia command area in el-behira gover- norate, egypt that serves 66,674 ha, 86.8% of which is cropped."
10,"second, el-wasat command area in kafr el-shikh governorate that serves 29,141 ha, 86.1% of which is cropped."
10,"the third area was el-wasat canals in kafr el-shiekh governorate as well and serves 19,829 ha (87.7% are cropped)."
10,the study concluded that wheat-cultivated area has increased from 1997/1998 to 2002/2003 for both improved and non- improved canal command areas.
10,"in the winter season of 2002/2003, a decrease of"

11,"the study proved as well an increase of water productivity for all crops from 1997 to 2003, with a slightly larger increase in the iip-improved areas."
11,"it was also pointed out that wheat crop- water productivity was increased from 1.34 in 1998 to 1.50 in 2003, which is larger than the worldwide water productivity for wheat of 1.08."
11,the mwri contracted as well with a team of experts (misr consult) to prepare an environmental assessment study for the integrated irrigation improvement and management project (iiimp) during the period from july to september 2004 [55].
11,the study presented key findings and recommendations to relevant aspects to the following: 1.
11,the proposed iiimp physical interventions in each command area 2.
11,the baseline environmental profile of each command area including existing environmental challenges 3.
11,the key potential environmental impacts of the iiimp 4.
11,the proposed pest management plan (pmp) 5.
11,the proposed environmental management plan (emp) 6.

11,the proposed environmental component’s budget 3 geo-informatics for agroecological characterization creating accurate and updated geospatial datasets for agricultural lands are criti- cally needed for more sustainable on-farm water management and food security.
11,"the use of geo-information techniques, i.e., remote sensing and gis, is confirmed as efficient tools to override the majority of difficulties encountered in the collec- tion of a large amount of data [56]."
11,this will result in more sustainable on-farm management especially for irrigation and drainage systems [36].
11,the idea is to use this technique for dividing the agricultural land and/or the world to different agroecological zones (aezs).
11,"each zone has its climate, soil, crop, and water database to help irrigation scheduling and improve water use efficiency and water and land productivities."
11,agroecological zoning is considered as one of the most relevant approaches for agriculture planning and development.
11,this is because the success or failure of any farming system depends primarily on the surrounding agroclimatic resources [45].
11,"according to the inland valley consortium [57], the importance of charac- terizing different territories on agroecological base is derived from the fact that, at different scales, there exist a difference in soil structure, soil nutrient distribution, and water dynamics, among other factors, i.e., population density, climate, geology, market accessibility, etc."
11,"these factors are important for modern agriculture research and development especially for technologies such as plant genetics, farming practice, and appropriate machinery."
11,"as trial-and-error technique is simply too expensive, time-consuming, and wasteful of resources, the agroecological"

12,elbana et al. characterization identification will be an efficient tool for setting scientific research priorities for more sustainable improvement and development to the targeted agricultural system.
12,"in addition, the results of the agroecological characterization will be the basis for technology transfer."
12,"however, in order to achieve the highest benefit of remote sensing technology, the data must be inherently sound."
12,"this implies an ongoing need for calibration, validation, stability, monitoring, and quality assurance [25]."
12,"4 geo-informatics and precision irrigation with the increased stress in freshwater especially in arid and semiarid areas, the management of irrigation process is greatly required with a high level of precision to minimize the water input and adverse environmental impacts while maximizing water productivity [58]."
12,"during the 1990s, the precision agriculture or site-specific management has grabbed the attention of all scientific community."
12,the idea is to break out the field into smaller units and deal with each unit separately instead of dealing with the field as one unit as in conventional agricultural practice [59].
12,this should result at the end in maximizing the benefits of water and land productivity.
12,the term precision irrigation started to take its relevance during the early 2000s.
12,it simply refers to applying the right amount of water to the plant in the right place at the right time for improving crop-water productivity and increasing yield.
12,"according to evans et al. [60], precision irrigation is applying a precise amount of water at the correct time in a uniform way across the field."
12,"the application of precision irrigation system needed integrating data about crop-water requirements, soil characteristics, irrigation scheduling, and high-tech irrigation equipment [58]."
12,the precision irrigation term and techniques have been developed over time (irrigation new [61]).
12,"at the first generation, the precision irrigation was depended on dividing the field into sectors (sector control) and was mainly applied in central pivots."
12,"in this case, the central pivot was divided into sectors; each sector is planted with the different crop which means different water requirement."
12,the main idea of this technique is to control the speed of pivot movement to control the depth of applied water in each sector.
12,"later on, the technique has been developed to be based on segment control instead of sector control."
12,"in this case, the land has been split into smaller segments."
12,"irrigation water, in this case, was controlled by banks of sprinklers."
12,each bank can control the entire segment or even part of it.
12,"nowadays, precision irrigation has been developed to a full variable rate irrigation control technique."
12,"in this method, irrigation field could be divided into different zones based on soil properties and water content."
12,the irrigation applied by controlling each sprinkler separately which allows to adding water to different zones at different timing and depth as necessary.
12,"figure 5 shows the difference in shape among sector, segment, and full variable rate irrigation control techniques according to (irrigation new [61])."

13,5 evolution in precision irrigation controlling techniques.
13,simplified and updated based on irrigation new zealand [61] dalezios et al. [62] used both field measurements and geo-informatics (gis/rs) including image filtering and image processing to precisely divide a planted cotton field into different zones.
13,each zone shares similar soil properties and organic matter content.
13,the target of this work was to precisely add water and fertilizers per location/zone as needed to reduce water and fertilizer inputs to the system.
13,they concluded that applying worldview-22 is a useful tool to extract the crop area and estimate crop-water requirements.
13,el nahry et al. [46] studied the economic and environmental viability of using remote sensing and gis techniques in precision irrigation.
13,the research has been conducted in irrigated maize field on pivot system with total area 153.79 acre in ismailia province (egypt).
13,they indicated that applying geo-informatics in preci- sion agriculture could be a helpful tool in simplifying data collection and analysis.
13,this resulted in better and rapid implementation to management decisions.
13,"they also found that applying precision farming (irrigation and fertilization) provoked saving 93,718 m3 (~600 m3/acre) compared to traditional farmer practice."
13,"yet, the cost of implementing precision irrigation was higher than the traditional farmer practice."
13,"however, the total revenue (returns-costs) was in favor to applying precision farming."
13,a total return increase of ~30% was found applying precision farming compared to traditional farming practice.
13,hedley et al. [63] used an electromagnetic induction mapping system to collect soil conductivity data in real time at high resolution in combination with geo- statistical analysis to divide the field study into different soil management zones.
13,they aimed to determine the potential benefit of applying precision irrigation to different pastoral and arable production soils in new zealand.
13,they compared two irrigation scheduling.
13,"one of them is applying uniform rate irrigation, and the second is variable rate irrigation."
13,fields have been irrigated only when soil zones reached a critical soil moisture deficit.
13,"they found out that applying precision irrigation to the field resulted in saving 8–21% of irrigation water and decreasing drainage and runoff by 19 and 55%, respectively."
13,"however, the utmost profitability 2 worldview-2 is a digital globe satellite sensor launched in 2009."
13,it delivers a panchromatic mono- and stereo satellite image data of 0.46 m.
13,more details could be encountered on https:// www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/worldview-2/.
14,308 m.
14,elbana et al. of applying variable rate irrigation will be achieved when then the farmers domi- nate the idea of knowing a small quantity of irrigation water could be applied without affecting the commercial quality of their crop under the condition of knowing the planted crop-water stress threshold [64].
14,"nevertheless, the majority of developed techniques for precision farming including precision irrigation in addition of being highly expensive [65], they have been developed ignoring the knowledge levels and skills of local farmers [66]."
14,"on the other hand, lea-cox [67] counted a number of indirect economic benefits of applying precision irrigation such as reducing disease incidence, lowering fungicide costs, and minimizing nutrient runoff and groundwater consumption."
14,policymakers and extension services should consider conducting farmer capacity building and training on how to use the developed techniques to increase their farm revenue.
14,more investigation should be applied in order to produce low-cost geo-information technology.
14,5 agricultural irrigation management technologies and public perception no doubt that improving irrigated agriculture has both direct and indirect effects on poverty alleviation in rural areas through creating off-farm employment opportu- nities and develops investments in other activities such as infrastructure and markets [5].
14,"the traditional agrarian people may be resistant to new management practices, especially who live in the developing countries."
14,"thus, to apply new water management project, the stakeholders should be convinced of the benefits before the implementation of such activities."
14,"nevertheless, public perception and farmer involvement in improving irrigation practices are considered important factors that could accelerate or restrict water management projects on the agricultural sector at both on-farm and district levels."
14,"in other words, farmers and land users are key players who affect the success or failure of water and land productivities’ projects directly."
14,the low adoption of improved agronomic practice is mainly because of insufficient attention that is given to farmer participation and community action [68].
14,ignoring land users’ participation in development projects could result in a drastic failure for those projects even all other factors are suited well.
14,"according to fao [5], ignoring public perception and land users’ participation in soil and water conservation projects in burkina faso was one of the reasons for its failure until the early 1980s."
14,considering villagers’ opinions and participation in the irrigation water management project in yatenga region of the country’s central plateau resulted in direct yield increase by 40% when testing and applying a number of new designed water harvesting techniques for irrigation purpose.
14,"thus, it is recom- mended to engage farmers to national water resources and agricultural development plans to alleviate water scarcity and food insecurity [69]."
15,implication of geo-informatics (gis/rs) on agricultural irrigation. . .
15,"309 recently, the importance of farmer participation through the organization of water users associations (wuas) in irrigation management is well accepted, and they are widely established [5]."
15,allam et al. [70] indicated that establishing wuas and irrigation advisory service (ias) is the key element to improve irrigation water management and increase water productivity.
15,"however, to increase the chance of wuas and ias successfully meeting the objectives, they should be structured with due consideration to the indigenous knowledge and practices in water management."
15,"in egypt, the public awareness regarding lack water availability was increased [10]."
15,"however, several studies cited that the main reason for water availability shortage is the poor distribution rather than the lack of water supply [10, 71, 72]."
15,"moreover, most of the institutions and research organizations are now aware to the importance of land user, and farmers interfere in any designed project or strategy."
15,the egyptian ministry of water resources and irrigation (mwri) also recognized the important role of public perception and end-user effect on the success of any developed strategy.
15,"therefore, and in partnership with usaid, the mwri developed the water communication units (wcus) in 1992 to provide a strong foundation to coordinate and launch public awareness programs [70]."
15,the results and the level of success obtained as a result of the formation of wcu are not available.
15,the mwri promoted as well a public awareness program to apprise people with the relevant role of water resources in the development plans and to encourage water users to positively participate in the decision-making process.
15,"therefore, during the development of the new national water resources plan, all stake- holders, both governmental (ministries, regional authorities) and nongovernmental (industry, water user organizations, etc.), are concerned with the development and use of egypt’s water resources involved [73]."
15,using of high-spatial-resolution imagery may allow monitoring of crop-growing season and crop-water use.
15,such information is highly appreciated by the profes- sional farmers and/or decision-makers.
15,"this information should be easy-to-use so farmers, as main users for those types of information, can deal with it."
15,"nowadays, web-gis, as well as mobile apps, are very effective and monitoring ways to attract the farmers to apply the irrigation management in their fields [74]."
15,"khalkheili and zamani [75] examined multiple factors (demographic, socioeco- nomic, and organizational) which directly affect the farmer participation in irrigation management programs and the obstacles that face the implementation of that pro- gram."
15,their results revealed that the farmers’ participation in irrigation management is increased for the farmers with the greater land area and larger family sizes.
15,6 conclusions agricultural activity and production sector plays a relevant role in world’s food security.
15,approximately one-third of the world population relies on agriculture to obtain its livelihood.
15,"however, water is an important pillar and the main limiting"
16,310 m.
16,elbana et al. factor on agricultural production sector especially in areas vulnerable to any environmental change such as arid and semiarid regions.
16,it is predicted that additional water development actions will be needed in order to accommodate the demands of about two billion people in the world by 2030.
16,"on that base, the need to investigate more methods and invent proper technologies for better exploitation to water in agriculture became a must."
16,evidences do exist that applying precision irrigation is one of the most effective techniques that could improve crop-water productivity in the agricultural sector.
16,this technique is mainly based on under- standing the land heterogeneity and soil water content and treat similar land zones in the same way.
16,"yet, this technique requires combining accurate and highly precise large datasets on land characteristics and water resources, among other factors."
16,geo-informatics (gis rs) are efficient tools in data collection and processing and are widely used on the international level.
16,it proved with evidence its positive and valuable impact on agricultural irrigation water management to maximize the output of the agricultural production system.
16,it saves time and efforts consumed applying trial-and-error method of continuous data sampling.
16,"geo-informatics, when connected with proper decision support tools, can supply decision-makers with suitable and efficient information for more sustainable planning to the country’s natural resources including water share for irrigation."
16,this will result in better food security on both regional and international levels.
16,"nevertheless, the highly elevated maintenance and calibration cost of used sensors in precision irrigation is considered a serious obstacle, especially in devel- oping countries."
16,"in addition, limited access to data availability as well as being expensive are a major dilemma that scientists are facing when attempting to use geo-informatics’ tools for agricultural management."
16,"7 recommendation on the research base, there are substantial efforts to use new advanced technologies such as geo-informatics in water management research area."
16,"however, it is recommended to improve and generalize the applicability of those types of research at the stakeholders’ level instead of only introducing them to the scientific com- munities."
16,"this will require concerted efforts among different entities and commu- nities at research, stakeholder, governmental, and decision-maker levels."
16,"therefore, cooperation on regional and international levels for better planning to increase water productivity in the agricultural sector is a must."
16,these plans should aim to gain more crop production in both quality and quantity with less water consump- tion.
16,"on that base, the following are a set of recommendations and suggestions for more sustainable benefit water exploitation in agricultural sector in egypt."
16,• both scientists and policymakers should work tightly to figure out a suitable solution to overcome the elevated cost of applying geo-informatics and precision irrigation techniques as well as lack of data availability obstacles.
16,they should
17,implication of geo-informatics (gis/rs) on agricultural irrigation. . . 311 focus on producing low-cost procedures and easy access networks to facilitate the produced geo-informatics related models calibration and validation under different conditions.
17,"• the agroecological zoning atlas in egypt needs to be updated and integrated with general and/or specific recommendations for agricultural practices, irriga- tion scheduling, and disease risk management."
17,"• further investigation and periodical update to hydrological, soil properties, land use, and water resource maps would pave the road in adopting the application of geo-informatics in agricultural irrigation and management."
17,"• proper plans, management, and strategies could be of great positive impact on irrigated agricultural sector for world food security."
17,"this requires precise and accurate datasets linked to calibrated and validated decision support models to help both scientific researchers and policymakers to develop the appropriate strategies for more sustainable management to the major natural resources (land, water, crop, and climate)."
17,• there is a need to set series of campaigns to increase farmers’ awareness about safe and rational water use.
17,these campaigns shall emphasize on the successful stories about farms and pilot areas that successfully gain good profit by practic- ing the newly developed techniques recommended by scientists and approved by policymakers.
17,• improving the socioeconomic aspect of landowners and stakeholders needs some immediate actions that can involve but are not limited to: – coin a set of laws and regulations that prohibit the unsafe use of water in irrigation as the agricultural activity is the highest consumer of freshwater. – improve the irrigation and drainage network infrastructure in irrigated fields.
17,"this action can be a cooperative effort of the government, nongovernmental organizations (ngos), and the farmers’ groups."
17,• proper involvement and investigation to public perception are highly recommended when planning the proposed scenarios and strategies.
17,"the environmental, eco- nomic, and social impact resulting from developing the water communication units (wcus) in egypt should be scientifically documented and evaluated for better future planning for public involvement in agricultural developing projects."
