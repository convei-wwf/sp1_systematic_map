5,evaluation of prediction accuracy the simulated validation procedure began with the pro- cess model and process error.
5,this model was used to sim- ulate data from eight independent spces between a weed and a crop.
5,a level of growing season precipitation was as- signed to each spce based on a random draw from a dis- tribution of precipitation records assembled for 985 (post- editing) site-years of data from 27 sites within the wheat- producing area of north-central montana (figure 2).
5,"eight experiment stations in a region surrounding a farm repre- sents a higher density than the two experiment stations that actually exist in this region of montana, but we entered into the analysis with the utmost optimism in maximizing the spce data available for making predictions."
5,nonlinear least squares regression (wolfram research inc. 1999) was used to fit the data combined from the eight spce sites.
5,we considered three scenarios for fitting the spce data.
5,"the first was to fit the data without including the influence of precipitation (three-parameter model), that is, we assumed that we had no knowledge of the influence of precipitation on weed-free yield when, in fact, it was the process generating variation in weed-free yield in the sim- ulated spce data."
5,"the second scenario included growing season precipitation in the regression model (six-parameter model), that is, we assumed that the specific relationship between growing season precipitation and weed-free yield was known (i.e., perfect knowledge of the cause of variation in weed-free yield)."
5,the six-parameter model was identical in form to the process model that generated the spce data.
5,"thus, the only sources of variation, other than weed density, when using the six-parameter model to fit data, were the process noise («i) and the fixed site factor (g)."

7,"the inclusion of the fixed site factor (e.g., depth to hard- pan) described in equation 4 resulted in predictions that were markedly degraded when compared with the case where such site factors were not known."

7,one of the advantages of exploring prediction accuracy using simulation was that we could explore the effects that different types of errors had on prediction.
