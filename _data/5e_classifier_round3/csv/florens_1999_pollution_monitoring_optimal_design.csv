1,introduction the game between polluters and a monitoring agency in which the polluter is convicted and pays a fine when it is observed by the agency is studied.
1,polluters are given greater or lesser incentives to pollute by the extent of the agency’s in- vestment in monitoring.
1,the agency is aware that agents behave strategically and tries to optimize the design of inspections.
1,the central issue is to define whether and when the purchase of costly-but-imperfect information about the likelihood of fraud increases social welfare.
1,we model the strategic behavior of a polluter with monetary incentives to pollute and a social-welfare-maximizing agency that designs an inspection scheme for pollution deterrence.
1,pollution is generated by tankers refusing to pay to clean their tanks after dis- charging an oil cargo.
1,"indeed, when tankers discharge oil, some of it is left clinging to the insides of the holds."
1,these deposits have to be cleaned off before the tanker is loaded with the ballast sea water required to assure the tanker’s stability during its return voyage.
1,ballast is discharged in the sea before the tanker is loaded with the next oil cargo.
1,"however, when tankers do not clean their tanks, which is costly *we gratefully thank jacques cremer for his helpful comments, as well as philippe bally, louis demargne, and louis-francois guerre for their useful information on satellite imagery."
1,we also thank the associate editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.
1,all responsibility for this document and for the analysis on the benefits of satellite imagery is ours.

2,"82 florens and foucher and time-consuming, the water discharge contains oil."
2,"such oil dumping is forbid- den by the law in “special zones,” whose number is increasing under pressure from the international maritime organization (imo), affiliated with the united nations."
2,"so far, pollution is deterred by aerial inspection of maritime areas."
2,"technical progress now makes it feasible to detect oil pollution from satellite images (more precisely, from sar’ imagery)."
2,we compare two monitoring techniques: aerial mon- itoring and the combined use of aerial observation and satellite information.
2,the major advantage of satellite information is that it can be used to monitor much larger areas than with aerial techniques.
2,"however, satellite observation is not ac- curate enough to prove fraud in court and thus cannot replace aerial surveillance."
2,"nevertheless, since pollution can be detected on a satellite image, planes can be sent to the zones suspected on satellite images in order to confirm the pollution."
2,satellite information enables the agency to restrict control where pollution occurs with a greater degree of certainty.
2,we study the consequences of buying satellite information before selecting the ships to control.
2,when does costly and imperfect satellite information improve social welfare?
2,"from a normative point of view, pollution is not good or bad a priori."
2,it is bad when its social cost exceeds the costs of fighting against it.
2,"much of the literature on pollution control defines the environmental policy which achieves an exogenous pollution level [ l , 91."
2,"we endogenize this level, which depends on the cost of pollu- tion deterrence, and we provide a cost-benefit analysis of pollution deterrence by a welfare-maximizing agency."
2,the model gives the investment that society should dedicate to pollution monitoring and the resulting pollution level.
2,the choice of appropriate policy instruments to achieve a fixed environmental standard has been widely debated.
2,"the literature has focused on the pros and cons of instruments such as (i) selling of licenses [ l ] , (ii) taxes and subsidies [9], and (iii) direct controls."
2,"here, pollution is punished when it is observed."
2,the punishment is an exogenous and individual fine.
2,we show that the decision to purchase satellite information does not always rely on the trade-off between increase in monitoring costs and decrease in pollution.
2,"in- deed, we prove that, at the nash equilibrium of the game, reduction of pollution is compatible with decrease in monitoring cost, compared to a situation in which only aerial observation is used."
2,we provide a condition for both pollution and cost arguments to be in favor of the use of satellite imagery.
2,we also show that the condition for satellite information to decrease pollution does not depend on the accuracy of satellite information.
2,the comparison of social welfares at the equilib- rium with both techniques is done in a numerical example applied to the channel and the mediterranean sea.
2,"we show that, if the value of the social cost of pollu- tion is high enough, satellite information must be purchased."
2,"moreover, we discuss, depending on this cost, the origin of the benefits of satellite information in both geographical zones."
2,"i.e., synthetic aperture radar."
2,"as opposed to optical satellites like the french spot or the american landsat, radar satellites can “see” through clouds and in the night."
2,"the main radar satellites currently operating are the european ers 1 and 2, the canadian radarsat, and the japanese jers."
2,the radar emits its own energy and records how that energy is reflected from the objects that are illuminated.
2,it is particularly well suited to the surveillance of highly reflecting areas like the sea.
2,what is called “satellite information” refers to the information provided by radar satellites.
3,pollution monitoring 83 we first describe the current international regulation of deliberate oil spills and present some cases of conviction of offenders (section 2).
3,then we present the theoretical model (section 3).
3,"finally, we provide a numerical example (section 4) based on realistic estimates of the parameters considered in the theoretical model applied to the channel and the mediterranean sea."
3,regulation of pollution and conviction of polluters the phenomenon of deliberate oil spills is much more frequent than public aware- ness suggests.
3,"indeed, whereas the best known cause of oil pollution in the sea is tanker accidents, a much greater amount of oil enters the sea as a result of the tankers’ normal operations: according to the american national research council2 [5], 23% of total maritime pollution is caused by normal tanker operations versus 12% for tanker accidents."
3,the marpol 73/78 convention established by the imo limits the amount of oil that ships are allowed to discharge into the sea during routine operations and bans it completely in some areas.
3,"moreover, another series of measures has been adopted in 1983 by nations along the north sea and the channel coastlines, to rein- force the control and application of the rules defined by this marpol convention."
3,"with these measures, known as the “bonn agreement,” germany, belgium, france, norway, holland, great britain, and sweden have developed a program to ease the gathering of evidence for prosecution of those responsible for oil dumping in the sea."
3,"in the past decade, the international community has become more and more aware of this phenomenon and of its environmental damages (ecological threats, losses to fishery, reduction of tourism, nuisance to industrial plants on the coast)."
3,incentives given to ships to respect the environment have also been very low.
3,"in- deed, facilities on shore for receiving oil were often missing, and tankers had no choice but to discharge dirty sea ballast water into the sea."
3,"moreover, polluters were rarely convicted due to stringent legal procedures and to a lack of homogene- ity in national rules."
3,"for instance, polluters were condemned if oil samples were extracted from both the sea and the tanker’s cargo and if a comparison of these samples yielded positive results."
3,a recent easing of these procedures has been observed.
3,"the direct observation of pollution by plane is sometimes sufficient for courts to condemn the offender: in 1995, and for the first time in france, a ship was fined (ca., $5000) for illegal dumping and the verdict relied on aerial observation."
3,"the sanction was very low compared to the penalty asked in 1997 of the song san, which received, for polluting extensive areas of singapore’s beaches, the heaviest sentence in maritime history for oil pollution, including the first jail time for the culprits: $450,000 for the tanker owner, $400,000 for the ship agent, and $400,000 and 13 months jail for the ship master, as well as two weeks jail for the ship’s chief officer3 (so far, the heaviest monetary penalty had been $150,000 on the singapore refining company in 1995)."
3,direct observation of pollution has not been sufficient to condemn the polluter: comparison of oil samples from the ship and from the water proved the pollution.

4,"84 florens and foucher however, satellite photographs were used by the maritime and port authority of singapore to prove that the song sun was the only ship that could have spilled oil."
4,the marpol convention also aims at making sure that harbor facilities for receiving oil exist.
4,"these facilities are still sometimes missing, which prevents imo from enlarging the number of areas where discharges are forbidden."
4,improvements regarding easing of legal procedures and extension of harbor receiving facilities will take time.
4,"however, an increased interest in this phenomenon and a desire to discourage this pollution have arisen."
4,aerial monitoring is still the observation technique most widely used to detect illegal oil discharges.
4,european countries invest significant resources in the inspec- tion of maritime areas.
4,"in france, for example, two planes equipped with modern radar systems are devoted to this purpose."
4,the use of satellite information to locate probable pollution is still marginal.
4,"nevertheless, an operational monitoring system combining aerial and satellite information has been developed by norwegian au- thorities: satellite pictures of norway’s maritime area are acquired daily, providing real time information (the picture is available about two hours after satellite track- ing) on sea surface conditions, which directs aerial monitoring."
4,the prior selection by the satellite of the areas to inspect in priority enables authorities to monitor much larger areas.
4,a complete aerial observation of large maritime zones is prohibitively expensive.
4,"for instance, bedborough [2] states that a daily air surveillance of the entire u.k. territorial water surface would cost e3.5 millions and is therefore practically impossible."
4,"today, the 800 hours flown per year for &320,000correspond to only 10% of that requirement."
4,"as a result, when planes fly randomly over shipping routes, the fight against pollution is extremely costly."
4,the following model discusses the acquisition of satellite information to design aerial inspection by a social-welfare-maximizing monitoring agency.
4,the model 3.1.
4,strategic behaviors 3.1.1.
4,"potential polluters the fraud considered is pollution, but it could be any other illegal activity creat- ing negative externalities."
4,"each one of n agents of type t e [0, 11 has a different incentive to pollute: when it pollutes, agent t saves the cost 6 + t of having its tanks cleaned in harbor."
4,"the alternative is to dirty the sea ballast water that is later dumped into the sea, which is illegal."
4,"with a probability of being caught p e [0, 11, the polluter risks a sanction: a fine cp such that cp > 6 + 1."
4,"an agent knows its type, but the monitoring agency only knows the cumulative distribution function p ( . ) of the types t."
4,an agent either creates one pollution or does not pollute at all.
4,the volume of pollution in the society equals the number of polluters.
4,"pollution occurs when the expected profit of a polluter is higher than what he or she obtains if he or she abides by the law, i.e., when 6 + t - pcp > 0."
4,"thus, given p , the probability q f ( p )that an agent pollutes is"
5,pollution monitoring 85 3.1.2.
5,"monitoring agency the external costs, or disutility, generated by a volume v of pollution are l ( v ) , with 1'( v)> 0."
5,"the monitoring agency invests4 c = c( p, f ) in pollution deterrence."
5,"as sources of government revenue, fines are not part of social welfare since they . ~ index i refers to the are just transfers from agents to the monitoring a g e n ~ y the observation technique considered ( i = 1 for aerial monitoring, i = 2 for satellite and aerial monitoring) and is applied similarly to c, w , and p ."
5,"the monitoring agency optimizes the social welfare w,(p, p ) = -l""qdp>] - g(p, p ) ."
5,(2) the fine cp is exogenous for limited liability reasons.
5,"indeed, since we consider risk-neutral individuals, the optimal value of an endogenized fine equals the wealth of individuals [ 7 ] ."
5,"this result is true no matter the cost of catching individuals, which is the key issue of our analysis."
5,"in order to focus on the link between this cost and other parameters of our economy, the value of the fine is assumed to be given."
5,"the probability of catching criminals, p, is therefore the only tool available to the monitoring agency in order to fight against pollution, and we have pt = arg max w,(p, p ) ."
5,(3) p it is not necessary to inspect all polluters in order to prevent all of them from polluting.
5,"this is due to the deterring effect of the fine: the higher the exogenous level of the fine, the lower the probability of catching polluters p that is required to deter pollution."
5,"a l . t is uniformly distributed on [0, 11."
5,"assumption let p2 be the solution of the first order necessary condition with a uniform dis- tribution of types: ~ c xp /'""(i - p2cp + a)] = c , ' ( ~ , , f ) , i = 1,2."
5,"(4) then the optimal monitoring policy pt is such that: argmin{c,(o), c,($)} if p2 < h i f s- < p-, i l + s ( 0 - (0 (5) argmin{cl(l), c,(?)}"

5,"< $, then qf(p ) = 1 and everybody pollutes, and when p2 > then y, qf(p) = 0 and nobody pollutes."
5,"the different specifications of the monitoring costs c,(p, f ) described below cor- respond to the observation techniques that we aim to compare."
5,we will explain later why c ( . ) may depend on f .
5,"we ignore the investment made in order to bring detected criminals to court, and the cost of cleaning tanks in harbor is not included in the social welfare function, although its addition does not significantly alter the results."
6,86 florens and foucher 3.2.
6,monitoring techniques: specijications and optimal inspection schemes we compare two observation schemes: aerial observation and a combination of satellite information with aerial observation.
6,"with the second technique, the agency buys some information about the likelihood of the pollution, and then defines the aerial observation scheme."
6,we study the arguments justifying the purchase of satel- lite information.
6,pollution threatens a geographical zone divided into s areas of size 1.
6,this size is taken small enough so that there can be at most one polluter per area.
6,each area may be inspected by plane.
6,we assume that the aerial observation of a polluted area is necessary and sufficient to impose the fine cp to the polluter.
6,3.2.1.
6,aerial observation only monitoring costs are made up of a fixed cost c of airplane acquisition and a cost cs proportional to the number s of areas observed (c is the cost per area monitored in terms of fuel and pilots' wages).
6,"the areas to monitor are chosen randomly, and therefore the probability of detecting fraud equals the probability of surveillance of any area: p = + s = sp."
6,"the monitoring cost function is6 c,(p, p ) = c + csp (6) and the optimal monitoring policy pt maximizes the social welfare for i = 1, i.e., let z be the solution of the first-order necessary condition of (7) with a uniform distribution of types, i.e., solving cs i""n( 1 - ecp + a)] = ~ cp"" then the optimal monitoring policy p ; is such that: p ~ = i 0 - 'p if z < 3 (everybody pollutes) fij<zss+' 'p - if z 'p > s+1 'p 3.2.2."
6,using satellite information to design aerial observation 'p (nobody pollutes).
6,satellite information is now purchased prior to aerial surveillance.
6,"the satellite (9) image provides imperfect information about the location of oil dumping: the prob- ability of pollution over an area suspected on the image is high, but the satellite hardly differentiates oil from other dark elements at the sea surface, and therefore might also draw suspicion to unpolluted areas."
6,"thanks to this prior information, the monitoring agency schedules more efficient aerial inspection, but the purchase of images is a fixed cost added to monitoring costs."
6,"to simplify, we do not take into account the geographical location, but only the number of suspected areas in the satellite image."
6,"in the case of aerial observation only, the cost function does not depend on f"
7,"pollution monitoring 87 the satellite information provides a signal uj, j = 1, . . . , s, about the likelihood of pollution in each area j ."
7,"for all s areas, satellite information indicates whether the fraud is probable (crj = 1) or improbable (crj = 0)."
7,"by assumption, it is impos- sible to buy the information for only part of the total area s ."
7,"the areas potentially monitored by plane are chosen among areas where pollution is probable {j/crj = l} (by assumption, one never inspects by plane the areas j in which crj = 0)."
7,the surveillance is in two steps: stage 1.
7,"purchase of satellite information, or signal aj,indicating whether or not pollution is suspected on area j , for j = 1, . . . , s."
7,stage 2.
7,aerial monitoring and selection of the suspicious areas to monitor.
7,to prove pollution requires aerial observation.
7,"the fixed cost i ( a , p ) of satellite information depends on its accuracy ( a , p ) , where a is the probability that fraud is declared probable on an area with pollu- tion, and p < a is the probability that fraud is declared probable over an area where no pollution occurred (in general, 1 - a is called the type i error, and p the type i1 error)."
7,"we have > 0 and $ < 0 ( ( a ,p ) = (1,o) characterizes perfect information)."
7,the accuracy of satellite information is lowered by “noise” at the surface of the sea that modifies the message (wavelength) transmitted to the satellite.
7,"for instance, the message sent to the satellite when there is vegetation on the surface is the same as in the case of pollution."
7,"if we assume that a4 “noisy elements” exist on the s areas ( m < s ) , then $ is the probability of noise on an area."
7,"we call the probability of receiving the message “pollution”because of the existence of noise on the area, p; i.e., p = p x ms."
7,"as with completely random observation, monitoring costs are divided into a fixed and a variable part."
7,"the fixed part includes plane equipment c and satellite images i ( a , p)."
7,variable monitoring costs cs only refer to aerial operating costs (fuel and pilots’ wages).
7,proposition 1.
7,"when satellite information is used to design aerial inspection, the monitoring cost function equals c2(p,p ) = c + i ( a , p ) + csp-ba - the area monitored by plane depends on the distribution of the polluters."
7,"proof;’ we call y e (0, 1) the decision by the monitoring agency whether to monitor any area j ."
7,the probability that any area j is monitored by plane is pr(y = 1) = pr(y = 1 i crj = 1) x pr(crj = 1) + pr(y = 1 i crj = 0) x pr(crj = 0).
7,"then, if s is large, the number of areas monitored by plane is pr(y = 1 i uj = 1) x pr(uj = 1) s=sx +pr(y = 1 i crj = 0) x pr(crj = 0) we assume that only areas with a suspicious satellite signal are monitored by plane, i.e., pr(y = 1 i uj = 0) = 0."
8,"88 florens and foucher moreover, the probability of getting a suspicious signal is a over polluted areas, p over non-polluted areas."
8,"these probabilities are contingent of a ship being in the area, which is not always the case."
8,the probability of finding a ship on a randomly taken area is $.
8,"thus, the probability of a suspicious signal is finally, the probability of detecting pollution, p, equals the probability of mon- itoring an area over which a suspicious signal aj is obtained, multiplied by the probability of a suspicious signal over a polluted area a ; i.e., p = pr(y = 1 i aj = 1 ) x pr(aj = 1 i area j polluted) p pr(y = 1 i aj."
8,"= 1) = -. e a we get and then c, ( p ,f ) = c + i ( a ,p ) + cs p-a c,(p, f ) = c + i ( a , p ) + csp-pa - cnpx -x ( 1 - p q a + 6)."
8,i corollary 2.
8,"in the uniform case, monitoring costs are increasingfor p 5 p"" and decreasingfor p > p""."
8,"thus, increasingpollution detection is compatible with decreasing monitoring costs."
8,"proo$ the proof is straightforward: as a result, for p > j?, lower monitoring costs also mean lower pollution."
8,"i for p 2 f, to monitor fewer areas means to detect more polluters."
8,"this is ex- plained by two opposing effects of a variation in p on the (variable) observation costs: direct effect (positive) : to increase pollution detection requires higher invest- ment for monitoring; thus, an increase in p increases (the variable part of) the cost c2(p,f ) ."
9,"pollution monitoring 89 indirect eflect (negative) : when information is collated, monitoring costs de- pend on individual behaviors (presence of q f ( p )in c 2 ( p ,f ) ) ."
9,"an increase in pol- lution detection p persuades some individuals not to pollute; thus it reduces the number of areas suspected, and thus inspected."
9,"via the individual behaviors, an increase in p decreases the cost c 2 ( p ,f ) ."
9,"in the uniform case, the function c 2 ( p ,f ) is concave."
9,"lemma proo$ the proof is straightforward: i thus, the optimal monitoring policy p ; maximizes the social welfare for i = 2 and for the cost function c 2 ( p ,f ) defined in proposition 1."
9,"we then have p ; = arg max w2(p,f ) pa), 11 let z be the solution of the first order necessary condition of (12) with a uniform distribution, i.e., solving (13) then the optimal monitoring policy p ; is such that 0 if < 3 (everybody pollutes) ia h . a h pz if - < p2 5 s+1 (14) ia- ia i s+1 ia if z > s+1 (nobody pollutes). ia considering the optimal monitoring policies pr and p ; , we now specify the condi- tions under which satellite information acquisition decreases pollution and/or mon- itoring costs."
9,"justification for satellite information acquisition the value of satellite information is positive if and only if it increases social welfare owing to a decrease in pollution, a decrease in monitoring costs, or both."
9,"we study conditions in which it decreases pollution, and then in which it decreases monitoring costs."

10,"proo$ notice that the concavity assumption implies that the second order con- ditions of maximization of m/;(p),i = 1 , 2 are satisfied."
10,"we compare w ; ( p ) and w,l(p), which are equal to zero respectively on pt and p;."

11,"stressing the role of the social cost of pollution, we pointed out the conditions under which costly acquisition of information reduces pollution when the optimal policy is chosen."

11,corollary 5.
11,"if the aim of the government is to achieve a level of pollution lower + than l [ n (1 - pcp a)], then using satellite information is less costly than relying only on aerial monitoring."
11,this level is achievable if and only if q / i > h.
11,"proo$ as shown in previous sections, the monitoring cost functions with and without satellite information are as shown in fig."
11,monitoring using satellite information is less costly for policies that target a pol- lution below l [ n ( 1 - pcp + s)].

12,numerical example the model of the previous section is now computed in a numerical example ap- plied to the choice of the optimal monitoring policy by a social-welfare-maximizing monitoring agency.
12,parameters are quantified over two regions: the channel and the mediterranean sea.
12,"the awareness of the phenomenon of illegal oil dumping is still very limited, and the lack of data prevents any econometric estimates."
12,most of the parameters were assessed following discussions with monitoring agency managers and with experts in the development of satellite techniques.
12,simulations of the values for poorly quantified parameters are suggested.
12,"according to this information, the estimates in table i seem realistic (all figures are computed on an annual basis)."
12,the values taken for a and are arbitrary.
12,the fixed cost of plane equipment c is included in the variable aerial costs.
12,* this enables us to take into account that an increase in the number of areas monitored by plane may increase the fixed cost c (need for more planes to cover the required surface).
12,"the disutility of pollution is assumed to be quadratic; that is, 2 l(v) = 5v , where 5 > 0 measures the social cost of pollution."
12,"the comparison between mon- itoring techniques depends on 5, which is very hard to quantify."

13,"at the equilibrium, the pollution is lower when satellite information is used if 5 > 8.3e - 10 in the channel, and 5 > 1."
13,ge - 09 in the mediterranean sea.
13,these are very small lower bounds for 5 compared to the values computed above (0.2 and 0.5).
13,"moreover, a value of 10e - 05 for 5 corresponds to a monetary loss of only $100 for 1000 annual pol- lutions."
13,"therefore, we can reasonably consider that 5 >> 1."
13,"ge - 09, and thus that the probability of detecting pollution is always higher when satellite information is used."
13,"as shown in the model, this does not depend on the technical precision of satellite information."
13,"satellite information is less costly when the social disutility of pollution is high enough (i.e., when 5 > 0.003 in the channel, and 5 > 0.3 in the mediterranean sea)."
13,"then, satellite information increases social welfare when pollution is costly to society (i.e., 5 > 0.0015 in the channel, and 5 > 0.2 in the mediterranean sea)."
13,the link between the optimal monitoring technique and the social cost of pollu- tion is as shown in fig.
13,"the simulations give channel: a = 0.00095, b = 0.0015, c = 0.003, and d = 0.1."
13,"mediterranean sea: a = 0.1, b = 0.2, c = 0.3, and d > 20."
13,"for low values of 5, aerial inspection is optimal because it is less costly."
13,"when satellite information is acquired at the optimum, the arguments justifying this pur- chase (in italics on the diagram) are either the reduction of pollution (for b 5 5 5 c ) , the decrease in monitoring costs (for 5 > d ) , or both (for c 5 5 i d ) ."
13,"intuitions are the following: when the disutilig of pollution is low,the investment to deter pollution is low at the optimum."
13,satellite information is used only if the savings in terms of variable monitoring costs exceed the fixed cost of acquisition.
13,"this is true when investment in monitoring is high enough, i.e., when pollution is sufficiently costly to society: for 5 2 b."

14,"94 florens and foucher for intermediate values of the disutility of pollution, benefits of reduced pollution exceed the cost of satellite information: although monitoring costs are higher, bene- fits in terms of pollution justify the purchase of satellite information at the optimum."
14,"when the disutilig of pollution is high, the area monitored by plane at the optimum is large enough so that the savings in aerial monitoring costs exceed the purchase of satellite information: then not only does the purchase of satellite information dissuade polluters, but also it is less costly."
14,"above a threshold d , optimal policies require no pollution whatever the technique used and the pollution argument disappears."
14,"however, to reach such a level, the size of the area monitored by plane must be much larger when no prior information is gathered."
14,"then, savings in monitoring costs that allow satellite information justify its acquisition at the optimum."
14,"a s an illustration, consider the case 5 = 0.2, i.e., 1000 dumpings per year in the mediterranean sea would cost $200,000 to society."
14,"then the value of satellite information is positive (annual welfare benefits of $700,000) since the benefits of a pollution decrease exceed the increase in monitoring costs."
14,"in terms ofpollution, aerial inspection induces 3600 annual pollutions at the equi- librium (37% of polluters caught), whereas satellite information induces 568 annual pollutions (62% of polluters caught)."
14,the monetary benefits are estimated to be $2.5 million per year.
14,"in terms of cost, satellite information increases monitoring costs since 79 million square kilometers inspected by plane cost $6.3 million, whereas 20 million square kilometers inspected by plane cost $8.1 million including the fixed cost of satellite images."
14,"the model also advises on investment for satellite production: if the government targeted an annual budget of $100 million for satellite production and operation, then the satellite would be produced if the sum of the expected social benefits of satellite information for all applications exceeded this value."
14,"for 5 = 0.2, pollution detection in the mediterranean sea represents about 0.7% of total requirements, 2.2% for 5 = 0.5, 3% for 5 = 3.5."
14,"finally, this model also serves as an argument to optimize the pricing policy of images."
14,"for example, if 5 = 0.1 (i.e., 1000 annual pollutions in the mediterranean cost society $loo,ooo), then the value of satellite information is positive if the price of an image is below $430."
14,conclusion the model presents two economic arguments in favor of satellite control: (1) reduction of pollution and (2) decrease in monitoring costs without increasing pol- lution.
14,"it shows that, at the equilibrium, the optimal monitoring technique does not depend on the trade-off between increase in cost and decrease in pollution."
14,satel- lite information restricts the monitoring to the agents who pose the greatest risk as polluters and allows pollution decrease with fewer aerial controls.
14,"therefore, us- ing satellite information, a reduction of pollution is compatible with a decrease in monitoring costs."
14,the possibility of observing pollution has a deterrent effect that increases when satellite information is purchased.
14,"the example confirms that, with realistic estimations for the parameters of the model, the use of satellite informa- tion may deter more pollution and also be less costly than aerial monitoring, as soon as the social cost of pollution is above a level justified empirically."
14,"when the social cost of pollution increases, then the cost argument alone remains."
15,"pollution monitoring 95 beyond the comparison of monitoring techniques, our motivation is to define the optimal investment for satellite production and the optimal satellite configuration."
15,"pollution detection is one of many potential applications of satellite imagery, and the following study should be conducted for the main potential applications."
15,the sum of expected values of satellite images for these applications estimates the social value of satellite information.
15,the methodology is also of interest for monitoring authorities seeking to decide whether it is efficient for them to invest in a receiving system for satellite imagery.
15,"one may argue that there are other, and possibly easier, ways to discourage oil discharges than to try to detect the pollution ex post."
15,to make sure that tanks are cleaned before tankers leave the harbor is one possibility.
15,"for practical and juridi- cal reasons, this solution is not considered by national authorities."
15,the obligation for ships to be fitted with segregated tanks for the carriage of the ballast water is another possibility.
15,"in 1992, marpol was actually amended to make it mandatory for new tankers to be equipped with double hulls."
15,this applies for all tankers or- dered after july 1993.
15,"but the adoption of internationally agreed standards is only part of the battle, and it will no doubt take a long time before all tankers satisfy the new legislation."
15,"therefore, imo also initiates procedures to help nations fight pol- lution ex post."
15,"pollution deterrence is currently achieved through the observation and condemnation of the polluters, which was the solution considered here, with the aim of optimizing the inspection scheme."
15,several extensions to this model may be suggested.
15,"for instance, partial monitoring of large areas should be possible."
15,"the inspection scheme would then correspond to a two-stage system: firms would first be subject to sampling, selecting the amount and location of the information to acquire, and then to a second sampling for those that appeared to be potential violators in the first stage."
15,"moreover, the spatial dimensions of the observation were not considered."
15,"once pollution is detected on a satellite image, the plane dispatched to confirm this vi- olation inevitably flies over areas where no signal was given."
15,"therefore, the aerial observation costs were underestimated in the second technique considered, but this is partly balanced by the fact that the probability of fraud deterrence is likely to be higher since planes may thus also detect pollution."
15,"refining the estimates of parameters used in the numerical example (channel and mediterranean sea) would be necessary for the results to be used as real guides to policy makers, rather than as simple illustrations."
15,"finally, the model and numerical example strengthen the importance of the so- cial costs of this pollution in the assessment of the value of satellite information for pollution monitoring, which could be estimated using the contingent valuation method."
