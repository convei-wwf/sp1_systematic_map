1,"as missions increasingly require a broader ‘‘earth systems’’ focus, it is important that the osses capture the potential benefits of the observations on end-use applications."
1,"toward this end, the results from the osses must also be evaluated with a suite of metrics that capture the value, uncertainty, and information content of the observations while factoring in both science and societal impacts."
1,this article presents a soil moisture osse that employs simulated l-band measurements and assesses its utility toward improving drought and flood risk estimates using the nasa land information system (lis).
1,a decision-theory-based analysis is conducted to assess the economic utility of the observations toward improving these applications.
1,"the results suggest that the improvements in surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and total runoff fields obtained through the assimilation of l-band measurements are effective in providing improvements in the drought and flood risk assessments as well."
1,the decision-theory analysis not only demonstrates the economic utility of observations but also shows that the use of probabilistic information from the model simulations is more beneficial compared to the use of corresponding deterministic estimates.
1,"the experiment also demonstrates the value of a comprehensive modeling environment such as lis for conducting end-to-end osses by linking satellite observations, physical models, data assimilation algorithms, and end-use application models in a single integrated framework."

11,"in each computation, the cost–loss (c/l) ratios are varied from 0.01 to 0.9 to determine the trade-off in voi as a function of c/l ratio."
11,figure 8 (top) shows voi as a function of c/l ratio from the deterministic cost–loss model.
11,"the behavior of voi is similar for both applica- tions, with the added value of observations reducing with increasing severity of drought (from d0 to d4) and flood risks (from f0 to f4)."
11,"for example, in the deterministic drought example (fig. 8, top left), da leads to approxi- mately 20% ‘‘cost savings’’ (voi) for the d0 category for a c/l ratio of 0.01."
11,the voi reduces to approximately 8% for a c/l ratio of 0.9.
11,"the flood risk example (fig. 8, top right) also shows a similar behavior, with the cost savings varying from approximately 9% to 4%."
11,"note that in all four plots of fig. 8, the voi values are always greater than 0, indicating that da provides sys- tematic improvements over ol in all drought and flood risk cases."
