1,"this sometimes scarce resource primarily comes from rivers, and international river basins (irbs), where watersheds and watercourses cross political boundaries, are often spaces of great political tension and conflict worldwide."
1,"such conflict potential has garnered interest from a wide range of research communities, and each emphasises public access to hydrologic data as integral to successful international management of irbs."
1,"however; these hydrologic data, especially measurements of river flow rate, are often closely guarded state secrets."
1,satellites have been cited as a key technology set to challenge this data monopoly that have yet been unable to calculate river flow rate without some form of guarded ancillary data.
1,"now, at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (amhg) offers a means of circumventing data limitations without any a priori information, and the forthcoming nasa/cnes surface water and ocean topography (swot) satellite also promises to estimate flow rates solely from its novel measurements following launch."
1,"in this paper, we explore how these newly available estimates of river flow rate could reconfigure water-management and interstate relations in irbs, and demonstrate amhg, for two cases: the ganges–brahmaputra and mekong."
1,for these basins we find that satellite flow rate retrievals will likely reinforce and favour state-level negotiations of water resource governance.
1,"also, satellite flow retrievals can have the direct, concrete effect of improving hydrologic understanding of the upstream ganges–brahmaputra, a sorely needed advance that will positively benefit millions of bangladeshis and affect state-level interactions between india, china, and bangladesh."
1,"finally, we avoid offering prescriptive water management solutions for each case, as local stakeholders will ultimately determine if and how such satellite retrievals will be used."

8,"indeed, ‘the lack of basic data about instream flows . . . undermines the ability of downstream countries to negotiate to protect necessary minimum flow levels as outlined by the mekong agreement’ (bakker 1999, 218), and flow rate data are considered too thorny an issue to tackle at a general mrc meeting (sneddon and fox 2006)."
8,"while hydrologic modelling work that assimilates rainfall and land cover data has been performed to calculate flow rates within the basin, accurate estimates of flow are not made publically available by states that collect them for much of the mekong basin (haddeland et al."
8,2006; kite 2001).
8,flow data for yunnan province are especially difficult to acquire and china has yet to share it with downstream states.
8,"the mrc has therefore officially requested information from china about dam- building activity and flow rates via a memorandum of understanding, but such information has not proven forthcoming (lebel et al."
8,2005).
8,"much like the us bureau of reclamation in its original studies of figure 3 this map charts the course of mekong river from the mekong, china uses its expertise to impose a yunnan province in china to the sea, with its watershed ‘technically superior’ science of water on the mekong given as a dashed line."

8,"this policy (thailand, cambodia, vietnam, and lao pdr) contribute constructs a data monopoly – and a bargaining 80% of the flow to the mekong."
8,"despite this water position – that satellite flow retrievals could balance, chinese water management practices can significantly alter. seriously affect downstream states, and dam building here, we use a publically available (via the grdc) within and outside china is the principal source of water gauge record to validate an amhg discharge resource conflict in this basin."
8,"flow estimations were estimation for the mekong main stem at mukdahan, performed using a gauge provided by the grdc at thailand (figure 3), using 12 landsat mss/tm images mukdahan, thailand collected from 1972 to 1982 (table 1)."

8,"for instance in with the ganges (and other world rivers), the method 1992, which was not a drought year, filling of a dam underestimates peak flows, tends to converge in yunnan corresponded to unusually low discharge as toward mean flow, represents discontinuous flow recorded at downstream stations (lu and siew 2006). estimates over several years, and is limited by in addition, unannounced water releases from available image data."
8,"however, the mekong case chinese dams have directly led to loss of life and again demonstrates the ability of amhg to provide property in downstream cambodia (lebel et al."

8,"‘chinese discussion: exploring the cases policy’ in the brahmaputra therefore may not map neatly onto the mekong, though comparison could the flow retrievals given here present point still prove beneficial (ho 2014)."
8,"in addition, china has estimations of river discharge without in situ data or a shown a preference for bilateral action and has been priori knowledge in two irbs where upstream data are more cooperative with regard to navigational uses of tightly controlled."
8,"this is the first such demonstration the mekong than it has with regard to dam building, of this kind, yet unless there is a significant advance in where it does not share its assessment of potential global image availability, amhg alone will not be downstream dam impacts (ho 2014; masviriyakul able to provide a full water balance in either case."
