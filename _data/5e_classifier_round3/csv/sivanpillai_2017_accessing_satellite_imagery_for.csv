1,red river charter members provided post-ﬂood and pre-ﬂood or archived rs data after the april 2011 ﬂoods in the remote sensing midwestern us.
1,these multispectral and radar images provided valuable information to end users and ﬁrst data policy responders in the ﬂood aﬀected states for their planning and relief eﬀorts.
1,"this eﬀort was successful because of data distribution the process established by the charter for soliciting requests, and acquiring and distributing data through a disaster response network of international and national agencies, and data vendors."
1,"this paper describes the a) role played by the charter to acquire and distribute rs data through six of its members, b) value of archived satellite data, c) need for image processing experts to process these near real-time data, and transfer them in a timely manner, and d) data acquisition and distribution policies of the charter."
