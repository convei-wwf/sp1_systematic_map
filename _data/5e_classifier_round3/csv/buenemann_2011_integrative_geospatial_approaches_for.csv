1,monitoring and assessment (m&a) can support decision-making by providing this information.
1,"as implied by the 10-year strategy of the united nations convention to combat desertiﬁcation (unccd), however, m&a efforts have thus far been insufﬁcient or inadequate."
1,we argue that integrative geospatial approaches should be implemented to enhance dryland management decision-making.
1,"by assimilating and linking human and environmental data, qualitative and quantitative data, as well as ﬁeld and remotely sensed data in a spatially explicit framework, such approaches facilitate assessments of both the complexities and place-speciﬁcities inherent to sustainability."
1,"in addition, they help represent different stakeholder perspectives, promote communication among scientists from diverse backgrounds as well as between scientiﬁc and local experts, facilitate inter-institutional knowledge sharing, and create synergy between the unccd and other conventions."
1,"due to these beneﬁts as well as the rapid evolution and increasing availability and affordability of geospatial data and technologies in all countries, it is appropriate to begin capitalizing more fully on them now for the m&a of land management sustainability."
1,"in order for integrative geospatial approaches to become more central to m&a efforts, however, capacities and infrastructure must be improved and standards and protocols developed for the collection, analysis, and modeling of data, for the evaluation of outputs, and for the reporting of results."

2,two major geospatial technologies are remote sensing and geographic information systems.
2,remote sensing facilitates the acquisition of information about earth’s surface by means of sensors that are not in physical contact with that surface.
2,remote sensing products such as satellite imagery and aerial photography yield spatial and temporal information that cannot be obtained from ground data.
2,"they provide systematically collected, digital, spatially explicit, and continuous data on earth’s surface across the globe, both in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum and beyond (e.g., thermal infrared or microwave)."
2,"aerial photography and satellite imagery are available from as early as the 1930s and 1970s, respectively, offering insights about historic land conditions and change that may be difﬁcult to obtain in the absence of long-term ﬁeld monitoring projects (jensen, 2007)."
2,"geographic information systems facilitate the capture, management, manipulation, analysis, and presentation of georeferenced data."
2,"geographic information systems can integrate georeferenced data from any discipline; be used for map-making, measuring of object properties, querying of databases, analyses and modelling, sharing of data across disciplines; and much more (longley et al., 2005)."
2,spatial analysis and modeling in a geographic information system are conceptually quite straight-forward.
2,"both usually require, as a ﬁrst step, the compilation of geographic data in a geodatabase."
2,"once compiled, it is possible to visualize the data in dynamic ways (e.g., zoom in/out, turn data layers on/off, change symbolization schemes)."
2,"it is also possible to apply a variety of digital computations to the data (e.g., perform simple geometric measurements, conduct queries, interpolate data, quantify patterns, or optimize site selection)."
2,"the simple superimposition of multiple layers related to one theme facilitates the presentation of persuasive empirical evidence in a manner that is difﬁcult to capture in words (e.g., maps of human well- being indicators can be overlaid to produce one human well-being map)."
2,"one may also engage in more complex modeling procedures, either within a geographic information system or through loose or tight coupling with other models (e.g., emulate processes such as land development)."
2,"analysis and model inputs (e.g., geographic data layers) may be changed at any time to examine what-if scenarios or policy alternatives."
2,"they may also be extracted from a database and used in other contexts; i.e., they may be ‘recycled’ for new purposes."
2,"when completed, geospatial analyses and models can result in a variety of outputs, including static printed or on-screen maps, animated or interactive dynamic maps, graphs, tables, data for other analyses and models, and also the revision of existing and development of new hypotheses and models about phenomena of interest. circumstances and management goals."

4,"speciﬁcally, we spatial structuring exists for two major reasons: spatial argue that the comprehensive m&a of land management autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity (e.g., turner and sustainability requires geospatial approaches that are also gardner, 1990)."
4,spatial autocorrelation refers to the highly integrative.
4,"that is, they need to assimilate and link tendency of nearby locations to be similar (i.e., spatially human and environmental data, qualitative and quantitative dependent) and is described well in tobler’s (1970) ﬁrst law data, as well as ﬁeld and remotely sensed data in a spatially of geography, ‘‘everything is related to everything else, but explicit framework to the degree necessary to comprehen- near things are more related than distant things.’’"

7,box 2: note on the complementary nature of geospatial and field approaches field work is an integral part of geospatial approaches for the m&a of land management sustainability.
7,"field work provides georeferenced in situ data (e.g., on-the-ground land cover data), which are crucial for both the calibration and evaluation of geospatial products (e.g., land cover maps) (mccoy, 2005)."
7,"field work is required to obtain data about human (e.g., income) and environmental (e.g., groundwater quality) conditions that cannot be acquired through remote sensing."
7,"such data can provide contextual knowledge: for example, while remote sensing may be used to map gains or losses of woody plants in an area, only ﬁeld work (e.g., interviews) can tell us how this change is perceived by diverse stakeholders."
7,"when georeferenced and collected using a spatially meaningful sampling scheme, however, ﬁeld data may also be input into a geographic information system for further analysis and modeling: for example, continuous surfaces may be interpolated in a geographic information system based on point data collected in the ﬁeld (ahmadi and sedghamiz, 2008) and/or the ﬁeld data may become part of more complex geospatial sustainability assessment models (liu et al., 2009)."
7,"just as much ﬁeld work is indispensible in the context of geospatial applications, they may also enhance the efﬁciency and utility of ﬁeld efforts."
7,"geographic information systems and remote sensing may be used to design a stratiﬁed random sampling plan, for example, to ensure that ﬁeld samples adequately represent the heterogeneity of given study area (mworia et al., 2008)."
7,"maps and air photos or satellite images also afford context for ﬁeld work, providing spatially continuous and extensive information about earth’s surface that cannot be obtained on the ground."
7,a particularly fertile ground for integrative geospatial m&a and for bridging the gap between scientiﬁc expert and local expert knowledge further exists in the area of participatory learning and action.
7,"at the simplest level, local land managers can be included actively in mapping endeavors to generate maps that are practically useful to them and not ‘theory-laden’ (robbins and maddock, 2000)."
7,"more complex participatory mapping frameworks also offer opportunities for the inclusion of stakeholder perspectives on available resources and needs, however (ahamed et al., 2009)."
7,"maps can be used to stimulate discussions between stakeholders concerning land use problems and alternative options, to gain greater insights into possible conﬂicts and synergies between stakeholders (hessel et al., 2009)."
7,"in some cases, such participatory efforts have helped to resolve long-standing conﬂicts between villages and develop more sustainable, inter-village land management cooperation (isager and broge, 2007)."
7,"spatial multicriteria decision models offer opportunities for synthesizing in a quantitative fashion the often qualitative inputs of diverse stakeholders: stakeholders may identify criteria of relevance to them, weight their importance, and specify how they should be measured; the various stakeholder inputs are then combined into a single set of criteria and weighted to produce solutions that should be acceptable to all those whose inputs were considered in the modeling process."
7,"strager and rosenberger (2006), for example, used this kind of approach to identify stakeholder preferences for land conservation."
7,"clearly, geospatial approaches offer many opportunities for the participation of the diverse stakeholders whose decisions ultimately determine whether land management will or will not be sustainable. location, extent, and use of surface water as well as water evapotranspiration, and soil moisture data are retrieved quality parameters such as turbidity, temperature, and commonly with the aid of remote sensing (kalma et al., chlorophyll content (ritchie et al., 2003)."

7,"when 2005; gomez et al., 2008; zhang and srinivasan, 2009) and combined with other data (e.g., slope or amount of advances are made in deriving estimates by means of remote impervious surface) in spatial models, such surface water sensing (michaelides et al., 2009)."
7,"accurate temperature and/or groundwater data can yield information about issues and precipitation data are critical inputs for models on such as non-point source pollution of surface water bodies climate and climate variability effects on sustainability (munafo et al., 2005), groundwater pollution risk (backhaus variables such as water, vegetation, and soil dynamics et al., 2002), or links between urbanization and water quality (mulligan, 1998)."
