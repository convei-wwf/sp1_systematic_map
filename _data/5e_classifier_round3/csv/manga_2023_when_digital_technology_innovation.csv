3,"introduction indigenous territories, especially in canadian northern regions, are heavily exposed to the climate change threat."
3,"consequently, indigenous and local communities consist most of the time of vulnerable populations to climate change threats."
3,"also, smart cities are emerging across the planet while rural territories including indigenous and local communities are absent from the vocabulary of the current smart world."
3,this technol- ogy policy contribution brings the hope that indigenous peoples can be included in an evolving smart planet to ensure no first nation is left behind (fndgs 2020).
3,"it shows that technology innovation in landscape geomatics engineering, along with the new information technologies (nits) tools such as the internet and smartphone applica- tions, can lead to the building of digital smart indigenous peoples territories and com- munities to better face climate change resilience-building challenges."
3,"smartphone applications and the internet, including apps, are meant to democratize indigenous peoples’ participation in decision-making processes in the management of indigenous territories and communities."
3,they are also meant to facilitate the full assertion of indigenous peoples’ human rights.
3,"online clearing-house mechanisms (chms) are also suggested in this contribution as institutional arrangements to enable information sharing and exchange between different stakeholders of the indigenous peoples’ affairs global agenda, including indigenous peoples and thus, at the landscape local scale, between landscapes at the national level, regionally or globally."
3,nits allow indigenous populations to bring information to the management of their territories and communities’ lives as events occur.
3,"moreover, this contribution enhances the potential of e-smart and inclusive indigenous peoples’ chms with a landscape geomatics framework consisting of an online smart digital gis."
3,"in total, these innovative technol- ogy interfaces and institutional arrangements lead to the development of the “e- gis smart, inclusive, and climate-resilient indigenous people landscape and community clearing-house mechanism solution”, referred to hereafter as the “solution”."
3,"the solution raises to a higher level of technology innovation, the initial web-based multi- lingual environmental technology approach emerging under the united nations biodiversity global agenda to facilitate communication between local and indigenous communities."
3,"it shows, in fact, that gis technology, remote sensing products of obser- vation satellites, and smartphone application products derived from telecommunication satellites, can enhance the potential of a web-based multilingual environmental tech- nology approach."
3,"the solution will be made available in an application environment (app) and on a mobile-friendly website (e-online) and is meant to generate e-smart and inclusive indigenous peoples’ territories and communities managed with inclusive institutional arrangements, allowing indigenous peoples to use their traditional know- ledge, innovations, practices, and experiences as their contribution to the implementa- tion of the indigenous peoples’ global affairs agenda."
3,"we plan to show that, like other local communities under the un biodiversity global agenda, indigenous peoples can contribute to building climate resilience in the current digital smart world."
3,results of the research consist of the promises of the solution.
3,results will be discussed in the last chapter with a reminder of the import- ance of governance arrangements enabling indigenous peoples to administer the solution’ stations for themselves with the financial support of state governments and inter-governmental institutions.
3,the administration by indigenous people for indigenous peoples is shared as a governance arrangement that gives indigenous peoples sovereignty over their information without giving them financial burdens or
4,journal of environmental planning and management 2469 unpaid labor responsibilities.
4,"among many other advantages, the administration of the solution’s stations by indigenous peoples for indigenous peoples avoids using indigenous labor and knowledge to benefit scientific endeavors without reciprocating benefits."
4,"among other results, this contribution encourages canada to take advantage of the potential of the solution to enhance the canadian first nations data governance strategy (fndgs)."
4,the strategy is a response to an evolving smart planet to ensure no first nation is left behind.
4,"according to the first nations information governance center (fnigc), the fndgs is funded through federal budget 2018 in support of the new fiscal relationship strengthening first nations institutions and community capacity and is a response to a direction received from first nations leadership (fndgs 2020)."
4,"from the web-based multilingual tool to the “e-gis smart, inclusive, and, climate-resilient indigenous peoples landscape and community clearing-house mechanism solution”: a technology approach emerging under both biodiversity and climate change global agendas according to the secretariat of the united nations convention on biological diversity (uncbd), the clearing-house mechanism (chm) is an institutional arrangement ena- bling different stakeholders – financial, scientific, or administrative – to share and exchange information towards achieving common goals within an organization (uncbd 2021)."
4,chm is adopted within the global biodiversity agenda to facilitate the implementation of normative provisions achieved through multilateralism including article 18.3 of the uncbd and article 20.1 of the cartagena protocol on biosafety.
4,web-based multilingual tools have the potential to boost chms in facilitating commu- nication between local and indigenous communities.
4,the use of online technology is an emerging environmental technology approach in the implementation of both biodiversity and climate change global agendas.
4,"however, to boost achievements on the global indigenous peoples affairs global agenda this chapter brings technology innovation to a higher step in adding to online chm’s potential, the benefit of gis, remote sensing, and nits technology environments."
4,"web-based multilingual tools to boost inclusion on indigenous peoples’ matters uncbd experts stated, at their recommendation 19 of technical series no. 25, that sustainable development in the light of adaptation to climate change needs to docu- ment, analyze and apply traditional knowledge in ways that complement science-based knowledge and vice versa (uncbd 2006)."
4,"they added that nits will facilitate com- munication between local and indigenous communities, such as web-based multilin- gual tools (uncbd 2006)."
4,these recommendations had an impact on the deliberation of the international work group for indigenous affairs (iwgia) held in copenhagen on 21–22 february 2008.
4,experts gathered to consider climate change-related chal- lenges and major threats that indigenous peoples are facing in the preparation of the 7th session of the 2009 united nations permanent forum on indigenous issues and of the world conference on climate change (cop 15).
4,"especially, experts discussed the impacts of climate change on indigenous peoples and pondered on how global agree- ments, political processes, and restrictive regulations hinder indigenous peoples in their"

5,"in 2017, delegates at the tenth meeting of the uncbd ad hoc open-ended working group on article 8(j) and related provisions agreed on a set of recommendations related to the contribution of indigenous peoples and local communities to the cbd implementation (uncbd 2017)."
5,"cristiana palmer, who was then executive secretary of the cbd, stated that the meeting was an occasion for experts to demonstrate that indigenous peoples and local communities remain at the very heart of the convention and that their effective participation is needed."
5,this statement echoes uncbd expert authors of the technical series no. 25 who added at point 19 of their recommendations that understanding changes in bio- logical diversity due to climate change should include the active participation of local and indigenous people’s communities (uncbd 2006).
5,"at the unfccc conference in bali in december 2007, participants agreed that addressing climate change effectively requires mitigation, adaptation, new technology, and financing (annex 1 of the conference report)."
5,"it was also noticed that enhancing and supporting the adaptive cap- acity of indigenous peoples will only be successful if integrated with other strategies such as disaster preparation, land-use planning, environmental conservation, and national plans for sustainable development (un 2008)."
5,the bali agenda also covers the transfer of technological capacity that most indigenous communities do not possess to enable their effective participation in the elaboration of state-developed mitigation measures and ensure that such schemes do not negatively affect their vulnerable communities (un 2008).
5,"it has been, however, cautiously agreed that some mitigation measures may have undesirable direct and indirect consequences for indigenous people’s communities."
5,"for instance, certain agricultural initiatives may reduce greenhouse gas emissions but may lead to an increase in monoculture crops and plantations and an associated decline in biodiversity and food security (un 2008)."
5,normative activity may benefit from the solution to build climate-resilient indigenous peoples’ territories and local communities through synergetic sustainable management processes.

5,"gis and remote sensing potential in indigenous landscape sustainable management and limits thereof according to usgs (2021), a geographic information system (gis) is a computer system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information."
5,it uses data that is attached to a unique location.
5,"gis is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing information that integrates many types of data and analyzes spatial location, and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3 d scenes (esri 2021)."
5,"gis reveals deeper insights into data, such as patterns, relationships, and situations to assist users to make smarter decisions (esri 2021)."
5,gis technology has allowed the academic milieu to produce georeferenced measurements and databases on landscapes and territories over several decades since the technology has been in the market.
5,gis helped peter h.
5,verburg et al. (2004) to highlight current practice and research priorities through land-use change modeling.
5,"geoghegana, wainger, and bockstael (1997) conducted a study on spatial landscape indices in a hedonic frame- work using an ecological economics analysis with gis."
5,an integrated gis-based model has been used by hilferink and rietveld (1999) to simulate long-term projec- tions of land use in urban and rural areas.
5,gis-based simulation can also be used to conduct exploratory analysis for space-time processes (wu 1999).
5,"also, gis technol- ogy was used by li and gar-on yeh (2000) to conduct research activities in"
6,journal of environmental planning and management 2471 sustainable urban modeling.
6,"in 2002, these two authors built neural-network-based cel- lular automata for simulating multiple land-use changes also using gis (li and gar- on yeh 2002)."
6,gis technology use in indigenous peoples’ matters is a technology solution with a big potential to respond to the copenhagen meeting call of 2008 in the context of climate change policy-making.
6,remote sensing as satellite imagery processing is a correlative technology to gis and has been enabling gis to enhance its potential.
6,remote sensing imageries are used to update gis georeferenced systems information and data.
6,many landscape research proj- ects are conducted using remote sensing on climate-related matters.
6,"for instance, integra- tion of remote sensing and eddy covariance measurements have been conducted to study the effect of algal blooms on carbon emissions in western lake erie by ouyang et al."
6,(2017).
6,"tan, ma, and kuang (2017) used satellite imagery processing to study spatial- temporal characteristics and climatic responses of water-level fluctuations of global major lakes from 2002 to 2010."
6,"snow mass and peak river flows for the mackenzie river basin have been estimated using remote sensing technology by wang, zhou, and russell (2017)."
6,"liang (2017) integrated remote sensing technology and water balance modeling principles to quantify streamflow variations in ungaged lake basins, in china."
6,"likewise, in northern tanzania, studies on endemic cichlid habitats using remote sensing have been conducted on land cover, land use, and climate change impacts by kalacska et al."
6,(2017).
6,"in the nepal himalaya, rounce, watson, and mckinney (2017) used remote sensing to identify hazards and risks for glacial lakes, whereas in the central qinghai- tibet plateau."
6,ke et al. (2017) used remote sensing to study glacier change and the rela- tionship with changing climate.
6,"no doubt, the role of remote sensing or earth observation satellites in climate change studies is important (yang et al."
6,2013).
6,"along with gis tech- nology, the use of remote sensing technology on indigenous peoples’ matters is a tech- nology solution with a big potential to respond to the copenhagen meeting call of 2008 in the context of climate change policy-making at the national and regional scales."
6,"however, gis technology along with remote sensing, its correlative technology, are most efficient at the local scale."
6,the municipality is its optimal spatial framework.
6,"consequently, these technology environments show their limits in the regional context and mostly at the continental and the global scales."
6,the spatial resolution of earth observation satellites decreases from the local scale to the regional scale resulting less precision on objects remotely sensed.
6,"regional satellites, which are mostly meteoro- logical, indeed have very low spatial resolutions."
6,"with such limitations at the regional, continental, and global scales, the potential of gis and remote sensing will need to be boosted by other technology environments to enable full implementation of united nations normative provisions on environmental matters, including climate change resilience issues within the indigenous peoples’ global agenda."
6,1.2.2.
6,"online clearing-house mechanisms (chm) to overcome the limitations of gis and remote sensing at regional, continental and global scales gis and remote sensing limitations at the regional, continental, and global scales can be overcome by clearing-house mechanisms (chms)."
6,"in the context of indigenous peoples matters, online chms are meant to connect all online indigenous peoples gis landscape and community projects."
6,chms enable information exchange and sharing among the population and other stakeholders on experiences and events occurring in indigenous peoples territories and communities.
6,"chms have the potential to conduct,"

7,"manga under cooperation and partnership arrangements, climate resilience-building crusades with indigenous peoples’ e-participation at any time and from everywhere."
7,"such an asset helps the indigenous population to participate in gis database updating by bring- ing to cadaster managers and environmental agency officials, strategic information col- lected on their territories and communities online live as events, observations, phenomena, or experiences occur."
7,"such a contribution is strategic, since indigenous peoples are first-hand witnesses of climate change impacts on their lands."
7,"their trad- itional knowledge and technics are key contributors to sustainability and climate resili- ence in their lands, territories, and communities."
7,"sharing live information on fishery activities, forest, ice melting, hunting, agriculture, farming, food, nutrition, public health, and farming, is extremely valuable in the context of poverty eradication and climate resilience-building under the indigenous peoples affairs global agenda."
7,methodology the methodology approach used to conduct this technology policy contribution con- sists of a synergetic and holistic method that brings into contribution different technol- ogy environment interfaces among the most innovative of our time.
7,"it is a plural interface solution designated as the “e-gis smart, inclusive, and, climate-resilient indigenous peoples landscape and community clearing-house mechanism solution”."
7,the solution is meant to facilitate the e-participation of indigenous peoples in climate resilience-building within their territories in terms of biodiversity and their commun- ities in terms of poverty eradication on a planet that is smarter and smarter.
7,the poten- tial of each interface is highlighted in terms of its capacity to contribute to the implementation of the indigenous people’s affairs global agenda normative provi- sions.
7,landscape-sustainable management in the context of climate change resilience- building and indigenous peoples’ assertion of their human rights are the main purposes of the solution.
7,"in total, the solution is a plural interface tool with four technology environments or components that work together in synergy toward climate resilience- building."
7,these are: 1.
7,"a gis and geomatics component to collect, stock, process, and, manage information on landscapes and to help in decision-making."
7,"data and information collection may include remote sensing, surveys, mapping, laboratory experimentation, analysis, etc."
7,"data and information processing may involve satellite imagery processing, mathematical modeling, algorithm development, simulations, statistics building, computerizing, etc."
7,an online e-component to allow access themes in the discussion from everyone and at any time 24/7; 3.
7,"a clearing-house mechanism (chm) to allow information and data exchange between different landscape managing staff and other stakeholders, including the public in a country, within a region, and even worldwide and; 4."
7,a nits (smart) component to democratize participation in smart landscape sustainable management with smartphone applications.
7,the solution will be made available in an application environment (app) and on a mobile-friendly website (e-online).

8,"promises of the solution: a climate resilience-building perspective research results in this environmental technology policy contribution are presented in terms of promises of the solution to facilitate indigenous people’s participation in decision-making processes, with the main objective of enabling inclusive management of their territories, landscapes, and, communities in the context of climate resili- ence-building."
8,there are many advantages to web-based approaches to public participation in deci- sion-making (kingston et al.
8,2000).
8,such a technology environment removes all restric- tions to meetings.
8,citizens can participate wherever they are and when they can and want 24/7; and also have lived access to information on issues being discussed and debated.
8,"interventions, comments, and other contributions in such a technological envir- onment, can be made anonymously without confrontation within a group of unknown participants (kingston et al."
8,2000).
8,public participation gis systems are also an efficient tool to broaden public involvement in policymaking (sieber 2006).
8,"also, as presented earlier, limitations of the gis interface at the regional, continental, and global scales can be overcome with chm institutional arrangements."
8,"together, landscape geomatics tech- nology trends have the potential to democratize the sustainable management of natural and genetic resources in indigenous peoples’ territories and communities."
8,"moreover, the potential of these landscape geomatics engineering technology trends is enhanced by the use of smartphone applications to democratize indigenous peoples and local commun- ities’ participation."
8,this smart interface of the solution facilitates public participation at any time 24/7 and from everywhere.
8,"with such a potential, online landscape geomatics engineering technology trends, conceived and presented in this contribution, can indeed facilitate the participation of indigenous peoples in allowing them to bring live informa- tion directly to administrations as a strategic contribution to climate resilience-building in their territories as being involved in climate change adaptation and mitigation in the present smart world."
8,"the solution to address the adverse effects of climate change on ecosystems in indigenous peoples’ territories the solution and its four technology interfaces, promise to efficiently address issues related to indigenous peoples’ ecosystems affected in various ways by climate change."
8,the gis environment can address measurements and assessment of biophysical and geophysical ecosystem elements.
8,"the online, chm, and smartphone applications have a known potential to share and exchange information and to democratize participation in community management."
8,"they promise, therefore, to enable inclusive processes throughout the implementation, among others, of the year 2008 copenhagen meeting, which raised some important facts."
8,"indigenous peoples are among the world’s most marginalized, impoverished, and vulnerable peoples."
8,their issues are magnified by the unprecedented changes in their environment and natural resources due to climate change.
8,"livelihoods are affected, land rights are diminished and food security is"

9,manga further threatened.
9,"the meeting attendees, noticed, however, that the effects of climate change on indigenous peoples’ territories, communities, and ecosystems are different depending on their locations and the types of ecosystems they live in."
9,"the meeting report states that this means that indigenous peoples are affected differently by climate change according to the threats they face, such as sea ice melting or shifting animal migration routes affected in the arctic."
9,it also can be increased fires in tropical rainfor- ests or reductions in rainfall and even temperature.
9,indigenous communities often leave their traditional territories when they face increased coastal erosion or intensified threats to water and food security.
9,"according to the copenhagen meeting report, indigenous peoples are, nevertheless, in some cases affected positively, for instance in the establishment of oil palm plantations to produce agrofuels on indigenous land and other opportunities such as industrial development, resource extraction, and transport (un 2008)."
9,"the solution along with its four technology interfaces, promises to address all issues and sustainable development initiatives and projects related to the ecosystems in indigenous peoples territories’ that are affected in various ways by climate change."
9,"the solution to address indigenous peoples’ traditional knowledge and climate change the solution and its four technology interfaces, promise inclusive management of indigenous peoples’ landscapes, territories, and communities."
9,indigenous peoples’ traditional knowledge and technics can assist the implementation of normative pro- visions addressed at the year 2008 copenhagen meeting which reminded the inter- national community of the potential of indigenous peoples’ ancestral knowledge and experience to contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation.
9,"indigenous peoples have always adapted to changing environments with sophisticated and sus- tainable strategies throughout the ages, including creative technics from their trad- itional knowledge in natural resource management and traditional technologies (un 2008)."
9,"ways, strategies, and technics of climate adaptation may be different from one indigenous people’s community to another, depending on ecosystems, regions, the kinds of threats they face, and local culture."
9,democratizing indigenous peoples’ participation in the management of their territories and communities with the solution can help to strengthen indigenous peoples’ territories facing climate change adversity.
9,"at the year 2008 copenhagen meeting, the united nations experts stated that indigenous peoples’ traditional experience and strategies are no longer suffi- cient to cope with the intensity and frequency of current climatic challenges despite a long history of adapting to changing environmental conditions (un 2008)."
9,the solution promises to be part of the solution to boosting indigenous peoples’ trad- itional knowledge.
9,"the solution and its interfaces will help to measure, assess, cross and compute landscape and community-related information to better address the contribution of traditional knowledge in reversing the adverse effects of climate change on indigenous peoples’ ecosystems."
9,"the solution to address legal and governance barriers in climate change adaptation and mitigation nits interfaces of the solution, namely the internet and smartphone applications along with the chm, promise to address efficiently legal and governance barriers to allow a"
10,journal of environmental planning and management 2475 full implementation of the indigenous peoples global agenda.
10,"at the year 2008 copenhagen meeting, experts gave a reminder that there are various legal and institu- tional barriers preventing indigenous peoples from coping efficiently with climate change under the adaptation solutions proposed for mitigation (un 2008)."
10,"among these barriers, is the lack of recognition and promotion of indigenous peoples’ human rights, even those already guaranteed by the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples (undrip)."
10,"inclusion through participation, including participa- tion in decision-making are legal and governance arrangements which are promised to be magnified by the solution, especially with its nits technology environments which will facilitate bringing strategic information to the administration of territories and communities, about events and experiences as these occur in the field, especially on matters related to climate change adaptation and mitigation."
10,participation is a key-legal and governance arrangement that enables indigenous peoples to assert their basic human rights toward climate resilience-building in indigenous peoples’ land.
10,having indigenous peoples involved is a unique opportunity to understand how to address cli- mate change and how to prepare for and deal with the changes that are already occur- ring (un 2008).
10,indigenous peoples have a long history of living in harmony with the natural world and in responding to threats in ways that enhance the resilience of eco- systems.
10,their traditional knowledge and technologies offer solutions that are specific- ally adapted to the environments in which they live (un 2008).
10,the solution to address general normative provisions on indigenous peoples’ participation in climate change adaptation and mitigation the implementation of capacity-building-related normative and legislative provisions will benefit from technology innovation as well stated in the uncbd experts’ recom- mendations on the potential of nits and web-based multilingual tools to address sus- tainability challenges.
10,ambassador dr.
10,"ahmed djoghlaf launched, under the uncbd satoyama initiative, this landscape, and community technology trends to lead the inter- national community toward the sustainable management of natural resources in a con- text of harmony between human beings and nature."
10,satoyama is a japanese landscape ensuring harmony between the people and nature.
10,the potential of the four interfaces of the solution can be brought into contribution as an answer to that call to action.
10,the solution is also an answer to the year 2008 copenhagen meeting’s recommenda- tions.
10,it covered several key issues among which is an invitation to adopt processes ensuring indigenous people’s access to information on planned and current adaptation and mitigation schemes (un 2008).
10,"the meeting also recommended participatory and multi-disciplinary research projects in the context of climate change, with the involve- ment of indigenous peoples and constructive dialogue with other stakeholders includ- ing governments, institutions, private sector, and indigenous peoples’ organizations (un 2008)."
10,the participation of the civil society was recommended considering its abilities to play a conciliating role among different stakeholders.
10,the importance of political will was expressed at the uncbd ad hoc open-ended working group experts meeting on article 8(j) held in december 2017 in montreal.
10,parties to the uncbd demonstrated an increased interest in indigenous peoples’ future on climate change- related matters.
10,they identified key issues in the implementation of the copenhagen experts meeting of february 2008 and of the un cbd ad hoc open-ended working group experts meeting on article 8(j) held in montreal in december 2017.

11,manga met in copenhagen with the full knowledge and awareness of the needs of indigenous communities which are among the most vulnerable populations exposed to climate change’s long-term consequences (un 2008).
11,"in parallel, parties to the uncbd and the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) conducted com- plementary activities which further highlight the reality that indigenous peoples are among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change because of their close relationship with the environment and its resources (uncbd 2017)."
11,"the uncbd ad hoc technical expert group on biodiversity and unfccc experts on article 2 of the convention recognized the interlinkages between biodiversity, climate change, and sus- tainable development throughout the last decade."
11,"such linkages are recorded in the vari- ous technical uncbd technical series on the subject (uncbd 2003, 2006, 2009)."
11,these working groups of experts on indigenous people’s affairs conducted different nor- mative activities on topics related to indigenous peoples’ participation.
11,outputs show that multilateralism recognizes that indigenous peoples ought to play a key role in any decision-making process on things concerning their future in their lands and commun- ities.
11,multilateralism is allowing more and more indigenous peoples to contribute to the implementation of the global agenda on environmental and climate change mitigation.
11,normative provisions and frameworks are being adopted to this end (un 2008) and indigenous peoples’ participation is part of the strategies.
11,"in north america, for example, indigenous peoples daily witness climate change effects such as loss of bio- diversity and melting ice."
11,the north pole is one of the anticyclones of the global atmos- pheric circulation and its inhabitants are potential key contributors to any climate change mitigation policy-making process (un 2008).
11,the solution promise to facilitate indigenous peoples’ participation in the measurement of biodiversity loss and sea ice melting.
11,"economic opportunities for indigenous peoples may grow their interest and increase the demand for renewable energy using wind and solar power to replace fossil fuel-derived energy, which will lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions (un 2008)."
11,"for example, the great plains could provide wind resources that can be developed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the management problem of the missouri river hydropower in maintaining water levels for power generation, navigation, and recreation while creating opportunities for carbon sequestration (un 2008)."
11,the solution is a technology answer to multilateralism expectations and normative activity toward indigenous peoples’ participation in climate change adaptation and mitigation in their territories and communities.
11,"the overall purpose is to enable indigenous peoples’ participation in decision-making processes based on free and prior informed consent (un 2008), especially in matters related to climate resilience-building and green econ- omy growth."
11,"more practically, the solution will be made available in an application environment (app) and on a mobile-friendly website (e-online)."
11,discussion we endeavored to explain how indigenous peoples are subject to more environmental degradation and potential negative effects to some climate change mitigation efforts.
11,we demonstrated that indigenous peoples also have a communication barrier and that this barrier affects their ability to represent themselves.
11,we added that such a barrier affects scientific efforts to understand and mitigate climate change.
11,these facts led us to present a solution to materialize the indigenous peoples global agenda’s vision to address this barrier.

12,"it is an environmental technology approach emerging under the united nations biodiversity global agenda, as well as in the climate change global agenda, with con- siderable potential to ensure full implementation of undrip’s normative provisions."
12,"we highlighted that landscape geomatics interfaces, including remote sensing and gis have, great potential in indigenous peoples’ sustainable management of land resources toward climate resilience-building."
12,indigenous peoples’ participation in decision-making processes for the sustainable management of their lands and communities is also pre- sented as a key governance asset to remove barriers.
12,"we also highlighted the potential of new technologies of information and communication (nits) interfaces, namely smart- phone applications, to democratize participation in decision-making to enable inclusive management of indigenous peoples’ lands, territories, and communities."
12,"the adoption of information exchange and sharing clearing-house mechanisms (chm) to better address managerial challenges of different indigenous landscapes, territories, and communities’ management within a country, a region, a continent, or globally, is also presented as an institutional arrangement with great potential toward national, regional, continental, and global climate resilience-building crusades."
12,"in total, the solution can boost ongoing syn- ergic efforts conducted by indigenous peoples, state governments, and inter-governmen- tal institutions in the implementation of the indigenous peoples affairs global agenda under inclusive management mechanisms and strategies."
12,"however, to achieve these noble targets of the solution, indigenous peoples ought not to be content with their local communities’ initiatives."
12,"they would have to be involved through their states’ implementation agendas for global instances and normative instruments such as uncbd, undrip, and the iwgia."
12,active participation of indigenous peoples in these instances is a key asset of success.
12,"indigenous peoples’ par- ticipation is essential, because the information involved is related to their territories, com- munities, culture, beliefs, thoughts, ideas, and, future."
12,indigenous peoples’ sovereignty over such information is a guarantee of their appropriation of the solution.
12,any success in the implementation of the solution will be the result of indigenous peoples’ appropri- ation of the solution with the outermost goal to avoid being left behind in the current planet which is increasingly digital and smarter.
12,"from such a perspective, the normative activity within the united nations system ought to encourage trends that strengthen rhet- orical sovereignty, as explained by lyons (2000) who emphasizes that, among other things, indigenous peoples have sovereignty over their information and stories."
12,the fail- ure of multilateralism in these principles is a reality that highlights the precarious nature of state goodwill in the implementation of normative provisions in indigenous peoples’ matters.
12,"according to the un human rights office of the high commissioner (2019), during the 2019 report review period, united nations human rights mechanisms noted that the full implementation of the undrip is far from being achieved."
12,"however, there is room to improve indigenous and local communities’ life condi- tions under the undrip implementation agenda and through other global instances’ implementation agendas where states are compelled to exhibit goodwill in matters related to indigenous peoples’ affairs."
12,"to discuss the results of this research project, we plan to acknowledge state goodwill failures in the implementation of indigenous people-related normative provisions."
12,this will allow us to show potential instances and paradigms through which states are compelled to exhibit goodwill in matters related to indigenous peoples affairs.
12,we will conclude this section with an example of canada endeavoring to materialize its compliance with normative provisions through the

13,manga implementation of the canadian first nations data governance strategy (fndgs) as a response to an evolving smart planet to ensure no first nation is left behind.
13,"state goodwill failures under the implementation of the indigenous peoples’ global agenda the united nations human rights committee is, within the un human rights office of the high commissioner, a body of independent experts that monitors the implementa- tion of the international covenant on civil and political rights in state parties (un human rights committee 2022)."
13,"under this instance, all state parties are obliged to sub- mit regular reports to the committee on how rights are being implemented."
13,the mission of this institution states that the committee examines each report and addresses its con- cerns and recommendations to the state party in the form of “concluding observations”.
13,"in its year 2019 report, the committee states that, during the period under review, des- pite major steps taken to advance the rights of indigenous peoples, reports show that full implementation of the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, is far from being achieved (un human rights – office of the high commissioner 2019)."
13,"rather, this instance noted that global trends during this period indicate that in a context of shrinking democratic spaces, indigenous human rights defenders, organizations, and movements face widespread attacks on them and, at times, criminalization, particularly those defending their rights to their traditional lands and nat- ural resources."
13,the committee insisted that the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in finding the right solutions in matters that concern them is a human rights responsibility that many states where indigenous peoples live are still fail- ing to meet.
13,this includes the elaboration of development priorities.
13,"however, the un instance is a reminder that during the reporting period, the rights of indigenous peoples were included in the recommendations of several human rights treaty bodies and in the reports, communications and other activities of special procedures mandate holders."
13,"the committee added that the mentioned mechanisms provided detailed, thematic, and coun- try-specific recommendations to implement the rights of indigenous peoples, enabling them to claim such rights and to interact on an equal footing with the authorities, private sector, and defenders of human rights mechanisms."
13,"we aim to suggest, in this contribution, a couple of ways out toward the full implementation of indigenous peoples’ rights about the benefits of the solution sug- gested in this contribution."
13,the first way out is the participative contribution of indigenous peoples in united nations instances such as un biodiversity.
13,the second way out is indigenous peoples-related information and data’ decolonization with an illustration under the canadian first nations data governance strategy (fndgs).
13,"this strategy is meant, by both indigenous peoples’ governments and the canadian government, to be a practical response to an evolving smart planet to ensure no first nation is left behind."
13,"examples of instances of the participative contribution of indigenous peoples within united nations instances: the un biodiversity case throughout recent decades, indigenous peoples and local communities have played an active role in normative activity through multilateralism, especially under the uncbd agenda, also known as the un biodiversity global agenda."
14,journal of environmental planning and management 2479 indigenous and local communities represent a sole program (uncbd 2022).
14,"moreover, on 8 september 2017, the general assembly adopted resolution a/res/71/ 321 on enhancing the participation of indigenous peoples’ representatives and institutions in meetings of relevant united nations bodies on issues affecting them (united nations human rights high commissioner 2022)."
14,"the un general assembly states that this resolution is a result of a process that began with a commitment by the member states, during the world conference on indigenous peoples in 2014, to con- sider the participation of indigenous peoples at the united nations."
14,member states were compelled to consider decisions made by the general assembly and other con- crete recommendations on the possible further measures needed to enable the participa- tion of indigenous peoples’ representatives and institutions in meetings of relevant united nations bodies.
14,such normative achievements were the result of a long multi- lateral process.
14,"for instance, morgan (2004) mentioned, a decade earlier, that during the past 30 years, indigenous peoples have emerged as legitimate subjects of inter- national law with the right to exist as distinct peoples."
14,"the author added that this shift in international law is the result of activity over the last few decades that has involved hundreds of indigenous peoples’ leaders, community representatives, and lawyers."
14,"according to morgan (2004), indigenous peoples have become actively engaged in efforts to transform the disposition and direction of international law so that it might become a supportive force of change in the relations between them and the states in which they live."
14,"the author noted that international legal instruments containing state- ments and resolutions on indigenous peoples’ rights in that review period include the international labor organization convention no. 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples of 1989 and, most importantly, the united nations draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples."
14,one should also bear in mind that iwgia is a forum where indigenous people express their desire to be included.
14,"normative provisions implementing agendas ought therefore to be instances where indigenous peoples are allowed to advance their agenda, including access to smart technologies along with other residents of the planet."
14,"in the particular context of this contribution, indigenous peoples are making their voices heard under the global biodiversity conservation agenda through national reports."
14,"for instance, canada states in its sixth report to the uncbd that indigenous governments are actively engaged in the development of new legislation in the north west territories for the establishment of conserved and pro- tected areas, which may consider climate change impacts and adaptation on a regional basis (cbd – clearing-house mechanism – biodivcanada 2019)."
14,"canada recognizes, in this report, the essential role of indigenous peoples in the conservation of wildlife, including their contribution to the national aboriginal council on species at risk."
14,the report also mentions that indigenous knowledge is increasingly incorporated into management and decision-making related to land and marine protected areas.
14,the solu- tion suggested in this contribution is meant to be implemented at the landscape scale worldwide including at the indigenous peoples’ territory and local community level.
14,examples of innovative paradigms enabling indigenous peoples’ appropriation of indigenous-related information: the case of “information and data decolonization” with a focus on the canadian first nations data governance strategy (fndgs) the second way out which may lead indigenous peoples to better benefit from the potential of the landscape management information technology innovation suggested in
15,2480 s.-j.-t.
15,manga this contribution is indigenous peoples’ related information and data decolonization.
15,"according to jensen (2019), data is mostly collected and presented in a way that per- petuates the narrative of poverty and need, painting a portrait of disparity and deficit and thus, from health outcomes to economic indicators to educational attainment."
15,"according to the author, this mainstream data collection and presentation leave little room to showcase the many strengths of indigenous people."
15,"according to him, decolo- nizing data means indigenous peoples controlling their stories and information."
15,jensen’s conviction is that decolonizing data in indigenous peoples’ rights matters.
15,"according to blackfoot confederacy health director and fnigc chairperson, bonnie healy (2020), there is an urgent call for decolonizing data, ensuring that first nations are not left behind in the digital revolution which would create another gap."
15,"mindy (2020), administrator of the union of nova scotia mi’kmaq and also an fnigc board member, states that beyond self-determination and self-governance, data decolonization is equally important for first nations addressing the gap between the life we are living today and the life which the creator intended us to live."
15,"among key initiatives to pro- mote indigenous data sovereignty through data decolonization, the native nations institute recommends the generation of resources and the building support for indigenous data governance (the university of arizona native nations institute 2022)."
15,the canadian first nations information governance center (fnigc) and the center’s first nations data governance strategy (fndgs) are examples of generating resour- ces and building support for indigenous data and information governance.
15,the fnigc envisions that every first nation will achieve data sovereignty in alignment with its distinct worldview (fnigc 2022).
15,"fnigc’s mission is to assert with first nations, data sovereignty and to support the development of information governance and man- agement at the community level through regional and national partnerships under key principles such as free, prior, and informed consent, respect nation-to-nation relation- ships, and recognize the distinct customs of nations."
15,the solution offered in this contri- bution can help materialize these principles with its clearing-house mechanism interface.
15,the canadian fndgs is a response to an evolving smart planet to ensure no first nation is left behind.
15,the smart landscape and community interface of the solution will assist in achieving this goal.
15,"according to the fnigc, the fndgs is funded through the federal budget 2018 in support of the new fiscal relationship strengthening first nations institutions and community capacity and is a response to a direction received from first nations leadership (fndgs 2020)."
15,canada state also reported in biodivcanada 2019 that indigenous representatives participate in inter- national decision-making by guiding in canada’s preparation for meetings of the convention on biological diversity and as members of the canadian delegation to meetings.
15,"canada reported, furthermore, that participation by indigenous peoples in biodiversity-related strategies and decision-making processes is also facilitated in part through federal funding for indigenous partners."
15,"in this regard, the biodivcanada 2019 report made the precision that the federal government provided funding to sup- port engagement and input into the development and implementation of policies and programs related to conservation, wildlife, and biodiversity from the assembly of first nations, inuit tapiriit kanatami, the metis national council, the native women’s association of canada, and the congress of aboriginal peoples."
15,"the report concluded that this, in turn, will help canada achieve its biodiversity goals, in part- nership with indigenous peoples, conservation organizations, industry, and youth."
15,"the solution presented in this research project appears, therefore, as a technology"
16,"journal of environmental planning and management 2481 tool to achieve the goal of both indigenous peoples’ governments and the canadian government to ensure no first nation is left behind in the current evolving smart planet, but rather is part of this digitally evolving world."
16,"the solution is in fact, a smart technology asset to magnify indigenous peoples’ participation, especially the youth (manga 2020)."
16,"the sovereignty of indigenous peoples over their data to manage and implement the solution for themselves under state funding responsibility indigenous peoples matters’ global agenda instances and stakeholders including states ought to value, respect, and take into account indigenous traditional knowledge when identifying, conceiving, and adopting climate change mitigation policies and programs (un 2008)."
16,the invitation to remove all legal and institutional barriers that prevent indigenous peoples from coping efficiently with climate change impacts (un 2008) is also still relevant.
16,"indigenous peoples, like other vulnerable populations around the world, also need support of all kinds whether that be financial, technology development, innovation, training, or, awareness."
16,"together these inputs have the sole purpose of facili- tating indigenous peoples’ participation in resilience-building in their territories and communities by bringing to administrations, information, data, knowledge, technics, experiences, observations, and comments on live events occurring in their territories and communities."
16,"indigenous people’s participation in decision-making processes as they assert their right to decision-making with free and prior informed consent (un 2008), is, therefore, a key asset to climate change resilience-building."
16,"together, indigenous peoples matters agenda stakeholders can reverse the negative effects of climate change in indigenous peoples’ lands and communities."
16,"these include the civil society entities such as ngos and the academic milieu along with state govern- ments, inter-governmental institutions, and indigenous peoples communities as primar- ily concerned."
16,the appropriation of the solution and its implementation by indigenous peoples’ communities ought to be apprehended from a governance perspective in a normative context.
16,the undrip addresses state members as funders of the declaration’s imple- mentation.
16,"this contribution is in favor of governance arrangements enabling indigenous peoples to manage implementation activities with state funding but also with the financial support, when possible, of inter-governmental institutions."
16,undrip normative provisions related to training and awareness can be implemented with mech- anisms used to recruit future staff among the indigenous youth.
16,"in this, indigenous youth may be assisted by ngos, including the civil society along with the academic milieu."
16,we believe that such an administration by indigenous people for indigenous people is a governance arrangement that gives indigenous peoples sovereignty over their information without giving them financial burdens or unpaid labor responsibil- ities.
16,"such institutional governance arrangements to implement the solution can help avoid using indigenous labor and knowledge to benefit scientific endeavors without reciprocating benefits, but rather ensure that indigenous peoples are not used simply to benefit others (lyons 2000)."
16,"in canada, the management and implementation of the solution by indigenous peoples for themselves under the canadian government fund- ing responsibility and the civil society technical assistance can be planned as a key ini- tiative to magnify the implementation of the canadian first nations data governance"

17,"smart indigenous peoples’ territories and communities have a future in the current smart world in recommending web-based multilingual tools to facilitate communication between local and indigenous communities (uncbd 2006), uncbd experts opened avenues toward technology innovation, such as the conception and development of the solution, to better address these challenges in the current smart world in mobile- friendly websites and e-apps environments."
17,"noella noronha et al. (2021) stated that tailoring mobile apps to fit the needs of indigenous peoples, especially the youth, requires special consideration and appropriate research techniques that allow indigenous communities to be actively involved in the development of mobile apps for their community in meaningful ways."
17,"authors added that co-creation of indigenous mobile apps with indigenous communities is in the very early stages and investigation to date indicates that indigenous youth have a readiness for mobile apps, prefer infor- mation delivery that relies on visuals, including gaming elements, as well as helping to foster cultural identity and connectedness (noronha et al."
17,2021).
17,"the use of applica- tions is, however, beneficial to indigenous peoples."
17,indigenous people’s use of mobile technologies supports digital inclusion for all and is a vehicle for financial inclusion (highet et al.
17,2019).
17,"the authors, highlight the importance of improving indigenous women's access to mobile technology, enhancing data availability and quality in the health sector, and improving access to finance and information for farmers."
17,web appli- cations and smartphone applications have a correlative future with training and aware- ness which are among the key indigenous peoples’ human rights adopted in the undrip normative provisions.
17,the academic milieu’s experience can be brought into contribution.
17,the ontario institute for studies in education (oise) strives to foster a supportive learning community for both its aboriginal students and its non-aboriginal students interested in learning more about aboriginal peoples and communities through an application.
17,this application is available on googleplay (oise 2020).
17,"it provides a directory including maps, phone numbers, and websites for over 633 tribes (oise 2020)."
17,"according to brown et al. (2020), mobile apps may provide innovative, efficient, and cost-effective means for delivering suicide intervention strategies among indigenous peoples’ communities."
17,"sarah wagner (2014), highlighted the importance of carrying out communications training workshops for indigenous youth to create aware- ness about indigenous cultures and the history of discrimination."
17,when training and awareness show the path governance arrangements enabling administration by indigenous peoples for indigenous peoples is an asset of success in the implementation of normative provi- sions related to this contribution.
17,"such arrangements can be apprehended through train- ing scholarship programs allowing the hiring of indigenous youth to develop, host, and, manage the solution stations."
17,"for instance, the gdc foundation created a national scholarship to support indigenous students pursuing education (gdc foundation 2020)."
17,the gdc foundation cheryl lynn rutledge northern indigenous student award can inspire stakeholders (gdc foundation 2020).

18,"conclusion in this research, we endeavored to show that the e-gis smart, inclusive, and, climate- resilient indigenous peoples landscape and community clearing-house mechanism solution is a technology approach emerging under both the biodiversity and the cli- mate change global agendas."
18,we demonstrated that the potential of the solution can be enhanced with landscape geomatics technology interfaces such as remote sensing and gis and with web and smartphone applications.
18,this plural interface solution promises the creation of smart inclusive indigenous people’s climate-resilient landscapes and communities under the implementation of the united nations indigenous peoples affairs’ global agenda through participation and inclusion princi- ples including in decision-making.
18,this methodology promises to assist stakeholders of the indigenous peoples affairs global agenda to implement existing normative pro- visions.
18,research results are presented in terms of promises of the solution and are discussed by adopting the perspective of adopting governance arrangements enabling indigenous peoples to administer the implementation of the solution by themselves and for themselves with the financial support of state member governments and inter- governmental institutions.
18,the potential of training and awareness to assist in the implementation of normative provisions related to indigenous peoples’ matters has been highlighted.
18,these perspectives on governance are meant to ensure full success in the implementation of the indigenous peoples affairs global agenda with a focus on climate resilience-building within indigenous territories and communities.
