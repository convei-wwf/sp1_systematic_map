2,(received 28 october 1992) abstract.
2,the availability of environmental and earth resources data acquired by satellites can assist all countries to gain a better understanding of how to safeguard their environment as well as ensure a more efficient management and productive harnessing of their natural resources.
2,"however, in order for the developing countries to share in the benefits inherent in remote sensing tech- nology and in programmes related to environmental information systems, particularly through their participation in international, regional and national programmes and projects, there must be an adequate and long-term commitment to and an investment in the development of skills and knowledge in the discipline at the local level."
2,this article focuses on the united nations initiative to establish regional centres for space science and technology education which should provide a unique opportunity for the development of such an indigenous capability.
2,"these centres have the potential to contribute significantly to the implementation of the recommendations of the rio conference, otherwise known as agenda 21, and to the successful execution of the programme of activities of the user communities in the developing countries."
2,"background the observation of the earth from space has become operational, and informa- tion acquired in the process is being applied to improve the knowledge of the natural resources of many nations, to provide information necessary for the rational exploitation of these resources and to assist in preventing or redressing damages to the earth's environment."
2,"indeed, it is being amply and continuously demonstrated, through a variety of projects, that remote sensing can contribute significantly to the achievement of the economic and social development goals of nations."
2,environmen- tal and natural resources data of difterent parts of the world are being observed daily by an array of earth-orbiting satellites and manned space vehicles.
2,these activities will be intensified with the passage of time.
2,"for a long time to come, space- borne sensors may be the only source of reliable data on the environment and natural resources of most developing countries."
2,the availability of such data can assist these countries to gain a better understanding of how to safeguard their environment as well as ensure a more efficient management and productive harnessing of their natural resources.
2,"however, a major prerequisite for an effective participation of these countries in international programmes such as the inter- national geosphere-biosphere programme (igbp) and mission to planet earth, and t original version of this paper was presented at the european international space year conference, munich, germany, 30 march-4 april 1992. t the author is the expert on space applications."

3,"abiodun in regional and national programmes and projects, is an adequate and long-term commitment to and an investment in the development of skills and knowledge in the discipline at the local level."
3,similar conclusions have been arrived at by an advisory committee of the world bank (1991) and by a study commissioned by the commission of european communities (cec) (prince et al.
3,1990).
3,knowledge and skill development 2.1.
3,"addressing environmental problems-cec in addressing environmental problems in the developing countries, the aforemen- tioned report of directorate general viii of cec noted that: 'conventional approaches to technology transfer, such as training courses and short-term, in-country demonstration projects are useful educational tools, but on their own, they will not result in effective and permanent integration of remotely sensed techniques into operational programmes.'"
3,"in identifying the several steps needed to arrive at practical applications of remote sensing for environmental monitoring and natural resources management, the cec report opined that: (i) research and development are needed to integrate remote sensing techniques into resource management systems; and that (ii) research and development of remote sensing data processing, analysis and interpretation provide the scientific basis for application of the techniques."
3,"effective environment information system-the world bank in reviewing the preparedness of the developing countries to participate in environmental management and natural resources development programmes, the afore-mentioned world bank advisory committee noted that 'indeed, most co- operation programmes are geared to short training sessions to fill short-term objectives . .'."
3,"on education and training, the committee also noted that: (i) if a country is to have an effective environment information system, it must have policy makers and administrators capable of appreciating the appli- cations and implications of the information, and scientists, engineers, tech- nicians and teachers capable of developing, adapting, applying and teaching the technology."
3,"both education and training are required to build up these skills; and that (ii) education provides the individual with an understanding of the subject, and training teaches him to carry out specific tasks, when knowledge of the subject as a whole may not be essential."
3,"to create the awareness, flexibility and motivation necessary to adjust to rapidly changing conditions, education is likely to be more effective than training for tasks which, because of the nature of new technologies, alter very quickly."
3,one of the concluding recommendations of the committee directed that: a professional approach to environment information as the basis for the viable sustainability of environment information systems should be encouraged.
3,"staff capacity must be developed in the short, medium and long terms."
3,"in the short term, needs can be met by training courses and self-training."
3,"tn the longer term, basic"
4,"un centres for space science and technology education 1653 education and university courses must cover environmental concerns and related subjects, including the information aspects, more thoroughly."
4,"short-term training to date, the main venue for transmitting basic remote sensing knowledge to the developing countries is through the organization of short-term training courses either locally or abroad."
4,"however, these courses are too short in duration, very limited in scope and in knowledge transmission, and the skills taught in the process are usually based on accepted methodology that can be used to execute specific applications-oriented tasks."
4,it is often impossible to adapt such skills to other tasks without a fundamental knowledge of the methodology and an understanding of the principles involved.
4,"in the absence of the latter, applications efforts are bound to be shallow."
4,"furthermore, such skills are often imparted to junior/middle level technicians in user agencies."
4,"because of their limited knowledge of the fundamentals (i.e., prin- ciples and concepts) of the technology they are called upon to apply as counterpart experts, many of the projects for which they assume responsibility, often falter, especially once the project leader, usually a foreign expert, who has been recruited through bilateral or multilateral arrangement, is withdrawn."
4,"the need for in-depth education a higher level of knowledge and expertise is needed by educators and research and application scientists in order that the developing countries can make a significant contribution to the solution of global, regional and national environmen- tal problems."
4,"in particular, educators and scientists in the developing countries should participate in the definition of remote sensing instrument requirements, and in the investigation of the weaknesses and difficulties in current and future instrument design including the definition of techniques for their improvement."
4,"they should contribute to the development of calibration techniques for earth observa- tion data including the development of software for image assessment, the establish- ment of assessment criteria, and in the definition of calibration strategies with the aid of calibration targets and targets of opportunity."
4,they should also contribute to the evaluation of earth observation data and to the assessment of its value in various earth science disciplines.
4,these capabilities can only be acquired through long-term intensive education.
4,space science and technology education 3.1.
4,recommendations of the international community the great need for in-depth education in all areas of space science and technology was brought progressively into focus through three regional and one international workshops and meeting organized on the subject by the united nations between 1985 and 1989.
4,"following an analysis of the observations and recommendations made by the experts invited to these events, the united nations subsequently developed a proposal for the establishment of regional centres for space science and technology education in the developing countries."
4,"while the primary focus of these centres would be the provision of education (through knowledge and skill development) to university educators of all the scientific and technical disciplines that can benefit from the knowledge and use of space science and technology, research and application activities will also be integral"

5,abiodun parts of the programmes of these centres.
5,"the disciplines that will benefit from such an effort will include but not limited to communications, meteorology and all sciences and applications fields where remote sensing can be of practical use, particularly in such areas as agriculture, water resources, forestry, geological and mineral exploration and environmental management."
5,"a survey conducted within the international community by the united nations overwhelmingly recommended that such centres as proposed above should focus initially on in-depth education and research in remote sensing and satellite meteor- ology and that such a programme should provide essential experience, particularly in those applications that have the potential for a greater impact on a country's economic and social development including the preservation of the environment."
5,"united nations response at its forty-fifth session, in its resolution 45/72 of ii december 1990, the united nations general assembly, in recognition of the above situation, endorsed the recommendation of its committee on the peaceful uses of outer space that: , ... the united nations should lead, with the active support of its specialized agencies and other international organizations, an international effort to estab- lish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national/regional educational institutions in the developing countries.'"
5,"emphasis in practice, space science and technology can be grouped under four broad categories-basic space sciences, satellite communications, satellite meteorology and remote sensing."
5,"however, given the global realities and concerns of our time, the initial emphasis oj these centres shall concentrate on in-depth education, research and applications programmes in satellite meteorology and remote sensing as these relate directly to environmental monitoring and natural resources management."
5,"these centres should be viable educational teaching and research institutions that are capable of high attainments particularly in their development and transmis- sion of knowledge in the developing countries, as manifested by the examples of the international centre for theoretical physics (ictp) in trieste, italy."
5,"in addressing the emphasis of ictp, professor abdus salam, founder and director of ictp opined: 'very few within the developing world appear to stress that for long term effectiveness, technology transfer must always be accompanied by science transfer; that the science of today is the technology of tomorrow and that when we speak of science, it must be broad-based in order to be effective for applications.'"
5,"(lai 1987).t specifically, the emphasis of these centres shall focus on developing various capacities necessary to undertake, at the local level, the different aspects of agenda 21 programme."
5,"one such requirement of agenda 21 is its call for all countries to undertake a: 'comprehensive national inventory of their land resourcces in order to establish a land information system in which land resources will be classified according to their most appropriate uses and environmentally fragile or disaster-prone areas will be identified for special protection measures.' t speech delivered on 'science transfer for devlopment' at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science, may 1984."
6,"un centres for space science and technology education 1655 for this and other purposes, 'all countries, particularly developing countries, alone or in regional or subregio- nal groupings, should be given access to modern techniques of land-resource management, such as geographical information systems, satellite photography/ imagery and other remote-sensing technologies.'"
6,"objectives the activities of these centres would focus on re-education of educators and research and application scientists, particularly those in the natural and physical sciences at the universities, technical colleges and research institutions in the developing countries, through an intensive education and research experience."
6,"the educational programme would be accomplished through the development of in- depth knowledge and skills of educators and research and application scientists in environmental information systems with emphasis on remote sensing, satellite meteorology and other relevant technologies at the local level."
6,"a suggested curricu- lum, to be modified as may be appropriate for each centre, is shown in table i."
6,"the knowledge gained at each centre through this exposure, coupled with the experience acquired through the pilot projects that the educators and scientists would immediately undertake in their own countries as follow-up activities upon the completion of their programme at the centre, should adequately equip them to (i) introduce relevant aspects of space science and technology into existing education curricula in their respective countries, and (ii) contribute significantly to their nations' development programmes."
6,"each of the centres for space science and technology education should also (i) contribute to sustainable development of natural resources (air/water/land), and (il) provide a crucial supplementary input for biodiversity conservation and other related environmental programmes."

(ii) a capacity to utilize data from earth observation systems for weather prediction and monitoring of hurricanes and other natural phenomena so that they could undertake appropriate disaster management and mitigation programmes; (iii) a capacity that would strengthen institutions of higher learning and natioanl and regional institutions and will subsequently enable each country to support research and developmental efforts in its national institutions, especially those dealing with the understanding and application of environ- mental information systems; (iv) a capacity to develop an environmental and atmospheric sciences curricu- lum that can easily be taught and demonstrated at the high school and university levels in each country and to prepare effectively the educators to teach classes in these disciplines on their return to their institutions and (v) a capacity to participate in regional and international environmental programmes such as igbp and mpe and to contribute to the understanding and support of international actions on such issues as global warming and climate change, ozone layer depletion, global deforestation, land degrada- tion and management of the coastal marine environment."
8,"funding in 1991, most of the activities of the united nations on the establishment of the centres focused on seeking necessary financial, material and institutional support."
8,"these efforts included consultations with (i) member states who could be potential donors in support of the centres, (ii) potential host countries, (iii) undp head- quarters in new york (the regional bureaus and the bureau for programme policy and evaluation), and (iv) the regional economic commissions."
8,"countries visited in category (i) included australia, canada, finland, germany, the netherlands, norway, spain, sweden and the united states."
8,plans are in progress to undertake additional fund-raising missions to other countries and funding institutions that could support the centres.
8,next phase the next phase of the project is the organization of evaluation missions to the centres' potential host countries and institutions.
8,"the evaluation missions will assess the viability of the potential host institutions, i.e., existing/planned infrastructure; institutional, governmental financial and material support; existing educational programmes; existing/planned communication systems and any other support that could enhance the work of the centres."
8,"with the support of the governments of canada and spain, an evaluation mission to latin america and the caribbean was organized in late may 1992."
8,a host country will be identified after careful study of the evaluation report.
8,a similar mission was organized in africa in march/april 1993 with the support of the governments of france and germany.
8,two similar missions to evaluate potential centres in asia and the pacific and in the arab countries are planned for the second half of 1993.
8,each centre will be inaugurated once the host country selection process has been completed.

9,"conclusion globally, humanity is now preoccupied with developing and applying the knowledge needed to understand the ever-changing state of our planet earth."
9,thus one of the global needs today is an adequate opportunity for the men and women of each nation on this planet to experience the joy of successfully exercising their intellect and of unleashing their energies for the management of the environment and for the harnessing of the natural resources of their country in particular and of planet earth as a whole.
9,"such an opportunity should provide each nation with the ability to understand, process, analyse and judiciously utilize the copious informa- tion (data) being provided, daily and on a continuous basis, by an array of low- earth orbiting and geo-synchronous satellites."
9,the planned centres for space science and technology education will provide such an opportunity.
