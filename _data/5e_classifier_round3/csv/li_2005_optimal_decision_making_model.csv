1,"counter to drawbacks of previous application models, e.g. lack of compre- hensive and quantitative-comparison, the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is proposed."
1,"this model first acquires the possible accuracy-cost diagrams of multiple schemes through initial spatial exploration, then regresses them and standardizes them into a unified ref- erence frame, and finally produces the relatively optimal sampling scheme by using the discrete decision-making function (built by this paper) and comparing them in combination with the dia- grams."

1,"with this case and other cases, it is shown that the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is a good choice in the survey of the farm areas using remote sensing, with its distin- guished benefit of higher precision at less cost or vice versa."
