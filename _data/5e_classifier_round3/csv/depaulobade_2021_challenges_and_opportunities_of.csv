1,"chapter 9 challenges and opportunities of digital technology in soil quality and land management research vincent de paul obade, charles gaya, and paul thomas obade abstract soil being a unique life elixir determines ecosystem health and success of sustainable practices."
1,"however, despite available suite of indicators, sustainable practices are constrained by unreliable yet conflicting information attributed to model abstraction, scale mismatch and non replicability."
1,"besides, stale scientific evidence precludes its relevance to management or policy."
1,it remains a non-trivial task to determine a universal soil quality metric applicable in diverse ecosystems because of the difficulty in modeling soil multifunctionality and complexity across scale and time.
1,"the advent of digital technology which incorporate high perfor- mance computing systems with cellular communication devices, coupled with agile earth observation systems, creates new prospects for monitoring, demistifying and unravelling the specific drivers of soil quality dynamics."
1,"it is increasingly feasible to integrate multiple (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) datasets to inform site specific application of inputs thereby reducing costs, and simultaneously communicating scientific knowledge in real-time to stakeholders."
1,"however, fully operationalizing such initiatives remains elusive due to anticipated uncertainity in complex modeling systems."
1,"here, the value addition presented by digital technology in soil and land management research are explicated."
1,"the “whole to part” mapping template to guide sustainable land management is revisited, and scientific techniques discussed include multi-criteria analysis intended to: (i) screen-out sensitive variables to any complex-problem, (ii) hierarchically rank significant variables, (iii) investigate the interrelationships of the facets, and (iv) synthesize information at various scales to explore viable solutions."

2,"keywords diagnostics · land and soil quality · digital technology · resource management 9.1 introduction land not only remains a vital engine for economic development but is also integral towards addressing twenty-first century challenges such as food, water, energy, security, or lessening ramifications of abrupt climate change (de paul obade 2019; kamilaris et al."
2,2017; lal 2019).
2,"climate change generally attributed to anthropogenic actions, entails permanent shifts over say 30 years on weather variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation wind, or atmospheric pressure) from the average, a situation that triggers extreme events, such as drought, floods, storms, and strong winds."
2,"alternately, climate variability refers to the short-term fluctuations over time scales ranging from months to decades, falling between the extremes of daily weather and the long-term trends (lal 2004, 2009c; lal et al."
2,2012).
2,climate change exacerbates the frequency and magnitudes of adverse repercussions that trigger migration and conflict.
2,approximately 12% of global population are malnourished.
2,"it remains a daunt- ing task to strategically increase food production by the estimated 75% for the approximately 11 billion people expected on earth by 2050 (lal 2013, 2018, 2019)."
2,"apart from global resource depletion, dwindling arable land and changing lifestyles driven by the spiraling population and affluence, other synergistic effects related to resource overexploitation include land degradation and erosion, deteriorating infrastructure, pollution, biodiversity decline, outbreak of epidemics and pandemics (lal 2019)."
2,"however, it is not exactly known whether covid-19 disease could be directly transmitted or spread through contact with soil, or by water intake."
2,"besides, no study has been conducted to link the soil quality, diet, or even organic agriculture in developing countries (e.g., africa) with the prevalence and fatalities of covid-19, although data (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) shows that developing countries have been least affected by this pandemic (i.e., fewer fatalities)."
2,"soils which are critical to ecosystem health are occasionally under threat of being degraded by a complex array of stressors varying in intensity, space and time, with anticipated deadly consequences if unchecked (lal 2009b, c, 2013; lal et al."
2,2012).
2,"thus, scientific techniques are required that generate early warning information to support environmental regulation and prioritization of counter measures against the driving forces causing degradation."
2,"digital or data driven technologies holds sway not only in synthesizing complex variables, but also in lessening the nuance or subjectivity of existing monitoring efforts and disseminating timely information to support proactive management (boubin et al."
2,2019; herrick et al.
2,2017; kamilaris et al.
2,2017; u.n.

3,"against this backdrop, the question then are: (i) what are the knowledge gaps and challenges posed by digital technology?, and (ii) what are the new technological innovations required for sustainable intensification?"
3,"transformations in the field of spectroscopy, variable rate technologies (vrts), global navigation satellite systems (gnss) and data manipulation e.g., network analysis, structural equation models, clustering, principal component analyses, machine learning, opens new prospects for innovations on integrating multidis- ciplinary technologies to support climate smart agricultural systems."
3,"in-situ field data is not only multivariate but occasionally varies in acquisition time, quality and quantity, thus may exhibit significant uncertainties thereby providing unreliable information."
3,"although ignored or generalized in most models, soil organic carbon"
4,288 v. de paul obade et al.
4,"(soc), a proxy of soil quality should constitute baseline data."
4,"this is because soil quality determines soil functions such as supporting biodiversity, biomass produc- tion, climate regulation, elemental cycling, water purification and circulation."
4,"the magnitude and rate of soc depletion are exacerbated through soil erosion, leading to repercussions that include decline in soil structure, depletion of plant nutrients, change in soil temperature and moisture regimes which catalyze mineralization."
4,"alternately, soil degradation can be minimized through conversion to restorative land uses, e.g., by adding crop residues or enhancing the soc pool."
4,"restoring the soc pool increases soil aggregation, elemental cycling, soil biodiversity and reduces erosion (lal 2009a, 2013)."
4,"on the other hand, land evaluation evaluates land performance based on the correlation between agricultural production vis-à- vis soil quality, water availability, climate, topography, agro-ecological aptitude, socio-economic and environmental aspects (fig."
4,9.2) (arshad and martin 2002; bünemann et al.

4,"2015; rosa 2005), to identify the optimal land utility based on inherent land use options (bünemann et al."
4,2018).
4,"developing climate-resilient agriculture requires prudent soc management, and scientific data that can be transformed into practical/usable knowledge and roadmaps or action plans (lal 2014)."
4,"indiscriminate land management that hamper agro-ecosystem health are stimulated by: (1) technology without wisdom, (2) humanity without conscience, and (3) education without relevance (lal 2009b, c)."
4,"because of the strong interconnection between soil and land quality, this entry begins by outlining emerging management issues, followed by techniques for untangling individual drivers of land degradation, and exploration of connectivity with future scenarios, and identifies gaps or knowledge requirements to generate credible information from digital agricultural technology."
4,"further, knowledge gaps are identified to support innovations in digital agricultural technology."
4,9.2 emerging issues figure 9.2 depicts the interconnection between soil and land quality determination.
4,the site specificity of soil quality dynamics is perhaps the most significant challenge when designing robust models for predicting future climatic change effects.
4,"the soil is a complex medium that is approximately 50% solid, with 25% liquid and gaseous phases, respectively."
4,"the solid consists of mineral and organic matter, whereas liquid contains solutes (e.g., water) which facilitate nutrient circulation, and the gaseous or air compartment with o2 , ch4 , co2 , n2 o etc."
4,"the soil texture categorizes the mineral proportion of the soil (in %) as either sand, silt, clay or mixture."
4,the particle sizes chronologically from largest are of the order sand > silt > clay.
4,"thus, clay soils exhibit a larger surface area compared to silt or sand."
4,"texture determines soil functions, but does not significantly vary with management or climate (askari and holden 2014; bonfante and bouma 2015)."

5,"in essence, well formulated climate adaptive strategies contribute to poverty reduction and environmental quality (doran and parkin 1994; doran and zeiss 2000)."
5,developing climate resilient agriculture requires prudent management of blue and green water.
5,"blue water is precipitation and includes fresh surface or ground water, whereas green water is the soil water, which plants intake and transpire (de paul obade et al. 2013a, 2014; lal 2015a, c)."
5,in saturated conditions water flows in response to gravity through large soil pores.
5,"however in unsaturated soils, the water within the soil matrix moves in any direction depending on the energy potential and moisture gradient (i.e., wet to dry soil)."

6,"290 v. de paul obade et al. encompasses water contained in commodities (e.g., agricultural or industrial) that is traded across international boundaries (dia 2012; lal 2015c)."
6,soil moisture content is gravimetrically determined through oven drying a soil fraction at 105 ◦ c (topp and ferre 2002).
6,"alternately, water retention is determined by a combination of a tension table (blanco-canqui and lal 2007; clement 1996), and the pressure plate extractors (blanco-canqui and lal 2007; klute 1986; klute and dirksen 1986), with available water capacity (awc) computed as the proportional difference in volumetric water at field capacity (fc) (− 33 kpa), and at permanent wilting point (pwp) (− 1500 kpa) (dane and hopmans 2002; jemai et al."
6,2013).
6,another critical soil attribute is the soil bulk density (ρb ).
6,"mass of dry soil ρb = g/cm3 (9.1) t otal soil v olume the ρb is assayed using core method without roots and stones, and is inversely proportional to porosity."
6,this implies that soils with a high bulk density are less porous therefore contain less air spaces and water.
6,"soil structure is a critical soil attribute that can significantly be transformed by vehicular traffic density and load, crop rotation, organic matter and residue management."
6,"although the terms soil quality and soil health are generally assumed to be interchangeable, soil quality refers to the capability of the soil to produce biomass and support living things without jeopardizing environmental quality, whereas, soil health encompasses the living nature of soil considering its potential to sustain healthy plant growth while simultaneously maintaining soil functions (doran and parkin 1994)."
6,soil quality evaluation remains a subjective science because no universal soil quality metric exists.
6,"this quagmire is hypothetically attributed to the spatial temporal complexity of soil attributes, soil multi functionality, vague baselines, conflicting historical land use information, data artifacts and fuzzy soil quality definition."
6,"9.2.1 soil quality dilemma although defining quality soils is challenging because this depends on the purpose for which the soil is used, there is no doubt that degraded soils limit productivity not only because of nutrient deficiency but also through pollution, erosion and biodiver- sity decay."
6,soil quality dynamics controls the biotic and abiotic attributes including the food web.
6,"nutrient deficiency impedes microbial activity (bioturbation), and air circulation."
6,"excess soil water is also problematic, because this enhances flooding and landslides, causes soil elemental imbalance, pathogen epidemic and related feedback effects."
6,"besides other ramifications include nitrate denitrification through which greenhouse gases (e.g., co2 , n2 and ch4 ) are released into the atmosphere."
6,excessive phosphorus (p) and nitrogen (n) from agricultural runoff stimulates

7,hypoxia impacts on the tourism economy because the water is non swimmable and aquatic life are killed (toni et al.
7,2019; venegas-li et al.
7,2019).
7,sedimentation in water reservoirs reduces sun light and visibility thereby impacting on aquatic metabolism and photosynthesis.
7,"alternately, poor pesticides use enhances pollution risks and lowers crop yields."
7,"thus, soil quality indicators can improve the understanding of ecosystem processes and bridge the gap between information available for scientific and regulatory authorities (zahm et al."
7,2008).
7,"it is, therefore, imperative to screen out credible soil quality indicators before irreversible environmental consequences occur."
7,to do so requires the technological development and strategies that support sustainable agricultural intensification.
7,it is important to adhere to manual guidelines concerning precise rate and timing of pesticides or fertilizers applications.
7,"as a precaution, pesticides should not be applied if the weather forecast heavy precipitation or strong wind currents."
7,"alternately, judicious crop residue management requires at least 30% residue left in soil surface to support soil functions."
7,"crop residues or plant litter control surface energy balance, sequester carbon minimize soil erosion and replenish soil nutrients accounting for 40, 10 and 80% of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium of recycled natural fertilizer in u.s.a (blanco-canqui and lal 2009; blanco-canqui et al."
7,2006; doran et al.
7,1984).
7,excessive harvesting of surface crop residues driven by the insatiable demand for bio-energy products could have negative repercussions on micro-climate and soil quality (blanco-canqui et al.
7,2006; doran et al.
7,1984; fargione et al.
7,2008).
7,"thus, inexpensive yet automated techniques for monitoring surface residue cover are needed, to provide timely information on soil quality dynamics (de paul obade and gaya 2020; fargione et al."
7,2008).
7,"this is because the commonly used roadside surveys and “walk in the field” methods for assaying surface residue cover such as the line transect, are non-comprehensive, are tedious, expensive, time consuming, and error prone (de paul obade and gaya 2020)."
7,"other strategies for enhancing soil quality, include: (i) managing waste through reusing, recycling, avoiding maladaptation, and (ii) terracing, no-till or minimal till with manure incorporated into soil, cover cropping, crop rotation, and tile drains to drain excess water."
7,"9.2.2 current approaches for soil quality assessment soil quality is routinely gauged; (i) by expert judgement or human visual interpre- tation whereby darker heavier and sticky soils are assumed to be of high quality, (ii) by a soil test kit, or (iii) by score-based models such as the soil management assessment framework (smaf) (bone et al."

8,2008; wienhold et al.
8,2004).
8,"recently, on- farm derived indices to assay sustainable intensification have generated mixed interpretations (coyle et al."
8,2016; o’sullivan et al.
8,2015; schulte et al.
8,2014; wienhold et al.
8,2004).
8,"soil properties have been modeled from environmental predictors or covariates, abbreviated as scorpan factors, comprising (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position (grinand et al."
8,2008; lacoste et al.
8,2014; mcbratney et al.
8,2003).
8,"detailed descriptive statistics include measurements of sample size, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum and maximum values, median, the median absolute deviation, and so forth (batjes 2011, a; zornoza et al."
8,2007).
8,repeatable sampling design are needed to comprehensively determine the soil prop- erty characteristics over the entire study area (grinand et al.
8,2008; louis et al.
8,2014).
8,"examples of sampling designs include simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, systematic random sampling."
8,"simple random sampling is considered a reference method because of its simplicity, and the fact that data is randomly selected irrespective of location."
8,the major caveat in simple random sampling is that some parameters may be missed or data gaps may occur.
8,"alternately, stratified methods are deliberately divided into separate grids, groups or strata to precisely analyze variables of interest (louis et al."
8,2014).
8,"stratification, irrespective of whether applied as stratified random sampling or systematic sampling, usually involves the definition of strata, and the statistician needs to decide on stratum size, orientation and starting point for the grid overlay."
8,"typically, the starting point is randomly selected, and the effect of the starting position on the computed sample variance assumed to be miniscule."
8,"this is expected to suffice, unless there are strong directionalities or anisotropic effect, as may occur in valley topography (wang et al."
8,2012).
8,parametric and non-parametric methods are applicable in deciphering complex soil information.
8,"parametric methods can be applied in multivariate regression to sequentially screen out significant predictors, for instance using 3 different approaches: (i) forward selection which starts by selecting predictor variables that best fit the equation, and then adds predictors one at a time based on the weight and statistical significance, until there is no other significant predictor, (ii) backward elimination which begins with the full model but successively deletes non- significant predictor variables in each iteration, and (iii) the stepwise method which deletes one non-significant predictor variable at each iteration stage, the reverse of the forward method."
8,"parametric statistics require the following assumptions to hold true: (i) independence of observation, (ii) linearity, (iii) additivity of effects, (iv) homoscedasticity, and (v) normally distributed errors (chong and jun 2005; mehmood et al."
8,"2011, 2012)."
8,"because these assumptions are rarely satisfied, non- parametric techniques such as principal component analyses (pca), partial least"
9,"9 challenges and opportunities of digital technology in soil quality ... 293 squares (pls) regression, decision trees suffice, because these are parsimonious and do not require data transformations."
9,"pca which is an interpretive multivariate technique, simplifies data, eliminating multi-collinearity, and ranks the variables, according to weight."
9,"on the other hand, the pls referred to as “soft modeling” evaluates covariance, and minimizes errors by synchronizing information in both the predictors and response."
9,"one way to assess accuracy in pls is through cross validation (mehmood et al. 2011, 2012), which entails: (i) removal of one observation from the dataset, (ii) estimating this value using remaining observations, (iii) computing the error based on difference between the observed and predicted variable, and (iv) repeating this process for remaining observations (de paul obade and lal 2013, 2016a)."
9,"decision trees are data mining, machine learning, and rule-induction algorithms that classify data by inferring interconnection between a dependent variable and a set of predictors."
9,"they consist of nodes and leaves, with each node representing an if-then statement, and the leaves act as terminal nodes, where a decision is made according to the information presented by the class variable (breiman et al."
9,1984).
9,"a tree based model assesses all predictors so as to establish the optimal rules for splitting a node, where the within node homogeneity is maximized."
9,these splits are dependent on the specific tree-splitting algorithm utilized.
9,"the classification tree provides a categorical outcome, whereas the regression tree provides a continuous one (breiman 2001)."
9,"decision tree modeling are propitious because: (i) it analyzes non-parametric data; (ii) it is insensitive to missing data, inclusion of irrelevant predictors, or presence of outliers; (iii) it effectively analyzes numerical, ordinal, binary, and categorical classes; and (iv) it is well suited for synthesizing complex hierarchical relationships between predictors and response variables (heung et al."
9,2014).
9,decision tree models trees have been applied in soil property and predictive mapping (mcbratney et al.
9,"2003, 2014; mulder et al."
9,2011).
9,decision tree models are categorized as classification and regression trees.
9,"classification trees are rule- induction algorithms that group data to unravel their predictive structure and can handle quantitative or categorical predictor variables or both; for example soil type, topography or descriptive terrain attributes (heung et al."
9,2014).
9,a classification tree model for soil mapping utilizes a hierarchical subdivision of soil property predictor variables to represent soil types (oliver and webster 2014).
9,"classification tree analysis are pertinent for soil-landscape modelling applica- tions, because they are non-parametric, thus no apriori transformations are required (mcbratney et al."
9,2003).
9,"thus classification tree avoids variable transformation caused, for instance, by bi-modal or skewed histograms, which are frequent in soil class signatures; and are non-sensitive to missing data, perform automatic variable subset selection, are insensitive to the inclusion of a large number of irrelevant variables, and can handle quantitative and qualitative data, making it feasible to fuse data of various formats (davis 1987; grinand et al."
9,2008).

10,"(modified from (de paul obade and lal 2016a; krüger et al. 2018)) individual soil property (e.g., moisture or ρb ) to infer soil quality is insufficient (bünemann et al. 2018; de paul obade and lal 2016a, b; ohlson 2014)."
10,"besides, metrics are interpreted relatively due to uncertainties attributed to vague baselines (e.g., soils under native vegetation (nv) are usually assumed to be of high quality yet they may not necessarily be fertile) (bünemann et al."
10,2018; vollmer et al.
10,2016; vollmer et al.
10,2018).
10,"notwithstanding, existing metrics provide conflicting information attributed to oversimplification of complex phenomena especially upon upscaling or downscaling (e.g., reliance on surface point measurements for soil quality determination yet the whole profile is more comprehensive and holistic) due to cost and logistic constraints (andrews et al."
10,2002; askari and holden 2014; chaer et al. 2009; de la paz jimenez et al.
10,2002; paz-ferreiro and fu 2016; vasu et al.
10,2016).
10,"the soil quality index (sqi) is a quantifiable numerical index synthesizing multivariate qualitative (e.g., management) and quantitative (primary e.g., soc, ρb ) environmental data to facilitate identification and understanding of key variables driving soil processes and functions (de paul obade and lal 2016b)."
10,"sqis may be computed using either mathematical or statistical models (e.g., multivariate regression models)."
10,"a feasible strategy for assaying the efficacy of soil quality metrics is to: (i) define the problem or management goal (s) of the sqi (e.g., determine factors influencing crop yield), (ii) define the baseline (i.e., reference soil, which are"

11,"soil can be sampled in both the horizontal and vertical dimension at varied scales over time, to directly measure, for instance soc stocks."
11,"because measurement techniques have different assumptions, challenges arise when comparing models generated from these different techniques."
11,"in retrospect, soil quality models are not error free, because of soil spatial heterogeneity, land use history, vague benchmarks, making it difficult to replicate for monitoring purposes (malone et al."
11,2011).
11,"because it is impracticable to generate detailed point specific soil maps for the entire earth’s surface, generalization is employed."
11,"practically, sampling protocols entail acquiring data at different depths or layers, for instance, 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 20 cm, 20 to 40 cm and 40 to 60 cm, and measuring soil properties (e.g., soc, bulk density or ρb , and texture) to estimate soc stock per layer (kladivko et al."
11,2014; lal 2006).
11,"these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and can require complex data handling and preparation procedures, which can be error prone (jobbágy and jackson 2000; lorenz and lal 2005)."
11,besides soils being heterogeneous and the fact that plants uptake different nutrients simultaneously at variable environmental gradients suggest derived models may provide conflicting information (de paul obade and lal 2016a; ohlson 2014).
11,to enhance model fidelity requires calibration to assess the “fit” between measured quantities/variables estimated by a new method with the actual/true value of the same variables measured in the field.
11,although this issue is addressed in detail in other literature (breiman 1996; davis 1987; mcbratney et al.
11,2011; mota et al.
11,"2014; zornoza et al. 2007), the correlation coefficient (r) is among the common metrics for evaluating model fit in regression models under the null hypothesis that independent and dependent variables are not linearly related."
11,"as a precaution, “r” only measures the strength of a relation between two variables, not the agreement between them."
11,"for instance, a perfect agreement occurs only if all the points lie close to the line of equality between two variables, yet, a perfect correlation refers to points that lie along any straight line, as observed in multivariate analyses."
11,"to reiterate, sqi should quantify the soil quality for similar soils under identical land management, distinguish different soils under similar management, and catego- rize different soils under different management at diverse landscapes (de paul obade and lal 2016b)."
11,"in essence, assuming identical soil types are grouped in “classes”, this sqi should be capable of delineating different classes, yet simultaneously decreasing variability within the same class, to discern the impact of land use or management on soil quality (de paul obade and lal 2016a, b)."
11,"generally a weighting criteria screens out a minimum dataset consisting of key soil quality attributes (e.g., from fig."

13,data was processed according to the usda-nifa project guidelines (project web site: sustainablecorn.org) (kladivko et al.

13,the soil physical and chemical attributes were determined for all the sampled soil depths.
13,"these included ph, electrical conductivity (ec), soil organic carbon (soc), soil bulk density (ρb ), and available water capacity (awc), field capacity (fc), permanent wilting point (pwp), nitrate, nitrite and carbon/nitrogen (c/n) ratio."

14,"the pulverized, air dried and sieved (through a 250 µm sieve) loose soil samples were chemically analyzed to determine the ph, ec, c/n, and soc."
14,"this soc content was determined by the dry combustion method at 900 ◦ c using a vario max c:n analyzer (nelson and sommers 1982, 1996)."
14,"alternately, the ph and ec were measured using a a hand-held portable probe1 (lal 1996; peech 1965)."
14,"for ph measurement, a 1: 1 soil/water suspension were put in a tube and mixed after 3 h; whereas ec used the same suspension but was measured after 24 h."
14,the soil ph and ec are critical for soil quality assessment because they determine salinity and nutrient availability (arnold et al.

14,the soil ph being approximately 7 suggested non significance of inorganic carbonates (brown et al.

14,"the soc stocks (mg ha−1 ) were computed by multiplying the soc concentration by the specific gravity ρb /ρw , whereby ρw is the density of water."
14,the nitrate/nitrite concentrations were determined using the ion chromatograph (zhang et al.

14,"the yield data was determined from crops harvested on the exact spot in which the soils were extracted, with yield measurements done as follows: (i) for corn (zea mays l.), the ears from a field dimension of 2 rows and 2 m long were hand harvested and weighed; whereas the weight of the soybeans were measured from 1 m2 field dimension, (ii) the corn, and soybean (glycine max (l.)"

14,"the water content was determined by oven drying subsamples of kernel, cob and beans at 60 ◦ c for 96 h, and the grain yields computed after adjusting the respective weights to 15% moisture for corn, and 14% for soybean."
14,"the harvest index (hi) was computed as the ratio of the harvested grains, or beans to the total above ground vegetative biomass."
14,"partial least squares regression (plsr) in proc pls in sas 9.2 (sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa), was used to compute the sqi under the null hypothesis that site specific soil physical and chemical attributes (i.e., awc, fc, pwp, soil ρb , ec, ph, nitrate, nitrite and soc concentration, c/n ratio) are not significantly impacted by management or correlated (de paul obade and lal 2014, 2016a)."
14,from fig.

14,this hypothetically suggest that soil biota activity was relatively higher for surface nv managed soils.
14,"on the contrary, ct managed subsurface layers may have stimulated biota activity following residue incorporation into the soil."
14,"the r2 between sqi and corn yield was 74%, whereas soybean had 89%."

16,"these reflectance differences may be attributable to soil surface roughness, or carbon content (daughtry 2001)."
16,"a detailed view shows that the reflectance significantly varied with surface residue cover for blue, green, red, nir spectral bands as well as ndviw , bndviw and ndwiw indices, except for mir band and gndviw ."
16,"interestingly, the surface reflectance did not significantly vary along a moisture gradient except for gndviw and bndviw, which is contradictory for ndwiw which was designed specifically to detect moisture differences (gao 1996)."

19,"9.3.3 digital technology innovation progress in digital technology extends precision agriculture paradigm as a cost effective strategy for climate smart and site specific application of inputs (e.g., water, fertilizers, energy, labor, pesticides, time and seed genotypes)."
19,"precision agriculture is built on the premise that soil quality is spatially heterogeneous and non-random, implying that crop input requirements within the field are variable (kamilaris et al."
19,2017; kamilaris and prenafeta-boldú 2018).
19,the word digital technology emanates from the concept that precision agriculture is compartmentalized with internet communication technology and cellular devices to facilitate continuous information dissemination to the user or decision maker.
19,"for agricultural applications, the baseline data remains within field point data on soil quality i.e., physical, chemical, biologic and ecological attributes (de paul obade and lal 2016a; krüger et al."
19,2018).
19,"this data can acquired using remote sensing and subsequently integrated in a geographic information system (gis) with ancillary datasets such as climatic trends, yield, socio-economic income etc."
19,"precision agriculture entails mapping techniques that ensure accuracy, for instance the “the whole to part” strategy used by geodetic surveyors suffices as a paramount step (bannister et al."
19,1998).
19,"through this technique, a system of control or reference points within the whole area is established to a very high precision, following which minor details are located by less precise methods, to minimize error accumulation."
19,"because intensive soil sampling is not realistic due to cost and practicality constraints, interpolation strategies applicable include: (i) regression models or pedotransfer functions (ptfs) that relate known soil properties with significant indicators such as soc, (ii) geostatistics, or (iii) remote sensing."
19,"remote sensing acquires continuous data even for inaccessible locations from platforms such as boats, ground, aerial, or space (de paul obade et al. 2013a, b)."
19,"proximal remote systems are useful for small areal mapping, whereas high altitude sensors from aerial or space-based sensors are suitable for regional mapping."

20,"however, direct point measures especially over large areal extents are prohibitively expensive and time consuming."
20,"ordinarily, mapping tools include electrical conductivity sensors, global navi- gational satellite systems (gnss), lidar or radar to map terrain attributes (i.e., digital terrain modeling (dtm), or “on the go” variable rate technology (vrt)), and remote sensing optical and thermal sensors that convert spectral band information (spectra, e.g., from fig."

21,"traditional soil mapping generated at small geographic scales (e.g., < 1: 100,000), are non-comprehensible for detailed soil inventory."
21,"however, the advancement in active and passive remotely sensors have opened up a broad spectrum for characterizing earth resources at flexible scales (de paul obade and lal 2013; oliver and webster 2014; roy et al."
21,2008; roy et al.
21,2014).
21,"although remote sensing is non-destructive and acquires continuous data even over inaccessible terrain such as wetlands, its caveats include: (a) mixed signals arising from signal attenuation, adjacency effects, and atmospheric scattering, (b) rigorous data processing and calibrations, (c) mismatches in spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, (d) absence of long-term data (de paul obade et al. 2013a, b, 2014)."
21,"besides, depending on the resolution or sensor required, remotely sensed data can be costly (vitharana et al."
21,2008).
21,"soil quality data can be categorized into management zones for scientific applications using grid cell soil sampling based on landforms, yield monitor data, classified maps, digital elevation models (dem), electrical conductivity (ec) measurements, and so forth."
21,"soil properties (e.g., soc, moisture) have been predicted using remote sensors operating under the visible and near infra-red (nir) spectrum (gogé et al."
21,"2014; kinoshita et al. 2012a, b; marín-gonzález et al."
21,2013).
21,ec is measurable by electrical induction or resistivity methods using mobile systems embedded in a gps (vitharana et al.
21,2008).
21,"the non-destructive soil analysis by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (drs) is an alternative to the traditional time-consuming and costly analysis of soil properties, especially in studies where sample numbers are large (gogé et al."
21,2014).
21,drs can be used for

22,2014; sarkhot et al.
22,2011).
22,"the vnir spectra of the soils commonly exhibit features associated with oh− and h2 o, iron oxides, phyllosilicates, and organic molecules; whereas the mir spectra is associated with oh− , organic molecules, and a variety of silicate minerals, such as phyllosilicates and quartz (mcdowell et al."
22,2012).
22,"alternately, laboratory based chromate oxidation (walkley and black 1934) wet combustion method, is inaccurate because of the incomplete oxidation of soil organic matter; whereas others such as the dry combustion (nelson and sommers 1982) are expensive and slow (batjes 2011; mcdowell et al."
22,2012).
22,"in remote sensing applications, important sensor considerations include the spatial (pixel size, or size of smallest feature distinguishable by sensor), spectral (band ranges, or region of electromagnetic spectrum sensed), temporal (frequency of imagery acquisitions), radiometric (color depth, or number of digital levels representing data) resolution, and swath (area of coverage) (ouma 2016)."
22,"besides, remotely sensed data requires selection of high quality training and validation data accurately representing terrain signals."
22,"because remotely sensed data must be integrated with insitu measurements to glean information, a teething challenge remains the loss of details attributed to mismatch (i.e., spatial, temporal, radiometric, spectral resolution) of different datasets, mixed pixels, and abstraction during the signal processing stages (e.g., atmospheric correction and cloud removal) (proud et al."
22,2010; roy et al.
22,2008).
22,"pixel unmixing (i.e., separating different scanned features/objects within a pixel) remains a challenge even with hyperspectral (narrow continuous but contiguous spectral bands) data."
22,"although proximal sensors have limited spatial coverage, they exhibit less atmospheric noise due to reduced atmo- spheric path length and proximity to target."
22,monitoring through time series analyses of imagery is also prone to data gaps attributed to cloud obscured or shadowed pixels.
22,"atmospheric noise can be minimized through normalization algorithms, which screen-out and merge the pseudo-invariant (i.e. temporally unchanged) features on both the ground and imagery."
22,the goal of digital technology applied in sustainable agricultural intensification is to enhance prediction of soil quality and yield dynamics cost-effectively.
22,"how- ever, it remains challenging to operationalize this technology, let alone interpolate or predict trends without a spatially explicit and temporally dynamic quantification of within field soil quality, information useful for delineating management zones."
22,"for practical purposes i.e., operation of precision/tractor equipment, the management zones are limited to at-most 10 clusters depending on the field size, that is, for smaller fields less clusters and vice versa."
22,"if the field does not exhibit any significant variability in terms of soil quality, then homogenized or uniform application of input suffices."
22,"digital agriculture though requiring costly equipment, is justifiable for fields with significant clusters of soil quality variability."
22,"knowledge on specific crop requirements is critical for formulating economic and environmental action plans, energy conservation, time saving and advising on cost effective purchase of fertilizer, water and correct seed variety."
23,9 challenges and opportunities of digital technology in soil quality ...
23,"307 technological concerns include engineering issues e.g., system malfunctions, data handling and collection logistics (i.e., data storage, management and owner- ship) (table 9.3)."
23,data fusion may minimize ambiguities in soil quality mapping.
23,"for instance, time series analyses may lessen the occurrence of missing, shadowed and atmospherically contaminated pixels in the satellite imagery, and enable soil properties to be mosaicked in the final map product."
23,"for example, the systematic landsat data processing, includes conversion of digital numbers to calibrated top of atmosphere reflectance and brightness temperature, cloud masking, and re- projection (yan and roy 2014, 2014)."
23,"although automated approaches exist for extracting objects from satellite data, no automated field extraction methodology applies effectively for soil quality determination (de paul obade and gaya 2020)."
23,algorithms such as spectral mixture analyses may be used to decompose pixels into soil cover fractions (de paul obade and gaya 2020).
23,"object based classification techniques agglomerate many pixels systematically (e.g., by image segmentation)."
23,a validation protocol is prototyped to gain insights into the field extraction accuracy.
23,"on a separate note, the expenditure incurred in securing digital systems should not exceed the anticipated returns from this investment."
23,"as digital technology continues to take root, scientifically credible information is required not only to tackle challenges such as spatial-temporal interpolation, forecasting, and data security, but also to minimize negative feedbacks from improved efficiency, such as unemployment (u.n."
23,2019; weersink et al. 2018a).

23,it is anticipated that digital technology will generate objective metrics thereby reducing the need and frequency of using subjective expert opinion.
23,"however, the full potential of digital technologies applied in agriculture is yet to be fully explored, not only because of equipment and data costs or logistics, but also the scientific knowledge on constructing credible yet robust models depicting complex earth processes is still evolving."
