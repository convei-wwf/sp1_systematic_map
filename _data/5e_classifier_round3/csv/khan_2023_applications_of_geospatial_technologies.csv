1,borlaug paved the way to “green revolution” by introducing high-yielding and short-statured disease- and lodging-resistant wheat.
1,"since, then researchers have strived to improve the production of food, fiber, and fodder crops in the fields."
1,"however, increased food production has certain nega- tive impacts on the environment owing to heavy use of chemicals [1]."
1,"these chem- icals are used as fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides to suppress yield limiting soil constraints, weeds, and insects, respectively."
1,"further, additional land was cleared of other uses such as forests and wetlands to create more farms for food pro- duction."
1,the situation was further exacerbated when we started to use more water for production including surface water as well as groundwater.
1,this has deteriorated the groundwater quantity and quality.
1,the world population is expected to exceed 9.7 billion by 2050 from today’s 8 billion [2].
1,it will continue to exert pressure on scarce natural resources including both the land and water.
1,"as a result, fresh water and arable land are also getting depleted and degraded, respectively."
1,"therefore, agricul- ture remains the most important concern for sustainable livelihood [3]."
1,precision agriculture (pa) offers a sustainable management solution to meet increasingly high demand of food and raw materials associated with it while keeping environ- ment safe.
1,"in 1997, the us house of representatives defined the term pa as farming man- agement philosophy based on integrated information system with the objective to enhance the whole farm’s profitability with optimum inputs and minimum harmful impacts on ecosystems and environment."
1,"among many definitions, pa was simply defined as “the application of right input at right location and at right time” [4]."
1,"pa minimizes the climate change effects through spot applications of chemicals, water conservation while improving the microclimate."
1,"therefore, it helps in achieving sustainable agriculture for improving food security and hence becomes precision agriculture. https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-443-18953-1.00004-0 71 copyright © 2023 elsevier inc."

2,72 chapter 5 applications of geospatial technologies a linchpin of climate smart agriculture [5].
2,"among other benefits, pa has also proved to be an economical and profitable approach in 68% of the cases studied [6]."
2,"moreover, it is argued that the goal of sustainable agriculture can be achieved through the adoption of pa by increasing the ability to interpret farms’ big data and generate knowledge to improve the crop produce [7]."
2,"5.2 management philosophy of pa the management philosophy of pa is based on identifying and managing, within field and seasonal, variabilities of crop limiting factors including soil, weather, wa- ter, crop genetic potential, and management operations."
2,"moreover, the variations of the factors must be structured, of sufficient magnitude, and manageable."
2,it is advised to diagnose and remove the causes of variations and apply uniform input applica- tions.
2,"however, variable rate treatments are recommended if the causes of variation cannot be eliminated."
2,this philosophy can be applied as sequence of operations covering the complete paddock to plate chain.
2,the main aim of pa is to apply inputs as per variations in crop and soil require- ments which was not possible until the development of variable rate technologies in 1980s.
2,pa is referred as a management philosophy and its concepts and objectives were only achievable with the advent of its enabling technologies.
2,"5.3 enabling technologies of pa as agriculture has become information extensive, farmers must overcome the challenges of poor access to knowledge, financial services, markets, and ancil- lary information flows."
2,"farmers need information such as which crop is most suitable for his land and how to grow that crop, amount of water required, which part of his land is performing better, and where to sell his produce and where to buy the required products [8]."
2,"for example, precise information on soil moisture and weather can help farmers in deciding when to sow and irrigate their crops."
2,farm and field level data can be collected with ease using location-based and remote sensors.
2,these can then be integrated through the internet of things (iot) to make agriculture a digital entity.
2,"similarly, remotely sensed imagery can be used for yield prediction and stress monitoring."
2,early crop stress detection and monitoring are essential for achieving higher yields and hence increasing productivity.
2,"the use of smart systems can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of precision agriculture by recognizing stressed area patterns from real-time (satellite and drone) imagery and by real-time data-driven farm operations management (tillage, irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers applica- tions) [9]."
2,the technologies which allow the implementation of pa management philosophy are discussed below.
3,5.3 enabling technologies of pa 73 5.3.1 geographic information systems development and availability of positioning technologies like global positioning system (gps) and global navigation satellite system (gnss) for civilian uses particularly agriculture have paved the way for large-scale adoption of site-specific management.
3,"these technologies led to development of systems such as auto steer- ing, controlled traffic farming, yield monitors, and variable rate technologies (vrt)."
3,"vrts are comprised of differential global positioning system (dgps), processing unit, variable rate software, and controllers."
3,"these are designed for optimized seed- ing, planting density, and application of fertilizers, weedicide/herbicides, and insect/ pesticides to reduce inputs and environment risks."
3,it was reported by neupane (2019) that variable rate irrigation reduces water use by between 10% and 15% [10].
3,"similarly, with the fabrication of sensors for mapping in situ and on-the-go soil and plant characteristics has led to the development of useful products like yield maps, fertilizer prescription maps."
3,these help in developing optimal management zones at field level.
3,these products provide deep insights for better field manage- ment activities as compared to traditional ways of farming.
3,"for example, sensors for mapping and monitoring of apparent electrical conductivity, soil moisture, and microclimate of plants were readily available."
3,5.3.2 remote sensing (rs) crops undergo biophysical and biochemical changes while reacting to biotic and abiotic stresses.
3,"it is important to know when such changes occur, and it neces- sitates the use of remote sensing in agriculture."
3,"various rs systems ranging from gamma rays to microwave have been used to detect infection symptoms, physi- ological responses, and structural changes in plants [11e13]."
3,"these rs systems for plant diseases were categorized by zhang et al. [14] into four categories, that is, visible and near-infrared (vis-nir) spectral systems, fluorescence and ther- mal systems, synthetic aperture radar (sar), and light detection and ranging (lidar)."
3,airborne and space-borne sensors provide georeferenced information on crop health while recording plant spectral profiles with varying characteristics depending upon the wavelengths at which data is recorded.
3,"among these, sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) can provide high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution imageries for mapping and monitoring of agricultural systems and pro- cesses [15]."
3,it was reported that remote sensors were the most used technology in precision agriculture [16].
3,remote sensors can be classified based on the platform or the source of energy.
3,"platforms can be space, aerial, or ground-based."
3,both active and passive remote sensors are being used in precision agriculture for mapping and monitoring plant biotic and abiotic stresses.
3,"data resolution required for pa is defined by the management objectives, size of the field, and equipment to be used for variable rate application [17]."
4,"74 chapter 5 applications of geospatial technologies imagery from high spatial resolution satellites such as ikonos with 1e4 m was found adequate for mapping of soils, prediction of crop yields, nutrient manage- ment, and evapotranspiration (et) estimation [18e21]."
4,data from pleiades-1a and worldview-3 having spatial resolution less than 2 meters (2 m) can be used for detection of disease and water stress [22e24].
4,availability and flexibility of uavs in acquiring very high spatial resolution (centimeter level) imagery has certainly paved the way for precision agriculture’s development.
4,5.1 presents optimal ranges of the spatial and temporal resolution along with spectral resolution (can be accessed through the platform) needed for precision agriculture and allied disciplines.
4,sophisticated procedures have been and are being developed for transforming georeferenced data recorded by sensors into information that can be used in the decision-making process.
4,"accuracies of these procedures depend upon image reso- lution, atmospheric and crop conditions along with analytical techniques being employed, that is, deep learning, regression-based or simulations [17]."
4,"utilization of remote sensing datasets in pa is limited by huge volume of data as high spectral, spatial, radiometric, and temporal resolution data are required for site-specific management [26]."

5,"5.3 enabling technologies of pa 75 remotely sensed big data (huge volume, variety, and velocity of data) are being developed to use crucial information in decision support systems for pa."
5,"pa technologies based on remotely sensed imagery, for example, variable rate fertilizer application in green seeker and crop circles have been already adopted for commercial agriculture [17]."
5,plant water stress can be monitored by utilizing thermal sensors for estimation of temperatures [27].
5,"similarly, microwave sensors are very useful in estimating soil moisture content and water consumption by crops over large areas [28]."
5,although data from microwave sensors is of course resolution but it can be downscaled for pa use.
5,"5.3.3 big data analytics over the last decade, artificial intelligence has been applied in agriculture owing to its capacity to identify complex patterns in the big datasets."
5,the potential of machine learning techniques to monitor crop stresses using digital imagery have been explored to a great extent during past 10 years.
5,"despite the exponential development of remote sensing technologies, the com- mercial use of remotely sensed imageries in pa is limited by lack of readily available imaging solutions, high budgetary requirements, cloud cover limitations, and auto- mated systems for processing and analysis of imageries [29]."
5,"for wider adoption of remote sensing data in pa, more friendly and accurate systems are required [17]."
5,"moreover, more case studies have been carried out to link crop limiting factors with appropriate management actions like sowing, irrigation, fertigation, harvesting, and marketing."
5,"common imaging techniques used for detecting plant stress include digital fluorescence, lidar, thermography, multispectral and hyperspectral tech- niques [30]."
5,"data analytic capabilities provide knowledge and through information and communication technologies (icts) this knowledge is transferred to the farmers, thus, enabling them to practice sustainable agriculture by decreasing inefficiencies, costs, and enhancing farm profitability [31]."
5,web services are introduced to transfer the knowledge through development of decision support systems.
5,digital technolo- gies possess huge potential in meeting the demand for food and play their role throughout the value chain [32].
5,"during the past decade, the potential of advanced techniques like machine learning, internet of things (iots), and blockchain had been explored to a great extent."
5,"these techniques have had significant impact in the agriculture sector with applications like identification of weeds through artificial intelligence, assessment of fruit ripening, and identification of nutrient deficiencies."
5,iots have already contributed significantly in modernized agriculture [33].
5,every day new aspects and the application of ai techniques in agriculture are be- ing reported.
5,the potential of machine learning techniques to monitor crop stresses using digital imagery have been explored to a large extent in the past 10 years [34].
5,"generally, deep learning has proved to be promising in plant stress detection through image classification, segmentation, and object detection, which can be instrumental"

6,"similarly, transfer deep learning can be used for development of disease heat maps, which can be used for early detection and incubation period evaluation [36]."
6,5.4 state-of-the-art conceptual system examples of pa solutions currently being adopted in developed countries and likely to be adopted in developing countries are given below.
6,5.4.1 soil management system soil management systems are capable of characterizing soil variabilities in terms of their physical and chemical properties including slope and cultivation history.
6,"this system provides the basis of variable rate irrigation, fertigation and seeding."
6,soil quality is maintained through efficient monitoring of soils.
6,farming communities need to be capable of monitoring the status of their soil as vital indicator of the health of their land.
6,5.2 shows a mobile application which is a component of web-based decision support system that enables farmers to access soil properties along with agro-meteorological data.
6,the system was developed under australian figure 5.2 mobile-based decision support system for optimal management of water resources at the farm level.

7,"the system also assists farmers in computing crop water requirements, provides information on the soil sta- tus of their land, and crop profitability."
7,"thus, it enables them to select the best crop to grow among various options."
7,"5.4.2 auto steering system such systems allow machines to follow certain tracts and hence enhancing accu- racies and reducing operator-induced errors, inputs, and fatigue."
7,"autosteering systems are being used for planting, harvesting, and agronomic operations."
7,these systems are installed on tractors and/or farming machinery and are paired with precise gps to provide pass to pass accuracy in operations.
7,5.4.3 precise seeding system precise seeding systems are applied to sow maximal germination percentage and minimize inputs while ensuring optimum plant densities.

10,80 chapter 5 applications of geospatial technologies 5.5 perceptions of digital technologies widespread adoption of pa is subjected to the development of creative policies by the stake holders and development of incentives based and cost-sharing mech- anisms.
10,an effort was made to assess the current and future state of precision agriculture in australia.
10,a survey was undertaken to investigate the perceptions of various australian agricultural industry stakeholders and their perceptions of digital technologies in agriculture and how this will affect the stakeholder groups and sustainability (fig.
10,"participants were also asked what technologies they would use or avoid, and if and how each could be used to increase sustainability."
10,the results of the survey showed interest of stakeholders in adopting the technol- ogies which form the core of pa.
10,"the technologies include (in the order of prefer- ence) drones, gps, satellite remote sensing, and automation."
10,the respondents also believed that the biggest barriers to adoptions are financial cost and knowledge of the products as shown by fig.
10,"this demands actions from the government (relevant) agencies, research organi- zations and academia to promote such technologies and create government- academia-industry linkages to promote the use of such technologies in a sustainable manner."
10,figure 5.6 stakeholders’ preferred technologies to be adopted.
11,5.6 conclusions 81 figure 5.7 stakeholders’ perception of barriers to adoption of technologies in pa.
11,5.6 conclusions precision agriculture (pa) offers a sustainable management solution to meet the increasingly high demand for food and fiber while keeping the environment safe.
11,crop management (from sowing to harvesting) is an important component of the agricultural value chain and needs apt decisions by the farmers.
11,"this whole process is dynamic in nature and geospatial technologies assist in identifying the dynamics such as variabilities in soil, weather, water, and crop performance."
11,such technolo- gies in combination with iot guide farmers not only to identify these yield-limiting factors but also to provide support in making optimal decisions.
11,this chapter describes a state-of-the-art conceptual system of pa while presenting practical examples of using geospatial technologies for pa.
11,the development in the field of remote sensing and gis has enabled us to acquire field-scale data and convert that information into knowledge.
11,now the farmers and extension workers can be enabled to acquire that knowledge without the need of running complex al- gorithms and acquire data as that is done through big data analytics in a cloud envi- ronment.
11,"when it comes to using digital technologies, agricultural stakeholders prefer using drones, gps, and satellite-based remote sensing data."
11,"however, for large-scale adoption of pa-enabling technologies, we need to reduce the cost of such technologies (through government support or cooperative farming) and improve the infrastructure, especially network connectivity."
11,we conclude that using geospatial technologies in combination with iot and cloud computing not only en- hances a paddock’s productivity but also contributes to environmental sustainability.
