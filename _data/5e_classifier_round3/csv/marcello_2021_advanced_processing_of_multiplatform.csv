5,"according to literature and different experiments, the gaussian radial basis function kernel has been used and grid search was used to find the optimal parameters [5], [26], [27]."
5,"in this work, 3 different types of training regions of interest (rois) were set up depending on the amount of pixels used to train the classifiers (roi_f: rois with few pixels, roi_a: rois with medium amount of pixels and roi_m: rois with many pixels)."

5,"afterwards, non-water areas are masked using a normalized water index that considers the blue and near-ir channels."
5,"in addition, when the sea surface was not calm, a sun-glint correction was applied [20], [21]."
5,"finally, using bathymetric information, water areas over 30 m deep were removed from the analysis because the water column attenuates the optical channels and radiation cannot reach the seafloor from a certain depth."

7,"marcello et al.: advanced processing of multiplatform remote sensing imagery to improve classifications accuracy, further experiments including additional features have been carried out."
7,given the previous results (table 3 and fig. 7) only the roi_m dataset has been considered.
7,"in particular, texture and bathymetric information were included in the analysis."
7,"table 5 presents the overall accuracies (mean and standard deviation) for the different sensors and feature combinations, training ml and svm algorithms with the roi_m dataset."

7,"fig. 8 shows the benthic maps obtained for each dataset, ml (left) and svm (right), using the best combination from table 5."
7,a majority filter with a 3 × 3 kernel has been applied to remove isolated noisy pixels.
7,"in general, we can note that similar maps are derived for each type of imagery irrespective of their spectral and spatial resolutions, except the upper-left part of the rpas scene due to sensing problems during the acquisition."
7,maps properly match the reference maps included in fig.4.
7,"mountain ecosystem the teide national park has been chosen as a high mountain area for its complexity and variability, as it is strongly stressed by climate change, herbivory pressure and tourism."
7,classifying the species is very challenging with remote sensing techniques as this shrubland ecosystem is mainly made up of small and mixed plant species (fig 1(c)).
7,"for this reason, sentinel-2 was not used as it cannot provide the appropriate spatial resolution."
7,the methodology presented in fig. 5 has been applied to the ms and hs imagery provided by the 3 different platforms figure 6.

7,table 6 shows the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the vegetation maps generated by the svm classifier.
7,"to properly compare results, the area covered by the rpas in the northern part of the park has been selected for the study and the same training and test datasets have been used."
7,"for worldview-2 imagery, apart from the original multispectral bands, the assessment has included the pansharpened data at 0.5 m applying the gram-schmidt (gs) algorithm."
7,"for the hyperspectral imagery, in addition to the original bands, the first 10 components of the mnf transformation have also been selected to retrieve the vegetation maps."
7,it can be appreciated that the 2 m (original wv-2 ms resolution) is not enough to accurately analyze this complex scene made up of small and mixed plant species.
