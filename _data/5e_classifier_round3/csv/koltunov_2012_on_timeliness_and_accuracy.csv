6,"the ﬁre start and end times are deﬁned as the left and the right ends of the estimated ﬁre activity intervals, respectively."
6,"adding the above margins to the recorded ﬁre activity periods was meant to compensate for possible delays in initial report and for possible resid- ual burning after containment, similar to previous studies (feltz et al., 2003; soja et al., 2009)."
6,"given the high population density in the study region, we believe that further increasing the ﬁre start margin is not justiﬁed."
6,keeping these margins on a conservative side also reduces the chance of a false match of a detection to an incident record.
6,below in section 3.3 we discuss that conservative (smaller) margins are preferable for incident-wise analyses.

6,both ﬁre area and duration are binned into 7 groups each (see section 3.1.1).
6,the bar locations (or widths) spatially and temporally varying error of geographic coordinates for on the area and duration axes represent group membership and not a within-group wf-abba detections.
6,a simple approach to compensate for these uncer- mean (or range). tainties is to use a single large spatial buffer.

6,these data are consistent with the premise that error in section 1.2.1).
6,"another problem with selecting an overly large wildﬁres in california tend to start in the afternoon (the hottest part buffer is that a goes ﬁre pixel may coincide in time and be spatially of the day) when more people are active and available to observe close enough to more than one ﬁre incident, making unclear which them, and so they are reported soon after ignition. incidents are actually “responsible” for the ﬁre pixel."
6,"therefore, a new ignition within the buffer distance of an older active ﬁre is more likely to be “detected” earlier than it actually started."
6,"spatio-temporal matching of geospatial wildﬁre records against we address these issues by 1) analyzing groups of co-occurring wf-abba detections incidents, 2) using a two-buffer pixel-to-ﬁre matching rule, and 3) tracking dynamic detected events, as discussed just below and 3.2.1."

6,"matching a ﬁre pixel in space and time is based on the two or more ﬁre incidents are considered co-occurring at the spatio-temporal proximity of the pixel to ﬁnal size polygons {pk}, spatial scale of the goes pixel if their activity periods overlap and k = 1,…, 402, of active ﬁres."
6,"for a k-th ﬁre, its estimated activity their ﬁnal perimeter polygons pk are less than 6 km (approximately one goes-w tir pixel over california) apart."
6,the co-occurrence anal- ysis is facilitated by extracting the following categories from the 354 active ﬁre incidents that started during the test period: a.
6,"fires co-occurring with one or more active wildﬁre incidents that started earlier, according to the estimated activity periods (section 3.2.1). b."
6,fires not in category a) that co-occur with a larger ﬁre started at the same (up to 10 min) time.
6,fires falling in categories a) or b) are excluded from the test sample for assessing detection timeliness.
6,"this leads to a conservative assessment of detection timeliness, because if a ﬁre pixel matches to a group of co-occurring ﬁres, then only one (the older or larger) ﬁre is assumed detected."
6,"however, all 402 ﬁres are included in the pixel-wise true/false positive analysis."

7,for connected components that do include re-detected pixels validation analysis should primarily focus on validating only new (fig. 5b–h) the analysis is slightly more complex: events.
7,"indeed, a repeat detection of an existing event is expected to a) first, each re-detected pixel-member (x, tdet) is assigned to be acted upon by the user rather differently from detection of a new its corresponding existing event e(yx) determined by step 3 event."
7,"for example, a new event may be assigned a higher priority (i.e. all light-grey pixels in fig. 5b–h are assigned a label). for veriﬁcation and response."
7,"if an event is veriﬁed and ﬂagged false positive, its re-detection (i.e. repeat detection) in subsequent images may not be as costly as its ﬁrst appearance."
7,"if it is ﬂagged true positive, its re-detection in subsequent frames may be of little infor- mational value, as far as timeliness is concerned."
7,"in any case, a re-detection of an existing event could often be safely ignored by users interested primarily in maximizing timeliness of detection."
7,"also, when an actual ﬁre incident results in multiple ﬁre pixels forming the same new event, the value of the detection information may not be directly proportional to the number of ﬁre pixels matching this incident."
7,"likewise, the user cost due to false information, i.e. a false positive new event, is not simply a multiple of the number of pixel-members of the event."
7,"since tactical operational decisions are generally made on a per-event basis and in near real time, it is helpful to imagine a simpli- ﬁed scenario in which an analyst is to make decisions about alerting ﬁrst responders, solely based on wf-abba outputs."
7,"the analyst issues an alarm only if (s)he decides it is a new event, i.e. it will not be a repeat alert about the same possible wildﬁre."
